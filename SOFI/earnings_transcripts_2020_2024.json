All lines will be muted during the presentation portion of the call, with an opportunity for questions and answers at the end.  At this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Andrea Prochniak, VP of Investor Relations. Andrea, please proceed.\nAndrea Prochniak: Thank you, operator, and thank you all for joining us today for SoFi's fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. Joining me today are Anthony Noto, SoFi's CEO; and Chris Lapointe, SoFi's CFO. They will share prepared remarks regarding the quarter's results and then take your questions at the end. Just after market closed today, we issued a press release announcing SoFi's fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results. Our discussion of our results today is complementary to the press release, which is available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investors.sofi.com. This conference call is being webcast live and will be available as a replay for 30 days, beginning about one hour after the conclusion of this call. There's also an accompanying investor presentation on our IR page. During the course of this conference call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, forecasts and projections as of today's date. Any forward-looking statements that we make are subject to various risks and uncertainties, and there are important factors that could cause actual outcomes to differ materially from those included in the statements. We discuss these factors in our SEC filings, including our 2021 Form 10-K, which can soon be found on the IR page of our website and the SEC filings' website, sec.gov/edgar. As a reminder, we are not required to update our forward-looking statements. In our presentation today, unless otherwise noted, we will be discussing adjusted financial measures, which are non-GAAP measures that we believe are meaningful when evaluating the company's performance. For detailed disclosures on these measures and the GAAP reconciliations, you should refer to the financial data contained within our press release, which is also posted to the IR page of our website. Today's discussion will focus on both the fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. As always, we encourage you to evaluate SoFi's performance on an annual basis, as quarterly results can be affected by unexpected events that are outside our control. Now, I'll turn the call over to Anthony.\nAnthony Noto: Thank you, Andrea, and good afternoon, everyone. Before beginning my prepared remarks, I want to take a moment to recognize the unacceptable tragedy that is currently taking place in Ukraine. It's been truly difficult to watch the series of events unfold over these past few weeks and escalate in recent days. No one should have to live in fear or under the threat of violence, which has now become a reality. Our hearts go out to everyone directly or indirectly affected by this tragic situation. Now, on to our results. We had another strong quarter, hitting new highs across our key financial and operating metrics and finishing 2021 with record annual results. Today, we are in our best position ever to achieve our long-term strategic goal: to be the digital one-stop shop for the major financial decisions in our members' lives and all of the moments in between. Here are some of the highlights. Record fourth quarter adjusted net revenue of $280 million was up 54% year-over-year and increased sequentially from a very strong third quarter, despite the unexpected federal student loan moratorium extension at quarter end. All three of our business segments achieved higher year-over-year growth. We delivered record full year revenue of just over $1 billion, at the high end of our guidance, which we increased on our third quarter earnings call. We achieved our sixth consecutive quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA at $5 million and delivered on our goal of positive full year EBITDA. We had an amazing quarter for member growth. We added 523,000 new members in the fourth quarter, a record in absolute number terms and impressively up 39% versus the amount added in the third quarter. As a result, we ended 2021 with 3.5 million members, an increase of 1.6 million, up 87% year-over-year and well above the 3 million member target set in January of '21. We also set another record with new product adds of 906,000 in the fourth quarter, up an incredible 51% versus the number of third quarter adds. We finished 2021 at 5.2 million total products, more than double the 2.5 million we had at year-end 2020. And at Galileo, we grew enabled accounts 67% year-over-year to 100 million. We were able to achieve these milestones in 2021 and get to such a position of strength today for three main reasons. First, we continue to drive strong growth through great execution across our three diverse businesses, which reflects our ability to capitalize on changing macro conditions. Second, the success of SoFi's unique Financial Services Productivity Loop strategy accelerated as we scaled our business in 2021, which allowed us to exceed our original 2021 member growth target by 40% and, importantly, still hit our EBITDA target. And third, we took a giant step forward in 2021 in achieving our goal of becoming a household brand name via our SoFi Stadium affiliation, the success of our integrated multimedia campaigns and the virality of the influencers we partnered with. I'll take these points one by one, starting with, number one, how we drove strong growth through great execution across our three diverse businesses. In lending, we grew segment revenues by 30% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 42% for the full year even with the unexpected extension of the federal student loan payment moratorium in late December. Fourth quarter personal loan originations were a record of $1.7 billion, up 168% year-over-year, and more than double fourth quarter 2019's pre-pandemic total. Full year originations were more than $5.3 billion versus $2.6 billion in 2020 and $3.7 billion in 2019. Personal Loans outperformed as a result of our improved execution, enhancements to our technology and credit models and the quality of our loans. And through our lending as a service partnership with Pagaya, we added nearly 7,700 referred loans across a broader audience while maintaining our credit criteria. In home loans, we met our 2021 goals to diversify into purchase loans from predominantly refinanced loans and to reenter the jumbo loan market. By the fourth quarter, we had increased purchased home loans from low single-digits to low double-digits as a percentage of SoFi's total home loan volume. And we relaunched jumbo loans in the second half of the year. This diversification will help drive continued growth in a rising rate environment. In student loans, we saw accelerating demand in the fourth quarter ahead of the January federal student loan payment moratorium deadline and anticipated rate increases in 2022. We originated nearly $1.5 billion in loans, up more than 50% sequentially, even with the surprise late December extension to May 2022, which caused a reduction in demand during the final week of the quarter. Looking ahead, we expect continued strong growth in lending driven by our ongoing momentum in personal loans, the end of the student loan payment moratorium, better positioning in home loans and the many opportunities our new bank license presents. In financial services, we achieved record growth in products adopted in the fourth quarter and, importantly, a large step-up in monetization that drove record revenue up nearly 2x sequentially. We added 857,000 new financial services products in the fourth quarter, up 56% from the number of third quarter adds. For the year, we added nearly 2.5 million new financial services products, more than double the $1.2 million we added in 2020. Through better monetization, we produced a 5x year-over-year increase in our fourth quarter total financial services revenue of $22 million as well as our full year revenue of $58 million. Product improvements that drove the year's phenomenal growth include the following; in SoFi Invest, we give members more selection and new features. We added 25 new cryptocurrencies, making SoFi a selection leader with 30 at year-end. We offered two regular way IPOs to retail investors in the fourth quarter. The first was Rivian, the largest IPO since Facebook in 2012. And the second is Nubank, a leading fintech company in Brazil. We introduced stop limit trade orders in the fourth quarter and margin trading earlier this year. At SoFi Money, we introduced two-day early paycheck, autosave, cashback and no-fee overdraft protection. And with our launch of SoFi Checking and Savings, we now offer members 1% APY, 33 times the national average, plus no account fees or minimum balance, plus many of the free features members already enjoy. Our SoFi Credit Card, which includes the only rewards platform that gives points for both transactions and smart financial behaviors, really took off in its first full year. Quarterly spend balances and accounts grew at high double-digit rates, and we finished 2021 with 91,000 products and a debut NPS score in the mid-50s. Finishing with our tech platform, Galileo benefit throughout 2021 from growth in enabled accounts, transactions per account and adoption of new products by existing partners, as well as the addition of diverse new partners. Fourth quarter segment revenues of $53 million was up 42% year-over-year, an acceleration versus the year-over-year growth in Q3 at 29%. And with the inclusion of a full year of Galileo results, 2021 revenue more than doubled to $195 million. Galileo added 11 million new end-user accounts in the quarter, a 67% year-over-year increase to $100 million at year-end, up from 60 million enabled accounts at the start of 2021. Galileo launched new clients and signed nine new ones in the fourth quarter, bringing total full year adds to 44. We also grew Galileo's total B2B client base by 40% in 2021. We launched Toast last year and signed a T. Rowe Price in the fourth quarter to service its future emergency savings program. And H&R Block just chose Galileo to power its new mobile banking app, Spruce. We acquired Galileo to leverage an owned and operated platform to drive rapid innovation with the benefit of a great business that further diversified our revenue. Now as we announced last week, we're finding the same playbook by acquiring Technisys, a leading cloud-native multi-product core banking platform. Adding Technisys is the next step in vertically integrating SoFi's businesses to further accelerate the pace of innovation of our best-of-breed financial products. We expect Technisys to be a growth multiplier for both SoFi and Galileo, in addition to realizing its own enormous growth opportunities, which are further strengthened in partnership with Galileo. We are well on our way to building the AWS of fintech. Now let's talk about point number two, the success of SoFi's unique Financial Services Productivity Loop strategy. Critical to the FSPL is creating best-of-breed products that build trust and reliability with members, which increases the likelihood they choose SoFi for a second or third product. When they do, we benefit from increased LTV per member by generating more revenue at little to no incremental customer acquisition cost. As a result, our higher LTV allows us to invest in more differentiated products and services, which in turn drives more demand and higher LTVs. It's a true competitive advantage. The FSPL has had its biggest impact yet on 2021 results. The scale of our top of the funnel products is now large enough that at the same cross-buy rates, fourth quarter cross-buy volume more than triple the year-over-year to more than 380,000 products. And more than one-third of our new products were adopted by existing members in the quarter, contributing to the 17% decline in our customer acquisition costs in 2021. I mentioned that our total year-end members of 3.5 million exceeded our 2021 goal by 500,000. Our unique FSPL advantage not only helped us exceed this goal, we did so without notable associated marketing costs. Instead, these FSPL efficiencies allowed us to significantly exceed our member and product goals, yet still achieve our EBITDA targets. This brings me to my third key success factor for 2021, our ability to drive a dramatic increase in SoFi's unaided brand awareness, with the unmatched reach of SoFi Stadium nationally televised games, the success of our various integrated multimedia campaigns and the reality of the influencers we partner with. Here are a few remarkable stats. The 5 nationally televised regular season games at SoFi Stadium were seen by an average of more than 22 million households per total. This visibility helped increase SoFi's unaided brand awareness by nearly 70% in 2021 to a new record in the fourth quarter. And that was before an estimated 106 million people tuned in to watch the Rams win the Super Bowl at SoFi Stadium. Before turning it over to Chris to talk to the results, I wanted to share a few additional thoughts. In February, I celebrated my fourth anniversary as the CEO of SoFi. While I could not be more proud of all we've accomplished in such a short period of time, I am even more excited about what's ahead of us. We are just starting to reap the benefits from the enormous progress we have made on our strategic position, the breadth of our differentiated and diversified product suite, our tech platform that helps us serve the industry as we build the AWS of fintech, our balance sheet of $4.7 billion in equity value, the exponential growth for our brand awareness and, of course, most importantly, our team. With that, let me turn it over to Chris for a review of the financials for the quarter and the year.\nChris Lapointe: Thanks, Anthony, and good afternoon. We finished off a remarkable year by delivering record quarterly revenue and our sixth consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA. Importantly, we achieved this despite facing new and existing challenges in the quarter, proving once again that our diversified and differentiated business model drive SoFi's durability and long-term growth potential. I'm going to walk you through some key financial highlights for the quarter and year and then share color on our financial outlook. Unless otherwise stated, I'll be referring to adjusted results for the fourth quarter of 2021 versus fourth quarter of 2020. Our GAAP consolidated income statement and all reconciliations can be found in today's earnings release and our 10-K filing. For the quarter, top line growth accelerated as we delivered record adjusted net revenue of $280 million, up 54% year-over-year from the same prior year period and at the high end of our guidance of $272 million to $282 million. Adjusted EBITDA of $5 million was also at the high end of our guidance of $2 million to $5 million. For the full year, we delivered $1.01 billion of adjusted net revenue, up 63% year-over-year. Our original 2021 plan and what we guided process was $980 million in adjusted net revenue. That assumed that federal student loan payment moratorium would expire on September 30, 2021, and also included a full year of revenue recognition from our equity investment in Apex, which was called last January. Despite the $50 million plus of revenue headwinds created by those 2 factors alone, we still exceeded our original revenue plan by $30 million. From an adjusted EBITDA perspective, we delivered $30 million in profits, above our original full year guidance of $27 million and up $75 million from the $45 million of losses incurred in 2020. Now on to the segment level performance where growth accelerated across all 3 segments. In lending, fourth quarter adjusted net revenue grew 30% year-over-year to $208 million versus 21% in Q3 of 2021 driven by a 67% increase in funded volume to $3.8 billion in total, a new high for us. The largest contributors to funded volume growth were our personal loans business which grew 168% or $1 billion year-over-year to $1.6 billion in originations for the quarter; and our student loans business, which saw more than 50% year-over-year growth to $1.5 billion. In personal loans, we captured increased demand from borrowers remodeling their homes and refinancing variable rate debt into attractive fixed rate products as interest rates increase. Additionally, we continue to improve conversion as we iterated throughout our funnel. In student loans, we benefited from increased demand from federal student loan borrowers looking to refinance prior to the anticipated January 2022 expiry of the federal student loan payment moratorium. In addition, increased net interest margins and strong gain on sale margins, inclusive of hedge gains, drove material year-over-year growth in net interest income and loan sales revenue. The lending business delivered $105 million of contribution profit at a 51% margin. Overall contribution dollars were up 23% versus the same prior year period, but margins were down from 53% in Q4 2020. The slight year-over-year decline in margins was caused by lower home loans throughput with our third-party fulfillment partner, resulting in lower home loans revenue and margins. I'm pleased to say demand remained robust throughout the quarter and were it not for these partner issues, we would have had strong quarterly performance. These issues have since been resolved by onboarding another third-party fulfillment partner. In addition, expenses were higher in the student loan refinancing business where we increased marketing to capitalize on elevated demand in the lead up to the January 2022 federal student loan payment moratorium expiration. When the moratorium was unexpectedly extended to May 2022 at the end of December, we lost a week of revenue from anticipated federal student loan funding and had already spent the marketing dollars. For the full year, lending adjusted net revenue grew 42% to $764 million and the segment delivered $400 million of contribution profit at a 52% margin. Shifting to our tech platform where we delivered net revenue of $53 million in the quarter, up 42% from the same prior year period. Overall segment growth was driven by 67% year-over-year Galileo account growth to 100 million in total. As a reminder, it is normal to see a lag between the addition of new accounts and the engagement and monetization of those accounts. We are encouraged by this leading indicator of Galileo's growth. Q4 contribution profit was $20 million at a 38% margin, which is down year-over-year given the investments we have made in technology capabilities overall and the migration to the cloud, but up sequentially from 31% in Q3 2021 due to fixed cost leverage we were able to achieve in the quarter. This one quarter does mark the beginning of a trend, and as discussed previously, we plan to operate the business in the 20% to 30% contribution margin range for the foreseeable future as we continue investing to take advantage of the opportunity ahead of us. For the full year, the tech platform segment grew revenue 102% to $195 million and delivered $64 million of contribution profit at a 33% margin. On to our financial services segment, which continues to benefit from strong growth across all products and our improved ability to monetize that growth. This segment delivered revenue of $22 million in Q4, more than five times the prior year quarter at $4 million and up 74% sequentially. Within the segment, year-over-year revenue growth was particularly strong in SoFi Invest, Lantern, SoFi Credit Card, and SoFi Money. As important, our year-over-year revenue growth was twice our exceptional product growth of 2.5x, demonstrating our continued progress in monetization. Invest added 362,000 accounts and reached 1.6 billion in total. Money added 276,000 accounts and reached 1.4 million in total, and Relay added 180,000 accounts and hit 930,000 in total. Contribution losses were $35 million for the quarter. While this is a slight improvement year-over-year, we remain in investment mode, focused on creating the right unit economics for each business to drive long-term sustainable growth. For the full year, segment revenue of $58 million was nearly 5x the $12 million we delivered in 2020 and our $135 million contribution loss was essentially flat year-over-year. Quickly switching to our balance sheet, which grew by approximately $600 million year-over-year to $9.2 billion in total, primarily as a result of growth in originations that accelerated in the back half of the year. In addition, we exited the year with $1.6 billion drawn on our warehouse facilities, less than 25% of our overall $7 billion of capacity. That low reliance on warehouse capacity allowed us to significantly reduce our cost of funds and we ended the year very well capitalized, having raised a total of $3.6 billion of new capital. Our total book value is $4.7 billion, and our capital and leverage ratios are extremely strong. Finally, on December 6th, we redeemed all of the outstanding SoFi Technologies' private and public warrants which removed a significant source of P&L volatility for SoFi. We are excited about the strength of our balance sheet, and continue to make choices that ensure the most efficient cost and use of capital. The last thing I want to discuss is Q1 and full year 2022 guidance. It's important to note before getting into the details that the incremental net interest income from SoFi Bank will only contribute nominally to Q1 results and prior to fully originating loans in the bank, which we expect in May of 2022. That's because when we opened the bank in February, we did not contribute any existing SoFi loans to the bank as we initially capitalized the bank with cash. We are still transitioning our operations to have loan originations occur from the bank, and that transition will not be fully complete until the end of May. Over the last several quarters, our unique diversified business model has proven to be an increasingly powerful competitive advantage. Even as we continue to invest in scale, we expect that strength and momentum to continue. Our Q1 guidance incorporates the negative impact of the unexpected extension of the federal student loan payment moratorium to May of 2022. We estimate that negative impact to be approximately $30 million to $35 million of revenue and $20 million to $25 million of contribution profit in Q1, with loan origination levels for the entire quarter to be consistent with those of the first three quarters of 2021. For Q1, we expect $280 million to $285 million of adjusted net revenue, up 30% to 32% year-over-year and $0 million to $5 million of adjusted EBITDA. Had the moratorium expired in January, we estimate that Q1 revenue would have been $310 million to $320 million, and EBITDA would have been $20 million to $30 million. For illustrative purposes, we've included this alternative scenario in our investor presentation. For the full year 2022, we expect to grow adjusted net revenue 55% year-over-year to $1.57 billion and deliver adjusted EBITDA of $180 million. There are several recent developments that factor into our full year guidance. First, we assume the moratorium on federal student loan payments expires as currently contemplated on May 1, 2022, and student loan refinancing origination volume will normalize at pre-COVID levels partway through Q2 and remain at those levels from that point through the remainder of the year. Second, we assume the SoFi Bank will begin contributing to SoFi's results more meaningfully in Q2 rather than in Q1 when we opened the bank. That's because, as I just mentioned, we opened the bank with no loans and initially capitalized it with cash from our balance sheet. This is an important distinction because we won't begin to realize the lower cost of capital benefits of the bank until we can originate and fund loans in the bank. And we believe it will take until Q2 to build the appropriate loan balances to see more than a nominal impact. Third, we assume that Technisys revenue growth will be 20% to 25% for the full year and start contributing to our business following the close of the transaction. And fourth, as discussed previously, we expect our core SoFi business, excluding the impact of Technisys, to deliver incremental EBITDA margins of 30% in 2022 as we continue investing to drive sustainable growth for years to come. Technisys will contribute a small amount of EBITDA in 2022. But as we mentioned last week, 2021 was a year of significant investment for Technisys. Over time, we expect this business to be additive to consolidated incremental EBITDA margins. The last thing to cover on guidance is our stock-based compensation expense which we currently forecast to be between $80 million and $85 million in Q1 and $340 million for the full year. In summary, we could not be more proud of the results SoFi delivered in 2021. We exceeded $1 billion in annual revenue and delivered a full year of positive EBITDA. We continue to be extremely well-capitalized and are excited about the opportunities in front of us. We look forward to another strong year in 2022. With that, let's open it up to questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the Q&A session.  We will now take our first question from the line of John Hecht of Jefferies. John, your line is connected. Please proceed.\nJohn Hecht: Thanks very much. Nice quarter, guys, and thanks for the detailed guidance. Very good member and product numbers for the fourth quarter. Maybe can you give us color on what drove that in terms of customer acquisition channels, customer acquisition costs. Any change there? And what are you seeing opportunities and so forth?\nAnthony Noto: Thank you, John. So it was an extraordinary quarter for member and product growth, and it's the culmination of a lot of hard work that's going into the company over the last four years. Everything from the member home feed in the app to developing use of data to make recommendations to our members based on their information and other members' information in a personalized way, our reporting program, our rewards program and then, of course, just differentiating the products individually themselves, and then layered on top of all that is just the hard drive that we've made to increase unaided brand awareness. The financial services companies, our members need to trust us. We become a household brand name. And the ability to leverage the broad reach that we talked about in our prepared remarks of SoFi Stadium throughout October, November, December, really gave us a nice slip in unaided brand awareness which makes all of our marketing more efficient. The combination of that and the product differentiation that we've added as it relates to products like SoFi Money and SoFi Invest, which I talked during the quarter, really drove a really strong growth rate across both members and products but, importantly, at a decreasing customer acquisition cost. I'll let Chris talk to the specifics of the decline in customer acquisition cost on a per member and per product basis, but it was really the culmination of product, marketing, operations and just a really strong integrated campaign across traditional media, digital and social influencers.\nChris Lapointe: Yeah. Thanks, John. So if you look at Q4 2021, total sales and marketing divided by new members, you'll see that our overall sales and marketing per new member was down nearly 20% sequentially. And if you look at this on a full year basis, it was down about 18% when comparing it to full year 2020.\nJohn Hecht: Okay. That's great. Thanks for the color. And then second question, and I know, Chris, you talked about the contribution from the bank over the course of the year. But maybe can you give us kind of an idea, as rates moved during the year, what that does to the kind of context of the revenues and expenses coming out of the bank, just assuming we'll go through a rate hike cycle?\nChris Lapointe: Yeah, absolutely. I can address the overall question on rates. But what I would say is that our current guidance contemplates five rate hikes in 2022. That's roughly in line with what's implied by the forward curves today. And as a reminder, at a high level for the lending business overall, we seek to maximize profit dollars in our lending business, while staying within the 40% to 50% contribution margin range that we've talked about historically. In Q4, we delivered $105 million of contribution dollars at a 51% margin across our entire portfolio, even as rates increase. And we expect to maintain this type of approach going forward, even with the bank. As you know, you can't really look at rate volatility in isolation as we have a number of levers that we can pull to moderate the impact of interest rate movements such as pricing, the structure of our loan sale agreements and hedging. From a pricing perspective, we've worked really hard over the course of the last several years to build the muscle and pricing capabilities to react really quickly to changes in rates and achieve our overall margin objectives. In Q1, we've started to increase our weighted average coupon in order to keep pace with rate moves and offset the impact of margin compression that's expected. And demand has remained fairly robust, specifically in our personal loans business. From a sales construct perspective, some of our forward flow deals are structured with fixed prices wherein we don't take interest rate or credit risk. And we also, as you know, have an incredibly diversified exit mix wherein we don't need to overly depend on securitization markets as an outlet, and therefore, we're a bit more insulated in market dislocation situations. From a hedging perspective, we currently hedge loans on the balance sheet, subject to rate volatility in order to eliminate that impact of rates on future gain on sale. And then the last thing I would note as it relates to rates, and this is what we discussed previously, we benefit from the fact that we have a diversified portfolio of lending products that do well in different rate environments. In rising rate environments, our personal loans business does really well, and we're seeing that right now. And in lower rate environments, our student loan refinancing and home loan refinancing businesses do well. Overall, our diversified model allows us to adjust in real time and allocate capital to businesses and opportunities that we do well in, that do well in specific market and macro backdrops.\nAnthony Noto: The additional thing I'd add to that, just for everyone's benefit, is if you go back to 2018 and track interest rates throughout that year, then into 2019 and 2020, we've sort of navigated an environment of rates going up meaningfully. I think at one point in 2018, we're expecting four to five rate increases. In 2019, we are geared up for that. We spent the whole year really putting in place the right marketing channels, the right distribution channels for our loans from a whole loan standpoint and ADS standpoint, in addition to our funding costs and our pricing capabilities prepared for that. When we got into 2019, I think there was maybe one or two rate increases then the market completely switched, not unlike we started hearing about today, and we're able to pivot our business to go to those areas that benefited from a flat rate environment. And then again, during COVID, when rates went from -- I think Fed funds was at 1.5% rate to zero, we pivoted again. So we're not always going to be perfect. We'll make our mistakes, but having navigated through that bottle environment in the past gives us great sort of playbook to navigate in the future.\nOperator: Thank you for your question, John. Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi. Ashwin, please proceed with your question.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thanks. I was wondering if you could kind of walk through the guidance assumptions by segment and the cadence on that.\nChris Lapointe: Yes, absolutely. I can take that one, Ashwin. So we aren't providing specific segment- or product-level guidance or quarterly progression guidance at this point. But in order to help bridge you from where we are from a current run rate perspective to our full year guide at the revenue level, there are a few things that I would call out. First, there are several businesses or factors that are not in our current run rate but will have much more of a meaningful impact beginning in Q2 and beyond this year. That bucket includes, first, a return to normalized pre-COVID student loan refinancing originations once the moratorium ends. And we've quantified that Q1 loss revenue and contribution impact for you as part of our guide. Second, we expect to be fully originating loans in the bank and benefiting from a lower cost of capital by May of this year and the extended hold period benefit a few months thereafter. And then third, we'll have contribution from Technisys following the close of the transaction. The second bucket that consider is continued growth across all of our segments. Within lending, I just mentioned the student loan refinancing business, but we also expect to see continued momentum in our personal loans business as rates rise and folks look to refinance at a variable rate debt into attractive fixed rate loans. And we continue to improve our overall funnel conversion, which has had a really strong impact on growth in the last several quarters for us. We also expect to see strong growth in our home loans business as we move beyond third-party throughput issues that I talked about in my prepared remarks and continue to scale our overall purchase and jumbo programs as well as continue to capture large opportunities that we have with our existing member base. Within financial services, we're expecting to see continued growth in products and monetization. And the things that are going to drive that monetization are increased assets under management in our Invest business, increased spend on our Money and Credit Card businesses as well as new product releases, premium services and scaling our ETFs. Just quickly hitting on some of the higher growth drivers within financial services, in Money, we generate revenue, as you know, from net interest income and inter-exchange. Given the spend behaviors that we've seen over the course of the last several quarters as well as the expected growth in accounts that we're going to get now that we can offer a competitive interest rate, we're really optimistic about being able to further drive monetization here. In Invest, we generate revenue from a number of sources: net interest income, share lending, payment for order flow, digital assets. More recently, we launched margin and soon-to-be options. And all of those are driven by assets under management, and we expect continued growth here as our AUM per product trends continues to do really well and our member base grows. And then in Credit Card, we generate revenue from interchange and balances and are really optimistic about recent trends that we've been seeing here, particularly around spending. Collectively, the reference trends that I just talked about are really helping drive growth in monetization, and you can start seeing that play out in the actual numbers. In Q4 alone, our overall revenue per financial services product was up more than 2x year-over-year and nearly 40% sequentially. And then the last thing I'd call out as it relates to the segment forecast is within the tech platform, we expect continued growth in accounts, transactions per account, growth in new partners and, obviously, the combination with Technisys to really help drive growth there in a high margin segment.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Got it, got it. Okay. And just a clarification on the Pagaya loans included in the personal loan originations number and perhaps you could use that as a stepping off the talk about future partnerships such as this that might be in the pipeline?\nAnthony Noto: Yeah. And for the benefit of others, Pagaya is a partnership that we entered in as it relates to people outside of the credit box that SoFi underwrites. We only improve about 30% of our personal loan applications because we're focused on prime borrowers, not near prime or sub-prime. When we first arrived here four years ago, we've built a strategy, which we call the decline monetization strategy, which was a way of taking applicants to SoFi and sending them to other underwriters. And we get a lead generation fee, and we do that through Lantern. We want to build on that success as a the contribution to our business and help satisfy even more people that are applying for loans. And our Pagaya partnership, think of it as a lending as a service. It's completely integrated with our application process. The credit and approval pricing models are run simultaneously. The loan is underwritten by Pagaya and a partner. We do not take the credit risk on that paper, but we do the servicing on that member and offer them other products and services. This was our first quarter where it contributed to the financial services revenue number because there is a referral revenue fee and a lending of the fee. Chris, I don't think if you want to talk about the loan volume, but it's not included, correct?\nChris Lapointe: No, we don't disclose the actual loan volume. What you'll see in the disclosures is the number of members that are attributable to Pagaya and you can see that in our financial services segment, but we outline that in actual disclosures.\nOperator: Thank you for your question Ashwin. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy, please proceed. Betsy can you confirmed that your line is not muted. Okay. In there interest of time we’re going to move on. Betsy you can reenter the queue if you like. Our next question is from Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. Moshe, please proceed.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks. So Anthony, you talked a lot about -- and Chris, both of you about the marketing efficiency that you're seeing lower CAC. And you spent maybe $15 million more in marketing. Can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about the 2022 plan in terms of both marketing efficiency, how much you'll be spending, what it means for the growth rate on the incremental margins?\nChris Lapointe: Yeah, I can take that, Moshe. So like I said, we have made really different progress in terms of overall efficiencies. What I would say in terms of the overall outlook, we're not going to provide it at the segment level or spend level detail. But what I would say is we're at the level that we currently need to be at in order to support our longer term 30% margin target at a consolidated level. As you know, we're right now at the right unit economics within our financial services segment, and we're seeing really strong cross-buy trends, as we alluded to, where we're starting to feel comfortable about shifting more marketing dollars towards those lower CAC products.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Got it. Thanks. One of the things that we've talked about over the last couple of months, as you've gotten the bank closed and up and running, is the ability to use that as a tool to get direct deposit customers. I know that you just launched the deposit suite of products relatively recently. But could you talk about any progress there in terms of getting into direct deposit for the SoFi Money customers and what that means for engagement?\nAnthony Noto: Yes. It's still early days, and I would also just emphasize, it's not something we're just starting on now. It's really something that we start to emphasize throughout 2021, and we're starting to see the benefit of more and more each quarter. The numbers are small. They're increasing very nicely. The number of direct deposit accounts that we signed per week increased 50% from Q3 to Q4 and another 50% from Q4 into Q1 already. And we, obviously, just started to introduce the interest rate and the marketing. One of the things that I'd say about the direct deposit activity is that, once it does begin, you do see the pickup in spending, which Chris alluded to. So the increases we're seeing are steady and positive and to the right. But we're really just getting started. One of the things that may not be obvious from the outside looking in is that, when the Federal Reserve approved our bank license in January, we had to go through a whole product launch. We had to switch the technology. We had to switch the reporting. We had to change all the marketing collateral. We had to change all the relationships with affiliates. And that process is still ongoing. So it's not like you just flip a switch and, all of a sudden, all the things that was driving your business before can now drive this new product in a service called SoFi Checking. It really was sort of a close down SoFi Money and stand up SoFi Checking and Savings. And since we have over 1 million accounts as it relates to our Money product, which we disclosed, we had to do that process in a very coordinated fashion. I will give the team a ton of credit. It's been executing incredibly well, knock on wood, so far. But we went through a product rollout as if it was an entirely new product, launching it first to our existing members and then slowly rolling it out to new members. And we're just now actually switching over a lot of the marketing collateral with affiliates, et cetera. But in terms of the direct deposit initiative, it just didn't start in February. It started when we launched two day Early Paycheck. It started when we launched overdraft protection. It started when we launched AutoSave. And it's been a continuous process. So really strong growth in Q3 to Q4, 50% higher direct deposit adds per week in Q4 versus Q3. And right now, we're up another 50%. The numbers are small, but it's contributing as you see in the financial services revenue line.\nOperator: Thank you, Moshe. Our next question is from Mihir Bhatia of Bank of America. Mihir, please proceed.\nMihir Bhatia: Great. Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about Galileo, specifically, maybe in the technology platform. I appreciate that you're not giving guidance by product. But maybe you can just talk about a couple of things within that platform? Just overall from a growth perspective, maybe just give us some expectations on account growth in that platform. And specifically, the two things that I'm hoping you can address have to do with stimulus, the impact of stimulus on account growth at neobanks, if you're seeing any impact from that and just the competitive backdrop and any major contract renewals that you may have coming up.\nAnthony Noto: Yes. I think it's important to contextualize for everybody. The Galileo business is probably not that well understood in terms of how the business drives growth and what the growth opportunities are, so let me just frame that at a high level first. We're absolutely benefiting from the secular transition of physical payment to digital payments, and that's impacting the entire business, and that's a secular trend behind it, whether that's B2B payments or consumer payments or B2C activity. Here are the growth drivers. First is the growth of accounts of our existing partners. So that's the 100 million that we reported this quarter of enabled accounts. That continues to grow from existing partners. That 100 million accounts that are enabled, we can provide new products and services to that installed base of Galileo's partners. And we have a very robust pipeline to add new products and services through the existing accounts, things like secured debit, dynamic fraud protection and a number of other products that you'll see us introduce throughout the year. So the first driver is big growth in those accounts. The second driver on top of that is new products against those accounts. And then, of course, underlying all of that is just the increased activity within each one of those accounts. The second sort of bucket of driver is growth of new partners. Some of the new partners we announced there are a good example. H&R Block with the consumer app called Spruce is an example of a new partner, and we added 44 new partners, entirely new partners in 2021. The third growth driver is international. We have four of the largest neobanks as partners in Mexico. We're expanding into Colombia. And now on the back of the acquisition of Technisys, we can enter another 12 markets that they're already in and operating in. So international expansion is another bucket. And within that bucket are the first two buckets as well. And the last thing I'd say is that, we continue to diversify our relationships. The business was built on the back of B2C or consumer neobanks. But increasingly, we are much more attracted to enterprise businesses. And we'll have a competitive advantage in some of these cases. Enterprise businesses use commercial events, while SoFi also has a bank. So SoFi Bank could be the sponsor bank to commercial partners, enterprise partners and have a 10 to 12 basis points advantage, because we are the sponsor bank on top of the fact that we're also a payment processor. So we're really excited about the organic growth opportunities at Galileo. Without a doubt, some of the same-store customers will face stimulus tough comps, et cetera. And our goal is to overcome that through all these other growth drivers, and that's what we're focused on. Our outlook reflects it. So, we absolutely understand the headwind that may be there for some of the existing partners, but we have a bunch of other tailwinds to continue to drive strong growth there, not to mention the increased growth opportunities from the partnership with Technisys and vice versa.\nMihir Bhatia: Got it. That was quite comprehensive. Maybe just switching gears a little bit, I was curious about your guide. Your EBITDA effectively are going from $5 million to $60 million ramp. I understand some of that is, clearly the student loans coming back and we saw the Q1 impact of that. So, maybe just talk about some of the other factors driving it. Is it just scale? Maybe is there a way to break out how much benefit you get from the bank charter versus just revenue growth at scale driving that?\nChris Lapointe: Yes, absolutely. In terms of your overall question on how to bridge from where we are today in terms of $0 to $5 million of EBITDA and $180 million for the year, there are a few things I'd call out. Similar to what I said on the revenue guide, there are things that will start contributing more, as you pointed out, the student loan refinancing moratorium. The bank will also start contributing more at scale towards the end of Q2 and thereafter. And then you're also going to see good growth across our higher-margin businesses, specifically our personal loans and Galileo. What I would say in terms of quantifying the overall impact of the bank, I want to reiterate again that we just opened ago in February, and we capitalized it with cash, not loans. The reason that's really important is because that there were zero loans in the bank as of day one, and we just started originating loans within the bank. We expect to be fully originating those loans by the end of May of this year. As a result, the cost of capital benefits will start occurring in Q2 and the extended hold benefits will start four to five months thereafter, because we're already holding loans on the balance sheet for three to four months. If you were to assume normalized pre-COVID student loan refinancing originations and continued growth in our personal loans business as well as an extended three-month hold period and relatively conservative cost of capital savings assumptions, the impact would be about $70 million to $75 million of revenue for the year and $20 million to $25 million of adjusted EBITDA. That's what's currently embedded in our guide today.\nOperator: Thank you, Mihir. Our next question is from Dominick Gabriele of Oppenheimer. Dominick, please proceed.\nDominick Gabriele: Hey, great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I just want to go back to actually -- and you covered this a little bit, but I want to go back to the average revenue per product in the financial segment, which was much better than I was modeling and really shone. Maybe you could just go back and talk about the mix of financial products within the segments and how that mix really changed in the quarter and which products you think are getting adopted perhaps faster than you would have expected or a little slower by your customer base on a cross-sell. Any color around those metrics would be really, really helpful. Thank you.\nChris Lapointe: Yes. I'll hit on the financial component, and then I'll turn it over to Anthony. But overall, really good traction in the financial services segment. We ended up driving $22 million of revenue in the quarter. That was up 5x year-over-year from the $4 million that we did last Q4, so an $18 million improvement. Where that growth ended up coming from was in our Invest business, which contributed about 32% of that growth. Our Money and Credit Card businesses combined delivered $8 million in the quarter and contributed about 42% of the growth. And our Lantern and Pagaya businesses delivered about $6 million of Q4 revenue and contributed to about 22% of the growth.\nAnthony Noto: In terms of the performance of each of the products, I'm looking at the net adds across each of the products. And I would say, at a high level, it was a strong quarter across all the products. It would be hard to pick out one product and say it was not growing as fast as we'd like. These are all disclosed, and we'll see them in the 10-K. We had a really strong growth in the Money product and, on an absolute basis, on a relative basis, really strong in brokerage and in crypto as well as robo. I think of those products, the one I think we can differentiate a lot more, they all have opportunities. We're focused on fast selection, content and convenience as well as making the products work better together. But of those four that I just mentioned, robo is oldest of the four products and one the team is interested in differentiating more and we think there is a big opportunity there to do so. That doesn't mean we're not going to differentiate on brokerage and launch options, which is down the road or do other things on Money as it relates to high-yield savings, et cetera. There are still opportunities in every one of the products. That's the one we've probably invested the least in, that's still a big opportunity. I think about Credit Card and our At Work product and international. And I would tell you, Credit Card, I think, is a huge opportunity for us. The team has done a phenomenal job. I talked about the trends you've already achieved. But we've really just scratched the surface. We have one card. It's not segmented by different types of different types of members. You have spenders. You also have revolvers. There's a lot more personalization we could do with the Credit Card. And there's also an opportunity to make the Credit Card to work better with all the rest of our products. So, we're excited about the opportunity in financial services products. The trends are really strong in the fourth quarter. And it would be hard to pick out one or another underperforming, but I do think that what I characterize as some of the opportunities to take some of the products to the next level.\nDominick Gabriele: Great. You kind of led me straight into it with the Credit Card. That is a huge opportunity. It can really drive the ARPU significantly higher, compared to some other products despite its nature. And so, I was just curious about what is the target audience? When you think about the average FICO score, you mentioned prime on some of the other products, in particular, and just how you think about the life of loan loss rates that you would be targeting for these products as you ramp it up? Thanks so much.\nAnthony Noto: Yeah. The Credit Card product is still a prime product with very high FICO score of over 700. We think there's a lot of opportunity to play in that segment with differentiation within it. Over time, we can explore different opportunities for a broader member base. But we sort of have all these cylinders going at the same time. And its can't the way that they just ask, are we doing enough, are we doing too much or we doing enough, are we doing too much? And I think we have the right balance as it relates to Credit Card. We want to build a high-quality card base. We want to drive strong engagement. And we want to make sure we have great product market fit before we step out of our comfort zone. So there's still a lot of room within the prime customer that we have and no reason to change. We can differentiate within that still. And in terms of CECL reserves, Dominick, you can see in our filing that we're running at about a 5.5% loss rate right now, which is relatively consistent with our personal loans business, so really healthy. Operator: Thank you, Dominick. We are currently at the top of the hour, so we do not have time for any additional questions. So I'll pass the conference back over to Anthony, for any closing remarks.\nAnthony Noto: Thank you. Thank you all for tuning in today. Before we wrap-up, I wanted to final thoughts. The road to this point at SoFi has had its share of unexpected twist and turns. And every single time, our team has shown the grit, the perseverance and cohesion to navigate through the fog of uncertainty, to achieve our goals and come out stronger. Now only have we managed to exceed our already ambitious goals, we've accomplished more in one year, than most companies achieve in their lifetime. As we've turned the page on 2021, 2022 has started off with an even more volatile environment with greater uncertainty. The fog of uncertainty excites me. It creates the greatest opportunities for those who dare to win. It's when leadership matters most because it's when the winners who will take the most are decided. I love our team. I love our strategy. I love our company. And I love where I work. I wake up every day trying to be a better leader than the day before and reminding myself that who dares wins. For the first time in four years, I also wake up every day, knowing the only thing between us and realizing our ambitions is us. I would take that setup any day of the week and twice on Sundays. Thank you for your time today. And we look forward to addressing you next quarter, when we report Q1 results.\nOperator: That concludes the SoFi Q4 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chris Lapointe",
            "content": "Thanks, Anthony, and good afternoon. We finished off a remarkable year by delivering record quarterly revenue and our sixth consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA. Importantly, we achieved this despite facing new and existing challenges in the quarter, proving once again that our diversified and differentiated business model drive SoFi's durability and long-term growth potential. I'm going to walk you through some key financial highlights for the quarter and year and then share color on our financial outlook. Unless otherwise stated, I'll be referring to adjusted results for the fourth quarter of 2021 versus fourth quarter of 2020. Our GAAP consolidated income statement and all reconciliations can be found in today's earnings release and our 10-K filing. For the quarter, top line growth accelerated as we delivered record adjusted net revenue of $280 million, up 54% year-over-year from the same prior year period and at the high end of our guidance of $272 million to $282 million. Adjusted EBITDA of $5 million was also at the high end of our guidance of $2 million to $5 million. For the full year, we delivered $1.01 billion of adjusted net revenue, up 63% year-over-year. Our original 2021 plan and what we guided process was $980 million in adjusted net revenue. That assumed that federal student loan payment moratorium would expire on September 30, 2021, and also included a full year of revenue recognition from our equity investment in Apex, which was called last January. Despite the $50 million plus of revenue headwinds created by those 2 factors alone, we still exceeded our original revenue plan by $30 million. From an adjusted EBITDA perspective, we delivered $30 million in profits, above our original full year guidance of $27 million and up $75 million from the $45 million of losses incurred in 2020. Now on to the segment level performance where growth accelerated across all 3 segments. In lending, fourth quarter adjusted net revenue grew 30% year-over-year to $208 million versus 21% in Q3 of 2021 driven by a 67% increase in funded volume to $3.8 billion in total, a new high for us. The largest contributors to funded volume growth were our personal loans business which grew 168% or $1 billion year-over-year to $1.6 billion in originations for the quarter; and our student loans business, which saw more than 50% year-over-year growth to $1.5 billion. In personal loans, we captured increased demand from borrowers remodeling their homes and refinancing variable rate debt into attractive fixed rate products as interest rates increase. Additionally, we continue to improve conversion as we iterated throughout our funnel. In student loans, we benefited from increased demand from federal student loan borrowers looking to refinance prior to the anticipated January 2022 expiry of the federal student loan payment moratorium. In addition, increased net interest margins and strong gain on sale margins, inclusive of hedge gains, drove material year-over-year growth in net interest income and loan sales revenue. The lending business delivered $105 million of contribution profit at a 51% margin. Overall contribution dollars were up 23% versus the same prior year period, but margins were down from 53% in Q4 2020. The slight year-over-year decline in margins was caused by lower home loans throughput with our third-party fulfillment partner, resulting in lower home loans revenue and margins. I'm pleased to say demand remained robust throughout the quarter and were it not for these partner issues, we would have had strong quarterly performance. These issues have since been resolved by onboarding another third-party fulfillment partner. In addition, expenses were higher in the student loan refinancing business where we increased marketing to capitalize on elevated demand in the lead up to the January 2022 federal student loan payment moratorium expiration. When the moratorium was unexpectedly extended to May 2022 at the end of December, we lost a week of revenue from anticipated federal student loan funding and had already spent the marketing dollars. For the full year, lending adjusted net revenue grew 42% to $764 million and the segment delivered $400 million of contribution profit at a 52% margin. Shifting to our tech platform where we delivered net revenue of $53 million in the quarter, up 42% from the same prior year period. Overall segment growth was driven by 67% year-over-year Galileo account growth to 100 million in total. As a reminder, it is normal to see a lag between the addition of new accounts and the engagement and monetization of those accounts. We are encouraged by this leading indicator of Galileo's growth. Q4 contribution profit was $20 million at a 38% margin, which is down year-over-year given the investments we have made in technology capabilities overall and the migration to the cloud, but up sequentially from 31% in Q3 2021 due to fixed cost leverage we were able to achieve in the quarter. This one quarter does mark the beginning of a trend, and as discussed previously, we plan to operate the business in the 20% to 30% contribution margin range for the foreseeable future as we continue investing to take advantage of the opportunity ahead of us. For the full year, the tech platform segment grew revenue 102% to $195 million and delivered $64 million of contribution profit at a 33% margin. On to our financial services segment, which continues to benefit from strong growth across all products and our improved ability to monetize that growth. This segment delivered revenue of $22 million in Q4, more than five times the prior year quarter at $4 million and up 74% sequentially. Within the segment, year-over-year revenue growth was particularly strong in SoFi Invest, Lantern, SoFi Credit Card, and SoFi Money. As important, our year-over-year revenue growth was twice our exceptional product growth of 2.5x, demonstrating our continued progress in monetization. Invest added 362,000 accounts and reached 1.6 billion in total. Money added 276,000 accounts and reached 1.4 million in total, and Relay added 180,000 accounts and hit 930,000 in total. Contribution losses were $35 million for the quarter. While this is a slight improvement year-over-year, we remain in investment mode, focused on creating the right unit economics for each business to drive long-term sustainable growth. For the full year, segment revenue of $58 million was nearly 5x the $12 million we delivered in 2020 and our $135 million contribution loss was essentially flat year-over-year. Quickly switching to our balance sheet, which grew by approximately $600 million year-over-year to $9.2 billion in total, primarily as a result of growth in originations that accelerated in the back half of the year. In addition, we exited the year with $1.6 billion drawn on our warehouse facilities, less than 25% of our overall $7 billion of capacity. That low reliance on warehouse capacity allowed us to significantly reduce our cost of funds and we ended the year very well capitalized, having raised a total of $3.6 billion of new capital. Our total book value is $4.7 billion, and our capital and leverage ratios are extremely strong. Finally, on December 6th, we redeemed all of the outstanding SoFi Technologies' private and public warrants which removed a significant source of P&L volatility for SoFi. We are excited about the strength of our balance sheet, and continue to make choices that ensure the most efficient cost and use of capital. The last thing I want to discuss is Q1 and full year 2022 guidance. It's important to note before getting into the details that the incremental net interest income from SoFi Bank will only contribute nominally to Q1 results and prior to fully originating loans in the bank, which we expect in May of 2022. That's because when we opened the bank in February, we did not contribute any existing SoFi loans to the bank as we initially capitalized the bank with cash. We are still transitioning our operations to have loan originations occur from the bank, and that transition will not be fully complete until the end of May. Over the last several quarters, our unique diversified business model has proven to be an increasingly powerful competitive advantage. Even as we continue to invest in scale, we expect that strength and momentum to continue. Our Q1 guidance incorporates the negative impact of the unexpected extension of the federal student loan payment moratorium to May of 2022. We estimate that negative impact to be approximately $30 million to $35 million of revenue and $20 million to $25 million of contribution profit in Q1, with loan origination levels for the entire quarter to be consistent with those of the first three quarters of 2021. For Q1, we expect $280 million to $285 million of adjusted net revenue, up 30% to 32% year-over-year and $0 million to $5 million of adjusted EBITDA. Had the moratorium expired in January, we estimate that Q1 revenue would have been $310 million to $320 million, and EBITDA would have been $20 million to $30 million. For illustrative purposes, we've included this alternative scenario in our investor presentation. For the full year 2022, we expect to grow adjusted net revenue 55% year-over-year to $1.57 billion and deliver adjusted EBITDA of $180 million. There are several recent developments that factor into our full year guidance. First, we assume the moratorium on federal student loan payments expires as currently contemplated on May 1, 2022, and student loan refinancing origination volume will normalize at pre-COVID levels partway through Q2 and remain at those levels from that point through the remainder of the year. Second, we assume the SoFi Bank will begin contributing to SoFi's results more meaningfully in Q2 rather than in Q1 when we opened the bank. That's because, as I just mentioned, we opened the bank with no loans and initially capitalized it with cash from our balance sheet. This is an important distinction because we won't begin to realize the lower cost of capital benefits of the bank until we can originate and fund loans in the bank. And we believe it will take until Q2 to build the appropriate loan balances to see more than a nominal impact. Third, we assume that Technisys revenue growth will be 20% to 25% for the full year and start contributing to our business following the close of the transaction. And fourth, as discussed previously, we expect our core SoFi business, excluding the impact of Technisys, to deliver incremental EBITDA margins of 30% in 2022 as we continue investing to drive sustainable growth for years to come. Technisys will contribute a small amount of EBITDA in 2022. But as we mentioned last week, 2021 was a year of significant investment for Technisys. Over time, we expect this business to be additive to consolidated incremental EBITDA margins. The last thing to cover on guidance is our stock-based compensation expense which we currently forecast to be between $80 million and $85 million in Q1 and $340 million for the full year. In summary, we could not be more proud of the results SoFi delivered in 2021. We exceeded $1 billion in annual revenue and delivered a full year of positive EBITDA. We continue to be extremely well-capitalized and are excited about the opportunities in front of us. We look forward to another strong year in 2022. With that, let's open it up to questions. Yeah. Thanks, John. So if you look at Q4 2021, total sales and marketing divided by new members, you'll see that our overall sales and marketing per new member was down nearly 20% sequentially. And if you look at this on a full year basis, it was down about 18% when comparing it to full year 2020. Yeah, absolutely. I can address the overall question on rates. But what I would say is that our current guidance contemplates five rate hikes in 2022. That's roughly in line with what's implied by the forward curves today. And as a reminder, at a high level for the lending business overall, we seek to maximize profit dollars in our lending business, while staying within the 40% to 50% contribution margin range that we've talked about historically. In Q4, we delivered $105 million of contribution dollars at a 51% margin across our entire portfolio, even as rates increase. And we expect to maintain this type of approach going forward, even with the bank. As you know, you can't really look at rate volatility in isolation as we have a number of levers that we can pull to moderate the impact of interest rate movements such as pricing, the structure of our loan sale agreements and hedging. From a pricing perspective, we've worked really hard over the course of the last several years to build the muscle and pricing capabilities to react really quickly to changes in rates and achieve our overall margin objectives. In Q1, we've started to increase our weighted average coupon in order to keep pace with rate moves and offset the impact of margin compression that's expected. And demand has remained fairly robust, specifically in our personal loans business. From a sales construct perspective, some of our forward flow deals are structured with fixed prices wherein we don't take interest rate or credit risk. And we also, as you know, have an incredibly diversified exit mix wherein we don't need to overly depend on securitization markets as an outlet, and therefore, we're a bit more insulated in market dislocation situations. From a hedging perspective, we currently hedge loans on the balance sheet, subject to rate volatility in order to eliminate that impact of rates on future gain on sale. And then the last thing I would note as it relates to rates, and this is what we discussed previously, we benefit from the fact that we have a diversified portfolio of lending products that do well in different rate environments. In rising rate environments, our personal loans business does really well, and we're seeing that right now. And in lower rate environments, our student loan refinancing and home loan refinancing businesses do well. Overall, our diversified model allows us to adjust in real time and allocate capital to businesses and opportunities that we do well in, that do well in specific market and macro backdrops. Yes, absolutely. I can take that one, Ashwin. So we aren't providing specific segment- or product-level guidance or quarterly progression guidance at this point. But in order to help bridge you from where we are from a current run rate perspective to our full year guide at the revenue level, there are a few things that I would call out. First, there are several businesses or factors that are not in our current run rate but will have much more of a meaningful impact beginning in Q2 and beyond this year. That bucket includes, first, a return to normalized pre-COVID student loan refinancing originations once the moratorium ends. And we've quantified that Q1 loss revenue and contribution impact for you as part of our guide. Second, we expect to be fully originating loans in the bank and benefiting from a lower cost of capital by May of this year and the extended hold period benefit a few months thereafter. And then third, we'll have contribution from Technisys following the close of the transaction. The second bucket that consider is continued growth across all of our segments. Within lending, I just mentioned the student loan refinancing business, but we also expect to see continued momentum in our personal loans business as rates rise and folks look to refinance at a variable rate debt into attractive fixed rate loans. And we continue to improve our overall funnel conversion, which has had a really strong impact on growth in the last several quarters for us. We also expect to see strong growth in our home loans business as we move beyond third-party throughput issues that I talked about in my prepared remarks and continue to scale our overall purchase and jumbo programs as well as continue to capture large opportunities that we have with our existing member base. Within financial services, we're expecting to see continued growth in products and monetization. And the things that are going to drive that monetization are increased assets under management in our Invest business, increased spend on our Money and Credit Card businesses as well as new product releases, premium services and scaling our ETFs. Just quickly hitting on some of the higher growth drivers within financial services, in Money, we generate revenue, as you know, from net interest income and inter-exchange. Given the spend behaviors that we've seen over the course of the last several quarters as well as the expected growth in accounts that we're going to get now that we can offer a competitive interest rate, we're really optimistic about being able to further drive monetization here. In Invest, we generate revenue from a number of sources: net interest income, share lending, payment for order flow, digital assets. More recently, we launched margin and soon-to-be options. And all of those are driven by assets under management, and we expect continued growth here as our AUM per product trends continues to do really well and our member base grows. And then in Credit Card, we generate revenue from interchange and balances and are really optimistic about recent trends that we've been seeing here, particularly around spending. Collectively, the reference trends that I just talked about are really helping drive growth in monetization, and you can start seeing that play out in the actual numbers. In Q4 alone, our overall revenue per financial services product was up more than 2x year-over-year and nearly 40% sequentially. And then the last thing I'd call out as it relates to the segment forecast is within the tech platform, we expect continued growth in accounts, transactions per account, growth in new partners and, obviously, the combination with Technisys to really help drive growth there in a high margin segment. No, we don't disclose the actual loan volume. What you'll see in the disclosures is the number of members that are attributable to Pagaya and you can see that in our financial services segment, but we outline that in actual disclosures. Yeah, I can take that, Moshe. So like I said, we have made really different progress in terms of overall efficiencies. What I would say in terms of the overall outlook, we're not going to provide it at the segment level or spend level detail. But what I would say is we're at the level that we currently need to be at in order to support our longer term 30% margin target at a consolidated level. As you know, we're right now at the right unit economics within our financial services segment, and we're seeing really strong cross-buy trends, as we alluded to, where we're starting to feel comfortable about shifting more marketing dollars towards those lower CAC products. Yes, absolutely. In terms of your overall question on how to bridge from where we are today in terms of $0 to $5 million of EBITDA and $180 million for the year, there are a few things I'd call out. Similar to what I said on the revenue guide, there are things that will start contributing more, as you pointed out, the student loan refinancing moratorium. The bank will also start contributing more at scale towards the end of Q2 and thereafter. And then you're also going to see good growth across our higher-margin businesses, specifically our personal loans and Galileo. What I would say in terms of quantifying the overall impact of the bank, I want to reiterate again that we just opened ago in February, and we capitalized it with cash, not loans. The reason that's really important is because that there were zero loans in the bank as of day one, and we just started originating loans within the bank. We expect to be fully originating those loans by the end of May of this year. As a result, the cost of capital benefits will start occurring in Q2 and the extended hold benefits will start four to five months thereafter, because we're already holding loans on the balance sheet for three to four months. If you were to assume normalized pre-COVID student loan refinancing originations and continued growth in our personal loans business as well as an extended three-month hold period and relatively conservative cost of capital savings assumptions, the impact would be about $70 million to $75 million of revenue for the year and $20 million to $25 million of adjusted EBITDA. That's what's currently embedded in our guide today. Yes. I'll hit on the financial component, and then I'll turn it over to Anthony. But overall, really good traction in the financial services segment. We ended up driving $22 million of revenue in the quarter. That was up 5x year-over-year from the $4 million that we did last Q4, so an $18 million improvement. Where that growth ended up coming from was in our Invest business, which contributed about 32% of that growth. Our Money and Credit Card businesses combined delivered $8 million in the quarter and contributed about 42% of the growth. And our Lantern and Pagaya businesses delivered about $6 million of Q4 revenue and contributed to about 22% of the growth."

            "name": "Anthony Noto",
            "content": "Thank you, Andrea, and good afternoon, everyone. Before beginning my prepared remarks, I want to take a moment to recognize the unacceptable tragedy that is currently taking place in Ukraine. It's been truly difficult to watch the series of events unfold over these past few weeks and escalate in recent days. No one should have to live in fear or under the threat of violence, which has now become a reality. Our hearts go out to everyone directly or indirectly affected by this tragic situation. Now, on to our results. We had another strong quarter, hitting new highs across our key financial and operating metrics and finishing 2021 with record annual results. Today, we are in our best position ever to achieve our long-term strategic goal: to be the digital one-stop shop for the major financial decisions in our members' lives and all of the moments in between. Here are some of the highlights. Record fourth quarter adjusted net revenue of $280 million was up 54% year-over-year and increased sequentially from a very strong third quarter, despite the unexpected federal student loan moratorium extension at quarter end. All three of our business segments achieved higher year-over-year growth. We delivered record full year revenue of just over $1 billion, at the high end of our guidance, which we increased on our third quarter earnings call. We achieved our sixth consecutive quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA at $5 million and delivered on our goal of positive full year EBITDA. We had an amazing quarter for member growth. We added 523,000 new members in the fourth quarter, a record in absolute number terms and impressively up 39% versus the amount added in the third quarter. As a result, we ended 2021 with 3.5 million members, an increase of 1.6 million, up 87% year-over-year and well above the 3 million member target set in January of '21. We also set another record with new product adds of 906,000 in the fourth quarter, up an incredible 51% versus the number of third quarter adds. We finished 2021 at 5.2 million total products, more than double the 2.5 million we had at year-end 2020. And at Galileo, we grew enabled accounts 67% year-over-year to 100 million. We were able to achieve these milestones in 2021 and get to such a position of strength today for three main reasons. First, we continue to drive strong growth through great execution across our three diverse businesses, which reflects our ability to capitalize on changing macro conditions. Second, the success of SoFi's unique Financial Services Productivity Loop strategy accelerated as we scaled our business in 2021, which allowed us to exceed our original 2021 member growth target by 40% and, importantly, still hit our EBITDA target. And third, we took a giant step forward in 2021 in achieving our goal of becoming a household brand name via our SoFi Stadium affiliation, the success of our integrated multimedia campaigns and the virality of the influencers we partnered with. I'll take these points one by one, starting with, number one, how we drove strong growth through great execution across our three diverse businesses. In lending, we grew segment revenues by 30% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 42% for the full year even with the unexpected extension of the federal student loan payment moratorium in late December. Fourth quarter personal loan originations were a record of $1.7 billion, up 168% year-over-year, and more than double fourth quarter 2019's pre-pandemic total. Full year originations were more than $5.3 billion versus $2.6 billion in 2020 and $3.7 billion in 2019. Personal Loans outperformed as a result of our improved execution, enhancements to our technology and credit models and the quality of our loans. And through our lending as a service partnership with Pagaya, we added nearly 7,700 referred loans across a broader audience while maintaining our credit criteria. In home loans, we met our 2021 goals to diversify into purchase loans from predominantly refinanced loans and to reenter the jumbo loan market. By the fourth quarter, we had increased purchased home loans from low single-digits to low double-digits as a percentage of SoFi's total home loan volume. And we relaunched jumbo loans in the second half of the year. This diversification will help drive continued growth in a rising rate environment. In student loans, we saw accelerating demand in the fourth quarter ahead of the January federal student loan payment moratorium deadline and anticipated rate increases in 2022. We originated nearly $1.5 billion in loans, up more than 50% sequentially, even with the surprise late December extension to May 2022, which caused a reduction in demand during the final week of the quarter. Looking ahead, we expect continued strong growth in lending driven by our ongoing momentum in personal loans, the end of the student loan payment moratorium, better positioning in home loans and the many opportunities our new bank license presents. In financial services, we achieved record growth in products adopted in the fourth quarter and, importantly, a large step-up in monetization that drove record revenue up nearly 2x sequentially. We added 857,000 new financial services products in the fourth quarter, up 56% from the number of third quarter adds. For the year, we added nearly 2.5 million new financial services products, more than double the $1.2 million we added in 2020. Through better monetization, we produced a 5x year-over-year increase in our fourth quarter total financial services revenue of $22 million as well as our full year revenue of $58 million. Product improvements that drove the year's phenomenal growth include the following; in SoFi Invest, we give members more selection and new features. We added 25 new cryptocurrencies, making SoFi a selection leader with 30 at year-end. We offered two regular way IPOs to retail investors in the fourth quarter. The first was Rivian, the largest IPO since Facebook in 2012. And the second is Nubank, a leading fintech company in Brazil. We introduced stop limit trade orders in the fourth quarter and margin trading earlier this year. At SoFi Money, we introduced two-day early paycheck, autosave, cashback and no-fee overdraft protection. And with our launch of SoFi Checking and Savings, we now offer members 1% APY, 33 times the national average, plus no account fees or minimum balance, plus many of the free features members already enjoy. Our SoFi Credit Card, which includes the only rewards platform that gives points for both transactions and smart financial behaviors, really took off in its first full year. Quarterly spend balances and accounts grew at high double-digit rates, and we finished 2021 with 91,000 products and a debut NPS score in the mid-50s. Finishing with our tech platform, Galileo benefit throughout 2021 from growth in enabled accounts, transactions per account and adoption of new products by existing partners, as well as the addition of diverse new partners. Fourth quarter segment revenues of $53 million was up 42% year-over-year, an acceleration versus the year-over-year growth in Q3 at 29%. And with the inclusion of a full year of Galileo results, 2021 revenue more than doubled to $195 million. Galileo added 11 million new end-user accounts in the quarter, a 67% year-over-year increase to $100 million at year-end, up from 60 million enabled accounts at the start of 2021. Galileo launched new clients and signed nine new ones in the fourth quarter, bringing total full year adds to 44. We also grew Galileo's total B2B client base by 40% in 2021. We launched Toast last year and signed a T. Rowe Price in the fourth quarter to service its future emergency savings program. And H&R Block just chose Galileo to power its new mobile banking app, Spruce. We acquired Galileo to leverage an owned and operated platform to drive rapid innovation with the benefit of a great business that further diversified our revenue. Now as we announced last week, we're finding the same playbook by acquiring Technisys, a leading cloud-native multi-product core banking platform. Adding Technisys is the next step in vertically integrating SoFi's businesses to further accelerate the pace of innovation of our best-of-breed financial products. We expect Technisys to be a growth multiplier for both SoFi and Galileo, in addition to realizing its own enormous growth opportunities, which are further strengthened in partnership with Galileo. We are well on our way to building the AWS of fintech. Now let's talk about point number two, the success of SoFi's unique Financial Services Productivity Loop strategy. Critical to the FSPL is creating best-of-breed products that build trust and reliability with members, which increases the likelihood they choose SoFi for a second or third product. When they do, we benefit from increased LTV per member by generating more revenue at little to no incremental customer acquisition cost. As a result, our higher LTV allows us to invest in more differentiated products and services, which in turn drives more demand and higher LTVs. It's a true competitive advantage. The FSPL has had its biggest impact yet on 2021 results. The scale of our top of the funnel products is now large enough that at the same cross-buy rates, fourth quarter cross-buy volume more than triple the year-over-year to more than 380,000 products. And more than one-third of our new products were adopted by existing members in the quarter, contributing to the 17% decline in our customer acquisition costs in 2021. I mentioned that our total year-end members of 3.5 million exceeded our 2021 goal by 500,000. Our unique FSPL advantage not only helped us exceed this goal, we did so without notable associated marketing costs. Instead, these FSPL efficiencies allowed us to significantly exceed our member and product goals, yet still achieve our EBITDA targets. This brings me to my third key success factor for 2021, our ability to drive a dramatic increase in SoFi's unaided brand awareness, with the unmatched reach of SoFi Stadium nationally televised games, the success of our various integrated multimedia campaigns and the reality of the influencers we partner with. Here are a few remarkable stats. The 5 nationally televised regular season games at SoFi Stadium were seen by an average of more than 22 million households per total. This visibility helped increase SoFi's unaided brand awareness by nearly 70% in 2021 to a new record in the fourth quarter. And that was before an estimated 106 million people tuned in to watch the Rams win the Super Bowl at SoFi Stadium. Before turning it over to Chris to talk to the results, I wanted to share a few additional thoughts. In February, I celebrated my fourth anniversary as the CEO of SoFi. While I could not be more proud of all we've accomplished in such a short period of time, I am even more excited about what's ahead of us. We are just starting to reap the benefits from the enormous progress we have made on our strategic position, the breadth of our differentiated and diversified product suite, our tech platform that helps us serve the industry as we build the AWS of fintech, our balance sheet of $4.7 billion in equity value, the exponential growth for our brand awareness and, of course, most importantly, our team. With that, let me turn it over to Chris for a review of the financials for the quarter and the year. Thank you, John. So it was an extraordinary quarter for member and product growth, and it's the culmination of a lot of hard work that's going into the company over the last four years. Everything from the member home feed in the app to developing use of data to make recommendations to our members based on their information and other members' information in a personalized way, our reporting program, our rewards program and then, of course, just differentiating the products individually themselves, and then layered on top of all that is just the hard drive that we've made to increase unaided brand awareness. The financial services companies, our members need to trust us. We become a household brand name. And the ability to leverage the broad reach that we talked about in our prepared remarks of SoFi Stadium throughout October, November, December, really gave us a nice slip in unaided brand awareness which makes all of our marketing more efficient. The combination of that and the product differentiation that we've added as it relates to products like SoFi Money and SoFi Invest, which I talked during the quarter, really drove a really strong growth rate across both members and products but, importantly, at a decreasing customer acquisition cost. I'll let Chris talk to the specifics of the decline in customer acquisition cost on a per member and per product basis, but it was really the culmination of product, marketing, operations and just a really strong integrated campaign across traditional media, digital and social influencers. The additional thing I'd add to that, just for everyone's benefit, is if you go back to 2018 and track interest rates throughout that year, then into 2019 and 2020, we've sort of navigated an environment of rates going up meaningfully. I think at one point in 2018, we're expecting four to five rate increases. In 2019, we are geared up for that. We spent the whole year really putting in place the right marketing channels, the right distribution channels for our loans from a whole loan standpoint and ADS standpoint, in addition to our funding costs and our pricing capabilities prepared for that. When we got into 2019, I think there was maybe one or two rate increases then the market completely switched, not unlike we started hearing about today, and we're able to pivot our business to go to those areas that benefited from a flat rate environment. And then again, during COVID, when rates went from -- I think Fed funds was at 1.5% rate to zero, we pivoted again. So we're not always going to be perfect. We'll make our mistakes, but having navigated through that bottle environment in the past gives us great sort of playbook to navigate in the future. Yeah. And for the benefit of others, Pagaya is a partnership that we entered in as it relates to people outside of the credit box that SoFi underwrites. We only improve about 30% of our personal loan applications because we're focused on prime borrowers, not near prime or sub-prime. When we first arrived here four years ago, we've built a strategy, which we call the decline monetization strategy, which was a way of taking applicants to SoFi and sending them to other underwriters. And we get a lead generation fee, and we do that through Lantern. We want to build on that success as a the contribution to our business and help satisfy even more people that are applying for loans. And our Pagaya partnership, think of it as a lending as a service. It's completely integrated with our application process. The credit and approval pricing models are run simultaneously. The loan is underwritten by Pagaya and a partner. We do not take the credit risk on that paper, but we do the servicing on that member and offer them other products and services. This was our first quarter where it contributed to the financial services revenue number because there is a referral revenue fee and a lending of the fee. Chris, I don't think if you want to talk about the loan volume, but it's not included, correct? Yes. It's still early days, and I would also just emphasize, it's not something we're just starting on now. It's really something that we start to emphasize throughout 2021, and we're starting to see the benefit of more and more each quarter. The numbers are small. They're increasing very nicely. The number of direct deposit accounts that we signed per week increased 50% from Q3 to Q4 and another 50% from Q4 into Q1 already. And we, obviously, just started to introduce the interest rate and the marketing. One of the things that I'd say about the direct deposit activity is that, once it does begin, you do see the pickup in spending, which Chris alluded to. So the increases we're seeing are steady and positive and to the right. But we're really just getting started. One of the things that may not be obvious from the outside looking in is that, when the Federal Reserve approved our bank license in January, we had to go through a whole product launch. We had to switch the technology. We had to switch the reporting. We had to change all the marketing collateral. We had to change all the relationships with affiliates. And that process is still ongoing. So it's not like you just flip a switch and, all of a sudden, all the things that was driving your business before can now drive this new product in a service called SoFi Checking. It really was sort of a close down SoFi Money and stand up SoFi Checking and Savings. And since we have over 1 million accounts as it relates to our Money product, which we disclosed, we had to do that process in a very coordinated fashion. I will give the team a ton of credit. It's been executing incredibly well, knock on wood, so far. But we went through a product rollout as if it was an entirely new product, launching it first to our existing members and then slowly rolling it out to new members. And we're just now actually switching over a lot of the marketing collateral with affiliates, et cetera. But in terms of the direct deposit initiative, it just didn't start in February. It started when we launched two day Early Paycheck. It started when we launched overdraft protection. It started when we launched AutoSave. And it's been a continuous process. So really strong growth in Q3 to Q4, 50% higher direct deposit adds per week in Q4 versus Q3. And right now, we're up another 50%. The numbers are small, but it's contributing as you see in the financial services revenue line. Yes. I think it's important to contextualize for everybody. The Galileo business is probably not that well understood in terms of how the business drives growth and what the growth opportunities are, so let me just frame that at a high level first. We're absolutely benefiting from the secular transition of physical payment to digital payments, and that's impacting the entire business, and that's a secular trend behind it, whether that's B2B payments or consumer payments or B2C activity. Here are the growth drivers. First is the growth of accounts of our existing partners. So that's the 100 million that we reported this quarter of enabled accounts. That continues to grow from existing partners. That 100 million accounts that are enabled, we can provide new products and services to that installed base of Galileo's partners. And we have a very robust pipeline to add new products and services through the existing accounts, things like secured debit, dynamic fraud protection and a number of other products that you'll see us introduce throughout the year. So the first driver is big growth in those accounts. The second driver on top of that is new products against those accounts. And then, of course, underlying all of that is just the increased activity within each one of those accounts. The second sort of bucket of driver is growth of new partners. Some of the new partners we announced there are a good example. H&R Block with the consumer app called Spruce is an example of a new partner, and we added 44 new partners, entirely new partners in 2021. The third growth driver is international. We have four of the largest neobanks as partners in Mexico. We're expanding into Colombia. And now on the back of the acquisition of Technisys, we can enter another 12 markets that they're already in and operating in. So international expansion is another bucket. And within that bucket are the first two buckets as well. And the last thing I'd say is that, we continue to diversify our relationships. The business was built on the back of B2C or consumer neobanks. But increasingly, we are much more attracted to enterprise businesses. And we'll have a competitive advantage in some of these cases. Enterprise businesses use commercial events, while SoFi also has a bank. So SoFi Bank could be the sponsor bank to commercial partners, enterprise partners and have a 10 to 12 basis points advantage, because we are the sponsor bank on top of the fact that we're also a payment processor. So we're really excited about the organic growth opportunities at Galileo. Without a doubt, some of the same-store customers will face stimulus tough comps, et cetera. And our goal is to overcome that through all these other growth drivers, and that's what we're focused on. Our outlook reflects it. So, we absolutely understand the headwind that may be there for some of the existing partners, but we have a bunch of other tailwinds to continue to drive strong growth there, not to mention the increased growth opportunities from the partnership with Technisys and vice versa. In terms of the performance of each of the products, I'm looking at the net adds across each of the products. And I would say, at a high level, it was a strong quarter across all the products. It would be hard to pick out one product and say it was not growing as fast as we'd like. These are all disclosed, and we'll see them in the 10-K. We had a really strong growth in the Money product and, on an absolute basis, on a relative basis, really strong in brokerage and in crypto as well as robo. I think of those products, the one I think we can differentiate a lot more, they all have opportunities. We're focused on fast selection, content and convenience as well as making the products work better together. But of those four that I just mentioned, robo is oldest of the four products and one the team is interested in differentiating more and we think there is a big opportunity there to do so. That doesn't mean we're not going to differentiate on brokerage and launch options, which is down the road or do other things on Money as it relates to high-yield savings, et cetera. There are still opportunities in every one of the products. That's the one we've probably invested the least in, that's still a big opportunity. I think about Credit Card and our At Work product and international. And I would tell you, Credit Card, I think, is a huge opportunity for us. The team has done a phenomenal job. I talked about the trends you've already achieved. But we've really just scratched the surface. We have one card. It's not segmented by different types of different types of members. You have spenders. You also have revolvers. There's a lot more personalization we could do with the Credit Card. And there's also an opportunity to make the Credit Card to work better with all the rest of our products. So, we're excited about the opportunity in financial services products. The trends are really strong in the fourth quarter. And it would be hard to pick out one or another underperforming, but I do think that what I characterize as some of the opportunities to take some of the products to the next level. Yeah. The Credit Card product is still a prime product with very high FICO score of over 700. We think there's a lot of opportunity to play in that segment with differentiation within it. Over time, we can explore different opportunities for a broader member base. But we sort of have all these cylinders going at the same time. And its can't the way that they just ask, are we doing enough, are we doing too much or we doing enough, are we doing too much? And I think we have the right balance as it relates to Credit Card. We want to build a high-quality card base. We want to drive strong engagement. And we want to make sure we have great product market fit before we step out of our comfort zone. So there's still a lot of room within the prime customer that we have and no reason to change. We can differentiate within that still. And in terms of CECL reserves, Dominick, you can see in our filing that we're running at about a 5.5% loss rate right now, which is relatively consistent with our personal loans business, so really healthy. Operator: Thank you, Dominick. We are currently at the top of the hour, so we do not have time for any additional questions. So I'll pass the conference back over to Anthony, for any closing remarks. Thank you. Thank you all for tuning in today. Before we wrap-up, I wanted to final thoughts. The road to this point at SoFi has had its share of unexpected twist and turns. And every single time, our team has shown the grit, the perseverance and cohesion to navigate through the fog of uncertainty, to achieve our goals and come out stronger. Now only have we managed to exceed our already ambitious goals, we've accomplished more in one year, than most companies achieve in their lifetime. As we've turned the page on 2021, 2022 has started off with an even more volatile environment with greater uncertainty. The fog of uncertainty excites me. It creates the greatest opportunities for those who dare to win. It's when leadership matters most because it's when the winners who will take the most are decided. I love our team. I love our strategy. I love our company. And I love where I work. I wake up every day trying to be a better leader than the day before and reminding myself that who dares wins. For the first time in four years, I also wake up every day, knowing the only thing between us and realizing our ambitions is us. I would take that setup any day of the week and twice on Sundays. Thank you for your time today. And we look forward to addressing you next quarter, when we report Q1 results."

I'm now going to hand over to Andrea Prochniak, VP of Investor Relations to begin. Andrea, please go ahead.\nAndrea Prochniak: Thank you, Jordan. And thank you all for joining us today for SoFi third quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Anthony Noto, SoFi CEO and Chris Lapointe, SoFi CFO. He will share prepared remarks regarding the quarters you know, and then take your questions at the end. Just after market closed today, we issued a press release announcing SoFi's third quarter, 2021 financial results. A discussion of our results today is complementary to the press release, which is available on the Investor Relations page of our website investors.SoFi.com. This conference call is being webcast live with accompanying slides on our IR page as well. And will be available as a replay for 30 days beginning about one hour after the conclusion of this call. During the course of this conference call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, forecasts, and projections as of today's date. Any forward-looking statements that we make are subject to various risks and uncertainties. And there are important factors that can cause actual outcomes to differ materially from those indicated in the statements.  We discuss these factors in our filings with the SEC including our upcoming Form 10-Q which can be found on the IR page of our website or the SEC filings website, sec. gov/edgar. As a reminder, we are not required to update our forward-looking statements. In our presentation today, unless otherwise noted, we will be discussing adjusted financial measures, which are non-GAAP measures that we believe are meaningful when evaluating the Company's performance. For detailed disclosures on these measures and the GAAP reconciliation, you should refer to the financial data contained within our press release, which is also posted on the IR page of our website. Well, today's discussion will focus primarily on the third quarter results. We encourage you to evaluate SoFi's performance on an annual basis as quarterly results can be affected by unexpected events that are outside our control. Now, I'll turn the call over to Anthony.\nAnthony Noto: Thank you, Andrea. And thank you all for joining us for our third quarter earnings conference call. The results we're reporting today demonstrate three things. First, our ability to continue to deliver record financial results, which is a testament to our diversified business mix and our ability to execute on our long-term strategy. Second, our commitment to consistently iterate and innovate to create products that are both best-in-breed on a standalone basis and work even better when used together. And third, our ability to leverage data and learnings to drive more effective marketing and brand building as we strive to make SoFi a trusted household brand name. Collectively, these things are driving strong continued growth in members, products, and cross-buy. Let's take these areas one-by-one. I've said many times that the benefit of our unique and diversified business model is that our three distinct business segments behave differently in varying economic and operating environment.  This allows us to shift focus and resources as conditions evolve, diversifying beyond our core student loan business into personal loans and home loans allowed us to weather the storm when the global pandemic cut industry-wide student loan origination volumes in half versus overnight in for the last 20 months. Building out a broad suite of financial service offerings has created exciting new opportunities for us to help people get their money right across online investing and spending via SoFi Invest, SoFi Money, and SoFi credit card.  And acquiring Galileo not only allows us to innovate faster on our products, but also positions us prominently among integrated tech platforms that service financial and non-financial institutions. Diversification across our platform has allowed us to achieve record financial results in the third quarter, even in a continuing volatile environment. Our third quarter adjusted net revenue of $277 million marks another record, beating both our previous record of $237 million for Q2 2021, and the high end of our quarterly guidance.  Even with the extension of the CARES Act, the lending segment adjusted net revenue, hit a record of $215 million driven primarily by record revenues from our personal loans business. Our technology platform segment contributed $50 million in the quarter, or 18% of total revenue, representing 29% year-over-year and 11% sequential growth. We achieved this despite difficult comparisons from last year's Stimulus benefits. And in our Financial Services segment, third quarter revenue of $12.6 million, nearly quadrupled from last year's $3.2 million drawn by meaningful contributions from five businesses: SoFi Invest, SoFi Money, Lantern by SoFi, Protect, and SoFi credit card. This broad-based revenue growth coupled with the benefits of cross-buying and our ongoing focus on realizing new operating efficiencies resulted in third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $10 million, our fifth consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA. Achieving record results allows us to invest in the new products and features necessary to position SoFi for long-term sustainable growth, we're sticking to our commitment to reinvest $0.70 of every incremental revenue dollar and drop $0.30 to the bottom line, as we scale our business.  Here's some new product improvements and features from the quarter that are already making an impact in lending. We launched a next-generation underwriting model in student loan refinancing that drove an increase in approval rates within our risk parameters. And personal loans, we launched a new partnership with Pagaya to capture revenue opportunities from loan applicants, we may not otherwise lend to. This allows us to serve a broader audience without additional credit risk and while maintaining our stringent approval guidelines.  In home loans, we made additional investments in marketing and fulfillment capabilities to better capture purchase volumes. In financial services, we launched after hours quotes in SoFi Invest and introduced 7 new crypto coins, bringing our total to 28. That's up from 5 at the beginning of the year. We also earned recognition for our growing Robo-Advisory business from berries (ph), which just named SoFi, the best Robo-Advisory for 2021. And in credit card, we launched in-app balance transfers and implemented soft poll pre -approvals which reduces credit score impact on the 9 applicants. At Galileo, our significant investment to build a new cloud-based, modern card issuing and payment platform is resonating with both existing and prospective clients. Having the best offering is not enough. We need to market our products and the SoFi brand in ways that engage members in order to make SoFi a trusted household brand name. Our reiteration on marketing efforts over the last 4 years is significantly improving the effectiveness of our brand-building efforts. The third quarter was a game changer for SoFi's visibility and reach and the impact on our growth. Here are just a few examples of our success. In September, we launched our new SoFi, Money Moves brand campaign during the U.S. open tennis tournament in the start of the NFL regular season. Leveraging television, social and digital influencers, along with TV commercials that aired during the nationally televised games from SoFi Stadium. The impact has been immediate and dramatic. SoFi TV sports drove more than 500 million impressions during the biggest moments and fall sports, and our unaided brand awareness doubled to a new high during the launch week. By working with some of the biggest digital influencers across social media, we've driven an additional 400 million impressions and 775 thousand engagements with SoFi content.  Our hashtags, SoFi Money Moves campaign on TikTok, has driven more than 8 billion views and more than 1 million uses of our branded hashtag so far. The reopening of SoFi stadium to sold-out crowds, with great media coverage across the full array of sports and entertainment events, has validated our decision to invest in naming this iconic destination for sports and live entertainment. Nationally televised NFL games from SoFi Stadium, this season, have averaged 20 million TV viewers per game. That compares with the 15 million total TV viewers we previously reached in an entire year between all of our SoFi sports sponsorships. As a result, when our TV ads run during SoFi stadium NFL games, we consistently see a significant uptake in brand awareness, member and product growth, and SoFi app downloads. We're also getting better at leveraging our highly engaged member base to drive product adoption via cross-buy. Let me share three examples from the quarter. First, by iterating on referrals, continue to scale our top of the funnel products, leveraging in-app communication, and expanding our popular SoFi personal loans, money bonds to a 100% of our members. We drove a 65% sequential increase in cross-buy volume amongst SoFi Money members. Second, we had 8 new ways to earn points to our unique SoFi rewards program. The only program that allows members to earn points for both transactions and responsible financial behaviors bringing our total earn and redeem options across the SoFi platform to 33. SoFi rewards through 15% of the quarter's new product growth. And third, we launched promotions around our new refer in the app and SoFi Money referral programs, which drove 18% of member growth in the quarter and significantly increased our app downloads and our rank in app stores. Our product enhancements plus more effective marketing were instrumental in driving member, product, and cross-buy growth.  The third quarter was our second highest ever for both member and product growth, total members grew 96% year-over-year to 2.9 million. We added 377,000 new members, which is an amazing 35% increase versus the 279,000 new members we added in the Second Quarter. Total products grew 108% year-over-year to nearly $4.3 million. We added 600 thousand new products, which is a 24% increase versus the 483 thousand new products in the second quarter. The scale we are achieving in money -- Invest in Credit Card, which are at the top of our product funnel, is having a dramatic impact on cross-buy volumes. The third quarter was a record for cross-buy products with SoFi Money, SoFi Invest, and SoFi credit card first members accounting for 73% of total cross-buying, demonstrating that as the top of our final scale increases, so will cross-buying and the benefits of our financial services productivity with strategy. As important when a bottom of the final loan is crossed bought, the lifetime value of the member doubles from already industry high levels to more than $1600 versus Just a loan-only member. Our momentum continues at Galileo as well. We signed 13 new clients, bringing our year-to-date total to 35 and finished the quarter enabling our clients to serve 89 million accounts, up 80% year-over-year.  Today, we are in our strongest position ever to fund and execute on our ambitious long-term growth strategy. The $1.2 billion we raised in a 0-coupon convertible debt offering, in October, brought our total capital rates over the past year to $3.6 billion and our total capital to $4.6 billion. And our pending application for a bank license represents a potential new source of funding and flexibility for us. I am proud of this impressive list of accomplishments for the quarter, especially in a continuing volatile economic and financial markets environment. As we head into the final weeks of 2021 and turn our focus to 2022, I am honored and humbled by all the SoFi team has been able to accomplish this year, and I'm thrilled for our next chapter in 2022. Now, I'll turn it over to Chris for a discussion of the quarter's financials.\nChris Lapointe: Thanks, Anthony. And good afternoon, everyone. We had a great quarter with strong growth trends across the entire business. We exceeded our financial outlook while achieving record revenue in our 5th consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA, despite facing a number of headwinds in the quarter. Our results further validate the durability and long-term growth potential of the diverse and differentiated business model we've built. I'm going to walk you through some key financial highlights for the quarter and then share some color on our financial outlook. Unless otherwise stated, I'll be referring to adjusted results for the third quarter of 2021 versus third quarter of 2020. Our GAAP consolidated income statement and all reconciliations can be found in today's earnings release, and in our upcoming 10-Q filing. For the quarter, we delivered record adjusted net revenue of $277 million up nearly 20% from the prior sequential quarters record of $237 million and $22 million above the high end of our guidance of $245 million to $255 million. We also delivered $10 million of adjusted EBITDA, which came in $7 million higher than the high-end of our guidance of negative $7 million to positive $3 million. We continue to make great strides on an annual basis as well. We've generated $912 million of adjusted net revenue over the last 12 months, an 82% increase from the same prior year period. We also generated $37 million of positive EBITDA over the last 12 months, a significant $195 million improvement from our $157 million loss, in the same prior year period. Our incremental EBITDA margin for the last 12 months, we've  some 40%, but as we've discussed previously, we intend to reinvest 70% of incremental revenue back into the business on average, and deliver incremental margins of 30% to drive sustainable growth for years to come. Now on to the segment level performance. Our record lending segment adjusted net revenue of $215 million was driven by a 49% increase in funded volume to $3.4 billion in total. The largest contributor of the funded volume growth was our personal loans business, which grew a 167% or $1 billion year-over-year to $1.6 billion in originations for the quarter, a new high for us. Not only that, personal loans funded volume grew sequentially by 27% even as we stuck to our stringent credit standards finishing the quarter at a 105% above Q4 2019 pre -pandemic origination levels, a true fee.  This growth was driven by our ability to capture increased demand from borrowers, booking to remodel homes, and refinance on a variable rate debt into attractive fixed rate products as interest rates increase. In addition, increased net interest margins and strong gain on sale margins drove material year-over-year growth in net interest income and loan sales revenue. Strong growth in originations and record lending revenue are a testament to the success we've had in diversifying our lending segment beyond student loan refinancing which remained at 50% of pre -cares levels and in our ability to navigate the evolving credit and interest rate environment.  The lending business delivered a $118 million of contribution profit, and a 55% margin up from a $103 million a year ago. Shifting to our tech platform, where we delivered net revenue of $50 million in the quarter, up 29% year-over-year versus a tough comparison driven by stimulus benefits in the same prior year period. Overall, growth was driven by 80% year-over-year Galileo account growth to $89 million in total and contribution profit of $16 million represented a 31% margin. As discussed previously, we are committed to investing in the platform to ensure that Galileo is well-positioned to capitalize on the secular shift from physical to digital payments and the rising overall demand for more FinTech services. Accordingly, margins are down from 61% a year ago due to our significant 2021 investment in technology capabilities overall, our migration from on-premise to the cloud, as well as the ongoing investments in new products and geographies. It's worth noting as well that Q3 2020 included the 100% margin contribution of our equity method investment in Apex which we called earlier this year. We will continue operating our tech platform business from a 20% to 30% contribution margin-range, for the foreseeable future, to set the stage for compounding long-term growth. Onto our financial services segment, which continues to benefit from strong product growth across our broad and diversified suite of offerings. This segment delivered revenue of $12.6 million, nearly 4 times the prior year quarter at $3.2 million. The sequential decline from $17 million of revenue in Q2 of 2021 reflects the absence of episodic revenues, recognized that quarter from our Advisory and IPO underwriting services totaling about $4.5 million. Excluding these Q2 specific items, revenues were essentially flat. Within the segment, year-over-year revenue growth was particularly strong in SoFi Invest, Lantern, credit card, SoFi Money and Protect. Exponential growth in products which grew 2.8x to $3.2 million from $1.2 million in Q3 of 2020 drove our strong performance. Every one of our Financial Services products grew by triple digits year-over-year. We had 1.2 million products in SoFi Money, 1.2 million in SoFi Invest, and 750,000 in Relay and continue to see good momentum in credit cards. While we're starting to see a more meaningful contribution to consolidated revenue from this segment will remain in investment mode, focused on creating the right unit economics for each business to drive long-term sustainable growth. You can see this investment reflected in our Q3 financial services contribution losses of $39 million, which were up $2 million from a loss of $37 million a year ago. Excluding acquisition marketing, contribution profit improved by $2 million. The next thing I want to address is our balance sheet. Overall, we're very well-capitalized. Over the last year, we have raised $3.6 billion of capital, $2.4 billion of which came through a combined private-placement led by T. Rowe Price of , in our IPO, and $1.2 billion of which came through a 0% convertible debt offering that closed in October. The strength of our Balance Sheet has provided us with significant flexibility and helped lower our overall cost of capital, resulting in strong net interest income in the last two quarters. Our current book value is $4.6 billion, and our capital and leverage ratios are extremely strong. In addition, we still have access to nearly $6 billion of warehouse capacity to help fund the operations and growth of our lending segment. We are excited about the strength of our Balance Sheet and we'll continue to make choices that ensure the most efficient cost and use of capital. All right. I'll finish up with guidance, over the last several quarters, we have demonstrated the benefits of our uniquely diversified business model by delivering strong financial and operating growth. For Q4, we expect an acceleration in growth with $272 to $282 million of adjusted net revenue, up 49% to 55% year-over-year, and $2 to $5 million of adjusted EBITDA as we continue to invest to drive growth. We now expect to deliver $1.002 to $1.012 billion in adjusted net revenue, exceeding our original 2021 full-year guidance of $980 million and adjusted EBITDA of $28 to $31 million above our original full-year guidance of $27 million.  This is despite facing previously discussed headwinds estimated to be $52 million of negative impact from the CARES Act extension on our SLR volumes and our prior equity investment in Apex being called earlier this year, which we mentioned during our Q2 earnings call. Switching to non-cash items below our adjusted EBITDA. We announced last week that we will be redeeming the $28 million SoFi Technologies, Public and Private Warrants that were issued as part of our IPO process. Warrant holders have the option to exercise on a cash or cashless basis up until December 6.  Q4 share issuance associated with these exercises will be in the range of $10 million to $28 million shares depending on exercise methodology. And the Q4 non-cash P&L impact will be determined based on the change in fair market value of the warrant as of the redemption date relative to the end of Q3 2021. Finally, we forecast stock-based compensation expense to be $80 to $85 million in Q4. Overall, we're thrilled with our performance in Q3, where we delivered more than $1 billion of annualized revenue, and our 5th consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA. We continue to make great progress and remain very well-capitalized to continue pursuing our longer-term objective of ultimately becoming a top financial institution. With that, let's begin the Q&A.\nOperator: As a reminder, if you'd like to register a question . If you change your mind,  and please ensure you're unmuted when speaking. Our first question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy, the line is yours.\nBetsy Graseck: Hey, thanks so much. Good evening, everyone. Can you hear me, okay?\nChris Lapointe: Okay.\nAnthony Noto: Yes.\nBetsy Graseck: All right. Great. Yes. I had 2 questions to kick off here. One was just understanding in financial services, the -- how you see the impact of the new coins that you launched this quarter. And if you could update us on how you're thinking about additional coins from here. And really the underlying question is, you were flat Q2, ex on -- the one time as you called out. So, help us understand how you're thinking about the trajectory in that line as we move forward? And am I right in thinking that Coins might be part of it, or would you direct focus elsewhere? Thanks.\nAnthony Noto: Yes, I'll answer the question from a consumer value  standpoint, and then Chris can -- I'll get into the numbers in more detail. We endeavor to differentiate our products on 4 macro things, fast, selection, content, and convenience. And then we want each of our products to work better, when our members use it with another product. As it relates to selection, we're the only invest product that has single-stocks, fractional shares, 6 of our own ETFs uniquely built for our members, Robo-Advisory accounts, as well as cryptocurrency. And then within each one of those, we're trying to add more and more selection as well in addition to driving horizontal selection. And so, you're right, we added a number of core earnings in the quarter. Actually, throughout the year we started with 5 points, we're now up to over 25 points, and we'll continue to look for opportunities to add selection generally both within cryptocurrency and outside cryptocurrency.  And we hear for our members every day what they want, and we want to give them the opportunity to buy what they would like, but to do it in a responsible, diversified way, so educating them on the risks of cryptocurrency, and also dollar cost averaging, and setting up recurring investing and capabilities. We're really encouraged by the trends we're seeing in our investments overall. We had really strong growth in both new members, and invest, and have really strong growth in AUM. And I'll turn it over to Chris to talk about the differences between Q2 and Q3, as well as how we see the momentum going into Q4, which is quite strong for investor overall.\nChris Lapointe: Yes. Hey Betsy. In terms of Q2 versus Q3 and crypto revenues specifically, we don't disclose that in our filings, but you'll see it in our 10-Q that gets filed in a few days that we do disclose brokerage revenue, and that was down by about $2.7 million sequentially, as a result of lower trading activity. However, the headwind that I just mentioned and the decline in brokerage revenue were offset by sequential strong growth in our SoFi Money Lantern, and credit card businesses, which allowed us to generate that flat revenue that you talked about quarter-over-quarter when excluding those  revenue.  And this speaks to the benefits of the diversification within Financial Services. And then in terms of, as we think about the fourth quarter and our guidance, we are guiding for an acceleration of year-over-year basis to 49% to 55% year-over-year growth, which is faster than what we had in Q3 on a year-over-year basis. When you think about sequential growth, the vast majority of that sequential growth will come from tech platform and in a similar faster as it was in Q3, as well as financial services, which would be material faster sequentially. Into Q4, we're seeing really positive trends in both those businesses and really benefiting from the initiatives in Q3 flowing into Q4 from a revenue standpoint.\nBetsy Graseck: Got it. Thanks. And then separate question is on the question around the bank charter, and I know you have that application outstanding. The question has to do with the recent OCC acting heads speech where they indicated that there might be a need for holding Company level regulation from institutions that are seeking a charter outside of the regular bank channels. And I'm wondering if you saw that speech, and if you have any thoughts or comments as to whether or not that would change your plans as to how you're thinking about moving forward with the potential for a bank like structure and part of your business?\nAnthony Noto: Yes, I was very relieved by that speech. We're watching it very closely. Some people may not realize this, but we applied for the exact license that our current acting head Michael Su (ph) mentioned. We applied for a bank holding Company, national bank charter, which would be regulated by the Federal Reserve as a bank holding Company and will be regulated by the OCC as a bank. Both of those will be our two primary regulators in addition to the FDIC. So, we're really fortunate in that we've built the business for durable long-term growth. Taking a harder path, our lending business originally is built on the back of licenses in 50 states; our home loan business -- and these are our licenses, not borrowed licenses, not rented licenses. Same thing with our home loan business. And in cryptocurrency, we have money transmitter licenses. So, we've taken a harder right approach over the easier, but I think long opposed, people same time including applying for a national bank charter instead of applying for an ILC, or applying for a FinTech Charter, or applying for a crypto charter.  We applied for the full Monte exactly what the acting head indicated everyone should be applying for if they're taking deposits or taking cash. We're really encouraged by the progress we've made with our regulators in the exam process since March, the feedback has been constructive. The timeline is not specific, and there are more steps beyond just the exam, but we're encouraged by the constructive feedback we've gotten and working with them as real partners. So, we look forward to finishing this last mile on -- and reaching that milestone for the Company that we think will be a huge competitive advantage, especially in light of the comments last week.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. Thanks so much, Anthony. Appreciate that.\nAnthony Noto: You're welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. Moshe the line is yours.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the underwriting process of the changes that have allowed you to expand originations, I think there's a little bit of a discussion with that in the student part. And then also some additional context on the relationship with Pagaya and what that could do for SoFi.\nAnthony Noto: Yeah. I want to be super clear on our lending business. We have not changed our credit model, we haven't changed our target focus, our average fico scores are high quality prime, fico scores that are still well into the 700s. What we're doing is we're constantly testing all the different variables and they're indication of where we end up on loan size, on pricing, and let alone losses, and delinquencies. So, it just continued iteration to make sure that we're being efficient on both the credit spectrum, as well as the pricing spectrum. And we develop new-generation models that are based on data and analysis. But we haven't changed our philosophy or approach to -- of the credit that we're willing to underwrite. Is there anything to that? Okay, is there a second part to your question? I think was tied to Pagaya?\nChris Lapointe: Yeah, Pagaya -- yeah, Pagaya.\nAnthony Noto: Yes. Sorry, I apologize. So Pagaya is the extension of a strategy we started 2 years ago. We're able to meet about 30% of the demand that we get for our unsecured personal loans, what we call PL, and what we found was that we're obviously investing in our brand -- investing in brand-building. And if we're only meeting 30% of our demand, how could we capture more value beyond that, if we don't want to change our approach to credit. And we built a property called Lantern credit by SoFi, which is a  in property.  Our first step was to take some of the people that we would not otherwise lend to and send them to our Lantern partners and generate lead revenue from that. The guidance and extension of that  and we're integrating their credit model into our decision engine, along with the SoFi credit model, and so we're running both simultaneously. Pagaya allows us to serve -- the partnership allows us to serve a broader set of people than we otherwise fund. But we're not taking the credit risk. We're not changing our credit profile.  And Pagaya and our other partners are taking that paper, underwriting it, pricing it, and then taking out the credit risk, and we maintain the servicing and the relationship with that member so we can continue to offer them other products and services, and quite frankly, improve their credit and be able to serve them well and help them get their money right. It was de minimis in the quarter, but it's a bigger opportunity for us to add additional high-margin revenue against all the investments that we're making. So, it's part of a broader strategy.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Got it. Thanks. That's extremely helpful. And maybe if you could just talk a little bit about your expectations on marketing costs and how you see them trending as you go forward. You talked -- I think Chris talked about the re-investments to drive future growth. And what are you actually seeing and how will that be reflected over the next several quarters?\nAnthony Noto: We saw a real game changer in our marketing as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the elements that we've worked hard to build over the last couple of years, multilayered marketing, television, the stadium, our direct mail marketing, our digital marketing, social influencer marketing, it's all coming together to drive really strong performance. We're achieving our long-term customer acquisition costs by product, which is allowing us to drive the level of scale that we're driving sequentially. And we're seeing good -- good efficiencies there. Each one of our businesses and their -- and their leads are really challenged to build over the long term at best of the product based on the differentiators I mentioned, and best of breed unit economics.  And those unit economics are tied to very specific targets across each of the cost line items, as well as their customer acquisition costs. They're all operating like a long-term customer acquisition cost, and we're still operating in that range, which is what's really helping us drive the scale that you see. Cross-buying was a record for the quarter, one of the things that may not be obvious to everyone when we say 73% of the cross-buying was driven by money investing credit card first members, is that we're not paying that second customer acquisition costs. So, we hit 2.9 million members in the quarter when we went through the public process and do a presentation in January of this year 2021. We had a year-end target of 3 million members. Well, we ended the quarter at 2.9 and we're over 3 million now, as you would imagine, and we're seeing good strong trends there. If you think about our total cost-per-member, which went down sequentially, we should have significantly even greater marketing costs but we're driving the member growth through lower-cost vehicles like referrals and other programs that are unique to SoFi. It's allowing us to achieve out-sized growth in members relative to expectations, but still delivering on profitability.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Thank you very much.\nAnthony Noto: You're welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dominick Gabriele of Oppenheimer. Dominick, please go ahead.\nDominick Gabriele: Great and great results. If you think about the launch, I believe this quarter of SoFi financial planning. Could you just walk through some of the dynamics that you're looking to gather among your customer base with launching that product in particular then I still have a follow up. Thanks.\nAnthony Noto: Sure. I think what you're referring to is our partnership with FPA. It's not a new program, it's an extension of what we call SoFi at Work. SoFi At Work is our approach to enterprises, to companies, where we offer them a suite of products and services and a portal for their employees to take advantage of unique offers from SoFi that are driven for us through their employee communications.\nChris Lapointe: The FPA is an association that has a significant number of financial planners. The program that we brought to them has the ability to get those same benefits for their customers and it's a new distribution relationship for the At Work program, which contributes to all of our products and also has revenue stream itself from a proceed basis. And so, it's not a building of financial planning at SoFi, it's really a new relationship with the FPA. One thing that we do provide for our members that is direct is we do provide free certified financial planners already. In addition to that, we also have the Relay product which gives us a significant amount of information from all their other financial products so we can better personalize offers to them.\nAnthony Noto: Often is the case that we'll see that someone through Relay has a number of credit cards that are fully utilized and we can offer that person based on what we see a lower-cost term loan through our personal loan business, or we could see someone with a lot of excess cash in their SoFi Money account, and we could offer that person a free certified financial planner session to help them invest that money and have it compounding over years. We can also see someone that can be paying a personal loan and that personal loan could have -- could still be a federal loan and one that we could refinance at a lower cost. So, we're in the business of financial planning every day helping our members answer 3 questions: what must they do that day in their financial life? What should they deal? What can they do? But it's more of a holistic experience that SoFi, as opposed to one particular thing.\nDominick Gabriele: Great. And then --\nAnthony Noto: So, you going to follow up as well?\nDominick Gabriele: Yeah. I mean, if you -- thank you. If you -- we talked about the technology segment margin being in the range of, I believe, 20 to 30. It obviously came in above that range this quarter. Maybe you could talk about the cadence of how that margin reacts over the next number of quarters. And then how your progress is overall and moving your client on the cloud, be great. Thank you very much.\nAnthony Noto: We're really happy with the addition of Galileo to the Company 18 months ago. The team has done a phenomenal job of upgrading the On-Prem technology capabilities, as well as completing the craft cloud build-out. We're currently on-board with all new partners into the cloud directly and we're building a detailed plan of migrating existing customers into the cloud that will take place throughout all of 2022. In terms of the investments that we're making from here -- now that we have On-Prem upgraded and the cloud built up and it's really just about migration, we can reallocate our resources more offensively and launch new products and services. We did already launch a new disputes product, which the team re-engineered and reintroduced for our members. And that was a big heavy less than there will be a series of other products that unfold in 2022, that will drive incremental revenue against the existing 80 million accounts that we -- 89 million accounts that we enable not to mention allowing us to capture new partners way to 13 new partners in the quarter, that brings us to 35 for the year. They'll start contributing new accounts in 2022 as well. In terms of the investing, we are committed to staying in that 20% or 30% margin range. There could be a quarter where revenue comes in, and we can't spend enough, and the margin's a little bit higher, but there's no change in our desire to want to invest as much as we can in that business, but being prudent in that 20% to 30% margin range. We just think the growth opportunity here is so enormous, we don't want to under invest in it. We want to drive durable compounding growth over time on where we think that's the right level of investments to make, let's ensure that we're capturing it.\nDominick Gabriele: Thanks again.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Hecht of Jefferies. John, please go ahead.\nJohn Hecht: Afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First was the general yield relative to originations in the lending segment was stronger this quarter than prior quarters. And I'm wondering, is that gain on sale execution or is there other fee accruals that we should be aware of, and then also maybe the mix of whole loan sales to other financial services companies versus the sales and securitizations and how the execution worked out there.\nChris Lapointe: Yeah, sure. Hey, John, this is Chris. In terms of what drove some of the growth there, we saw good sequential and year-over-year growth both in NIM revenue as well as loan sales and originations, which was driven by our overall gain on-sale margins. So, you'll see this in the 10-Q that gets filed in a few days. But again, on-sale margins remained very healthy in our business and improved in both personal loans and home loans. In personal loans, again, on-sale margin was 4.5% in the quarter. That's up from 4.2% last quarter. Student loan refinancing remained at very healthy level at 4%, and our Home Loans business was at 3.1% in the quarter, up from 2.7% last quarter.  In addition to that, the things driving the strong NIM margin was overall reduced cost of capital as we deployed some of our -- our IPO proceeds towards paying down warehouse debt in the quarter, and that helped drive some of that yield. And then, in terms of the mix of whole Loans and securitizations, it was in line with what we've seen historically. It's about 50% in each of personal loans and student loan refinancing, 50-50 split.\nJohn Hecht: Okay. And then you -- really strong quarter of customer acquisition. And I know you guys talked about different marketing channels in particularly in the SoFi Money product. I'm wondering, is there been a change given the kind of increase in personal loans versus student loans and if not in the inbound entry products. And does that mean anything in terms of the unit level economics in the future?\nChris Lapointe: Yeah. We've definitely seen efficiencies in the personal loan on the marketing line from cross-buy. We've had real strong cross-buying from both PL and SLR. We've shared some of those rates with you during the IPO process, and they've continued to be strong in that range. Home Loans has always been very high in the 60% to 70% range, and that's stayed consistent. The marketing efficiencies on PL have been the greatest.  the unit economics are very attractive and not paying that second customer acquisition cost results in more variable profit. But we're trying to reinvest all those benefits back into the business just because we know what the response is to the spend.  It's a good return but return takes place over time on the financial services products and the loans that pays back right away. And we just want to make sure that we're capturing the growth in front of us versus driving to really high margins and not capturing opportunity in front of us. On the entry points, the way to think about the top of the funnels is money is at the very top of the funnel, is a big driver of cross-buying a Money First member. In fact, I think I've said in the prepared remarks, it was able to drive 65% of the cross-buying in the quarter, just given how much more data we have and the activity on a day-to-day basis from that product. And invest contributes also benefits and credit card contributes. The other product that we have that doesn't drive revenue directly is Relay, and it would add another 10% to the contribution of cross-buy to money invest credit card, so instead of 73% of our cross-buy driven by money invest credit card. First members, it would be closer to 85% if we added in added in Relay.  So, there's a lot of different levers driving it. And we're seeing the benefits, but we're spending it back to maximize member and product growth. And then that will lead to revenue in the future because it takes a while for those member and products that come on that are outside our loans, to build up balances or AUM or start to spend on their credit card before it hits the revenue line. And we do think we're going to have strong momentum going into Q4 versus Q3 in the financial services line, as I mentioned.\nJohn Hecht: Appreciate that call, thanks.\nAnthony Noto: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Dolev of Mizuho. Dan, please go ahead.\nDan Dolev : Hi, Anthony, hi, Chris. Great results and great quarter, amazing. So just had a question on the personal loans and maybe on the partnership with Pagaya? How much of the competitive advantages, it sounds -- it looks like the results are -- are really strong. Like what is -- how much of a competitive advantage for SoFi to have that relationship, and what is still unique about it? Because I've been hearing more and more about it, and then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nAnthony Noto: They're a great Company. They have strong technology; they have great partnerships that allow them to drive their lending business. We attempted over the last 4 years. I think Michelle will tell you we've probably attempted 2 other times of integrating a partner so that their credit model would run simultaneously with ours in our decision engine, and we never got to the point that it was working really well. Now, is it working well with Pagaya for my technical standpoint, but the team is now iterating and learning how to improve the conversion from the offer down through all the way to funding. So, it's a really unique opportunity. As I mentioned, we're capturing 30% of demand that comes in for our personal, which means we're missing 70% of it. This type of relationship, on top of what we're doing with Lantern, allows to capture that. But the thing I really love about this relationship is now we're recapturing economically on day 1, but we're also capturing that member as part of the SoFi family, and we can help them get their money right with other products like investing and SoFi Money, SoFi credit card down the road, SoFi Relay, Protect and our other lending products as well. It's a really important economic relationship. It does take a unique technology to make it happen. And we found the right technology partner and lending partner. But it also has a longer-term benefit beyond what we'll report in any one quarter.\nDan Dolev : Yes. Totally cool, very strong. And then I have a quick follow-up, Anthony and Chris. I'm looking at the product per member and it's looking really strong and it's improving sequentially, really nicely. Where are we headed? I mean, this seems to be the dream come true of the 1Money app, and you're moving towards that really quickly. What can you share about those metrics, which looks really strong this quarter? Thank you.\nChris Lapointe: Yes. We are growing really fast, so we're growing the numerator and the denominator, and both in terms of members and products per member, and so it can mask some of the cohort trends. But\nAnthony Noto: generally, what we're seeing is our strategy playing out and older cohorts having more products per member than newer cohorts. And you see the weighted average math by just dividing product by member. So I think we have a really good understanding of the types of information that we can use to come up with personalized recommendations for our members, and serving them in our member home feed, which is driving additional product adoption, referrals are -- are very unique product that allows us to build trust and reliability with one member, and then they refer that to their friends and their family, and we get other members that looks like them seeing demographically, so that's really working. Our rewards program, as I mentioned, this contributor as well, we have words program that really will be hard for others to match, because they'll either not have all the products or they won't have the technology.  We built a technology platform that allows our product managers and general managers to trigger rewards off with any activity they want. And we redeemed into all of our products, regardless of where it's triggered. So, people get 1% back if they just use the credit card and just redeem into credit card, they redeem it to investor, they redeem to buy cryptocurrency or to buy single-stocks, or Robo, more ETFs or they redeem into money where they pay down loans with those rewards, we double the points. But we target list points not just off the credit cards, right now we're churning off of recurring investments, of\nChris Lapointe: of direct deposit, off of bill pay, how often is the app, et c. That's starting to have an impact. And so, each one of these product enhancements that leverage our unique strategy, we're contributing to that product growth. And that's why you see the relationship of 600,000 new products to 377,000 new members. It's hard to drive both so fast, and we're at the point now where we have the data, the logic, and the approach to doing it. And we were looking forward to seeing it to the next level in '22.\nSean Horgan: Amazing results. Congrats again.\nAnthony Noto: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sean Horgan of Rosenblatt Securities. Sean, please go ahead.\nSean Horgan: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So, I wanted to just dig in on the cross-buy rates. I appreciate the additional disclosure you gave. I think you said cross-buy for SoFi Money first members increased 65% sequentially. Can you expand on the products that comprises this cross-buy volumes? In other words, what's the typical second product for the average SoFi Money first member?\nAnthony Noto: I would say, it's not getting into that level of detail and I don't want to not answer your question. It's just, we're not trying to actually guide people to where we benefit but trying to serve them relative to what the opportunity is to get their money right. So, we're in different, what the first or second product is this. Someone comes in through a student loan refinancing and then takes out a personal loan, we save the 100 hours of customer existing costs and we're super happy. If they come in through SoFi Money and go into Invest we're equally as happy.  And so, we're trying to build each product by itself to be best-of-breed across the value profit I mentioned earlier, as well as best of -- best-in-class and economics, so that we'll always remain indifferent. We want to use the data we have to make the right suggestions for them at the right moment in time, be there for all the major decisions they make in their lives, and everything in between. So, we look at that data, we understand the success of our ability to drive personalization, but we're not trying to drive some combination. We want to serve them when they need to process the  If we do that, and that's our job to be done, they'll keep coming back.  And we're measuring NPS scores as well as reactions to offers in their member home fee to make sure that we're meeting our satisfaction levels that -- well, there's satisfaction levels that -- where we should. It is very much the case that each product drives cross-buy to others, but it's different percentages. Generally, the more data we have for one product, the more cross-buying we can derive from it.\nSean Horgan: Yeah, that makes sense, I guess then. In a quarter where personal loans, for example, did really well. I guess the incremental growth overall is a fair assumption. Just switching gears to my follow-up. You provided some helpful metrics around your brand in influencer campaigns. For example, the 8 billion views on TikTok. Can you discuss how these metrics are translating to new users and what customer acquisition costs? And how has your allocation of marketing spent to these channels increased as a result of the recent data privacy changes weighing on customer acquisition costs grew more traditional performance marketing channels?\nAnthony Noto: I'll answer the last part of your question first. We really haven't seen an impact to our customer acquisition costs from the data privacy changes that you referenced for others and other people have seen. So, I would just say that upfront. I said earlier that our customer acquisition costs by-product are within the range of where we set them for long-term targets to make sure we get the right LTV: CAC relationship in the right long-term return. And so, the team has done a good job of being able to drive this growth by staying within those limits. One measure -- we report sales and marketing. About 60% of our sales and marketing is true customer acquisition cost marketing as opposed to fixed costs. But even if you just took our total sales and marketing and divide it by new members, you would see that that marketing cost per member went down sequentially, I think 8%, which just shows you the efficiency that we're growing really fast, we're spending a lot more dollars. It's very rare that we -- you have the dollar increase that we had in the quarter and that we've been driving that you actually drive efficiency. So, I talked about effectiveness in our prepared remarks and what it was driving across each element. We're also as efficiency that you can just see in the P&L if you do that math. So, we're really encouraged by the impact that our marketing has had and integration into the product experience. And we will continue to reinvest in those bands that I mentioned. Each product has its own, but that's one way for the street to look at what's the overall efficiency of our marketing to new member.  And revenue -- I want to reinforce this point again, revenue from loans comes Day 1, the revenue from the Financial Services products unfolds over time on a direct basis. It unfolds on an indirect basis over time as well. So, a new Money member that comes in, could drive revenue faster, by driving cross-buy into a loan, then it drives on its own during that quarter per se. But obviously when a Money member signs up, they then have to transfer money in, start a direct deposit, and  over time that's a 2 hours stock increase. In Invest, we have  to start investing. Typically, not sitting on $2 or $3 thousand. It takes a while for that to build up to that level on. But as it does, the revenue starts to come in and it starts to contribute.\nChris Lapointe: Same thing with credit card, they have to start spending and the momentum that we're seeing in the financial services line and that we're guiding to is a reflection of the growth over the last couple of quarters starting to kick in from a revenue standpoint. Sequentially, but obviously was up close to fourfold on a year-over-year basis. But I don't want anyone to miss the point that those financial services members that come into the top of the funnel, they can drive lending revenue Day 1, Day 2 right away. We don't have to wait for them to build up a balance or AUM.\nOperator: We have no further questions on the phone line, so we'll hand back to Anthony Noto, CEO.\nAnthony Noto: Thank you very much. I'd like to finish today's call with what I told our SoFi team at our all-hands meeting when Q3 ended. We've accomplished more at SoFi this year than many other companies will achieve in a lifetime. I'm incredibly proud of these accomplishments and the additional progress we made during the third quarter, which marks a yearlong sprint of incredible Company milestones. Now, the only thing that stands between where we are today and our long-term aspirations for SoFi is us. And I have absolutely no doubt that we have the right strategy, the right team with the right goals to deliver on these aspirations and more. Thanks for joining us today and we look forward to talking to you when we report fourth quarter results. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chris Lapointe",
            "content": "Thanks, Anthony. And good afternoon, everyone. We had a great quarter with strong growth trends across the entire business. We exceeded our financial outlook while achieving record revenue in our 5th consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA, despite facing a number of headwinds in the quarter. Our results further validate the durability and long-term growth potential of the diverse and differentiated business model we've built. I'm going to walk you through some key financial highlights for the quarter and then share some color on our financial outlook. Unless otherwise stated, I'll be referring to adjusted results for the third quarter of 2021 versus third quarter of 2020. Our GAAP consolidated income statement and all reconciliations can be found in today's earnings release, and in our upcoming 10-Q filing. For the quarter, we delivered record adjusted net revenue of $277 million up nearly 20% from the prior sequential quarters record of $237 million and $22 million above the high end of our guidance of $245 million to $255 million. We also delivered $10 million of adjusted EBITDA, which came in $7 million higher than the high-end of our guidance of negative $7 million to positive $3 million. We continue to make great strides on an annual basis as well. We've generated $912 million of adjusted net revenue over the last 12 months, an 82% increase from the same prior year period. We also generated $37 million of positive EBITDA over the last 12 months, a significant $195 million improvement from our $157 million loss, in the same prior year period. Our incremental EBITDA margin for the last 12 months, we've  some 40%, but as we've discussed previously, we intend to reinvest 70% of incremental revenue back into the business on average, and deliver incremental margins of 30% to drive sustainable growth for years to come. Now on to the segment level performance. Our record lending segment adjusted net revenue of $215 million was driven by a 49% increase in funded volume to $3.4 billion in total. The largest contributor of the funded volume growth was our personal loans business, which grew a 167% or $1 billion year-over-year to $1.6 billion in originations for the quarter, a new high for us. Not only that, personal loans funded volume grew sequentially by 27% even as we stuck to our stringent credit standards finishing the quarter at a 105% above Q4 2019 pre -pandemic origination levels, a true fee.  This growth was driven by our ability to capture increased demand from borrowers, booking to remodel homes, and refinance on a variable rate debt into attractive fixed rate products as interest rates increase. In addition, increased net interest margins and strong gain on sale margins drove material year-over-year growth in net interest income and loan sales revenue. Strong growth in originations and record lending revenue are a testament to the success we've had in diversifying our lending segment beyond student loan refinancing which remained at 50% of pre -cares levels and in our ability to navigate the evolving credit and interest rate environment.  The lending business delivered a $118 million of contribution profit, and a 55% margin up from a $103 million a year ago. Shifting to our tech platform, where we delivered net revenue of $50 million in the quarter, up 29% year-over-year versus a tough comparison driven by stimulus benefits in the same prior year period. Overall, growth was driven by 80% year-over-year Galileo account growth to $89 million in total and contribution profit of $16 million represented a 31% margin. As discussed previously, we are committed to investing in the platform to ensure that Galileo is well-positioned to capitalize on the secular shift from physical to digital payments and the rising overall demand for more FinTech services. Accordingly, margins are down from 61% a year ago due to our significant 2021 investment in technology capabilities overall, our migration from on-premise to the cloud, as well as the ongoing investments in new products and geographies. It's worth noting as well that Q3 2020 included the 100% margin contribution of our equity method investment in Apex which we called earlier this year. We will continue operating our tech platform business from a 20% to 30% contribution margin-range, for the foreseeable future, to set the stage for compounding long-term growth. Onto our financial services segment, which continues to benefit from strong product growth across our broad and diversified suite of offerings. This segment delivered revenue of $12.6 million, nearly 4 times the prior year quarter at $3.2 million. The sequential decline from $17 million of revenue in Q2 of 2021 reflects the absence of episodic revenues, recognized that quarter from our Advisory and IPO underwriting services totaling about $4.5 million. Excluding these Q2 specific items, revenues were essentially flat. Within the segment, year-over-year revenue growth was particularly strong in SoFi Invest, Lantern, credit card, SoFi Money and Protect. Exponential growth in products which grew 2.8x to $3.2 million from $1.2 million in Q3 of 2020 drove our strong performance. Every one of our Financial Services products grew by triple digits year-over-year. We had 1.2 million products in SoFi Money, 1.2 million in SoFi Invest, and 750,000 in Relay and continue to see good momentum in credit cards. While we're starting to see a more meaningful contribution to consolidated revenue from this segment will remain in investment mode, focused on creating the right unit economics for each business to drive long-term sustainable growth. You can see this investment reflected in our Q3 financial services contribution losses of $39 million, which were up $2 million from a loss of $37 million a year ago. Excluding acquisition marketing, contribution profit improved by $2 million. The next thing I want to address is our balance sheet. Overall, we're very well-capitalized. Over the last year, we have raised $3.6 billion of capital, $2.4 billion of which came through a combined private-placement led by T. Rowe Price of , in our IPO, and $1.2 billion of which came through a 0% convertible debt offering that closed in October. The strength of our Balance Sheet has provided us with significant flexibility and helped lower our overall cost of capital, resulting in strong net interest income in the last two quarters. Our current book value is $4.6 billion, and our capital and leverage ratios are extremely strong. In addition, we still have access to nearly $6 billion of warehouse capacity to help fund the operations and growth of our lending segment. We are excited about the strength of our Balance Sheet and we'll continue to make choices that ensure the most efficient cost and use of capital. All right. I'll finish up with guidance, over the last several quarters, we have demonstrated the benefits of our uniquely diversified business model by delivering strong financial and operating growth. For Q4, we expect an acceleration in growth with $272 to $282 million of adjusted net revenue, up 49% to 55% year-over-year, and $2 to $5 million of adjusted EBITDA as we continue to invest to drive growth. We now expect to deliver $1.002 to $1.012 billion in adjusted net revenue, exceeding our original 2021 full-year guidance of $980 million and adjusted EBITDA of $28 to $31 million above our original full-year guidance of $27 million.  This is despite facing previously discussed headwinds estimated to be $52 million of negative impact from the CARES Act extension on our SLR volumes and our prior equity investment in Apex being called earlier this year, which we mentioned during our Q2 earnings call. Switching to non-cash items below our adjusted EBITDA. We announced last week that we will be redeeming the $28 million SoFi Technologies, Public and Private Warrants that were issued as part of our IPO process. Warrant holders have the option to exercise on a cash or cashless basis up until December 6.  Q4 share issuance associated with these exercises will be in the range of $10 million to $28 million shares depending on exercise methodology. And the Q4 non-cash P&L impact will be determined based on the change in fair market value of the warrant as of the redemption date relative to the end of Q3 2021. Finally, we forecast stock-based compensation expense to be $80 to $85 million in Q4. Overall, we're thrilled with our performance in Q3, where we delivered more than $1 billion of annualized revenue, and our 5th consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA. We continue to make great progress and remain very well-capitalized to continue pursuing our longer-term objective of ultimately becoming a top financial institution. With that, let's begin the Q&A. Okay. Yes. Hey Betsy. In terms of Q2 versus Q3 and crypto revenues specifically, we don't disclose that in our filings, but you'll see it in our 10-Q that gets filed in a few days that we do disclose brokerage revenue, and that was down by about $2.7 million sequentially, as a result of lower trading activity. However, the headwind that I just mentioned and the decline in brokerage revenue were offset by sequential strong growth in our SoFi Money Lantern, and credit card businesses, which allowed us to generate that flat revenue that you talked about quarter-over-quarter when excluding those  revenue.  And this speaks to the benefits of the diversification within Financial Services. And then in terms of, as we think about the fourth quarter and our guidance, we are guiding for an acceleration of year-over-year basis to 49% to 55% year-over-year growth, which is faster than what we had in Q3 on a year-over-year basis. When you think about sequential growth, the vast majority of that sequential growth will come from tech platform and in a similar faster as it was in Q3, as well as financial services, which would be material faster sequentially. Into Q4, we're seeing really positive trends in both those businesses and really benefiting from the initiatives in Q3 flowing into Q4 from a revenue standpoint. Yeah, Pagaya -- yeah, Pagaya. The FPA is an association that has a significant number of financial planners. The program that we brought to them has the ability to get those same benefits for their customers and it's a new distribution relationship for the At Work program, which contributes to all of our products and also has revenue stream itself from a proceed basis. And so, it's not a building of financial planning at SoFi, it's really a new relationship with the FPA. One thing that we do provide for our members that is direct is we do provide free certified financial planners already. In addition to that, we also have the Relay product which gives us a significant amount of information from all their other financial products so we can better personalize offers to them. Yeah, sure. Hey, John, this is Chris. In terms of what drove some of the growth there, we saw good sequential and year-over-year growth both in NIM revenue as well as loan sales and originations, which was driven by our overall gain on-sale margins. So, you'll see this in the 10-Q that gets filed in a few days. But again, on-sale margins remained very healthy in our business and improved in both personal loans and home loans. In personal loans, again, on-sale margin was 4.5% in the quarter. That's up from 4.2% last quarter. Student loan refinancing remained at very healthy level at 4%, and our Home Loans business was at 3.1% in the quarter, up from 2.7% last quarter.  In addition to that, the things driving the strong NIM margin was overall reduced cost of capital as we deployed some of our -- our IPO proceeds towards paying down warehouse debt in the quarter, and that helped drive some of that yield. And then, in terms of the mix of whole Loans and securitizations, it was in line with what we've seen historically. It's about 50% in each of personal loans and student loan refinancing, 50-50 split. Yeah. We've definitely seen efficiencies in the personal loan on the marketing line from cross-buy. We've had real strong cross-buying from both PL and SLR. We've shared some of those rates with you during the IPO process, and they've continued to be strong in that range. Home Loans has always been very high in the 60% to 70% range, and that's stayed consistent. The marketing efficiencies on PL have been the greatest.  the unit economics are very attractive and not paying that second customer acquisition cost results in more variable profit. But we're trying to reinvest all those benefits back into the business just because we know what the response is to the spend.  It's a good return but return takes place over time on the financial services products and the loans that pays back right away. And we just want to make sure that we're capturing the growth in front of us versus driving to really high margins and not capturing opportunity in front of us. On the entry points, the way to think about the top of the funnels is money is at the very top of the funnel, is a big driver of cross-buying a Money First member. In fact, I think I've said in the prepared remarks, it was able to drive 65% of the cross-buying in the quarter, just given how much more data we have and the activity on a day-to-day basis from that product. And invest contributes also benefits and credit card contributes. The other product that we have that doesn't drive revenue directly is Relay, and it would add another 10% to the contribution of cross-buy to money invest credit card, so instead of 73% of our cross-buy driven by money invest credit card. First members, it would be closer to 85% if we added in added in Relay.  So, there's a lot of different levers driving it. And we're seeing the benefits, but we're spending it back to maximize member and product growth. And then that will lead to revenue in the future because it takes a while for those member and products that come on that are outside our loans, to build up balances or AUM or start to spend on their credit card before it hits the revenue line. And we do think we're going to have strong momentum going into Q4 versus Q3 in the financial services line, as I mentioned. Yes. We are growing really fast, so we're growing the numerator and the denominator, and both in terms of members and products per member, and so it can mask some of the cohort trends. But of direct deposit, off of bill pay, how often is the app, et c. That's starting to have an impact. And so, each one of these product enhancements that leverage our unique strategy, we're contributing to that product growth. And that's why you see the relationship of 600,000 new products to 377,000 new members. It's hard to drive both so fast, and we're at the point now where we have the data, the logic, and the approach to doing it. And we were looking forward to seeing it to the next level in '22.

            "name": "Anthony Noto",
            "content": "Thank you, Andrea. And thank you all for joining us for our third quarter earnings conference call. The results we're reporting today demonstrate three things. First, our ability to continue to deliver record financial results, which is a testament to our diversified business mix and our ability to execute on our long-term strategy. Second, our commitment to consistently iterate and innovate to create products that are both best-in-breed on a standalone basis and work even better when used together. And third, our ability to leverage data and learnings to drive more effective marketing and brand building as we strive to make SoFi a trusted household brand name. Collectively, these things are driving strong continued growth in members, products, and cross-buy. Let's take these areas one-by-one. I've said many times that the benefit of our unique and diversified business model is that our three distinct business segments behave differently in varying economic and operating environment.  This allows us to shift focus and resources as conditions evolve, diversifying beyond our core student loan business into personal loans and home loans allowed us to weather the storm when the global pandemic cut industry-wide student loan origination volumes in half versus overnight in for the last 20 months. Building out a broad suite of financial service offerings has created exciting new opportunities for us to help people get their money right across online investing and spending via SoFi Invest, SoFi Money, and SoFi credit card.  And acquiring Galileo not only allows us to innovate faster on our products, but also positions us prominently among integrated tech platforms that service financial and non-financial institutions. Diversification across our platform has allowed us to achieve record financial results in the third quarter, even in a continuing volatile environment. Our third quarter adjusted net revenue of $277 million marks another record, beating both our previous record of $237 million for Q2 2021, and the high end of our quarterly guidance.  Even with the extension of the CARES Act, the lending segment adjusted net revenue, hit a record of $215 million driven primarily by record revenues from our personal loans business. Our technology platform segment contributed $50 million in the quarter, or 18% of total revenue, representing 29% year-over-year and 11% sequential growth. We achieved this despite difficult comparisons from last year's Stimulus benefits. And in our Financial Services segment, third quarter revenue of $12.6 million, nearly quadrupled from last year's $3.2 million drawn by meaningful contributions from five businesses: SoFi Invest, SoFi Money, Lantern by SoFi, Protect, and SoFi credit card. This broad-based revenue growth coupled with the benefits of cross-buying and our ongoing focus on realizing new operating efficiencies resulted in third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $10 million, our fifth consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA. Achieving record results allows us to invest in the new products and features necessary to position SoFi for long-term sustainable growth, we're sticking to our commitment to reinvest $0.70 of every incremental revenue dollar and drop $0.30 to the bottom line, as we scale our business.  Here's some new product improvements and features from the quarter that are already making an impact in lending. We launched a next-generation underwriting model in student loan refinancing that drove an increase in approval rates within our risk parameters. And personal loans, we launched a new partnership with Pagaya to capture revenue opportunities from loan applicants, we may not otherwise lend to. This allows us to serve a broader audience without additional credit risk and while maintaining our stringent approval guidelines.  In home loans, we made additional investments in marketing and fulfillment capabilities to better capture purchase volumes. In financial services, we launched after hours quotes in SoFi Invest and introduced 7 new crypto coins, bringing our total to 28. That's up from 5 at the beginning of the year. We also earned recognition for our growing Robo-Advisory business from berries (ph), which just named SoFi, the best Robo-Advisory for 2021. And in credit card, we launched in-app balance transfers and implemented soft poll pre -approvals which reduces credit score impact on the 9 applicants. At Galileo, our significant investment to build a new cloud-based, modern card issuing and payment platform is resonating with both existing and prospective clients. Having the best offering is not enough. We need to market our products and the SoFi brand in ways that engage members in order to make SoFi a trusted household brand name. Our reiteration on marketing efforts over the last 4 years is significantly improving the effectiveness of our brand-building efforts. The third quarter was a game changer for SoFi's visibility and reach and the impact on our growth. Here are just a few examples of our success. In September, we launched our new SoFi, Money Moves brand campaign during the U.S. open tennis tournament in the start of the NFL regular season. Leveraging television, social and digital influencers, along with TV commercials that aired during the nationally televised games from SoFi Stadium. The impact has been immediate and dramatic. SoFi TV sports drove more than 500 million impressions during the biggest moments and fall sports, and our unaided brand awareness doubled to a new high during the launch week. By working with some of the biggest digital influencers across social media, we've driven an additional 400 million impressions and 775 thousand engagements with SoFi content.  Our hashtags, SoFi Money Moves campaign on TikTok, has driven more than 8 billion views and more than 1 million uses of our branded hashtag so far. The reopening of SoFi stadium to sold-out crowds, with great media coverage across the full array of sports and entertainment events, has validated our decision to invest in naming this iconic destination for sports and live entertainment. Nationally televised NFL games from SoFi Stadium, this season, have averaged 20 million TV viewers per game. That compares with the 15 million total TV viewers we previously reached in an entire year between all of our SoFi sports sponsorships. As a result, when our TV ads run during SoFi stadium NFL games, we consistently see a significant uptake in brand awareness, member and product growth, and SoFi app downloads. We're also getting better at leveraging our highly engaged member base to drive product adoption via cross-buy. Let me share three examples from the quarter. First, by iterating on referrals, continue to scale our top of the funnel products, leveraging in-app communication, and expanding our popular SoFi personal loans, money bonds to a 100% of our members. We drove a 65% sequential increase in cross-buy volume amongst SoFi Money members. Second, we had 8 new ways to earn points to our unique SoFi rewards program. The only program that allows members to earn points for both transactions and responsible financial behaviors bringing our total earn and redeem options across the SoFi platform to 33. SoFi rewards through 15% of the quarter's new product growth. And third, we launched promotions around our new refer in the app and SoFi Money referral programs, which drove 18% of member growth in the quarter and significantly increased our app downloads and our rank in app stores. Our product enhancements plus more effective marketing were instrumental in driving member, product, and cross-buy growth.  The third quarter was our second highest ever for both member and product growth, total members grew 96% year-over-year to 2.9 million. We added 377,000 new members, which is an amazing 35% increase versus the 279,000 new members we added in the Second Quarter. Total products grew 108% year-over-year to nearly $4.3 million. We added 600 thousand new products, which is a 24% increase versus the 483 thousand new products in the second quarter. The scale we are achieving in money -- Invest in Credit Card, which are at the top of our product funnel, is having a dramatic impact on cross-buy volumes. The third quarter was a record for cross-buy products with SoFi Money, SoFi Invest, and SoFi credit card first members accounting for 73% of total cross-buying, demonstrating that as the top of our final scale increases, so will cross-buying and the benefits of our financial services productivity with strategy. As important when a bottom of the final loan is crossed bought, the lifetime value of the member doubles from already industry high levels to more than $1600 versus Just a loan-only member. Our momentum continues at Galileo as well. We signed 13 new clients, bringing our year-to-date total to 35 and finished the quarter enabling our clients to serve 89 million accounts, up 80% year-over-year.  Today, we are in our strongest position ever to fund and execute on our ambitious long-term growth strategy. The $1.2 billion we raised in a 0-coupon convertible debt offering, in October, brought our total capital rates over the past year to $3.6 billion and our total capital to $4.6 billion. And our pending application for a bank license represents a potential new source of funding and flexibility for us. I am proud of this impressive list of accomplishments for the quarter, especially in a continuing volatile economic and financial markets environment. As we head into the final weeks of 2021 and turn our focus to 2022, I am honored and humbled by all the SoFi team has been able to accomplish this year, and I'm thrilled for our next chapter in 2022. Now, I'll turn it over to Chris for a discussion of the quarter's financials. Yes. Yes, I'll answer the question from a consumer value  standpoint, and then Chris can -- I'll get into the numbers in more detail. We endeavor to differentiate our products on 4 macro things, fast, selection, content, and convenience. And then we want each of our products to work better, when our members use it with another product. As it relates to selection, we're the only invest product that has single-stocks, fractional shares, 6 of our own ETFs uniquely built for our members, Robo-Advisory accounts, as well as cryptocurrency. And then within each one of those, we're trying to add more and more selection as well in addition to driving horizontal selection. And so, you're right, we added a number of core earnings in the quarter. Actually, throughout the year we started with 5 points, we're now up to over 25 points, and we'll continue to look for opportunities to add selection generally both within cryptocurrency and outside cryptocurrency.  And we hear for our members every day what they want, and we want to give them the opportunity to buy what they would like, but to do it in a responsible, diversified way, so educating them on the risks of cryptocurrency, and also dollar cost averaging, and setting up recurring investing and capabilities. We're really encouraged by the trends we're seeing in our investments overall. We had really strong growth in both new members, and invest, and have really strong growth in AUM. And I'll turn it over to Chris to talk about the differences between Q2 and Q3, as well as how we see the momentum going into Q4, which is quite strong for investor overall. Yes, I was very relieved by that speech. We're watching it very closely. Some people may not realize this, but we applied for the exact license that our current acting head Michael Su (ph) mentioned. We applied for a bank holding Company, national bank charter, which would be regulated by the Federal Reserve as a bank holding Company and will be regulated by the OCC as a bank. Both of those will be our two primary regulators in addition to the FDIC. So, we're really fortunate in that we've built the business for durable long-term growth. Taking a harder path, our lending business originally is built on the back of licenses in 50 states; our home loan business -- and these are our licenses, not borrowed licenses, not rented licenses. Same thing with our home loan business. And in cryptocurrency, we have money transmitter licenses. So, we've taken a harder right approach over the easier, but I think long opposed, people same time including applying for a national bank charter instead of applying for an ILC, or applying for a FinTech Charter, or applying for a crypto charter.  We applied for the full Monte exactly what the acting head indicated everyone should be applying for if they're taking deposits or taking cash. We're really encouraged by the progress we've made with our regulators in the exam process since March, the feedback has been constructive. The timeline is not specific, and there are more steps beyond just the exam, but we're encouraged by the constructive feedback we've gotten and working with them as real partners. So, we look forward to finishing this last mile on -- and reaching that milestone for the Company that we think will be a huge competitive advantage, especially in light of the comments last week. You're welcome. Yeah. I want to be super clear on our lending business. We have not changed our credit model, we haven't changed our target focus, our average fico scores are high quality prime, fico scores that are still well into the 700s. What we're doing is we're constantly testing all the different variables and they're indication of where we end up on loan size, on pricing, and let alone losses, and delinquencies. So, it just continued iteration to make sure that we're being efficient on both the credit spectrum, as well as the pricing spectrum. And we develop new-generation models that are based on data and analysis. But we haven't changed our philosophy or approach to -- of the credit that we're willing to underwrite. Is there anything to that? Okay, is there a second part to your question? I think was tied to Pagaya? Yes. Sorry, I apologize. So Pagaya is the extension of a strategy we started 2 years ago. We're able to meet about 30% of the demand that we get for our unsecured personal loans, what we call PL, and what we found was that we're obviously investing in our brand -- investing in brand-building. And if we're only meeting 30% of our demand, how could we capture more value beyond that, if we don't want to change our approach to credit. And we built a property called Lantern credit by SoFi, which is a  in property.  Our first step was to take some of the people that we would not otherwise lend to and send them to our Lantern partners and generate lead revenue from that. The guidance and extension of that  and we're integrating their credit model into our decision engine, along with the SoFi credit model, and so we're running both simultaneously. Pagaya allows us to serve -- the partnership allows us to serve a broader set of people than we otherwise fund. But we're not taking the credit risk. We're not changing our credit profile.  And Pagaya and our other partners are taking that paper, underwriting it, pricing it, and then taking out the credit risk, and we maintain the servicing and the relationship with that member so we can continue to offer them other products and services, and quite frankly, improve their credit and be able to serve them well and help them get their money right. It was de minimis in the quarter, but it's a bigger opportunity for us to add additional high-margin revenue against all the investments that we're making. So, it's part of a broader strategy. We saw a real game changer in our marketing as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the elements that we've worked hard to build over the last couple of years, multilayered marketing, television, the stadium, our direct mail marketing, our digital marketing, social influencer marketing, it's all coming together to drive really strong performance. We're achieving our long-term customer acquisition costs by product, which is allowing us to drive the level of scale that we're driving sequentially. And we're seeing good -- good efficiencies there. Each one of our businesses and their -- and their leads are really challenged to build over the long term at best of the product based on the differentiators I mentioned, and best of breed unit economics.  And those unit economics are tied to very specific targets across each of the cost line items, as well as their customer acquisition costs. They're all operating like a long-term customer acquisition cost, and we're still operating in that range, which is what's really helping us drive the scale that you see. Cross-buying was a record for the quarter, one of the things that may not be obvious to everyone when we say 73% of the cross-buying was driven by money investing credit card first members, is that we're not paying that second customer acquisition costs. So, we hit 2.9 million members in the quarter when we went through the public process and do a presentation in January of this year 2021. We had a year-end target of 3 million members. Well, we ended the quarter at 2.9 and we're over 3 million now, as you would imagine, and we're seeing good strong trends there. If you think about our total cost-per-member, which went down sequentially, we should have significantly even greater marketing costs but we're driving the member growth through lower-cost vehicles like referrals and other programs that are unique to SoFi. It's allowing us to achieve out-sized growth in members relative to expectations, but still delivering on profitability. You're welcome. Sure. I think what you're referring to is our partnership with FPA. It's not a new program, it's an extension of what we call SoFi at Work. SoFi At Work is our approach to enterprises, to companies, where we offer them a suite of products and services and a portal for their employees to take advantage of unique offers from SoFi that are driven for us through their employee communications. Often is the case that we'll see that someone through Relay has a number of credit cards that are fully utilized and we can offer that person based on what we see a lower-cost term loan through our personal loan business, or we could see someone with a lot of excess cash in their SoFi Money account, and we could offer that person a free certified financial planner session to help them invest that money and have it compounding over years. We can also see someone that can be paying a personal loan and that personal loan could have -- could still be a federal loan and one that we could refinance at a lower cost. So, we're in the business of financial planning every day helping our members answer 3 questions: what must they do that day in their financial life? What should they deal? What can they do? But it's more of a holistic experience that SoFi, as opposed to one particular thing. So, you going to follow up as well? We're really happy with the addition of Galileo to the Company 18 months ago. The team has done a phenomenal job of upgrading the On-Prem technology capabilities, as well as completing the craft cloud build-out. We're currently on-board with all new partners into the cloud directly and we're building a detailed plan of migrating existing customers into the cloud that will take place throughout all of 2022. In terms of the investments that we're making from here -- now that we have On-Prem upgraded and the cloud built up and it's really just about migration, we can reallocate our resources more offensively and launch new products and services. We did already launch a new disputes product, which the team re-engineered and reintroduced for our members. And that was a big heavy less than there will be a series of other products that unfold in 2022, that will drive incremental revenue against the existing 80 million accounts that we -- 89 million accounts that we enable not to mention allowing us to capture new partners way to 13 new partners in the quarter, that brings us to 35 for the year. They'll start contributing new accounts in 2022 as well. In terms of the investing, we are committed to staying in that 20% or 30% margin range. There could be a quarter where revenue comes in, and we can't spend enough, and the margin's a little bit higher, but there's no change in our desire to want to invest as much as we can in that business, but being prudent in that 20% to 30% margin range. We just think the growth opportunity here is so enormous, we don't want to under invest in it. We want to drive durable compounding growth over time on where we think that's the right level of investments to make, let's ensure that we're capturing it. Thank you. They're a great Company. They have strong technology; they have great partnerships that allow them to drive their lending business. We attempted over the last 4 years. I think Michelle will tell you we've probably attempted 2 other times of integrating a partner so that their credit model would run simultaneously with ours in our decision engine, and we never got to the point that it was working really well. Now, is it working well with Pagaya for my technical standpoint, but the team is now iterating and learning how to improve the conversion from the offer down through all the way to funding. So, it's a really unique opportunity. As I mentioned, we're capturing 30% of demand that comes in for our personal, which means we're missing 70% of it. This type of relationship, on top of what we're doing with Lantern, allows to capture that. But the thing I really love about this relationship is now we're recapturing economically on day 1, but we're also capturing that member as part of the SoFi family, and we can help them get their money right with other products like investing and SoFi Money, SoFi credit card down the road, SoFi Relay, Protect and our other lending products as well. It's a really important economic relationship. It does take a unique technology to make it happen. And we found the right technology partner and lending partner. But it also has a longer-term benefit beyond what we'll report in any one quarter. generally, what we're seeing is our strategy playing out and older cohorts having more products per member than newer cohorts. And you see the weighted average math by just dividing product by member. So I think we have a really good understanding of the types of information that we can use to come up with personalized recommendations for our members, and serving them in our member home feed, which is driving additional product adoption, referrals are -- are very unique product that allows us to build trust and reliability with one member, and then they refer that to their friends and their family, and we get other members that looks like them seeing demographically, so that's really working. Our rewards program, as I mentioned, this contributor as well, we have words program that really will be hard for others to match, because they'll either not have all the products or they won't have the technology.  We built a technology platform that allows our product managers and general managers to trigger rewards off with any activity they want. And we redeemed into all of our products, regardless of where it's triggered. So, people get 1% back if they just use the credit card and just redeem into credit card, they redeem it to investor, they redeem to buy cryptocurrency or to buy single-stocks, or Robo, more ETFs or they redeem into money where they pay down loans with those rewards, we double the points. But we target list points not just off the credit cards, right now we're churning off of recurring investments, of Thank you. I would say, it's not getting into that level of detail and I don't want to not answer your question. It's just, we're not trying to actually guide people to where we benefit but trying to serve them relative to what the opportunity is to get their money right. So, we're in different, what the first or second product is this. Someone comes in through a student loan refinancing and then takes out a personal loan, we save the 100 hours of customer existing costs and we're super happy. If they come in through SoFi Money and go into Invest we're equally as happy.  And so, we're trying to build each product by itself to be best-of-breed across the value profit I mentioned earlier, as well as best of -- best-in-class and economics, so that we'll always remain indifferent. We want to use the data we have to make the right suggestions for them at the right moment in time, be there for all the major decisions they make in their lives, and everything in between. So, we look at that data, we understand the success of our ability to drive personalization, but we're not trying to drive some combination. We want to serve them when they need to process the  If we do that, and that's our job to be done, they'll keep coming back.  And we're measuring NPS scores as well as reactions to offers in their member home fee to make sure that we're meeting our satisfaction levels that -- well, there's satisfaction levels that -- where we should. It is very much the case that each product drives cross-buy to others, but it's different percentages. Generally, the more data we have for one product, the more cross-buying we can derive from it. I'll answer the last part of your question first. We really haven't seen an impact to our customer acquisition costs from the data privacy changes that you referenced for others and other people have seen. So, I would just say that upfront. I said earlier that our customer acquisition costs by-product are within the range of where we set them for long-term targets to make sure we get the right LTV: CAC relationship in the right long-term return. And so, the team has done a good job of being able to drive this growth by staying within those limits. One measure -- we report sales and marketing. About 60% of our sales and marketing is true customer acquisition cost marketing as opposed to fixed costs. But even if you just took our total sales and marketing and divide it by new members, you would see that that marketing cost per member went down sequentially, I think 8%, which just shows you the efficiency that we're growing really fast, we're spending a lot more dollars. It's very rare that we -- you have the dollar increase that we had in the quarter and that we've been driving that you actually drive efficiency. So, I talked about effectiveness in our prepared remarks and what it was driving across each element. We're also as efficiency that you can just see in the P&L if you do that math. So, we're really encouraged by the impact that our marketing has had and integration into the product experience. And we will continue to reinvest in those bands that I mentioned. Each product has its own, but that's one way for the street to look at what's the overall efficiency of our marketing to new member.  And revenue -- I want to reinforce this point again, revenue from loans comes Day 1, the revenue from the Financial Services products unfolds over time on a direct basis. It unfolds on an indirect basis over time as well. So, a new Money member that comes in, could drive revenue faster, by driving cross-buy into a loan, then it drives on its own during that quarter per se. But obviously when a Money member signs up, they then have to transfer money in, start a direct deposit, and  over time that's a 2 hours stock increase. In Invest, we have  to start investing. Typically, not sitting on $2 or $3 thousand. It takes a while for that to build up to that level on. But as it does, the revenue starts to come in and it starts to contribute. Thank you very much. I'd like to finish today's call with what I told our SoFi team at our all-hands meeting when Q3 ended. We've accomplished more at SoFi this year than many other companies will achieve in a lifetime. I'm incredibly proud of these accomplishments and the additional progress we made during the third quarter, which marks a yearlong sprint of incredible Company milestones. Now, the only thing that stands between where we are today and our long-term aspirations for SoFi is us. And I have absolutely no doubt that we have the right strategy, the right team with the right goals to deliver on these aspirations and more. Thanks for joining us today and we look forward to talking to you when we report fourth quarter results. Thank you."

Joining me today are Anthony Noto, SoFi's CEO and Chris Lapointe, SoFi's, CFO. They will share prepared remarks regarding the quarter’s results, and then take your questions at the end. Just after market closed today, we issued a press release announcing SoFi’s second quarter 2021 financial results. Our discussion of our results today is complimentary to the press release, which is available on the Investor Relations page of our website investors.sofi.com.

During the course of this conference call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, forecasts and projections as of today's date. Any forward-looking statements that we make are subject to various risks and uncertainties. And there are important factors that could cause actual outcomes to differ materially from those indicated in the statements. We discuss these factors in our filings with the SEC, including our upcoming Form 10-Q, which can be found on the IR page of our website, or the SEC filings website sec.gov/edgar.

While today's discussion will focus primarily on the second quarter results, we encourage you to evaluate SoFi's performance on an annual basis as quarterly results can be affected by unexpected events that are outside our control. Now I'll turn the call over to Anthony.\nAnthony Noto: Thank you, Andrea. Welcome all to SoFi';s first earnings conference call as a public company. We're excited to speak with you today about our second quarter results. I want to start by providing you with a short overview of our mission, our strategy, our job to be done, which is more commonly referred to as our value proposition and our points of differentiation. Our mission is to help our members predominately made up of what we call high earners that well serve, achieve financial independence to realize their ambitions. Our strategy is to offer a comprehensive suite of products and services so that we are there for every major financial decision in our members lives, and all the days in between. My passion for SoFi increases every day, driven by the impact that we have in our members lives. That impact is driven by our focus on a unique value prop. One job to be done, which is helping our members get their money right by giving them a one-stop-shop to borrow better, save better, spend better, invest better and protect better.\nbreed: And second, not only do we strive to make each of these products best-in-class, we also obsess over how to make them work better when they're used together. While we do both of these things right, we not only deliver unique SoFi experience to our members that improves with each new product they choose. But we can also create the best unit economics across our business. As we get more efficient and serving our members, we can invest that savings in offering members the best rates, no fees, the best prices, terms in selection, This in turn drives more engagement, more data and our ability to help our members use more products to get their money, right. We call this the financial services productivity loop, and it's working. We see it in the numbers, accelerating year-over-year growth in members and products, increasing member lifetime values, declining number acquisition costs, superior revenue growth, and improving margins. Today, to the best of our knowledge, SoFi is the only company providing a comprehensive solution set in one easily to used mobile first digital platform. Many companies have talked about it, but only SoFi has done it. Now let's get into the quarter. I'll take you through a few high level takeaways, and then Chris will take you through the results in more detail. The second quarter proved to be a very strong quarter full of milestones. We want to highlight four key points from the results. First, our strategy execution are driving record results. Second, we are constantly striving to iterate, learn and iterate some more in order to compound innovation and differentiate our products. Third, we are hitting an inflection point in our financial services proceeding strategy, with a number of financial services products used by members reaching nearly 3x the number of running products during the quarter versus about equal one year ago. And fourth, we continue to invest aggressively to ensure we're driving compounding growth while still delivering profitability. Let's take these one-by-one, starting with our strategy and execution are driving record results. Specifically, we achieved record adjusted net revenue of $237 million despite our student loan refinancing business operating in less than 50% of pre-COVID levels to the CARES Act, which is a great testament to the diversity of our business. Total members through 113% year-over-year, which is our eighth consecutive quarter of accelerating year-over-year growth. Total products held by our members increased 123%, our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth of more than 100%. We demonstrated continued strong cross-buying trends with cross-block products up 1.7x versus a year ago, Galileo our technology platform business will then doubled its total client accounts to 79 million and just crossed $100 billion of annualized payment volume in July. We delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA. In our financial services segment revenue had a breakout quarter of 2.5x versus Q1 2021. This brings me to the second key takeaway. In the quarter, we demonstrated our commitment to constantly iterate across four factors, fast selection, constant demands to drive compounding innovation. Here's just a few examples of what we did in the quarter. Our products are 100% digital, and there are infinite ways to tailor them to specific members needs. To ensure our members get the right loan for them. We launched a next gen credit model and reengineered our fraud and income verification processes. This drove a 30% higher approval rate with the same credit box, leading to a 60% increase in funnel conversion and improved Net Promoter Score, all with zero negative impact on credit quality. Across lending, we continue to invest in automation to make the loan application process easier, faster and lower touch. In Q2 more than 50% of personal loans process were 100% automated. That compares with less than 30% one year ago, which drove lower cost per loan and shortened time to fund to two days from four days last year and nearly a week a few years ago. In student loans, we work to align with members individual needs throughout the pandemic, specifically by introducing this snooze feature. The snooze feature allows borrowers to lock in a low rate on a student loan today. It's delaying the starting payments until the CARES Act loan deferral program ends in January 2022. In SoFi Money, we enhanced our direct deposit offering by adding two-day early paycheck to earlier enhancements like free overdraft protection, auto save and roundup features. And SoFi invest members asked for more cryptocurrency selection. So we added 16 points to the offering. We also have the ability to redeem SoFi reward points earned on all of SoFi products into cryptocurrency. And we were one of the first offer [audio gap] with our new IPO investment center. Also in invest we added to our already strong SoFi ETF offering by launching SoFi weekly the first ever equity ETF that pays weekly dividends, this joint SoFi TJF or fixed income ETF which pays a dividend every Friday. At Galileo, we near completion on a 15 month project to build out a new cloud computing environment to replace the on premises environment, and are now in Q3 focused on the migration of existing clients to the cloud, which we filed by onboarding new clients straight to the cloud. We also continue to grow the Galileo partner base, signing up 22 new partners in the first half of ‘21 well 12 of those in Q2, including some focused on enterprise and cryptocurrency. Finally, we continue to iterate and innovate on our unique rewards program by adding additional reward triggers when members set up returning purchases or return deposits in SoFi Invest or direct deposit in SoFi Money, or when members use the app to take actions that make their financial life better. Since launch, rewards is contributing meaningfully to cross-buy and engagement. Already members have earned 450 million points with new ways to earn in the works. This is just a sample of all the innovation introduced this quarter. But we have much more in the pipeline, so stay tuned. The third message I want to hit on today is the inflection point we have reached with the financial services productivity with strategy. We worked hard to scale our financial services offering which includes products like SoFi Money, SoFi Invest, SoFi relay and SoFi credit card, as these products have a much broader appeal, lower customer acquisition costs and greater daily engagement compared to lending products, which has significantly higher LTV for use less frequently and buy fewer people. Driving greater scale in the top remember funnel with financial services products drives two crucial benefits. First, it resulted more members, more usage and more data across a set of products with extremely attractive standalone characteristics. And second, this drives greater volume of cross bought products at lower overall acquisition costs, leading to superior economics and lifetime value. We are seeing our efforts pay off. In Q2, we reached a critical inflection point with a number of financial services products held by SoFi members and nearly $2.7 million is now nearly three times the number of SoFi Money products at almost $1 million. A year ago there were about equal in number. The 3x greater scale is helping drive a 1.7x increase in the number of products that were cross bought in the quarter versus Q2 2020. The profitability of our learning products is already at industry highs, and increases dramatically when loans are cross bought. Because there is no additional cost from acquisition. This further solidifies our superior lifetime values, leading to our ability to offer unmatched value to our members. The last point I'd like to drive home today that we continue invest aggressively in our business to fuel compounding growth, while still delivering profitability to our shareholders. This combination is not easy, but we are committed to contributing around 30% of incremental revenue to the bottom line and reinvest the remaining 70% in bolstering our product innovation to drive decades of compounding growth. Even as we invest aggressively in technology, marketing and people, we continue to realize cost efficiencies, which is beginning to drive real operating leverage. By leveraging cross buying and better gaining realization and targeting we've reduced sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue and customer acquisition cost meaningfully year-over-year. We have also improved our Member Services capabilities reduce onboarding friction points via implementation of more streamlined processes, including leveraging data and improved communications, all to drive down operating expenses, and improve efficiencies. All the while we've worked to drive improve product NPS, with better products and greater automation, which in turn reduces contacts and frees up resources to play often.  In summary, we had record results with accelerating growth and a lot of milestones we've caught up as we head into the second half year. But rest assured, we are committed to running faster, reaching higher and achieving more every day. With that. Let me turn it over to Chris to run through the results in detail.\nChris Lapointe: Thanks, Anthony, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a great quarter with strong growth trends across all of our businesses. We exceeded our financial outlook while achieving record revenue and our fourth consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA. We're excited about these trends, and are focused on building on this momentum as we moved into the back half of the year. I'm going to walk you through some key financial highlights for the quarter and then share some color on our financial outlook. Unless or otherwise stated, I'll be referring to adjusted results in all period-to-period comparisons refer to our second quarter of 2021 versus second quarter of 2020. Our GAAP consolidated income statement and all reconciliations can be found in today's earnings release and in our upcoming 10-Q filing. For the quarter, our adjusted net revenue grew 74% year-over-year to $237 million, a new record that exceeded the midpoint of our $215 million to $220 million of guidance by 9%. We also delivered $11 million of adjusted EBITDA, which is up $35 million year-over-year that exceeded the midpoint of our negative $8 million to positive $2 million of guidance by $14 million. Our incremental EBITDA margin, which is a changing EBITDA versus the year ago period, divided by the change in revenue for a given period, and a good indicator of our long-term margin potential was in the 30% range year-over-year. As we've discussed over time, we intend to reinvest 70% of incremental revenue back into the business in order to drive sustainable growth for years to come. We continue to make great strides on an annual basis as well despite the ongoing environment of significant uncertainty in macro volatility. Over the last 12 months, we generated $852 million of adjusted net revenue, and that includes the negative impact of interest on corporate debt, as well as the small charge we took related to our prior investment in APEX. Excluding these two non-recurring items, last 12 months adjusted revenue is closer to $885 million or 89%, higher than in 2019, our last full year of pre-COVID results. From a profitability perspective, we generated $61 million of positive EBITDA over the last 12 months, a significant improvement from the $149 million of losses we took in 2019. Before I get into the details of our performance in the quarter. I want to quickly remind everyone that we look at and manage our business across three segments. First, our lending segment includes student loan refinancing, personal loans, home loans, and in school loans. This segment is primarily a gain on sale model, whereby we originate loans and recognize the gain when we sell them via whole loan or securitization channels. We also generate net interest income by holding these loans on the balance sheet prior to sale. Second, our technology platform include Galileo, and we generate revenue on a per transaction basis when customers swipe their cards, make deposits and withdrawals are when API calls are made. And then finally, our financial services segment includes money invest credit card, lantern protect relay at work in our new equity capital markets and advisory business. These revenue streams are dependent on business activity, but primarily driven by member of assets on the platform and engagement. Now on to the segment level performance, our lending businesses grew 47% to $172 million in adjusted net revenue, driven by 66% growth and funded volume across all products to $2.9 billion in total. The largest contributor of that growth in funded volume was our personal loans business, which grew 188% to $1.3 billion. We also saw material growth and gain on sale revenue across both our student loan refinancing and personal loans businesses, which speaks to the quality of the loans that were underwriting. It's worth noting that we achieved this revenue growth despite significant headwinds in our student loans business, where the $859 million in origination volume in the quarter was less than half of pre-CARES levels. The lending business delivered $89 million of contribution profit at a 52% margin. That's up from $49 million a year ago at a 42% margin. Margin improvement was driven by efficiencies and marketing and operations that have brought cost per funded loan down meaningfully across both our personal loans and student loan refinancing businesses, as well as success in executing against our financial services productivity loop strategy. Switching to into our tech platform, which delivered net revenue of $45 million in the quarter. This is driven by 119% year-on-year Galileo account growth to $79 million in total. The tech platform delivered $13 million of profit at a 29% margin. And margins are down year-over-year due to our significant investments in technology capabilities overall, our migration from on premise to the cloud as well as ongoing investments in new products and geographies, something that we highlighted during our roadshow. I'll also remind you that our Q2 2020 contribution included our equity investment in APEX, which was 100% margin revenue stream. That contribution ended in January of this year. Overall, we believe the appropriate long-term margin for this business is around 30%. But we will continue operating in the 20% to 30% range to set the stage for compounding growth for years to come. Onto our financial services business, which really hit an inflection point in the second quarter with revenues of $17 million, up 7x versus the prior year quarter, and 2.6x sequentially. That growth is driven by exponential growth in products, which more than tripled year-over-year to $2.7 million from the 780,000 in Q2 of 2020. Every one of our financial services products grew by triple digits year-over-year. We hit the million product market invest surpassed 950,000 in money, and 600,000 in relay. We also launched a new equity capital markets and advisory business in the second quarter. Excluding this new initiative, revenue is still up 5x year-over-year and 2x sequentially. Financial Services generated $25 million in contribution losses during Q2, an improvement of $6 million from a loss of $31 million a year ago, and an improvement of nearly $10 million if you exclude acquisition marketing. As in our lending segment, this margin improvement was driven by efficiencies across both marketing and operations. The next thing I want to address is our balance sheet. Overall, we're very well capitalized after receiving the $2 billion of proceeds in June. Our current book value is $4.5 billion dollars and our capital leverage ratios are extremely strong. We also have access to nearly $6 billion of warehouse cApexity to help fund the operations of our lending businesses. We're excited about the strength of our balance sheet, and we'll continue to make choices that ensure the most efficient cost and use of capital. All right, I'll finish up with guidance. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by how our various growth initiatives are driving the momentum of our business as we head into the back half of the year. For Q3, we expect continued strong growth with $245 million to $255 million have adjusted net revenue up from $237 million we've just reported in Q2. Despite the fact we no longer expect a rebound in our student loan refinancing business in September of 2021. Specifically, we had factored that CARES Act would end on September 30 into our original guidance. But with last Friday's announcement that CARES will definitively expire on January 31, 2022. We have shifted our planning stance. Despite this shift. We believe the ongoing momentum in our other businesses will offset the absence of the previously expected growth in SLR demand to drive quarter-over-quarter growth to the $245 million to $255 million range. Our expected adjusted EBITDA range is negative $7 million to positive $3 million. For the full year, we're maintaining our original guidance of $980 million in adjusted net revenue and $27 million of adjusted EBITDA despite the negative impact of the following unanticipated factors. First, I just covered the CARES Act extension, which has an estimated $40 million negative revenue impact to our original guidance. Second, we originally included $12 million of 2021 revenue in our guidance from our equity investment in APEX. As I mentioned earlier, contribution from that investment ended in January, and we will not have the $12 million in 2021. In summary, we expect to be able to offset this $52 million in previously unanticipated revenue headwinds through the strong momentum we're seeing across the business. Overall, we're thrilled with our Q2 results. We've made a ton of progress and are very well capitalized to continue pursuing our longer term objective of being a leading financial institution serving every one of our members needs throughout their lives. With that, let's begin the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sean Horgan of Rosenblatt Securities. Sean, the line is yours.\nSean Horgan: Thanks. Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to start on the Financial Services is a very high point, I think for the quarter. So can you talk about the behavior we're seeing there maybe across by rate at the product level for incremental financial services products? And also, I'm just wondering, on the lending side, personal loan origination saw strong uptick. So can you talk about the drivers there and then just touch on your thoughts on BNPL as a potential future product offering?\nAnthony Noto: Great, thank you for the questions. In terms of financial services segment, we're seeing really strong growth, as Chris mentioned, across all the products there with triple digit growth, and SoFi Money, SoFi Invest as well as recently launched SoFi credit card, we're also seeing nice contributions from our product comparison property called Lantern, in addition to great leverage from our distribution, and platform capabilities in the enterprise channel, which is called At Work. So really pleased with the way we're executed across the board. As we mentioned on the call, the business really saw a key inflection point in the quarter with revenue up 2.5x Q2 versus Q1. As we're now starting to monetize all that activity. It's a critical element of our overall strategy, because these products are much lower customer acquisition cost products, they do provide great lifetime value, but it pales in comparison to the running products. And so we leverage them at the top of our funnel. So the bigger these products get, the bigger the top of our funnel gets. And it feeds to the bottom or funnel, where we make really, really high LTV on the loan products, which have great variable profit margins. And so we're starting to see that continue. We've seen see really strong cross buying rates both from the top of the funnel from the bottom, as well as within the funnel across the products. We shared when we were going through the public process that our cross-buy rates were continuing to increase. And we're in the mid 20 range, and they continue to be very strong. So we're really happy with the overall strategy. And the key inflection point now at the top of the funnel is meaningfully greater than the bottom of the funnel, we see those trends continue. As it relates to the overall environment for personal loans, I will turn it over to Chris to give you some perspective on how our business operates in different rate environments, and what we saw on the quarter.\nChris Lapointe: Yes, thanks, Anthony. And thanks, Sean, for the questions. In terms of our overall lending business, one of the things that we're really excited about is that it benefits across different macro environments and interest rate environments. In high interest rates, our personal loan does impacts really well, in low interest rate environment, our student loan refinancing and home loans business do better with higher demand, what you saw coming out of the end of Q2 was a rising rate environment. And our personal loans business did extremely well, we ended up originating about $1.3 billion in originations, which is up 188% year-over-year, and significantly up from pre-COVID levels when were originating between $800 million and $1 billion. So we're really enthusiastic about the trend lines that we're seeing in personal loans. And then as it relates to buy now pay later. For those that are familiar, we have four different lending products today, we have in school loans for those going after undergrad college, we refinance student loans, we also have a home loan, which is primarily refinance today. And then in addition to that, we have student loan refinancing. We also have revolving credit with a credit card, and we'll continue to look at new loan products to provide to our members. There's a lot of enthusiasm in the marketplace right now for buy now pay later, we do think we participate at retail with a number of different products. And we will continue to find ways to innovate across the range of winning products that we have. The great thing is we're vertically integrated in loans from top to bottom, which makes us a low cost operator. And he was a great platform that had other products on to without a lot of incremental fixed cost.\nSean Horgan: Great, thanks for the answers, guys. So the next one, I wanted to see if we could get an update on the bank charter process. Curious, has it been a cooperative process or, have there been any pain points? And do you still expect the process to conclude before year-end? And then lastly, just I've been getting some questions on [indiscernible] and the involvement there. I think there was a release by the Fed that that has [indiscernible] in the release along would you guys -- so if you can just touch on that and clear that up that'd be great? Thanks.\nAnthony Noto: So I mean, they asked you to clarify the [indiscernible] question, now at this -- I'm not sure what that's about. But on the bank charter? Yes. We've been really encouraged that just to give people some history, I'll walk back in time and where we’ve been with the bank application process and where we are now. But to answer your question upfront, we're really encouraged by the process. It's been great to work with the Federal Reserve Bank and the OCC. They've been incredibly constructive. And it's been a really good process for us. They've been really clear in what they expect. We've been able to provide them that feedback and that information and give them access to our team and our processes. And in the cases where there things they've had additional questions we've been able to respond in a way that also constructive. But to give you a perspective, for those that are familiar, we applied for National Bank charter license in July of 2020 with the OCC. We're really encouraging received preliminary conditional approval in October of 2020. We hadn't applied at that point to the other regulatory bodies because we needed to convert our capital structure from our preferred equity capital structure to a common equity capital structure. And we'll be able to accomplish that by going public. In addition to going public to make that transition, we did -- we announced a proposed acquisition of a small existing bank called Golden Pacific. And at that time, we refilled with the Federal Reserve in the OCC in March of 2021 in a change control application process versus our original application in July of 2020, that was a De Novo process. Since that time, we've been going through exams and reviews with both the OCC as well as the Federal Reserve. And as I mentioned, it's been a very constructive process. We've enjoyed working with both repertory bodies, there's not a definitive timeline to the process itself. We keep going through each step in the process with them. And we're encouraged about the outlook. We think we have the right type of company to be a national bank. And it's a matter of, continue to work with them through the process. And we'll give you updates as we have them. But we remain encouraged about the process. And we're in that.\nChris Lapointe: And then as early so [indiscernible], could you just clarify for me. Our crypto businesses, one that we partner with a couple of partners on most mostly Coinbase. So I am not sure we referring to the [indiscernible].\nSean Horgan: Yes. So there's a release from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. It says really, SoFi and [indiscernible] merger sub inc. plan to become bank holding companies by acquiring Golden Pacific?\nChris Lapointe: Yes, that [indiscernible] reference is actually Golden Pacific.\nSean Horgan: Got it. Okay. Thank you. Thanks for taking the question.\nAnthony Noto: Thank you, Sean.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dominick Gabriele of Oppenheimer. Dominick, the line is yours.\nDominick Gabriele: Great. Congrats on your first conference call. And thanks so much for the updated disclosures in the press release and slides.\nAnthony Noto: Thank you\nDominick Gabriele: If we -- obviously, in the quarter, there was really good member growth, there was really good revenue growth across the lending segment, as well as the financial segment. I guess if we think about the technology platform, and the revenue growth there, and how your original expectations are across, through basically 25 is there anything that's changed in that platform as far as where you think you're ultimately -- your ultimate revenue mix may hash out in the next -- in ‘21? And, and kind of through your original expectations?\nAnthony Noto: Thank you. The answer to your question upfront, we couldn't be more encouraged by the acquisition of Galileo technology platform, the progress that we've made with the business and the integrations were overall company, we're seeing really strong growth. And let me give you a few highlights. And we'll talk through your question in more detail. We saw 190% growth year-over-year in the partner accounts that we have reaching $79 million accounts enabled by the Galileo platform. That's up from 36 million accounts, when we close the deal in Q2 of 2020. So really strong growth on accounts, we've also continued to grow the partnership base, we added 22 new partners on Galileo in the first half of 2021, we added 10 in Q1 and we're adding 12 in Q2, those are announced deals they take a while to implement. And so we've added 22 new partners to our partner list so far in 2021. And that compares to really strong growth of 41 new partners in 2020, with 7 in the fourth quarter. So our expectations for the business, its ability to capture the sector transition of physical payments to digital payments has only been reinforced by the last 15 months of owning the business. The point of results have also been very positive. Last thing I've mentioned about Galileo and where we're headed is, we've made a significant investment in the technology over the last year, our first priority was to ensure that we developed stability, reliability and responsiveness in their current on premises platform for the current partners. And at the same time built out an entire cloud environment over the last 15 months, we -- that cloud environment is now built and we've begun transitioning partners over. Once we complete that transition to the cloud from on prem, we'll have a significant cost savings that we can reinvest back in the business we will also be more agile and our ability as well to develop new products and deploy them to our partners. And we have a really robust product pipeline on top of the products that Galileo has historically offered. That will not only increase the revenue and partnerships with our existing partners but it will also allow us to reach a broader of new partners and continue on that partner list that I mentioned. That transition will take place over the next six months and in addition to that, we'll be onboarding our new partners that we've announced straight into the cloud as it opposed to on prem. Let me turn it over to Chris to talk about the specifics on their revenue in the quarter, and then our outlook for Q3 as it relates to revenue. And then I'll come back about the longer term outlook.\nChris Lapointe: Thanks, Dominick, for the question. So in terms of the overall revenue for the quarter, obviously, we're really excited about the trends that we're seeing that Anthony mentioned, from a transaction perspective, we saw strong revenue growth year-over-year, the $45 million of revenue that we had on the quarter was impacted by an intentional delay of our migration to the cloud by one quarter, which ended up resulting in a one-time lower than normal payment from one of our clients, which negatively impacted revenue for Q2, if you were to exclude the impact of that item, you would have seen good solid sequential growth in revenue. Then the only other thing I would note as it relates to the tech platform revenue is that in Q1, we've benefited meaningfully from the two stimulus checks that were issued by the U.S. government, which also made it a pretty tough comp. Overall, while we're not guiding at the segment level, from a revenue perspective, to the rest of the year, I would say that we are expecting to see stronger quarter-over-quarter growth into Q3. And specifically, we expect to be in the mid-to-high single-digit percentage growth range compared to Q2 of ‘21. And then the only other thing I would note as it relates to guidance change for the segment overall in our in our long term outlook. I would say that our original five-year model and guidance that we had given included the impact of our equity investment in Apex, which was about $12 million of revenue that was embedded in our original 2021 plan. Apex called their investment back at the beginning of the year, and we're no longer going to see that $12 million embedded in revenue for 2021. And that was in tech platform.\nAnthony Noto: But separate from that or outlook for Galileo no change for it was before.\nDominick Gabriele: Excellent, thanks so much for all that color. That's great. And then, I -- the numbers in the member acquisition, the revenue per product. And the cross that you're seeing is obviously, it's much better than we were expecting this soon, can you just talk to the mix of your products and how that can translate into better revenue curve product over time. And then maybe you can talk about, on average, how many products over your horizon here through 2025, if you may, how many products on average your clients are expecting them to have. That'd be really great? Thank you so much.\nChris Lapointe: Yes, in terms of the monetization of the products in the financial services, segment manifestations are very early, I'll pop through some of the drivers and how that will continue to improve over time. But we've obviously benchmarked each of these businesses versus industry standards, and we see ourselves at or better than what others have seen at similar points in time. So for the SoFi Invest business, we uniquely have single stocks, fractional shares ETFs. We also have Robo accounts and cryptocurrency on each one of them generate revenue right in different ways. But it is largely tied to some level of assets under management and the activity against those assets under management. And as you bring on a new account, and that account funds the AUM for that account starts to grow over time. And so today we'll continue to see really strong cohort trends in AUM driving to those long-term benchmarks but we're still very early because we're growing so fast at triple-digits. So we're not at the AUMs levels per account that others would be at a steady state because we're adding so many new accounts that have to go through that transition of funding and building assets et cetera. In addition to the AUM build, we're not monetizing all the AUM the way others have and we will over time for example, we currently do not have margin in order we have options in the single stock area. The ETF business two of our ETFs are low bode ETFs the rescue generate fees and we're seeing nice trends there's AUM there as well and a robo accounts they're very similar profile to that. In a cryptocurrency we do actually generate commissions or fees offer cryptocurrency based on trading activity. And so it's still very early days in AUM per account in addition to new revenue streams against those AUM and investing. We are seeing obviously a big acceleration there 2.5x versus Q2 in total revenue. But there's still a lot of room to go per [indiscernible]. For SoFi Money today we primarily generate revenue as interchanged we there's not much NIM in that business that I given where rates are as we become bank there will be a big opportunity and SoFi Money to generate, not just interchange, but even in this rate environment, a pretty healthy type of NIM margin based on the ability of using insured deposits to fund our lending business. And that would be attributed to the bank and to the SoFi Money business. And so we're very early days in that product as well as it relates to deposits per account and spending levels, but seeing the nice trends that you would see over time. And then the other element of SoFi Money that's really important is driving direct deposit growth. And we're seeing triple-digit growth year-over-year in direct deposits, and that's accelerated for the last few quarters. As we drive a higher percentage of direct deposits, it drives more deposits [indiscernible] account drives more spending and drives the overall economics of the business directly in revenue, but also has a big indirect benefit and indirect credit things that when we have a primary account through direct deposit, we see what bills are being paid, especially loans like student loans or mortgages. And we can use that information to provide compelling offers to our members. In addition to that information, we also can see how much they're spending whether they're able to save money and then investing that money, whether overspending and they run to a deficit and we can help them potentially refinance some of the revolving rate debt. And so that's how we think about the SoFi Money business. And SoFi credit card we've launched in the fall of last year, it's off to a really strong start. It's a very unique value proposition, we tailored it specifically for our members, and they get twice the reward points, if they redeem into cryptocurrency, if they're redeemed with the stocks, or to invest, generally, they get double the reward points, if they redeem it into money or into our lending products. And so we're really encouraged by that. And then Lantern, which is a price comparison platform, benefits in a couple of ways, it benefits from the demand that we get to SoFi for loans, and if SoFi applicant gets turned down by our credit model, and they're open to an affiliate offer, we can monetize that offer through our platform and Lantern partnerships there. And same with other types of products as it relates to applicants on SoFi or just those looking for different financial services products that we don't have at SoFi but we do have at Lantern like small and medium business are seeing a nice ramp in that as well. So really good trends across all the businesses. But it's super early days in terms of monetization.\nDominick Gabriele: Excellent, and maybe just one last one on the competitive landscape. And maybe you could talk to how the competitive landscape for the various products within the financial services segment, as perhaps changed over the last year and how SoFi continues to position themselves against some of the peers in the market, as some other companies have come public some M&A has happened. When you think about the long-term positioning of the company, maybe you could talk to your competitive advantages when you go-to-market. Thanks so much, much I really appreciate it.\nAnthony Noto: Yes, the biggest competitive advantage we have is that we have a superior lifetime value, we have that superior lifetime value for a couple of factors. First and foremost, we're a one-stop shop and so we're building best of breed products. So when someone needs a product, we're there for them, whether that's a big financial decision, or something that we're going to do on a daily basis. And when they use that first product, we build trust and reliability of them. So they want to use a second product where they're from, when that happens only to generate more revenue from that relationship. But we have compounding profitability benefits because we're not paying a second customer acquisition costs. So in our loan business as an example, we've had variable profit in the range of $800. When that that product gets crossed bought that $800 doubles, which we outlined in our management presentation during the roadshow because we're not incurring a second acquisition cost. That lifetime value is really unmatched by any of our competitors set because one, they don't have the range of products that we have. And two many are not in the lending business. And because we have that superior lifetime value, we can then reinvest the excess profit compared to our competitors, and better rates, better prices, no fees, better service, better selection, and it just drives the overall flywheel of our business. And when we say we're seeing an inflection point there, we are seeing the benefits of it across lower customer acquisition costs, lower sales and marketing as percent of revenue overall. And as you saw significant acceleration, the number of products we have and the number of members that we have. In terms of the competitive landscape, no one else is really doing. Everyone's talked about it. I arrived in January 2018. We talked about our strategy, or we just talked about trying to become a one-stop shop and no one's gotten there. And there's a lot of reasons for it. But our team has really executed and [indiscernible] our way to the fact that we have this one-stop shop with this range of products. We'll continue to add to it. Our biggest competitive concern continues to focus on the 500 million accounts that are tied to legacy FDIC banks. We see that as the huge opportunity. And that's what we're going after. We want the tide of digital frontier competence to continue to rise and all the [indiscernible] to rise with us. But we see that market share coming from the legacy players.\nDominick Gabriele: Thank you.\nAnthony Noto: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Napoli of William Blair. Robert, the line is yours.\nRobert Napoli: Thank you. Good afternoon, Anthony, this question, just that I'd maybe like to dig in a little bit more into Galileo, the 36 million to 79 million accounts. What is the mix of that business? I know you have a big bank neobank business, if you would, but what is the mix of those accounts? And is there any concerns with your strategy your banking strategy, you're essentially could be competing with some of those customers of Galileo's?\nAnthony Noto: Yes, the vast majority of the partnerships are what we would call business to consumer relationships, there is business-to-business relationships, we're providing payment capabilities to non-consumer facing businesses. And increasingly, we have more what we call enterprises coming to us looking for a digital payment capabilities both in the U.S. as well as LATAM. And we've really had great success in Mexico, we'll expand into other LATAM countries and the LATAM market, there is an opportunity, not just in B2C, but it's pretty wide open as it relates to enterprise and different areas like buy now pay later and supplier payments, et cetera. But increasingly, this year, we have seen more activity, yes, as well, of the accounts that I mentioned that we've signed, so far in second quarter, we'd signed 22 in the first half of the year, and 5 of them in the second quarter would not be to see they were focused on the enterprise or on different types of currency payments. As relates to the longer term growth of that business, there's an opportunity for us to continue to expand products beyond just debit and ACH payments, in addition to other functionality, so we're not going to share our pipeline publicly. But there's a fair amount of additional products we can add to our existing partnerships, in addition to bring on new partners. So as a competitive environment, we haven't lost any of our major partners. There was one partner that announced that the moving off the Galileo well, before we acquired the company several years ago, that's the only large player that has transitioned off the platform. And that was happening over the last year and a half and really hasn't had any impact on anything that we've talked about. So if I'm able to maintain all of our partnerships, and the relationships are pretty sticky, and as long as we continue to build more value for our partners, then they can build on their own with someone else will maintain was partners. And our focus is on making sure our partners have the best NPS score with their customers they could possibly have just they do they want to continue to partner with us.\nRobert Napoli: Thank you and I just follow up on is M&A an important part of your strategy on going forward? I mean, you have a decent amount of capital? And if so what areas would you look to add what geographically or different products or technology?\nAnthony Noto: Yes, we're going to be first and foremost great stewards of capital, and be very prudent in how we deploy it, whether it's against funding our businesses, or reinvesting in growth or an M&A so I want to make that point upfront. M&A has been incredibly valuable and strategic for the direct-to-consumer technology business for the last few decades, we've seen tremendous value generated through M&A. If you look at eBay's purchase of PayPal, Google's purchase of Android or DoubleClick or YouTube, expedience, purchase of TripAdvisor or Priceline purchase of bookings.com. I can give you example, after example of how 10s of billions of dollars of value are created from acquisitions in the 100 million dollars a billion dollar range. And I think our acquisition of Galileo will prove out to be that similar type of huge strategic value. And the way we think about M&A prioritization is we're a big believer of vertical integration makes us I mean It gives us the ability to be agile, deploy technology, innovation, fashion anyone else and makes us a low cost operator. In addition to that allows us to create ancillary additional revenue streams that help fund the technology investments for the industry and makes the industry better. We are vertically integrated loans. It's proven to be a great competitive advantage with a really high variable profit margins that we disclose that have been 40% to 50% since 2018, as we focused on quality and really driving the economics Within our financial services businesses, the acquisition of Galileo allows us to vertically integrate with SoFi Money. And that provides us all the advantages of being able to innovate faster at lower costs and help the whole industry become more reliable, more stable and more trustworthy, which will accelerate the transition from traditional banks to new digital frontier banks. Our credit card bills will be very well integrated as well. Because the acquisition of Galileo and our plans there could be in our interest of [indiscernible] to integrate some of our other businesses, and we're so we're prioritizing that. But we have those opportunities. From a horizontal standpoint, we largely would look outside the United States for horizontal opportunities. One example of that is SoFi Hong Kong, we bought a small company, we bought a company in Hong Kong, we had a great management team that had deployed an invest product globally previously. We had a really strong technology team, they had licenses we paid a small dollar amount to be able to more than double the AUM of our SoFi [indiscernible] we'll use that to lens expand with invest through other areas within Asia. And then internationally, for Galileo, we're primarily focused on LATAM the competitive environment is there is really one that is where we're picking the lion's share of the opportunities. And we see a huge amount of opportunity, not just what we've achieved in Mexico, but in other markets there. But there could be opportunities to accelerate that through M&A also.\nRobert Napoli: Thank you really appreciate it.\nAnthony Noto: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from [indiscernible] to this question. Our next question is a follow up from Sean Horgan of Rosenblatt Securities. Sean, the line is yours.\nSean Horgan: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my call. So I wanted to ask you on crypto, some of your peers have seen a lot of success, monetizing and driving engagement with crypto trading, but particularly interested in the crypto rewards, I think, we're starting to see it pop up more and more. But it's something that I think, intuitively would drive a lot of the same kind of behavior. So if you could talk about any of the early feedback there, and then any aspirations to move into a [indiscernible] product like earning yield on a crypto balance.\nAnthony Noto: Thank you, Sean. The way we drive our innovation, which I alluded to in my opening remarks is we really listen to our members. And we try to advise the dominant member centric, not product centric. And when we're designing the SoFi Invest product, we asked our members what assets they want even differentiate on selection. And one of the most requested assets was cryptocurrency. And there was a lot of debate at SoFi, whether or not that was appropriate for members and whether it should be on the platform and in our view is that we want to educate our members about the volatility of cryptocurrency about the risks of cryptocurrency, which we do every time they put it in a buy order, but it's clearly an asset that they want and we're providing and that's why we got a continued selection in cryptocurrency. The concept of our rewards program is a great example of how not only do we have a one-stop shop, we're an example of how we can make our products work better when you use them together. And so our rewards platform for those [indiscernible] is not just rewards only once credit card we built the platform allows us to trigger rewards off of any activity you do on SoFi. Whatever our general managers our product team our marketing team want to trigger rewards off of that they can find they can trigger reward. So today, you do get rewarded when you use your credit card. But will we allow you to redeem them into other products and so one idea we had was it's not just redeem with the cash, let's double the rewards in every deal with SoFi Money out of the credit card or double them when they redeem into that always make principal payments or double down when they go into an invest. And when we put -- when we first did it for invest we didn't include cryptocurrency and our members wanted in cryptocurrency, so we let them redeem their points in the cryptocurrency. And after doing that, it quickly became the top three most popular redemption option of all of our products and a great example of how our products can be better when used together. Another example of that is we just launched in personal loans when you apply, you'll get an interest rate if you get approved, that's x. But if you're willing to do direct deposit with us, the interest rate will be lower than that. And that helps the person that's getting the loan get a better price. It helps us build a primary relationship with them. The good is more data to help them get their money right and so you'll continue to see this theme plays itself out, we're not just going to build best and beat products by themselves, we're going to make them better when they use together, which will be really hard for others to replicate. And cryptocurrency is a perfect example of that.\nSean Horgan: [Multiple speakers]\nAnthony Noto: In terms of the SoFi products just answer that question. We're constantly challenging ourselves to add selection in all the ways that you can think of. So it's absolutely something to [indiscernible].\nSean Horgan: Okay, great. Okay and maybe one modeling question for Chris. Can you just walk us through the EPS numbers and clarify how to get there?\nChris Lapointe: Yes, sure. Happy to Sean, and thanks for the question. So in terms of our overall net income, we had losses of about $165 million. What's important to call out though, is that embedded in that number are non-cash items related to stock-based compensation, as well as the fair market value changes to warrants attributable to our business combination with social capital, in addition to those non-cash items are one-time transaction expenses related to the business combination with social capital as well. In total, those three numbers total, about $144 million of non-cash and one-time expenses. If you were to exclude those numbers from our net income losses, net income losses would have been closer to $21 million, and the EPS would have been closer to $5.8 of losses per share.\nSean Horgan: Perfect. Thank you.\nAnthony Noto: Operator, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from mosh aren't [indiscernible] please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks for getting me in there. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit given particularly the growth and success both in mortgage and personal lending, how to think about, the efficiency of your marketing spend? Is it getting better? Is it getting worse? And kind of what's implied in the forecasts over time, and what have you seen in the recent results, as we look towards that?\nAnthony Noto: Yes, we've definitely seen efficiency in the overall company and marketing spend, we saw meaningful, year-over-year decline in sales and marketing as percent of revenue, which is obviously a reported result that's at the at the aggregate level. Within the personal loan business, our marketing expense per new loan also came down meaningfully on a sequential basis of benefiting from cross buying and benefiting from better data utilization and better pricing. But we saw meaningful step down in the marketing on a per loan basis for personal loans, Home loans has been the gold standard of cross buying. As we shared in our roadshow documents in our earlier disclosures, we've been in the mid 60% to high 60% to 70% range each quarter for the percentage of our home loans bought by our existing members. And that hasn't changed. When you have that high of a percentage, two-thirds of the home loans bought by the existing members. There's great marketing efficiencies relative to other products that don't have that level of cross buying. So it's been a it's been a huge benefit. The home loans things will go through a cycle, personal loans will go through the cycle, but we've had great efficiencies in home loans and improving efficiencies in personal loans.\nChris Lapointe: And we're really encouraged about our long-term cash for relative to our long-term margins of 30%. And we're on track to deliver that.\nAnthony Noto: Great well, operator, I'd like to end the call with a few closing remarks. And thank everyone for joining us on our first conference calls as a public company. On closing [indiscernible] emphasizing how critical our team is to our success, and the importance of building a durable culture of diversity, and a place people love to work. At SoFi, our products and services digital, there's no storefront that walk into or teller at a window to me without technology or service does not exist. But more critically important is our people. There's a saying I heard 30 plus years ago that I love to repeat, the tanks don't roll the planes don't fly and the ships don't sell without the people. Our people are our number one critical success factor because they build the technology in our services keystroke-by-keystroke data point-by-data point iteration-by-iteration, step-by-step that turns our vision into a real impact in our members lives. I could not be more thankful for the people at SoFi for their resilience, their grip, and most importantly, their passion to impact our members lives in profound ways. And so we chat again in Q3, take care and be safe. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Chris Lapointe",
            "content": "Thanks, Anthony, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a great quarter with strong growth trends across all of our businesses. We exceeded our financial outlook while achieving record revenue and our fourth consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA. We're excited about these trends, and are focused on building on this momentum as we moved into the back half of the year. I'm going to walk you through some key financial highlights for the quarter and then share some color on our financial outlook. Unless or otherwise stated, I'll be referring to adjusted results in all period-to-period comparisons refer to our second quarter of 2021 versus second quarter of 2020. Our GAAP consolidated income statement and all reconciliations can be found in today's earnings release and in our upcoming 10-Q filing. For the quarter, our adjusted net revenue grew 74% year-over-year to $237 million, a new record that exceeded the midpoint of our $215 million to $220 million of guidance by 9%. We also delivered $11 million of adjusted EBITDA, which is up $35 million year-over-year that exceeded the midpoint of our negative $8 million to positive $2 million of guidance by $14 million. Our incremental EBITDA margin, which is a changing EBITDA versus the year ago period, divided by the change in revenue for a given period, and a good indicator of our long-term margin potential was in the 30% range year-over-year. As we've discussed over time, we intend to reinvest 70% of incremental revenue back into the business in order to drive sustainable growth for years to come. We continue to make great strides on an annual basis as well despite the ongoing environment of significant uncertainty in macro volatility. Over the last 12 months, we generated $852 million of adjusted net revenue, and that includes the negative impact of interest on corporate debt, as well as the small charge we took related to our prior investment in APEX. Excluding these two non-recurring items, last 12 months adjusted revenue is closer to $885 million or 89%, higher than in 2019, our last full year of pre-COVID results. From a profitability perspective, we generated $61 million of positive EBITDA over the last 12 months, a significant improvement from the $149 million of losses we took in 2019. Before I get into the details of our performance in the quarter. I want to quickly remind everyone that we look at and manage our business across three segments. First, our lending segment includes student loan refinancing, personal loans, home loans, and in school loans. This segment is primarily a gain on sale model, whereby we originate loans and recognize the gain when we sell them via whole loan or securitization channels. We also generate net interest income by holding these loans on the balance sheet prior to sale. Second, our technology platform include Galileo, and we generate revenue on a per transaction basis when customers swipe their cards, make deposits and withdrawals are when API calls are made. And then finally, our financial services segment includes money invest credit card, lantern protect relay at work in our new equity capital markets and advisory business. These revenue streams are dependent on business activity, but primarily driven by member of assets on the platform and engagement. Now on to the segment level performance, our lending businesses grew 47% to $172 million in adjusted net revenue, driven by 66% growth and funded volume across all products to $2.9 billion in total. The largest contributor of that growth in funded volume was our personal loans business, which grew 188% to $1.3 billion. We also saw material growth and gain on sale revenue across both our student loan refinancing and personal loans businesses, which speaks to the quality of the loans that were underwriting. It's worth noting that we achieved this revenue growth despite significant headwinds in our student loans business, where the $859 million in origination volume in the quarter was less than half of pre-CARES levels. The lending business delivered $89 million of contribution profit at a 52% margin. That's up from $49 million a year ago at a 42% margin. Margin improvement was driven by efficiencies and marketing and operations that have brought cost per funded loan down meaningfully across both our personal loans and student loan refinancing businesses, as well as success in executing against our financial services productivity loop strategy. Switching to into our tech platform, which delivered net revenue of $45 million in the quarter. This is driven by 119% year-on-year Galileo account growth to $79 million in total. The tech platform delivered $13 million of profit at a 29% margin. And margins are down year-over-year due to our significant investments in technology capabilities overall, our migration from on premise to the cloud as well as ongoing investments in new products and geographies, something that we highlighted during our roadshow. I'll also remind you that our Q2 2020 contribution included our equity investment in APEX, which was 100% margin revenue stream. That contribution ended in January of this year. Overall, we believe the appropriate long-term margin for this business is around 30%. But we will continue operating in the 20% to 30% range to set the stage for compounding growth for years to come. Onto our financial services business, which really hit an inflection point in the second quarter with revenues of $17 million, up 7x versus the prior year quarter, and 2.6x sequentially. That growth is driven by exponential growth in products, which more than tripled year-over-year to $2.7 million from the 780,000 in Q2 of 2020. Every one of our financial services products grew by triple digits year-over-year. We hit the million product market invest surpassed 950,000 in money, and 600,000 in relay. We also launched a new equity capital markets and advisory business in the second quarter. Excluding this new initiative, revenue is still up 5x year-over-year and 2x sequentially. Financial Services generated $25 million in contribution losses during Q2, an improvement of $6 million from a loss of $31 million a year ago, and an improvement of nearly $10 million if you exclude acquisition marketing. As in our lending segment, this margin improvement was driven by efficiencies across both marketing and operations. The next thing I want to address is our balance sheet. Overall, we're very well capitalized after receiving the $2 billion of proceeds in June. Our current book value is $4.5 billion dollars and our capital leverage ratios are extremely strong. We also have access to nearly $6 billion of warehouse cApexity to help fund the operations of our lending businesses. We're excited about the strength of our balance sheet, and we'll continue to make choices that ensure the most efficient cost and use of capital. All right, I'll finish up with guidance. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by how our various growth initiatives are driving the momentum of our business as we head into the back half of the year. For Q3, we expect continued strong growth with $245 million to $255 million have adjusted net revenue up from $237 million we've just reported in Q2. Despite the fact we no longer expect a rebound in our student loan refinancing business in September of 2021. Specifically, we had factored that CARES Act would end on September 30 into our original guidance. But with last Friday's announcement that CARES will definitively expire on January 31, 2022. We have shifted our planning stance. Despite this shift. We believe the ongoing momentum in our other businesses will offset the absence of the previously expected growth in SLR demand to drive quarter-over-quarter growth to the $245 million to $255 million range. Our expected adjusted EBITDA range is negative $7 million to positive $3 million. For the full year, we're maintaining our original guidance of $980 million in adjusted net revenue and $27 million of adjusted EBITDA despite the negative impact of the following unanticipated factors. First, I just covered the CARES Act extension, which has an estimated $40 million negative revenue impact to our original guidance. Second, we originally included $12 million of 2021 revenue in our guidance from our equity investment in APEX. As I mentioned earlier, contribution from that investment ended in January, and we will not have the $12 million in 2021. In summary, we expect to be able to offset this $52 million in previously unanticipated revenue headwinds through the strong momentum we're seeing across the business. Overall, we're thrilled with our Q2 results. We've made a ton of progress and are very well capitalized to continue pursuing our longer term objective of being a leading financial institution serving every one of our members needs throughout their lives. With that, let's begin the Q&A. Yes, thanks, Anthony. And thanks, Sean, for the questions. In terms of our overall lending business, one of the things that we're really excited about is that it benefits across different macro environments and interest rate environments. In high interest rates, our personal loan does impacts really well, in low interest rate environment, our student loan refinancing and home loans business do better with higher demand, what you saw coming out of the end of Q2 was a rising rate environment. And our personal loans business did extremely well, we ended up originating about $1.3 billion in originations, which is up 188% year-over-year, and significantly up from pre-COVID levels when were originating between $800 million and $1 billion. So we're really enthusiastic about the trend lines that we're seeing in personal loans. And then as it relates to buy now pay later. For those that are familiar, we have four different lending products today, we have in school loans for those going after undergrad college, we refinance student loans, we also have a home loan, which is primarily refinance today. And then in addition to that, we have student loan refinancing. We also have revolving credit with a credit card, and we'll continue to look at new loan products to provide to our members. There's a lot of enthusiasm in the marketplace right now for buy now pay later, we do think we participate at retail with a number of different products. And we will continue to find ways to innovate across the range of winning products that we have. The great thing is we're vertically integrated in loans from top to bottom, which makes us a low cost operator. And he was a great platform that had other products on to without a lot of incremental fixed cost. And then as early so [indiscernible], could you just clarify for me. Our crypto businesses, one that we partner with a couple of partners on most mostly Coinbase. So I am not sure we referring to the [indiscernible]. Yes, that [indiscernible] reference is actually Golden Pacific. Thanks, Dominick, for the question. So in terms of the overall revenue for the quarter, obviously, we're really excited about the trends that we're seeing that Anthony mentioned, from a transaction perspective, we saw strong revenue growth year-over-year, the $45 million of revenue that we had on the quarter was impacted by an intentional delay of our migration to the cloud by one quarter, which ended up resulting in a one-time lower than normal payment from one of our clients, which negatively impacted revenue for Q2, if you were to exclude the impact of that item, you would have seen good solid sequential growth in revenue. Then the only other thing I would note as it relates to the tech platform revenue is that in Q1, we've benefited meaningfully from the two stimulus checks that were issued by the U.S. government, which also made it a pretty tough comp. Overall, while we're not guiding at the segment level, from a revenue perspective, to the rest of the year, I would say that we are expecting to see stronger quarter-over-quarter growth into Q3. And specifically, we expect to be in the mid-to-high single-digit percentage growth range compared to Q2 of ‘21. And then the only other thing I would note as it relates to guidance change for the segment overall in our in our long term outlook. I would say that our original five-year model and guidance that we had given included the impact of our equity investment in Apex, which was about $12 million of revenue that was embedded in our original 2021 plan. Apex called their investment back at the beginning of the year, and we're no longer going to see that $12 million embedded in revenue for 2021. And that was in tech platform. Yes, in terms of the monetization of the products in the financial services, segment manifestations are very early, I'll pop through some of the drivers and how that will continue to improve over time. But we've obviously benchmarked each of these businesses versus industry standards, and we see ourselves at or better than what others have seen at similar points in time. So for the SoFi Invest business, we uniquely have single stocks, fractional shares ETFs. We also have Robo accounts and cryptocurrency on each one of them generate revenue right in different ways. But it is largely tied to some level of assets under management and the activity against those assets under management. And as you bring on a new account, and that account funds the AUM for that account starts to grow over time. And so today we'll continue to see really strong cohort trends in AUM driving to those long-term benchmarks but we're still very early because we're growing so fast at triple-digits. So we're not at the AUMs levels per account that others would be at a steady state because we're adding so many new accounts that have to go through that transition of funding and building assets et cetera. In addition to the AUM build, we're not monetizing all the AUM the way others have and we will over time for example, we currently do not have margin in order we have options in the single stock area. The ETF business two of our ETFs are low bode ETFs the rescue generate fees and we're seeing nice trends there's AUM there as well and a robo accounts they're very similar profile to that. In a cryptocurrency we do actually generate commissions or fees offer cryptocurrency based on trading activity. And so it's still very early days in AUM per account in addition to new revenue streams against those AUM and investing. We are seeing obviously a big acceleration there 2.5x versus Q2 in total revenue. But there's still a lot of room to go per [indiscernible]. For SoFi Money today we primarily generate revenue as interchanged we there's not much NIM in that business that I given where rates are as we become bank there will be a big opportunity and SoFi Money to generate, not just interchange, but even in this rate environment, a pretty healthy type of NIM margin based on the ability of using insured deposits to fund our lending business. And that would be attributed to the bank and to the SoFi Money business. And so we're very early days in that product as well as it relates to deposits per account and spending levels, but seeing the nice trends that you would see over time. And then the other element of SoFi Money that's really important is driving direct deposit growth. And we're seeing triple-digit growth year-over-year in direct deposits, and that's accelerated for the last few quarters. As we drive a higher percentage of direct deposits, it drives more deposits [indiscernible] account drives more spending and drives the overall economics of the business directly in revenue, but also has a big indirect benefit and indirect credit things that when we have a primary account through direct deposit, we see what bills are being paid, especially loans like student loans or mortgages. And we can use that information to provide compelling offers to our members. In addition to that information, we also can see how much they're spending whether they're able to save money and then investing that money, whether overspending and they run to a deficit and we can help them potentially refinance some of the revolving rate debt. And so that's how we think about the SoFi Money business. And SoFi credit card we've launched in the fall of last year, it's off to a really strong start. It's a very unique value proposition, we tailored it specifically for our members, and they get twice the reward points, if they redeem into cryptocurrency, if they're redeemed with the stocks, or to invest, generally, they get double the reward points, if they redeem it into money or into our lending products. And so we're really encouraged by that. And then Lantern, which is a price comparison platform, benefits in a couple of ways, it benefits from the demand that we get to SoFi for loans, and if SoFi applicant gets turned down by our credit model, and they're open to an affiliate offer, we can monetize that offer through our platform and Lantern partnerships there. And same with other types of products as it relates to applicants on SoFi or just those looking for different financial services products that we don't have at SoFi but we do have at Lantern like small and medium business are seeing a nice ramp in that as well. So really good trends across all the businesses. But it's super early days in terms of monetization. Yes, sure. Happy to Sean, and thanks for the question. So in terms of our overall net income, we had losses of about $165 million. What's important to call out though, is that embedded in that number are non-cash items related to stock-based compensation, as well as the fair market value changes to warrants attributable to our business combination with social capital, in addition to those non-cash items are one-time transaction expenses related to the business combination with social capital as well. In total, those three numbers total, about $144 million of non-cash and one-time expenses. If you were to exclude those numbers from our net income losses, net income losses would have been closer to $21 million, and the EPS would have been closer to $5.8 of losses per share. And we're really encouraged about our long-term cash for relative to our long-term margins of 30%. And we're on track to deliver that."

            "name": "Anthony Noto",
            "content": "Thank you, Andrea. Welcome all to SoFi';s first earnings conference call as a public company. We're excited to speak with you today about our second quarter results. I want to start by providing you with a short overview of our mission, our strategy, our job to be done, which is more commonly referred to as our value proposition and our points of differentiation. Our mission is to help our members predominately made up of what we call high earners that well serve, achieve financial independence to realize their ambitions. Our strategy is to offer a comprehensive suite of products and services so that we are there for every major financial decision in our members lives, and all the days in between. My passion for SoFi increases every day, driven by the impact that we have in our members lives. That impact is driven by our focus on a unique value prop. One job to be done, which is helping our members get their money right by giving them a one-stop-shop to borrow better, save better, spend better, invest better and protect better. Great, thank you for the questions. In terms of financial services segment, we're seeing really strong growth, as Chris mentioned, across all the products there with triple digit growth, and SoFi Money, SoFi Invest as well as recently launched SoFi credit card, we're also seeing nice contributions from our product comparison property called Lantern, in addition to great leverage from our distribution, and platform capabilities in the enterprise channel, which is called At Work. So really pleased with the way we're executed across the board. As we mentioned on the call, the business really saw a key inflection point in the quarter with revenue up 2.5x Q2 versus Q1. As we're now starting to monetize all that activity. It's a critical element of our overall strategy, because these products are much lower customer acquisition cost products, they do provide great lifetime value, but it pales in comparison to the running products. And so we leverage them at the top of our funnel. So the bigger these products get, the bigger the top of our funnel gets. And it feeds to the bottom or funnel, where we make really, really high LTV on the loan products, which have great variable profit margins. And so we're starting to see that continue. We've seen see really strong cross buying rates both from the top of the funnel from the bottom, as well as within the funnel across the products. We shared when we were going through the public process that our cross-buy rates were continuing to increase. And we're in the mid 20 range, and they continue to be very strong. So we're really happy with the overall strategy. And the key inflection point now at the top of the funnel is meaningfully greater than the bottom of the funnel, we see those trends continue. As it relates to the overall environment for personal loans, I will turn it over to Chris to give you some perspective on how our business operates in different rate environments, and what we saw on the quarter. So I mean, they asked you to clarify the [indiscernible] question, now at this -- I'm not sure what that's about. But on the bank charter? Yes. We've been really encouraged that just to give people some history, I'll walk back in time and where we've been with the bank application process and where we are now. But to answer your question upfront, we're really encouraged by the process. It's been great to work with the Federal Reserve Bank and the OCC. They've been incredibly constructive. And it's been a really good process for us. They've been really clear in what they expect. We've been able to provide them that feedback and that information and give them access to our team and our processes. And in the cases where there things they've had additional questions we've been able to respond in a way that also constructive. But to give you a perspective, for those that are familiar, we applied for National Bank charter license in July of 2020 with the OCC. We're really encouraging received preliminary conditional approval in October of 2020. We hadn't applied at that point to the other regulatory bodies because we needed to convert our capital structure from our preferred equity capital structure to a common equity capital structure. And we'll be able to accomplish that by going public. In addition to going public to make that transition, we did -- we announced a proposed acquisition of a small existing bank called Golden Pacific. And at that time, we refilled with the Federal Reserve in the OCC in March of 2021 in a change control application process versus our original application in July of 2020, that was a De Novo process. Since that time, we've been going through exams and reviews with both the OCC as well as the Federal Reserve. And as I mentioned, it's been a very constructive process. We've enjoyed working with both repertory bodies, there's not a definitive timeline to the process itself. We keep going through each step in the process with them. And we're encouraged about the outlook. We think we have the right type of company to be a national bank. And it's a matter of, continue to work with them through the process. And we'll give you updates as we have them. But we remain encouraged about the process. And we're in that. Thank you, Sean. Thank you Thank you. The answer to your question upfront, we couldn't be more encouraged by the acquisition of Galileo technology platform, the progress that we've made with the business and the integrations were overall company, we're seeing really strong growth. And let me give you a few highlights. And we'll talk through your question in more detail. We saw 190% growth year-over-year in the partner accounts that we have reaching $79 million accounts enabled by the Galileo platform. That's up from 36 million accounts, when we close the deal in Q2 of 2020. So really strong growth on accounts, we've also continued to grow the partnership base, we added 22 new partners on Galileo in the first half of 2021, we added 10 in Q1 and we're adding 12 in Q2, those are announced deals they take a while to implement. And so we've added 22 new partners to our partner list so far in 2021. And that compares to really strong growth of 41 new partners in 2020, with 7 in the fourth quarter. So our expectations for the business, its ability to capture the sector transition of physical payments to digital payments has only been reinforced by the last 15 months of owning the business. The point of results have also been very positive. Last thing I've mentioned about Galileo and where we're headed is, we've made a significant investment in the technology over the last year, our first priority was to ensure that we developed stability, reliability and responsiveness in their current on premises platform for the current partners. And at the same time built out an entire cloud environment over the last 15 months, we -- that cloud environment is now built and we've begun transitioning partners over. Once we complete that transition to the cloud from on prem, we'll have a significant cost savings that we can reinvest back in the business we will also be more agile and our ability as well to develop new products and deploy them to our partners. And we have a really robust product pipeline on top of the products that Galileo has historically offered. That will not only increase the revenue and partnerships with our existing partners but it will also allow us to reach a broader of new partners and continue on that partner list that I mentioned. That transition will take place over the next six months and in addition to that, we'll be onboarding our new partners that we've announced straight into the cloud as it opposed to on prem. Let me turn it over to Chris to talk about the specifics on their revenue in the quarter, and then our outlook for Q3 as it relates to revenue. And then I'll come back about the longer term outlook. But separate from that or outlook for Galileo no change for it was before. Yes, the biggest competitive advantage we have is that we have a superior lifetime value, we have that superior lifetime value for a couple of factors. First and foremost, we're a one-stop shop and so we're building best of breed products. So when someone needs a product, we're there for them, whether that's a big financial decision, or something that we're going to do on a daily basis. And when they use that first product, we build trust and reliability of them. So they want to use a second product where they're from, when that happens only to generate more revenue from that relationship. But we have compounding profitability benefits because we're not paying a second customer acquisition costs. So in our loan business as an example, we've had variable profit in the range of $800. When that that product gets crossed bought that $800 doubles, which we outlined in our management presentation during the roadshow because we're not incurring a second acquisition cost. That lifetime value is really unmatched by any of our competitors set because one, they don't have the range of products that we have. And two many are not in the lending business. And because we have that superior lifetime value, we can then reinvest the excess profit compared to our competitors, and better rates, better prices, no fees, better service, better selection, and it just drives the overall flywheel of our business. And when we say we're seeing an inflection point there, we are seeing the benefits of it across lower customer acquisition costs, lower sales and marketing as percent of revenue overall. And as you saw significant acceleration, the number of products we have and the number of members that we have. In terms of the competitive landscape, no one else is really doing. Everyone's talked about it. I arrived in January 2018. We talked about our strategy, or we just talked about trying to become a one-stop shop and no one's gotten there. And there's a lot of reasons for it. But our team has really executed and [indiscernible] our way to the fact that we have this one-stop shop with this range of products. We'll continue to add to it. Our biggest competitive concern continues to focus on the 500 million accounts that are tied to legacy FDIC banks. We see that as the huge opportunity. And that's what we're going after. We want the tide of digital frontier competence to continue to rise and all the [indiscernible] to rise with us. But we see that market share coming from the legacy players. Next question, please. Yes, the vast majority of the partnerships are what we would call business to consumer relationships, there is business-to-business relationships, we're providing payment capabilities to non-consumer facing businesses. And increasingly, we have more what we call enterprises coming to us looking for a digital payment capabilities both in the U.S. as well as LATAM. And we've really had great success in Mexico, we'll expand into other LATAM countries and the LATAM market, there is an opportunity, not just in B2C, but it's pretty wide open as it relates to enterprise and different areas like buy now pay later and supplier payments, et cetera. But increasingly, this year, we have seen more activity, yes, as well, of the accounts that I mentioned that we've signed, so far in second quarter, we'd signed 22 in the first half of the year, and 5 of them in the second quarter would not be to see they were focused on the enterprise or on different types of currency payments. As relates to the longer term growth of that business, there's an opportunity for us to continue to expand products beyond just debit and ACH payments, in addition to other functionality, so we're not going to share our pipeline publicly. But there's a fair amount of additional products we can add to our existing partnerships, in addition to bring on new partners. So as a competitive environment, we haven't lost any of our major partners. There was one partner that announced that the moving off the Galileo well, before we acquired the company several years ago, that's the only large player that has transitioned off the platform. And that was happening over the last year and a half and really hasn't had any impact on anything that we've talked about. So if I'm able to maintain all of our partnerships, and the relationships are pretty sticky, and as long as we continue to build more value for our partners, then they can build on their own with someone else will maintain was partners. And our focus is on making sure our partners have the best NPS score with their customers they could possibly have just they do they want to continue to partner with us. Yes, we're going to be first and foremost great stewards of capital, and be very prudent in how we deploy it, whether it's against funding our businesses, or reinvesting in growth or an M&A so I want to make that point upfront. M&A has been incredibly valuable and strategic for the direct-to-consumer technology business for the last few decades, we've seen tremendous value generated through M&A. If you look at eBay's purchase of PayPal, Google's purchase of Android or DoubleClick or YouTube, expedience, purchase of TripAdvisor or Priceline purchase of bookings.com. I can give you example, after example of how 10s of billions of dollars of value are created from acquisitions in the 100 million dollars a billion dollar range. And I think our acquisition of Galileo will prove out to be that similar type of huge strategic value. And the way we think about M&A prioritization is we're a big believer of vertical integration makes us I mean It gives us the ability to be agile, deploy technology, innovation, fashion anyone else and makes us a low cost operator. In addition to that allows us to create ancillary additional revenue streams that help fund the technology investments for the industry and makes the industry better. We are vertically integrated loans. It's proven to be a great competitive advantage with a really high variable profit margins that we disclose that have been 40% to 50% since 2018, as we focused on quality and really driving the economics Within our financial services businesses, the acquisition of Galileo allows us to vertically integrate with SoFi Money. And that provides us all the advantages of being able to innovate faster at lower costs and help the whole industry become more reliable, more stable and more trustworthy, which will accelerate the transition from traditional banks to new digital frontier banks. Our credit card bills will be very well integrated as well. Because the acquisition of Galileo and our plans there could be in our interest of [indiscernible] to integrate some of our other businesses, and we're so we're prioritizing that. But we have those opportunities. From a horizontal standpoint, we largely would look outside the United States for horizontal opportunities. One example of that is SoFi Hong Kong, we bought a small company, we bought a company in Hong Kong, we had a great management team that had deployed an invest product globally previously. We had a really strong technology team, they had licenses we paid a small dollar amount to be able to more than double the AUM of our SoFi [indiscernible] we'll use that to lens expand with invest through other areas within Asia. And then internationally, for Galileo, we're primarily focused on LATAM the competitive environment is there is really one that is where we're picking the lion's share of the opportunities. And we see a huge amount of opportunity, not just what we've achieved in Mexico, but in other markets there. But there could be opportunities to accelerate that through M&A also. Thank you. Thank you, Sean. The way we drive our innovation, which I alluded to in my opening remarks is we really listen to our members. And we try to advise the dominant member centric, not product centric. And when we're designing the SoFi Invest product, we asked our members what assets they want even differentiate on selection. And one of the most requested assets was cryptocurrency. And there was a lot of debate at SoFi, whether or not that was appropriate for members and whether it should be on the platform and in our view is that we want to educate our members about the volatility of cryptocurrency about the risks of cryptocurrency, which we do every time they put it in a buy order, but it's clearly an asset that they want and we're providing and that's why we got a continued selection in cryptocurrency. The concept of our rewards program is a great example of how not only do we have a one-stop shop, we're an example of how we can make our products work better when you use them together. And so our rewards platform for those [indiscernible] is not just rewards only once credit card we built the platform allows us to trigger rewards off of any activity you do on SoFi. Whatever our general managers our product team our marketing team want to trigger rewards off of that they can find they can trigger reward. So today, you do get rewarded when you use your credit card. But will we allow you to redeem them into other products and so one idea we had was it's not just redeem with the cash, let's double the rewards in every deal with SoFi Money out of the credit card or double them when they redeem into that always make principal payments or double down when they go into an invest. And when we put -- when we first did it for invest we didn't include cryptocurrency and our members wanted in cryptocurrency, so we let them redeem their points in the cryptocurrency. And after doing that, it quickly became the top three most popular redemption option of all of our products and a great example of how our products can be better when used together. Another example of that is we just launched in personal loans when you apply, you'll get an interest rate if you get approved, that's x. But if you're willing to do direct deposit with us, the interest rate will be lower than that. And that helps the person that's getting the loan get a better price. It helps us build a primary relationship with them. The good is more data to help them get their money right and so you'll continue to see this theme plays itself out, we're not just going to build best and beat products by themselves, we're going to make them better when they use together, which will be really hard for others to replicate. And cryptocurrency is a perfect example of that. In terms of the SoFi products just answer that question. We're constantly challenging ourselves to add selection in all the ways that you can think of. So it's absolutely something to [indiscernible]. Operator, we have time for one last question. Yes, we've definitely seen efficiency in the overall company and marketing spend, we saw meaningful, year-over-year decline in sales and marketing as percent of revenue, which is obviously a reported result that's at the at the aggregate level. Within the personal loan business, our marketing expense per new loan also came down meaningfully on a sequential basis of benefiting from cross buying and benefiting from better data utilization and better pricing. But we saw meaningful step down in the marketing on a per loan basis for personal loans, Home loans has been the gold standard of cross buying. As we shared in our roadshow documents in our earlier disclosures, we've been in the mid 60% to high 60% to 70% range each quarter for the percentage of our home loans bought by our existing members. And that hasn't changed. When you have that high of a percentage, two-thirds of the home loans bought by the existing members. There's great marketing efficiencies relative to other products that don't have that level of cross buying. So it's been a it's been a huge benefit. The home loans things will go through a cycle, personal loans will go through the cycle, but we've had great efficiencies in home loans and improving efficiencies in personal loans. Great well, operator, I'd like to end the call with a few closing remarks. And thank everyone for joining us on our first conference calls as a public company. On closing [indiscernible] emphasizing how critical our team is to our success, and the importance of building a durable culture of diversity, and a place people love to work. At SoFi, our products and services digital, there's no storefront that walk into or teller at a window to me without technology or service does not exist. But more critically important is our people. There's a saying I heard 30 plus years ago that I love to repeat, the tanks don't roll the planes don't fly and the ships don't sell without the people. Our people are our number one critical success factor because they build the technology in our services keystroke-by-keystroke data point-by-data point iteration-by-iteration, step-by-step that turns our vision into a real impact in our members lives. I could not be more thankful for the people at SoFi for their resilience, their grip, and most importantly, their passion to impact our members lives in profound ways. And so we chat again in Q3, take care and be safe. Thank you for joining us."

All lines will be placed on mute during the presentation portion of the call with an opportunity to question and answers at the end.  At this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Maura Cyr, SoFi's Investor Relations.\nMaura Cyr: Thank you, and good morning.

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Anthony.\nAnthony Noto: Thank you, Maura, and good morning, everyone. 2022 was a remarkable year for SoFi. We accomplished more than any of us could have hoped for. Our resilient team drove great execution of our strategy that has proven to provide the benefits of business diversification and durability to deliver exceptional growth and improving profitability.  Our adjusted net revenue grew 52% in 2022 to over $1.5 billion, and we delivered nearly 5 times the adjusted EBITDA we did in 2021. We obtained a national bank license, which could not have come at a better time, allowing us to be incredibly flexible in a rapidly changing environment. We're offering a compelling SoFi Money product that is driving high-quality direct deposit customers spending and deposit balances. The deposits bolster and diversify our source of funding enabling us to offer our best rates on loans, while generating impressive returns and improving net interest income revenue. In fact, 2022 marks the first time our lending net interest income revenue of $530 million by itself exceeded our total directly attributable lending cost of $443 million.  we grew our deposits 7 times to $7.3 billion from $1 billion over the course of the year, really powering that cycle. We grew our member base by 1.8 million to 5.2 million members, nearly 9 times our size in 2018. We acquired Technisys, adding a critical capability as we build our end-to-end technology stack and bringing us one step closer to being the AWS of fintech.  We navigated unparalleled market volatility, macro headwinds, high inflation and increasing interest rates and two unexpected extensions of the student loan moratorium by reacting nimbly and leveraging the diversification of our business to hit record revenue in each quarter of the year. The fourth quarter was an incredible end to an exceptional year. We delivered another quarter of record adjusted net revenue and adjusted EBITDA and strong overall operating results. A few key achievements from the quarter include our seventh consecutive quarter of record adjusted net revenue of $443 million, up 58% year-over-year, which accelerated from 51% year-over-year growth in the third quarter and reflects record revenue in all three business segments.  Record adjusted EBITDA of $70 million was up 58% quarter-over-quarter, that is nearly equal to the total adjusted EBITDA in the first three quarters of the year combined. In Q4, we achieved a couple of important financial inflection points. Adjusted EBITDA was $70 million is now largely equal to share-based compensation expense of $71 million, a critical step toward GAAP net income profitability. Additionally, net interest income revenue, or NIM revenue of $183 million exceeded lending noninterest net revenue of $144 million for the first time. And importantly, our NIM revenue is meaningfully greater than our directly attributable lending expense of $106 million. In Q4, we had an incremental GAAP net income margin of 42%, resulting in a loss of just $40 million, roughly half of the third quarter 2022 loss. Said another way, of the $171 million of incremental GAAP revenue year-over-year, $71 million or 42% dropped to the GAAP net income line. Given these accomplishments, in our 2023 plan, we expect to achieve quarterly positive GAAP net income in Q4 2023. Our strategy is to continue to play out with SoFi Money, which allowed us to surpass $7.3 billion in deposits, up 46% quarter-over-quarter, and savings of 190 basis points on cost of funds versus using other sources of debt to fund loans. Another quarter of positive GAAP net income for the SoFi Bank at over $30 million and at an 11% margin. Finally, we grew our tangible book value for the overall company for the second consecutive quarter. Q4 also saw our second highest quarter ever of member adds and our third highest quarter of product adds with strong momentum continuing into Q1. The 487,000 new members in Q4 2022 brings total members to 5.2 million, up 51% year-over-year. We also added nearly 700,000 new products in Q4, ending with nearly 7.9 million total products, up 53% year-over-year. Of these new adds, financial services products grew by 60% year-over-year to $6.6 million, while lending products were up 24% to over $1.3 million. The strength of our results, once again, underscores how our full suite of differentiated products and services provides a uniquely diversified business that has been not only able to endure, but to thrive through market cycles. Now I'd like to touch on segment level results, with a particular focus on the benefits of our diversified business drivers as well as the structural advantage of our bank charter. In lending, we generated a record of $315 million of adjusted net revenue, up 51% versus the prior year period.  Our personal loan performance more than offset the continued lack of demand in student loan refinancing and the less robust performance of home loans. Student loan refi continues to be negatively impacted as federal borrowers again await clarity on the end of the moratorium of federal student loan payments. Home loans faces macro headwinds from high rates, while we continue the process of transitioning to new fulfillment partners. The personal loans business maintained its strength in Q4. We originated nearly $2.5 billion, up 50% from $1.6 billion in Q4 2021. This product continues to deliver even as we've raised our coupons to our borrowers as a result of rate increases and maintained our stringent underwriting criteria.  While these origination levels themselves are impressive, the strength of our balance sheet and diversification of our funding sources provide new options to fund lending growth while driving efficiency with cost savings. These advantages are a direct result of SoFi Bank. Having more flexibility with our balance sheet allows us to capture more NIM and optimize returns, a critical advantage in light of the macro uncertainty. Additionally, by using our deposits as a funding source, we benefit from a lower cost of funding for loans. In Q4, the difference in our deposit cost of funds and warehouse cost of funds was approximately 190 basis points, where it was 125 basis points in Q3, and just 100 basis points in Q2, a powerful benefit in a rising rate environment. Lastly, the bank contributes to strong growth in SoFi Money members, high-quality deposits and improved levels of spending and engagement. This has led to higher average balances even as average spend has increased. Of the $7.3 billion in deposits at quarter end, 88% were from direct deposit members. Roughly 50% of newly funded SoFi Money accounts are setting up direct deposit by day 30 versus 20% in Q4 '21, and this has had a significant positive impact on spending. Q4 annualized spend was 3.4 times 2021 total spend, and Q4 spend per average funded account was up 25% quarter-over-quarter. SoFi Money members have increased nearly 53% year-over-year to 2.2 million in total. Given the quality of these members with 745 median FICO score, we see ample opportunity for cross-buy. This is a great segue into financial services more broadly, where net revenue nearly tripled year-over-year to $64 million and grew 32% from $49 million sequentially in Q3. Moreover, Financial Services annualized revenue is now approximately $260 million. Contribution loss of $44 million improved $9 million versus the third quarter, even as we invested $13 million more in marketing in the fourth quarter. We saw this as a worthwhile opportunity to attract more direct deposit members. Even with this spend, variable profit, including all marketing costs, improved quarter-over-quarter and was nearly breakeven.  We still anticipate the Financial Services segment will be contribution profit positive in 2023 as we continue to scale and monetize the business. We finished Q4 with 6.6 million in Financial Services products, up 60% year-over-year, and 4.9 times total lending products of $1.3 million. The increased scale of Financial Services helps drive cross buy and marketing efficiencies over time.  The scale of Financial Services not only drives cross buy and marketing efficiencies, it also is proving to be a large revenue contributor as we continue to drive monetization of these businesses. In fact, annualized revenue per product is up nearly 2x from $21 in Q4 of last year to $40 in this quarter. This is due to the increasing attractiveness of these products, growing brand awareness and network effects. As we've committed, we continue to iterate and invest aggressively in our product suite, and that investment continues to pay dividends as members embrace our launches. Since our last earnings call, we introduced an increase in our checking and savings APY of up to 3.75% as of January 4.  We launched SoFi Plus, a premium member service, that bundles together are a wide variety of member benefits and provides incremental value and rewards. SoFi Plus is unlocked through enrolling in direct deposit. We will continue to add more value and benefits to this premium member service to not only highlight the breadth of our products and services, but to also increase the total value of having your direct deposit with SoFi.  We expanded insurance coverage for our members to include cyber insurance, our invest team launched options trading, making good on our promise to our members to deliver this much anticipated service, and we introduced a new way to spend with SoFi with paying for there first product built on the combined Galileo and Technisys platform.  This leads me to our Technology Platform segment which remains a critical element of SoFi's strategy. In the fourth quarter, full segment revenue of $86 million grew 61% year-over-year with a 20% margin at the segment level or 24% if you exclude Technisys.  The SoFi Technology platform strategy includes growth in new verticals, new products and new geographies. In Q4, Galileo signed 11 new clients and made big strides in the strategy, with 36% of new deals in B2B and 27% of new deals outside the United States. Importantly, of these 11 new deals, nine have existing customer bases, reflecting the continued demand for our innovative services from more mature organizations. Technisys is also delivering strong growth in number of new clients signing an additional 16 new clients in Q4, including its first digital deal in Mexico. I'll finish here by saying that we've been in an all-out sprint over the last five years to build out our digital product suite to meet our members' needs for every major financial decision in their lives and all the days in between.  The benefits of our strategy resulting in a uniquely diversified business, combined with a national bank license, not only positions SoFi to be the winner that takes most in the secular transition of the financial services to digital, but also to provide greater durability through a market cycle. I'm excited about where we are today and even more excited about where we can go from here. With that, let me turn it over to Chris for a review of the financials for the quarter.\nChris Lapointe: Thanks, Anthony, and good morning, everyone. We finished off a remarkable year while navigating a rapidly evolving macro backdrop even as our previously largest and most profitable business operated at 25% of Q4 2019 pre-COVID volumes. This proves once again that our diversified and differentiated business model drives SoFi's durability and long-term growth potential. I'm going to walk you through some key financial highlights and then share some color on our outlook. Unless otherwise stated, I'll be referring to adjusted results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2022 versus fourth quarter and full year of 2021. Our GAAP consolidated income statement and all reconciliations can be found in today's earnings release and the subsequent 10-K filing, which will be made available in the coming weeks. For the quarter, top line growth accelerated, and we delivered record adjusted net revenue of $443 million, up 58% year-over-year and 6% sequentially from the third quarter's record of $419 million and above the high end of the guidance provided during our last earnings call.  Adjusted EBITDA was $70 million at a 16% margin, also above the high end of our most recent guidance. We saw 14 points of year-over-year and five points of sequential margin improvement, demonstrating the strong operating leverage of the business as it scales. Year-over-year margin improvement has been driven by significant operating leverage across our sales and marketing, G&A and Ops functional expense lines. Overall, this resulted in a 40% incremental adjusted EBITDA margin year-over-year. Our GAAP net losses were $40 million this quarter, a $71 million improvement year-over-year and $34 million improvement sequentially. Incremental GAAP net income margin was 42% year-over-year, a notable step in our path to GAAP profitability. In addition to our adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, we saw meaningful leverage against stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue at 16% in Q4 2022, down from 27.5% in the same prior year period, putting us well on our path to longer-term goal of single-digit stock-based compensation margins as previously communicated. For the full year, we delivered $1.54 billion of adjusted net revenue, up 53% year-over-year from $1.01 billion in 2021. As a reminder, we revised our annual guidance in April of 2022 following the extension of the moratorium on federal student loan payments.  Our updated guidance for the year included $1.47 billion in adjusted net revenue and $100 million in adjusted EBITDA. This guidance contemplated an ultimate extension in the moratorium until year-end, which implied a Q4 ramp in student loan refinancing activity ahead of the anticipated resumption of federal payments.  From an adjusted EBITDA perspective, we delivered $143 million in profit, nearly 5 times that of 2021, and $63 million above the guidance we presented following the moratorium extension I just discussed. 2022 delivered a 9% adjusted EBITDA margin, 630 basis points of improvement from 2021.  Even with the recent subsequent extension of the moratorium through June of 2023, which impeded the expected Q4 2022 ramp in student loan refi demand, we still exceeded that revenue guidance by $80 million and adjusted EBITDA by $43 million. We achieved these results by implementing new strategies and through nimble asset allocation, which speaks to our ability to leverage the diversity of our revenue streams. Now on to the segment level performance, where we saw strong growth across all three segments. In lending, fourth quarter adjusted net revenue grew 51% year-over-year to $315 million. Results were driven by 138% year-over-year growth in our net interest income, while noninterest income was relatively flat.  Growth in net interest income was driven by a 109% year-over-year increase in average interest-earning assets and a 317-basis point year-over-year increase in average yield, slightly offset by 162 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. This resulted in average net interest margin of 5.94% for the quarter, up 141 basis points year-over-year.  Noninterest income was relatively flat year-over-year as increased personal loan originations at higher weighted average coupons were largely offset by lower student loan and home loan originations. Personal loan originations grew 50% year-over-year to $2.5 billion, while student loan originations were down 73% and home loan originations were down 84% year-over-year as a result of macro headwinds and a continued transition of home loan fulfillment partners. Overall, we achieved strong top line growth, while maintaining our stringent credit standards and disciplined focus on quality. Our personal loan borrowers weighted average income is $165,000, with a weighted average FICO score of 747. Our student loan borrowers weighted average income is $170,000, with a weighted average FICO of 773. This focus on quality has led to continued strong credit performance. In fact, our on-balance sheet delinquency rates and charge-off rates remain healthy and are still below pre-COVID levels.  Our on-balance sheet 90-day personal loan delinquency rate was 34 basis points in Q4 '22, while our annualized personal loan charge-off rate was 2.47%. Our on-balance sheet 90-day student loan delinquency rate was 13 basis points in Q4 2022, while our annualized student loan charge-off rate was 0.37%. As we have expressed in the past, it is reasonable to expect credit metrics to revert over time to more normalized pre-pandemic levels, but we continue to expect very healthy performance relative to broader industry benchmarks. The lending business delivered $209 million of contribution profit at a 66% margin, up from $105 million a year ago and a 51% margin.  This improvement was driven by a mix shift to higher-margin personal loans revenue, along with marketing and ops efficiencies as well as fixed cost leverage across the entire segment. For the full year, lending adjusted net revenue grew 45% to $1.11 billion, and the segment delivered $664 million of contribution profit at a 60% margin. Shifting to our tech platform, where we delivered net revenue of $86 million in the quarter, up 61% year-over-year, or up 13% excluding Technisys. Overall, annual revenue growth was driven by 31% year-over-year Galileo account growth to $131 million in total as well as sequential growth in transactions per active account.  We also signed 11 new clients, four of which are in the B2B space and three of which are in Mexico, further diversifying our partner base. During the quarter, one of our clients migrated the majority of their processing volumes to a pure processor, which resulted in a $6 million to $7 million revenue headwind in period. Segment contribution profit of $17 million represented a 20% margin and 24%, if you were to exclude Technisys. For the full year, the Tech Platform segment grew revenue 62% to $315 million, and delivered $76 million of contribution profit at a 24% margin. Excluding Technisys, revenue growth was 24% year-over-year and contribution margin was 30%. Moving on to Financial Services, where net revenue of $65 million increased 195% year-over-year, with new all-time high revenue for SoFi Money and continued strong contributions from SoFi Credit Card, SoFi Invest and Lending as a service.  Overall monetization continues to improve with annualized revenue per product increasing to $40, nearly 2 times the $21 in the same prior year quarter and up 25% sequentially from $34. We reached 6.6 million Financial Services products, up 60% year-over-year by adding 635,000 new products in the quarter. We now have 2.2 million products in SoFi Money, 2.2 million in SoFi Invest and 1.9 million in Relay. Contribution losses were $44 million for the quarter, which improved sequentially as a result of the growth in revenue as well as fixed cost leverage, but increased year-over-year, predominantly as a result of building our CECL reserves for the SoFi credit card business, which is expected as we continue to grow in scale. In addition, we saw a year-over-year reduction in higher-margin digital assets revenue. For the full year, the segment delivered $168 million of revenue, which is nearly 3 times the $58 million we delivered in 2021, and our contribution losses were $199 million. Notably, that's a 21% improvement in contribution loss per average product during 2022 versus 2021. Switching to our balance sheet, where we remain very well capitalized with ample cash, excess liquidity and strong regulatory capital and leverage ratios.  This year's opening of SoFi Bank further reinforces our strength and provides more flexibility and access to a lower cost of capital relative to alternative sources of funding. In Q4, assets grew by $3.2 billion as a result of the strong growth we continue to see in personal loan originations. On the liability side, we saw tremendous growth in deposits to $7.3 billion, up $2.3 billion quarter-over-quarter. Because of this, we exited the quarter with $3.1 billion drawn on our $8.4 billion of warehouse facilities, which represents 36% of our total available capacity. Our current book value is $5.5 billion, and our tangible book value has grown for two consecutive quarters, with more than a $50 million increase sequentially in Q4. Let me finish up with guidance. Before going through the specific numbers, I want to hit on some of the larger macro assumptions that underpin our financial guidance. From an interest rate perspective, we are assuming an outlook consistent with the consensus forward curve, with a peak Fed funds rate reaching approximately 5% in Q2 2023, with two rate cuts in the back half of the year to get us to a 4.5% exit rate in 2023.  We are assuming a 2.5% contraction in GDP and a normalization of unemployment to around 5%. And from a credit perspective, we are expecting a continuation of elevated credit spreads across capital markets and a continued normalization of consumer credit. For Q1, we expect to deliver adjusted net revenue of $430 million to $440 million and adjusted EBITDA of $40 million to $45 million. For the full year of 2023, we expect to deliver adjusted net revenue of $1.925 billion to $2.0 billion, representing 25% to 30% growth and adjusted EBITDA of $260 million to $280 million.  Our outlook represents 30% incremental EBITDA margins for full year 2023 versus full year of 2022, and we expect to reach quarterly GAAP net income profitability by Q4 2023, with GAAP net income incremental margins for the full year of 20%. Finally, quickly hitting on a few key points for each segment. In our lending segment, we expect the Department of Education's moratorium on federal student loan payments to extend through June 30, 2023, at which point there are 60 days before repayments actually begin. Accordingly, our outlook assumes that we will be operating in our current run rate levels until September. After September, we do believe there will be a recovery to a higher levels of student loan refinancing revenue than the current trend, but we do not expect to return to pre-COVID levels in 2023. In our personal loans business, we expect to see modest growth as we balance taking advantage of ample headroom in this business given our current market share and differentiated product with a thoughtful and prudent approach to ensuring our credit remains very high quality. We remain committed to underwriting to an industry-leading life of loan loss profile. In our Tech Platform segment, one year of focus for us in 2023 is on quality of new clients, including size, durability and time to market over quantity, which means bigger wins that leverage the combined go-to-market value proposition of the Tech Platform, while still investing in focused new product areas to drive diversification.  While we expect low double-digit organic revenue growth in 2023 due to this focus, and a variety of other factors, our longer-term strategy is already starting to pay off with greater diversification in our pipeline and significant margin expansion expected in 2023. After a three-year investment period in the Tech Platform, including moving to the cloud, a 2.5x increase in head count, the acquisition of Technisys and launching new product capabilities, we will increasingly focus on leveraging the value of our investments through the synergies between the two product lines, Technisys and Galileo, as well as through joint product offerings, all to drive meaningful contribution profit growth relative to revenue growth.  In starting to operate as one unified technology platform, we have recognized opportunities to reduce our costs, including a small reduction in head count. In Financial Services, we expect continued strong growth in revenue, driven by growth in products as well as increased monetization per product as we scale deposits, spend and AUM. We Importantly, we will front-load investments in the year to take advantage of attractive opportunities to continue to scale our high-quality deposit base. In summary, we could not be more-proud of the results SoFi delivered in 2022. We exceeded $1.5 billion in annual revenue and grew adjusted EBITDA nearly 5 times to more than $140 million. We continue to be extremely well capitalized and are excited about the opportunities in front of us. We look forward to another strong year in 2023. And with that, let's open it up to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Ng of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ng: Hi, good morning and thank you very much for the question. I appreciate all the color around 2023. I was just wondering if you could go into a little bit more detail around the origination assumptions. You gave some good deal around student loan and personal loans, could you do that for homes as well? Thank you very much.\nChris Lapointe: Yes, sure. So, I can hit that one, and Anthony can chime in. So, in terms of our overall outlook on originations, going back to what I said in my prepared remarks, we are assuming modest growth in our personal loans business. We do see there being ample headroom for continued growth given where our market share is today. Currently, we're at about a 6% market share in our credit box. That's up from about 4.5% a year ago.  So significant headroom ahead of us, but we are going to take a prudent approach to this and continue to monitor credit and make changes as necessary. In student loan refinancing, we're assuming that originations are at the current run rate levels at least through the end of August of 2023, and we do expect a bit of an uptick once the moratorium ends in June followed by a 60-day extension. And then in-home loan originations, we expect to continue at the current pace that we're at right now with a potential uptick in the back half of the year as we resolve all of our fulfillment issues.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dominick Gabriele of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nDominick Gabriele: Great results. So I just wanted to talk about the deposit growth. I mean it's really been -- Anthony, it's been really astounding how much deposit growth you've gotten over the last year. And I'm just curious about how you think about an environment where you may need less deposits? And how you would go about, perhaps, trimming that growth rate in that environment, let's say, originations are down. Is it rate, or is it something else? Any color you can provide on that outlook would be excellent. Thank you so much.\nAnthony Noto : Yes. And thank you, Dominic. We're really pleased and proud of what we've been able to achieve on the deposit side getting to 7 -- over $7 billion of deposits, starting at less than $1 billion at the beginning of the year. And that trend really reflects the strategy that we've employed behind the bank to offer a very high interest rate on checking of over 2% and a high interest rate on savings at 3.75%, no fees and complete functionality on your phone to be able to pay bills, to be able to send money to your friends to be able to look at all of your transactions, to be able to really function all of your money movement right from our app.  The combination of that plus the focus we've had on driving high-quality direct deposits has driven that deposit number. What I'd say is, we're nowhere close to the point in our total deposits that we would have trouble deploying them. The limit on our growth is really driven by how much resources that we have to go after it. Once people become aware of our product, the adoption is pretty strong behind that. And so the deposits that we have today could be deployed the way we have the last several quarters; one, to fund our own loans; two, to be opportunistic on opportunities related to our loans that are in the marketplace.  There are several businesses we're not in today that would leverage deposits, including small and medium business loans and being in that entire sector would require deposits as well. And we can leverage obviously growing deposits from small and medium businesses also. So if we get to the point that our deposits are significantly higher than they are today, we can deploy them in many, many other ways to drive a great return for the company.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker of Piper Sandler. Your line is now open, please go ahead. \nKevin Barker : Good morning. And thanks for taking my questions. Your balance sheet has grown tremendously over the last year, partly due to the deposit growth. Could you talk about the differences between held for investment versus a held-for-sale strategy? In particular, we've seen several companies start to come back to the securitization market in the first quarter with spreads tightening relative to late '22 numbers. I'm just trying to see how you balance driving net interest income versus potentially some fee or gain on sale income? And how do you think about that for the rest of the year? Thank you.\nAnthony Noto : Yes. Thank you for the question. We noted in the press release and prepared remarks that we hit a couple of key inflection points in the year. One of the biggest inflection points is that our NIM, our lending net interest margin revenue is now greater than our noninterest revenue, and that's a pretty big milestone. It reflects a lot of initiatives over the last five years, one of which was getting the bank license and being able to use the deposits to fund our loans and not have to recycle that cash through quick sales, et cetera.  So we have the luxury of being able to look in the marketplace, look at our balance sheet and make the best decisions for long-term returns. And as we've done that, we've been able to hold loans longer and generate that revenue stream that's more recurring from net interest margin. You should expect the NIM to continue to grow, both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue in the lending sector. The second big accomplishment was that, for the full year, we were able to -- sorry, in the fourth quarter, we were able to get the NIM revenue greater than the directly attributable fixed cost of the lending business, meaning the non-interest income lending revenue was it needed to get to profitability at the contribution basis in Q4, which is another big milestone but you should expect that to continue to grow. It is a revenue stream that's more visible, more consistent than gain on sale noninterest income. But we have the luxury of making the best choices based on the marketplace.  I'll let Chris talk about the specifics in terms of securitizations versus whole loan sales versus holding.\nChris Lapointe : Yes. In terms of the ABS market, we're seeing the exact same trends that you highlighted in your question. Back in November, we actually did a $600 million term securitization deal at an attractive cost relative to where we expect warehouse cost of funding to be in 2023, and things have continued to improve in the overall market in the first month of this year. So we expect to be able to access that market here in Q1 and for the rest of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open, please go ahead. \nMoshe Orenbuch: So maybe as a follow-up to that, can you talk about what you actually sold during the quarter in personal and student? And did you actually buy any portfolios during the period as well?\nChris Lapointe : Yes, I can hit on that. So in terms of sales for the quarter, we ended up relying predominantly on deposit funding, warehouse funding and that term securitization. We did about $200 million worth of whole loan sales and the $600 million term securitization, so about $800 million in total.  In terms of loan purchases, like I said during the last quarter, having the bank with a large and growing deposit base, provides us with much more flexibility and a new source of funding our loans, which allows us to grow the balance sheet and hold loans for a longer period of time. There are a few ways that we can bring loans on to the balance sheet. We can go out and pay an upfront marketing costs and originate them, or we can purchase the loans. So similar to Q3, we had the opportunity to buy some seasoned loans. This time, they were from -- they were in the student loan refinancing space, and these were all loans that we originally underwrote. Overall size was about half of what we did in Q3. And given the credit quality loss profile and return characteristics, we jumped on the opportunity as we knew the borrower best, and it's will set us up for really strong net interest income in the coming quarters given our overall cost of funding. And then we also had a few hundred million dollars of normal course cleanup calls on some of our consolidated securitizations that were several years seasoned.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Eugene Simuni of [Towers] (ph). Your line is now open, please go ahead. \nEugene Simuni: This is Eugene Simuni from MoffettNathanson. Hi, guys, how are you?  Quick question from me back to the outlook for 2023, very helpful to have the color, Chris. But I was wondering on the swing factors, let's say, the factors that would allow you to go to the high end of your guide, What would be the top two or three things that you guys are looking for that could swing the results here in 2023?\nAnthony Noto: Eugene, thank you for the question. There's a -- Chris laid out in our prepared remarks some of the underlying assumptions, both macro and micro. On the macro side, GDP growth, that's not as a dower as we have in our forecast and our implications, so a stronger economy than what we have. And we have a, we think, a relatively conservative i.e. low number for GDP, decline of about 2.5%.  Unemployment, we had at 5%. That's a factor if it comes in worse than that, that could be a negative, a tailwind would be if it sells in the 4s. And then on interest rates, we have them peaking up 5% and then coming back down to about 4.5%. If rates came back even more than 4.5% and sold than the 4% range, I think we could be at an optimal part of the curve as it relates to passing on coupons, profitability per loan as well as the NIM that we can make relative to our deposits would be a pretty good outcome. Separate from that, for the technology platform sector, we have a really robust pipeline. It's more diverse. But more importantly, there are many members -- sorry, clients in our pipeline that have large existing consumer bases or user bases. And to the extent that those become launched in 2023 before the second half of the year, we can benefit from upside in those large partners coming on board from the tech sector. As it relates to the financial services sector, I really believe we have a lot of upside in the invest category. We are quickly launching new products to make sure that we have some table stakes products, but also some more innovative differentiation selection. And I think that if we're able to launch those to a receptive member base and the user base, it could be a tailwind. Second thing that could be a tailwind to invest is if the IPO market opens back up, we can underwrite IPOs. We're the sole retail distribution channel for the Rivian IPO. We participated in the new bank. Our members want access to IPOs and IPO prices. We're uniquely providing Main Street with access to IPO prices at those -- IPOs and IPO prices.  To the extent the calendar opens back up, we have a pipeline there as well, which helps both with adoption of the product by new users because they want that unique selection, but it also drives incremental assets under management, which allows us to drive more revenue and monetize more. So those are some of the underlying trends that could give us a tailwind when we pass over to Chris...\nChris Lapointe: Yes. The only other thing I would add to that, Anthony, is back to one of the comments that I made a few minutes ago around credit spreads. So implied in our guidance, and what I mentioned is that we're expecting to see continued elevated credit spreads throughout the year. Obviously, things are looking pretty good in January and spreads have tightened and the ABS market seems to be showing some signs of life. So if that continues throughout the year, there could be additional upside in the lending business as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mihir Bhatia Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open, please go ahead. \nMihir Bhatia : Good morning. And thank you for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask about the Technology Platform segment. Sounds like a little bit of, maybe not change but refinement in the strategy as you go after -- you're focusing on quality of clients and bigger clients with existing basis. What are some of the implications of that strategy? And I was also curious in terms of just new product introductions or cross-sell to existing clients in that segment, like as we think about your growth from here, how much of it is going to come from cross sell, cross biofuel in that segment versus some winning some of these new large partners? Thank you.\nAnthony Noto : Thank you for the question. And I think you characterized it appropriate in that it's a refinement of the strategy. Now that we're operating on one unified platform with both Technisys and Galileo, we can leverage the combined go-to-market and that does drive some synergy cost savings, which is why Chris mentioned small head count reduction. But there're also cost savings in different areas like marketing when you have that unified approach, especially in the United States. In addition to that, we've made really significant investments in the tech platform over the last three years. We've increased headcount by 2.5x. We moved to the cloud while maintaining on-prem capabilities. The on-prem will now go away this year.  We've also done a great job at adding new partners. We've been adding 20-plus partners a year. As we look at the macroeconomic environment and where we sit, we think the right strategy for the year is to focus on durable companies with large installed bases, or well-capitalized companies that we know can make the transition and that we'll get a great return to leverage our platform capabilities. And so that's how we're approaching the year. For the first time, we're going to have meaningful margin expansion in the tech platform to start to leverage that investment we made, but we're still investing, and we're still growing.  And let me give you an example of some of the areas that we've invested in that we expect to bear fruit this year, and we'll keep investing in. First and foremost, we wanted to diversify our products just out of a debit or interchange ACH type of product expanded in the B2B category. We have a number of new B2B partners that are generating revenue today. Some are doing small and medium business lending, some are simply using it for payments and for accounts receivable and accounts payable.  But there's a good pipeline of other partners that have large fleets as well as big economy companies, et cetera. In addition to building out the B2B channel, we've also tried to add more products for consumer-facing clients. And so one of the products that we have that's been adopted as Secure Card. Another product that we've launched more recently is a fraud protection. As you think about fraud, and you think about the scale of some of the partners of Galileo, they may not have the scale to invest in fraud the way that we can, and they may not have the data that we have to actually drive those models. And so we've rolled out 1 piece of a fraud platform that we want to make available to all of our partners.  If we can help them eliminate fraud, it not only saves losses, but it actually makes their service more reliable, reduces the overhead they have in the call centers and also allows them to hit better SLAs in servicing their customers when they do have issues that have to be solved. So it's a classic major footprint, bringing your foot type of product.  In addition to that, we're focused on things that will help them drive engagement. So we've launched a direct deposit switching product, and you'll see us continue to do more to drive more engagement. Things like instant funding are another vehicle that makes the movement of money faster and better for our partners. And then last, we just launched our first product on both Galileo and Technisys SoFi, which is paying for. That product is now available for any of our partners. And if you think about the partners at Galileo, many of them are not playing the same segment that we are. We're at a very high-end customer with high FICO score and high income. Most of the scale in Galileo's partners is actually at the unbanked or underbanked. A Pay-in-4 product is much better for them than a secure card or unsecured loan or a credit card, and that product can be launched in a turnkey fashion with a much higher interchange of about 3% compared to what we're generating at 1% in debit. It does bring with it some risk and so we'll have to wait cautiously into that market with our partners. But it's another example of the innovation that we've driven that we now think we can get a return on revenue against. And the last thing I'll touch on is Connect. It's not something we've talked about on the call before, but we think it's a diamond in the rough, so to speak. It's an AI-driven customer service model that uses both voice and text. And that product is one that SoFi has now adopted, and that's after SoFi did a complete RFP of all the different choices and determined Connect to be the best choice for our company and we'll continue to invest in that product it's available to our partners as well.  And the last thing where I'd say about our strategy relates to the technology platform is that the opportunity to expand geographically is bigger than you could imagine. We have to really pace our level of investment. And while we're not expanding geographically today, there's a lot of penetration within the LatAm market, which is our area of focus, especially with Technisys in more than 12 markets, helping, cross-sell Galileo's products.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev of Mizuho. Your line is now open, please go ahead. \nDan Dolev : Great results. Thanks for squeezing me in. Can you maybe give us some quarterly trends on sort of particularly the three metrics, student loans, personal loans and mortgages, just kind of how things are trending through, say, the end of January? Thank you.\nChris Lapointe : Yes. So thanks, Dan, for the question. So we aren't providing specific views on how things are trending right now. But what I would say is, on the student loan front, through January, as mentioned in our guide, we expect it to be at the existing run rate levels that we saw in Q3 and Q4.  In personal loans, things are progressing. As one would expect, there's a lot of headroom in that business, but we're being mindful with respect to credit. And then on the home loan side, we have made some really good progress over the course of the last two to three months in terms of some of those fulfillment issues that we've talked about previously and things are trending in the right direction. Anthony, I don't know if it's anything you'd add there?\nAnthony Noto : Yes. The only other thing I'd add, Dan, as I did say in my prepared remarks that we're seeing the strong trend in member and product growth continue to Q1. We've, throughout the year, constantly iterating on marketing channels, on marketing messages, on life cycle marketing and leveraging the most efficient channels. And I feel like, in the fourth quarter, we -- it was a culmination of a lot of work over the last two years, and we saw the benefit of that. And as we started the new year, we continue to see that. So we feel really great about not just the growth rate in members as well as products, but the quality of those members and product adoption in addition to the cost of acquisition.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citigroup. Your line is now open, please go ahead. \nAshwin Shirvaikar : Thank you. Congratulations on the results. Questions on the process of transfer to new fulfillment partners. And you just mentioned the last two, three months have been good, Chris. But what should investors expect in terms of time line, financial impact? It's been a few quarters this has come up, and what's the main factors that seem to be, I guess, affecting a more timely transition?\nAnthony Noto : Yes. And just to give you a little bit of history here, we had a partner that was helping us drive great success on the back-end fulfillment side of the equation. We do the -- we do the marketing to drive the demand at the top of the funnel. We do the underwriting for the loans. And after that, loan is locked. We partner with a film partner to get through all the all the steps after that.  That partner unfortunately got acquired. We were then required to make a technology platform switch with the new acquired company, which was costly and time-consuming. And ultimately, the economics that entity was seeing became quite onerous as rates increased, and we realized that the economic relationship that we had was changing, and we needed another partner.  We started pursuing other partners, quite frankly, well before that acquisition happened just needing diversification. And so we fast-tracked the second partner that we needed to transition to. That transition didn't happen as quickly as we would hope.  I will tell you, in the last two months, we've seen more progress there than we have in the last 18 months, and I'm encouraged by the progress the team has made, both in terms of the technology integration, the process flow, the ability to hit time-to-funding metrics and serve our members better. We're nowhere near perfect, but we're starting to move in the right direction for the first time in a while. In terms of the economic impact on the overall business, Chris was pretty clear in saying that it will ramp throughout the year. I would think about it as more second half of the year than the first half of the year. But the team is executing in a way that I think positions us really strongly to start stepping on the gas a little bit more as it relates to demand. We've had our foot off the gas, quite frankly, because we don't want to generate demand that we can't fulfill in a high-quality way. And we're starting to get to the point, I think, we'll be there by the second half of the year where we can step on the gas and start to see a much bigger market share gain there. We have such a small market share. Even with higher interest rates, I think there's a huge opportunity for us to drive revenue there as well as that revenue being profitable. In addition to that, we do, at some point, similar to the rest of our businesses, want to own end-to-end. We own lending from metal to glass, so to speak, and it gives us such advantages on iterating, on testing, on pricing, on credit, on user flow, on fraud, on risk. And we see the same thing now in SoFi Money, owning Galileo and having the benefit of Technisys as well.  And so at some point, in home volumes, we'll own the back end also. We'll always partner. It's great to have two sources of capacity, especially given our aspirations and how big we think this could be. It is a huge financial transaction for our members. It is emotional transaction, and we need to be able to scale it and meet the needs of all of our members, and that's where we're focused on long term.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Hecht of Jefferies. Your line is now open, please go ahead. \nJohn Hecht : Thanks for taking my question. Again also you talked about B2B estimates starting up. And you guys have [indiscernible] on live in the uses and members and change in terms of marketing and customers and members. And how do you think about any opportunities in 2023?\nAnthony Noto : John, it was really hard to hear your question. I don't want to guess what your question was. Maybe you could just dial back in with a better connection. I heard something about B2B and that it was pretty muted after that.\nJohn Hecht : Is this better? Sorry, guys, is this better?\nAnthony Noto : Yes. Perfect. Thank you.\nJohn Hecht : I'm sorry, can you hear me now?\nAnthony Noto : Yes, we can hear you.\nJohn Hecht : Okay. I apologize as my headphones are bad. The question was just, Anthony, you mentioned B2B activity. You guys clearly still have very positive momentum with new members and new customers. I'm wondering, given your channels of customer acquisition, the cost of customer acquisition, has there anything changed from a characteristic perspective? And how do you look at opportunities from that regard in 2023?\nAnthony Noto : Yes. So the SMB opportunity, I think, is really an opportunity that's aligned with the type of member that we're acquiring in our core target. We don't have plans in 2023 to enter that market. We do believe it's an opportunity for us over the longer term to serve that market well. If you follow us on any social media, it's a constant requests that we get from people to launch small and medium business checking and savings, small medium business lending.  When the pandemic first started back in 2020 March time period, we were inundated with tons of small medium businesses coming on to SoFi and trying to apply for PPP loans. We clearly don't have small, medium lending now that we have a banking license. That is an area that we could go into, but we did at that point in time. We stood up a website that allowed us to take the traffic that came to SoFi and leverage lantern to send the traffic to a marketplace of small, medium business lenders. And it was very -- people were very happy with it. The demand, as a result of that, led us to realize that many of our members are operating small medium businesses and that we could serve them on the commercial side as well. But as I mentioned, it's not something that we do in 2023. I would never say that would say the same. We'll review it every quarter. If the student loan market came back sooner than expected, and some of the other things went our way in the economy and so forth, it may be something that we could focus on in the second half of the year. But right now, it's not on the funding list, but it's a huge opportunity for us. The only reason I mentioned it earlier was, we had asked -- been asked the question earlier about deposits and what happened if they grow too big, and that would be a great problem to have. If they grow in excess of what we're willing to originate on the personal loan side and SLR side and home loan side and credit cards, we would offer more lending products to make sure we're capturing that great resource of deposits to deploy against high-returning assets.\nOperator: Our last question today comes from the line of Michael Perito of Stifel [ph]. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nMichael Perito : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Obviously, you guys have hit on a lot already this morning. I thought maybe I'd just ask Chris, just can you maybe give us some reminder or some context around how you guys are thinking of capital of the bank in your 2023 projections, obviously, very healthy still today. But imagine in the guide, there's a bit of balance sheet growth baked as you guys done in 2022. I'm just curious where you kind of have the capital ratios levering to and how that compares to kind of where you want to run the bank normalized going forward?\nChris Lapointe : Yes. Thanks, Mike, for the question. So I'm not going to be providing guidance on the balance sheet side within the bank, but I'll at least provide a little bit of insight on how we're thinking about it. So right now, we've capitalized the bank with about $1 billion of capital. You'll see that in the bank call report that comes out later today. We're currently operating at about a 15% leverage ratio, which is still significantly above our regulatory limits.  So we do expect to see additional balance sheet growth as we continue to scale our lending business. We expect modest growth in our personal loans business and then relatively muted in the student loan refinancing and some growth in home loans. The only other thing I would add in terms of being able to grow the bank balance sheet is that we are sufficiently capitalized at the parent as well. We're coming off of a year in 2021 of raising over $3.5 billion of capital, and we've only deployed $1 billion of that to the bank. So we have sufficient excess liquidity that we could capitalize the bank and grow it further if we wanted to.\nAnthony Noto : And the only thing I would add on to that is something we were talking about as a team yesterday that doesn't get a lot of attention. But when you look at the asset side of our balance sheet and you look at the trend, and you look at our cash and cash equivalents, we finished the year at $1.4 billion of cash and cash approvals. What's not in that number is $424 million of restricted cash.  And then there's some investment securities, which is a combination of treasuries and government securities as well as loans or what we said, of about $400 million. The trend in that line has been continuing to increase, which speaks not only to the liquidity that we have but the equity that we have that we can deploy either against funding loans or funding the bank. And it's one of the important measures that we'll continue to give you a -- somewhat of a level of confidence on being able to fund the bank to grow more if we need to put more equity there. Great. Thank you for dialing in, so I want to end with a couple of comments. February marks my five-year anniversary at SoFi, and it's just very humbling what we've achieved during such an unprecedented time period, growing from less than $500 million of revenue to $1.5 billion at the end of 2022, 600,000 members to 5.2 million members and negative adjusted EBITDA to $140 million of EBITDA, plus raising $3.6 billion in capital, becoming a public company and receiving a federal bank license.  To have done all of that through two interest rate cycles, a recession, with the potential for another, a global pandemic, inflation at a 40-year high and in an incredibly competitive environment with significant access to near zero cost of capital is a remarkable five-year run. None of this, though, happens without the full faith of our Board and our shareholders, the persistent and unrelenting resolve of our people and a team that have done nothing short of extraordinary. Many can prognosticate about what lies ahead for the economy, interest rates, but in my view, the political background, the regulatory background remain very uncertain. And those exogenous factors are out of our control. But as it relates to what lies ahead, I will simply state my strongest belief that SoFi continues to be the best positioned company, to be the winner that takes most in the digital financial services sector of the future. Reaching the outcome is what we control, and what we remain steadfastly focused on to achieve. With that, thank you for calling in and listening to our fourth quarter results as well as our 2022 full year results. We'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Goodbye. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Have a great day ahead. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Chris Lapointe",
            "content": "Thanks, Anthony, and good morning, everyone. We finished off a remarkable year while navigating a rapidly evolving macro backdrop even as our previously largest and most profitable business operated at 25% of Q4 2019 pre-COVID volumes. This proves once again that our diversified and differentiated business model drives SoFi's durability and long-term growth potential. I'm going to walk you through some key financial highlights and then share some color on our outlook. Unless otherwise stated, I'll be referring to adjusted results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2022 versus fourth quarter and full year of 2021. Our GAAP consolidated income statement and all reconciliations can be found in today's earnings release and the subsequent 10-K filing, which will be made available in the coming weeks. For the quarter, top line growth accelerated, and we delivered record adjusted net revenue of $443 million, up 58% year-over-year and 6% sequentially from the third quarter's record of $419 million and above the high end of the guidance provided during our last earnings call.  Adjusted EBITDA was $70 million at a 16% margin, also above the high end of our most recent guidance. We saw 14 points of year-over-year and five points of sequential margin improvement, demonstrating the strong operating leverage of the business as it scales. Year-over-year margin improvement has been driven by significant operating leverage across our sales and marketing, G&A and Ops functional expense lines. Overall, this resulted in a 40% incremental adjusted EBITDA margin year-over-year. Our GAAP net losses were $40 million this quarter, a $71 million improvement year-over-year and $34 million improvement sequentially. Incremental GAAP net income margin was 42% year-over-year, a notable step in our path to GAAP profitability. In addition to our adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, we saw meaningful leverage against stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue at 16% in Q4 2022, down from 27.5% in the same prior year period, putting us well on our path to longer-term goal of single-digit stock-based compensation margins as previously communicated. For the full year, we delivered $1.54 billion of adjusted net revenue, up 53% year-over-year from $1.01 billion in 2021. As a reminder, we revised our annual guidance in April of 2022 following the extension of the moratorium on federal student loan payments.  Our updated guidance for the year included $1.47 billion in adjusted net revenue and $100 million in adjusted EBITDA. This guidance contemplated an ultimate extension in the moratorium until year-end, which implied a Q4 ramp in student loan refinancing activity ahead of the anticipated resumption of federal payments.  From an adjusted EBITDA perspective, we delivered $143 million in profit, nearly 5 times that of 2021, and $63 million above the guidance we presented following the moratorium extension I just discussed. 2022 delivered a 9% adjusted EBITDA margin, 630 basis points of improvement from 2021.  Even with the recent subsequent extension of the moratorium through June of 2023, which impeded the expected Q4 2022 ramp in student loan refi demand, we still exceeded that revenue guidance by $80 million and adjusted EBITDA by $43 million. We achieved these results by implementing new strategies and through nimble asset allocation, which speaks to our ability to leverage the diversity of our revenue streams. Now on to the segment level performance, where we saw strong growth across all three segments. In lending, fourth quarter adjusted net revenue grew 51% year-over-year to $315 million. Results were driven by 138% year-over-year growth in our net interest income, while noninterest income was relatively flat.  Growth in net interest income was driven by a 109% year-over-year increase in average interest-earning assets and a 317-basis point year-over-year increase in average yield, slightly offset by 162 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. This resulted in average net interest margin of 5.94% for the quarter, up 141 basis points year-over-year.  Noninterest income was relatively flat year-over-year as increased personal loan originations at higher weighted average coupons were largely offset by lower student loan and home loan originations. Personal loan originations grew 50% year-over-year to $2.5 billion, while student loan originations were down 73% and home loan originations were down 84% year-over-year as a result of macro headwinds and a continued transition of home loan fulfillment partners. Overall, we achieved strong top line growth, while maintaining our stringent credit standards and disciplined focus on quality. Our personal loan borrowers weighted average income is $165,000, with a weighted average FICO score of 747. Our student loan borrowers weighted average income is $170,000, with a weighted average FICO of 773. This focus on quality has led to continued strong credit performance. In fact, our on-balance sheet delinquency rates and charge-off rates remain healthy and are still below pre-COVID levels.  Our on-balance sheet 90-day personal loan delinquency rate was 34 basis points in Q4 '22, while our annualized personal loan charge-off rate was 2.47%. Our on-balance sheet 90-day student loan delinquency rate was 13 basis points in Q4 2022, while our annualized student loan charge-off rate was 0.37%. As we have expressed in the past, it is reasonable to expect credit metrics to revert over time to more normalized pre-pandemic levels, but we continue to expect very healthy performance relative to broader industry benchmarks. The lending business delivered $209 million of contribution profit at a 66% margin, up from $105 million a year ago and a 51% margin.  This improvement was driven by a mix shift to higher-margin personal loans revenue, along with marketing and ops efficiencies as well as fixed cost leverage across the entire segment. For the full year, lending adjusted net revenue grew 45% to $1.11 billion, and the segment delivered $664 million of contribution profit at a 60% margin. Shifting to our tech platform, where we delivered net revenue of $86 million in the quarter, up 61% year-over-year, or up 13% excluding Technisys. Overall, annual revenue growth was driven by 31% year-over-year Galileo account growth to $131 million in total as well as sequential growth in transactions per active account.  We also signed 11 new clients, four of which are in the B2B space and three of which are in Mexico, further diversifying our partner base. During the quarter, one of our clients migrated the majority of their processing volumes to a pure processor, which resulted in a $6 million to $7 million revenue headwind in period. Segment contribution profit of $17 million represented a 20% margin and 24%, if you were to exclude Technisys. For the full year, the Tech Platform segment grew revenue 62% to $315 million, and delivered $76 million of contribution profit at a 24% margin. Excluding Technisys, revenue growth was 24% year-over-year and contribution margin was 30%. Moving on to Financial Services, where net revenue of $65 million increased 195% year-over-year, with new all-time high revenue for SoFi Money and continued strong contributions from SoFi Credit Card, SoFi Invest and Lending as a service.  Overall monetization continues to improve with annualized revenue per product increasing to $40, nearly 2 times the $21 in the same prior year quarter and up 25% sequentially from $34. We reached 6.6 million Financial Services products, up 60% year-over-year by adding 635,000 new products in the quarter. We now have 2.2 million products in SoFi Money, 2.2 million in SoFi Invest and 1.9 million in Relay. Contribution losses were $44 million for the quarter, which improved sequentially as a result of the growth in revenue as well as fixed cost leverage, but increased year-over-year, predominantly as a result of building our CECL reserves for the SoFi credit card business, which is expected as we continue to grow in scale. In addition, we saw a year-over-year reduction in higher-margin digital assets revenue. For the full year, the segment delivered $168 million of revenue, which is nearly 3 times the $58 million we delivered in 2021, and our contribution losses were $199 million. Notably, that's a 21% improvement in contribution loss per average product during 2022 versus 2021. Switching to our balance sheet, where we remain very well capitalized with ample cash, excess liquidity and strong regulatory capital and leverage ratios.  This year's opening of SoFi Bank further reinforces our strength and provides more flexibility and access to a lower cost of capital relative to alternative sources of funding. In Q4, assets grew by $3.2 billion as a result of the strong growth we continue to see in personal loan originations. On the liability side, we saw tremendous growth in deposits to $7.3 billion, up $2.3 billion quarter-over-quarter. Because of this, we exited the quarter with $3.1 billion drawn on our $8.4 billion of warehouse facilities, which represents 36% of our total available capacity. Our current book value is $5.5 billion, and our tangible book value has grown for two consecutive quarters, with more than a $50 million increase sequentially in Q4. Let me finish up with guidance. Before going through the specific numbers, I want to hit on some of the larger macro assumptions that underpin our financial guidance. From an interest rate perspective, we are assuming an outlook consistent with the consensus forward curve, with a peak Fed funds rate reaching approximately 5% in Q2 2023, with two rate cuts in the back half of the year to get us to a 4.5% exit rate in 2023.  We are assuming a 2.5% contraction in GDP and a normalization of unemployment to around 5%. And from a credit perspective, we are expecting a continuation of elevated credit spreads across capital markets and a continued normalization of consumer credit. For Q1, we expect to deliver adjusted net revenue of $430 million to $440 million and adjusted EBITDA of $40 million to $45 million. For the full year of 2023, we expect to deliver adjusted net revenue of $1.925 billion to $2.0 billion, representing 25% to 30% growth and adjusted EBITDA of $260 million to $280 million.  Our outlook represents 30% incremental EBITDA margins for full year 2023 versus full year of 2022, and we expect to reach quarterly GAAP net income profitability by Q4 2023, with GAAP net income incremental margins for the full year of 20%. Finally, quickly hitting on a few key points for each segment. In our lending segment, we expect the Department of Education's moratorium on federal student loan payments to extend through June 30, 2023, at which point there are 60 days before repayments actually begin. Accordingly, our outlook assumes that we will be operating in our current run rate levels until September. After September, we do believe there will be a recovery to a higher levels of student loan refinancing revenue than the current trend, but we do not expect to return to pre-COVID levels in 2023. In our personal loans business, we expect to see modest growth as we balance taking advantage of ample headroom in this business given our current market share and differentiated product with a thoughtful and prudent approach to ensuring our credit remains very high quality. We remain committed to underwriting to an industry-leading life of loan loss profile. In our Tech Platform segment, one year of focus for us in 2023 is on quality of new clients, including size, durability and time to market over quantity, which means bigger wins that leverage the combined go-to-market value proposition of the Tech Platform, while still investing in focused new product areas to drive diversification.  While we expect low double-digit organic revenue growth in 2023 due to this focus, and a variety of other factors, our longer-term strategy is already starting to pay off with greater diversification in our pipeline and significant margin expansion expected in 2023. After a three-year investment period in the Tech Platform, including moving to the cloud, a 2.5x increase in head count, the acquisition of Technisys and launching new product capabilities, we will increasingly focus on leveraging the value of our investments through the synergies between the two product lines, Technisys and Galileo, as well as through joint product offerings, all to drive meaningful contribution profit growth relative to revenue growth.  In starting to operate as one unified technology platform, we have recognized opportunities to reduce our costs, including a small reduction in head count. In Financial Services, we expect continued strong growth in revenue, driven by growth in products as well as increased monetization per product as we scale deposits, spend and AUM. We Importantly, we will front-load investments in the year to take advantage of attractive opportunities to continue to scale our high-quality deposit base. In summary, we could not be more-proud of the results SoFi delivered in 2022. We exceeded $1.5 billion in annual revenue and grew adjusted EBITDA nearly 5 times to more than $140 million. We continue to be extremely well capitalized and are excited about the opportunities in front of us. We look forward to another strong year in 2023. And with that, let's open it up to questions. Yes, sure. So, I can hit that one, and Anthony can chime in. So, in terms of our overall outlook on originations, going back to what I said in my prepared remarks, we are assuming modest growth in our personal loans business. We do see there being ample headroom for continued growth given where our market share is today. Currently, we're at about a 6% market share in our credit box. That's up from about 4.5% a year ago.  So significant headroom ahead of us, but we are going to take a prudent approach to this and continue to monitor credit and make changes as necessary. In student loan refinancing, we're assuming that originations are at the current run rate levels at least through the end of August of 2023, and we do expect a bit of an uptick once the moratorium ends in June followed by a 60-day extension. And then in-home loan originations, we expect to continue at the current pace that we're at right now with a potential uptick in the back half of the year as we resolve all of our fulfillment issues. Yes. In terms of the ABS market, we're seeing the exact same trends that you highlighted in your question. Back in November, we actually did a $600 million term securitization deal at an attractive cost relative to where we expect warehouse cost of funding to be in 2023, and things have continued to improve in the overall market in the first month of this year. So we expect to be able to access that market here in Q1 and for the rest of the year. Yes, I can hit on that. So in terms of sales for the quarter, we ended up relying predominantly on deposit funding, warehouse funding and that term securitization. We did about $200 million worth of whole loan sales and the $600 million term securitization, so about $800 million in total.  In terms of loan purchases, like I said during the last quarter, having the bank with a large and growing deposit base, provides us with much more flexibility and a new source of funding our loans, which allows us to grow the balance sheet and hold loans for a longer period of time. There are a few ways that we can bring loans on to the balance sheet. We can go out and pay an upfront marketing costs and originate them, or we can purchase the loans. So similar to Q3, we had the opportunity to buy some seasoned loans. This time, they were from -- they were in the student loan refinancing space, and these were all loans that we originally underwrote. Overall size was about half of what we did in Q3. And given the credit quality loss profile and return characteristics, we jumped on the opportunity as we knew the borrower best, and it's will set us up for really strong net interest income in the coming quarters given our overall cost of funding. And then we also had a few hundred million dollars of normal course cleanup calls on some of our consolidated securitizations that were several years seasoned. Yes. The only other thing I would add to that, Anthony, is back to one of the comments that I made a few minutes ago around credit spreads. So implied in our guidance, and what I mentioned is that we're expecting to see continued elevated credit spreads throughout the year. Obviously, things are looking pretty good in January and spreads have tightened and the ABS market seems to be showing some signs of life. So if that continues throughout the year, there could be additional upside in the lending business as well. Yes. So thanks, Dan, for the question. So we aren't providing specific views on how things are trending right now. But what I would say is, on the student loan front, through January, as mentioned in our guide, we expect it to be at the existing run rate levels that we saw in Q3 and Q4.  In personal loans, things are progressing. As one would expect, there's a lot of headroom in that business, but we're being mindful with respect to credit. And then on the home loan side, we have made some really good progress over the course of the last two to three months in terms of some of those fulfillment issues that we've talked about previously and things are trending in the right direction. Anthony, I don't know if it's anything you'd add there? Yes. Thanks, Mike, for the question. So I'm not going to be providing guidance on the balance sheet side within the bank, but I'll at least provide a little bit of insight on how we're thinking about it. So right now, we've capitalized the bank with about $1 billion of capital. You'll see that in the bank call report that comes out later today. We're currently operating at about a 15% leverage ratio, which is still significantly above our regulatory limits.  So we do expect to see additional balance sheet growth as we continue to scale our lending business. We expect modest growth in our personal loans business and then relatively muted in the student loan refinancing and some growth in home loans. The only other thing I would add in terms of being able to grow the bank balance sheet is that we are sufficiently capitalized at the parent as well. We're coming off of a year in 2021 of raising over $3.5 billion of capital, and we've only deployed $1 billion of that to the bank. So we have sufficient excess liquidity that we could capitalize the bank and grow it further if we wanted to."

            "name": "Anthony Noto",
            "content": "Thank you, Maura, and good morning, everyone. 2022 was a remarkable year for SoFi. We accomplished more than any of us could have hoped for. Our resilient team drove great execution of our strategy that has proven to provide the benefits of business diversification and durability to deliver exceptional growth and improving profitability.  Our adjusted net revenue grew 52% in 2022 to over $1.5 billion, and we delivered nearly 5 times the adjusted EBITDA we did in 2021. We obtained a national bank license, which could not have come at a better time, allowing us to be incredibly flexible in a rapidly changing environment. We're offering a compelling SoFi Money product that is driving high-quality direct deposit customers spending and deposit balances. The deposits bolster and diversify our source of funding enabling us to offer our best rates on loans, while generating impressive returns and improving net interest income revenue. In fact, 2022 marks the first time our lending net interest income revenue of $530 million by itself exceeded our total directly attributable lending cost of $443 million.  we grew our deposits 7 times to $7.3 billion from $1 billion over the course of the year, really powering that cycle. We grew our member base by 1.8 million to 5.2 million members, nearly 9 times our size in 2018. We acquired Technisys, adding a critical capability as we build our end-to-end technology stack and bringing us one step closer to being the AWS of fintech.  We navigated unparalleled market volatility, macro headwinds, high inflation and increasing interest rates and two unexpected extensions of the student loan moratorium by reacting nimbly and leveraging the diversification of our business to hit record revenue in each quarter of the year. The fourth quarter was an incredible end to an exceptional year. We delivered another quarter of record adjusted net revenue and adjusted EBITDA and strong overall operating results. A few key achievements from the quarter include our seventh consecutive quarter of record adjusted net revenue of $443 million, up 58% year-over-year, which accelerated from 51% year-over-year growth in the third quarter and reflects record revenue in all three business segments.  Record adjusted EBITDA of $70 million was up 58% quarter-over-quarter, that is nearly equal to the total adjusted EBITDA in the first three quarters of the year combined. In Q4, we achieved a couple of important financial inflection points. Adjusted EBITDA was $70 million is now largely equal to share-based compensation expense of $71 million, a critical step toward GAAP net income profitability. Additionally, net interest income revenue, or NIM revenue of $183 million exceeded lending noninterest net revenue of $144 million for the first time. And importantly, our NIM revenue is meaningfully greater than our directly attributable lending expense of $106 million. In Q4, we had an incremental GAAP net income margin of 42%, resulting in a loss of just $40 million, roughly half of the third quarter 2022 loss. Said another way, of the $171 million of incremental GAAP revenue year-over-year, $71 million or 42% dropped to the GAAP net income line. Given these accomplishments, in our 2023 plan, we expect to achieve quarterly positive GAAP net income in Q4 2023. Our strategy is to continue to play out with SoFi Money, which allowed us to surpass $7.3 billion in deposits, up 46% quarter-over-quarter, and savings of 190 basis points on cost of funds versus using other sources of debt to fund loans. Another quarter of positive GAAP net income for the SoFi Bank at over $30 million and at an 11% margin. Finally, we grew our tangible book value for the overall company for the second consecutive quarter. Q4 also saw our second highest quarter ever of member adds and our third highest quarter of product adds with strong momentum continuing into Q1. The 487,000 new members in Q4 2022 brings total members to 5.2 million, up 51% year-over-year. We also added nearly 700,000 new products in Q4, ending with nearly 7.9 million total products, up 53% year-over-year. Of these new adds, financial services products grew by 60% year-over-year to $6.6 million, while lending products were up 24% to over $1.3 million. The strength of our results, once again, underscores how our full suite of differentiated products and services provides a uniquely diversified business that has been not only able to endure, but to thrive through market cycles. Now I'd like to touch on segment level results, with a particular focus on the benefits of our diversified business drivers as well as the structural advantage of our bank charter. In lending, we generated a record of $315 million of adjusted net revenue, up 51% versus the prior year period.  Our personal loan performance more than offset the continued lack of demand in student loan refinancing and the less robust performance of home loans. Student loan refi continues to be negatively impacted as federal borrowers again await clarity on the end of the moratorium of federal student loan payments. Home loans faces macro headwinds from high rates, while we continue the process of transitioning to new fulfillment partners. The personal loans business maintained its strength in Q4. We originated nearly $2.5 billion, up 50% from $1.6 billion in Q4 2021. This product continues to deliver even as we've raised our coupons to our borrowers as a result of rate increases and maintained our stringent underwriting criteria.  While these origination levels themselves are impressive, the strength of our balance sheet and diversification of our funding sources provide new options to fund lending growth while driving efficiency with cost savings. These advantages are a direct result of SoFi Bank. Having more flexibility with our balance sheet allows us to capture more NIM and optimize returns, a critical advantage in light of the macro uncertainty. Additionally, by using our deposits as a funding source, we benefit from a lower cost of funding for loans. In Q4, the difference in our deposit cost of funds and warehouse cost of funds was approximately 190 basis points, where it was 125 basis points in Q3, and just 100 basis points in Q2, a powerful benefit in a rising rate environment. Lastly, the bank contributes to strong growth in SoFi Money members, high-quality deposits and improved levels of spending and engagement. This has led to higher average balances even as average spend has increased. Of the $7.3 billion in deposits at quarter end, 88% were from direct deposit members. Roughly 50% of newly funded SoFi Money accounts are setting up direct deposit by day 30 versus 20% in Q4 '21, and this has had a significant positive impact on spending. Q4 annualized spend was 3.4 times 2021 total spend, and Q4 spend per average funded account was up 25% quarter-over-quarter. SoFi Money members have increased nearly 53% year-over-year to 2.2 million in total. Given the quality of these members with 745 median FICO score, we see ample opportunity for cross-buy. This is a great segue into financial services more broadly, where net revenue nearly tripled year-over-year to $64 million and grew 32% from $49 million sequentially in Q3. Moreover, Financial Services annualized revenue is now approximately $260 million. Contribution loss of $44 million improved $9 million versus the third quarter, even as we invested $13 million more in marketing in the fourth quarter. We saw this as a worthwhile opportunity to attract more direct deposit members. Even with this spend, variable profit, including all marketing costs, improved quarter-over-quarter and was nearly breakeven.  We still anticipate the Financial Services segment will be contribution profit positive in 2023 as we continue to scale and monetize the business. We finished Q4 with 6.6 million in Financial Services products, up 60% year-over-year, and 4.9 times total lending products of $1.3 million. The increased scale of Financial Services helps drive cross buy and marketing efficiencies over time.  The scale of Financial Services not only drives cross buy and marketing efficiencies, it also is proving to be a large revenue contributor as we continue to drive monetization of these businesses. In fact, annualized revenue per product is up nearly 2x from $21 in Q4 of last year to $40 in this quarter. This is due to the increasing attractiveness of these products, growing brand awareness and network effects. As we've committed, we continue to iterate and invest aggressively in our product suite, and that investment continues to pay dividends as members embrace our launches. Since our last earnings call, we introduced an increase in our checking and savings APY of up to 3.75% as of January 4.  We launched SoFi Plus, a premium member service, that bundles together are a wide variety of member benefits and provides incremental value and rewards. SoFi Plus is unlocked through enrolling in direct deposit. We will continue to add more value and benefits to this premium member service to not only highlight the breadth of our products and services, but to also increase the total value of having your direct deposit with SoFi.  We expanded insurance coverage for our members to include cyber insurance, our invest team launched options trading, making good on our promise to our members to deliver this much anticipated service, and we introduced a new way to spend with SoFi with paying for there first product built on the combined Galileo and Technisys platform.  This leads me to our Technology Platform segment which remains a critical element of SoFi's strategy. In the fourth quarter, full segment revenue of $86 million grew 61% year-over-year with a 20% margin at the segment level or 24% if you exclude Technisys.  The SoFi Technology platform strategy includes growth in new verticals, new products and new geographies. In Q4, Galileo signed 11 new clients and made big strides in the strategy, with 36% of new deals in B2B and 27% of new deals outside the United States. Importantly, of these 11 new deals, nine have existing customer bases, reflecting the continued demand for our innovative services from more mature organizations. Technisys is also delivering strong growth in number of new clients signing an additional 16 new clients in Q4, including its first digital deal in Mexico. I'll finish here by saying that we've been in an all-out sprint over the last five years to build out our digital product suite to meet our members' needs for every major financial decision in their lives and all the days in between.  The benefits of our strategy resulting in a uniquely diversified business, combined with a national bank license, not only positions SoFi to be the winner that takes most in the secular transition of the financial services to digital, but also to provide greater durability through a market cycle. I'm excited about where we are today and even more excited about where we can go from here. With that, let me turn it over to Chris for a review of the financials for the quarter. Yes. And thank you, Dominic. We're really pleased and proud of what we've been able to achieve on the deposit side getting to 7 -- over $7 billion of deposits, starting at less than $1 billion at the beginning of the year. And that trend really reflects the strategy that we've employed behind the bank to offer a very high interest rate on checking of over 2% and a high interest rate on savings at 3.75%, no fees and complete functionality on your phone to be able to pay bills, to be able to send money to your friends to be able to look at all of your transactions, to be able to really function all of your money movement right from our app.  The combination of that plus the focus we've had on driving high-quality direct deposits has driven that deposit number. What I'd say is, we're nowhere close to the point in our total deposits that we would have trouble deploying them. The limit on our growth is really driven by how much resources that we have to go after it. Once people become aware of our product, the adoption is pretty strong behind that. And so the deposits that we have today could be deployed the way we have the last several quarters; one, to fund our own loans; two, to be opportunistic on opportunities related to our loans that are in the marketplace.  There are several businesses we're not in today that would leverage deposits, including small and medium business loans and being in that entire sector would require deposits as well. And we can leverage obviously growing deposits from small and medium businesses also. So if we get to the point that our deposits are significantly higher than they are today, we can deploy them in many, many other ways to drive a great return for the company. Yes. Thank you for the question. We noted in the press release and prepared remarks that we hit a couple of key inflection points in the year. One of the biggest inflection points is that our NIM, our lending net interest margin revenue is now greater than our noninterest revenue, and that's a pretty big milestone. It reflects a lot of initiatives over the last five years, one of which was getting the bank license and being able to use the deposits to fund our loans and not have to recycle that cash through quick sales, et cetera.  So we have the luxury of being able to look in the marketplace, look at our balance sheet and make the best decisions for long-term returns. And as we've done that, we've been able to hold loans longer and generate that revenue stream that's more recurring from net interest margin. You should expect the NIM to continue to grow, both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue in the lending sector. The second big accomplishment was that, for the full year, we were able to -- sorry, in the fourth quarter, we were able to get the NIM revenue greater than the directly attributable fixed cost of the lending business, meaning the non-interest income lending revenue was it needed to get to profitability at the contribution basis in Q4, which is another big milestone but you should expect that to continue to grow. It is a revenue stream that's more visible, more consistent than gain on sale noninterest income. But we have the luxury of making the best choices based on the marketplace.  I'll let Chris talk about the specifics in terms of securitizations versus whole loan sales versus holding. Eugene, thank you for the question. There's a -- Chris laid out in our prepared remarks some of the underlying assumptions, both macro and micro. On the macro side, GDP growth, that's not as a dower as we have in our forecast and our implications, so a stronger economy than what we have. And we have a, we think, a relatively conservative i.e. low number for GDP, decline of about 2.5%.  Unemployment, we had at 5%. That's a factor if it comes in worse than that, that could be a negative, a tailwind would be if it sells in the 4s. And then on interest rates, we have them peaking up 5% and then coming back down to about 4.5%. If rates came back even more than 4.5% and sold than the 4% range, I think we could be at an optimal part of the curve as it relates to passing on coupons, profitability per loan as well as the NIM that we can make relative to our deposits would be a pretty good outcome. Separate from that, for the technology platform sector, we have a really robust pipeline. It's more diverse. But more importantly, there are many members -- sorry, clients in our pipeline that have large existing consumer bases or user bases. And to the extent that those become launched in 2023 before the second half of the year, we can benefit from upside in those large partners coming on board from the tech sector. As it relates to the financial services sector, I really believe we have a lot of upside in the invest category. We are quickly launching new products to make sure that we have some table stakes products, but also some more innovative differentiation selection. And I think that if we're able to launch those to a receptive member base and the user base, it could be a tailwind. Second thing that could be a tailwind to invest is if the IPO market opens back up, we can underwrite IPOs. We're the sole retail distribution channel for the Rivian IPO. We participated in the new bank. Our members want access to IPOs and IPO prices. We're uniquely providing Main Street with access to IPO prices at those -- IPOs and IPO prices.  To the extent the calendar opens back up, we have a pipeline there as well, which helps both with adoption of the product by new users because they want that unique selection, but it also drives incremental assets under management, which allows us to drive more revenue and monetize more. So those are some of the underlying trends that could give us a tailwind when we pass over to Chris... Thank you for the question. And I think you characterized it appropriate in that it's a refinement of the strategy. Now that we're operating on one unified platform with both Technisys and Galileo, we can leverage the combined go-to-market and that does drive some synergy cost savings, which is why Chris mentioned small head count reduction. But there're also cost savings in different areas like marketing when you have that unified approach, especially in the United States. In addition to that, we've made really significant investments in the tech platform over the last three years. We've increased headcount by 2.5x. We moved to the cloud while maintaining on-prem capabilities. The on-prem will now go away this year.  We've also done a great job at adding new partners. We've been adding 20-plus partners a year. As we look at the macroeconomic environment and where we sit, we think the right strategy for the year is to focus on durable companies with large installed bases, or well-capitalized companies that we know can make the transition and that we'll get a great return to leverage our platform capabilities. And so that's how we're approaching the year. For the first time, we're going to have meaningful margin expansion in the tech platform to start to leverage that investment we made, but we're still investing, and we're still growing.  And let me give you an example of some of the areas that we've invested in that we expect to bear fruit this year, and we'll keep investing in. First and foremost, we wanted to diversify our products just out of a debit or interchange ACH type of product expanded in the B2B category. We have a number of new B2B partners that are generating revenue today. Some are doing small and medium business lending, some are simply using it for payments and for accounts receivable and accounts payable.  But there's a good pipeline of other partners that have large fleets as well as big economy companies, et cetera. In addition to building out the B2B channel, we've also tried to add more products for consumer-facing clients. And so one of the products that we have that's been adopted as Secure Card. Another product that we've launched more recently is a fraud protection. As you think about fraud, and you think about the scale of some of the partners of Galileo, they may not have the scale to invest in fraud the way that we can, and they may not have the data that we have to actually drive those models. And so we've rolled out 1 piece of a fraud platform that we want to make available to all of our partners.  If we can help them eliminate fraud, it not only saves losses, but it actually makes their service more reliable, reduces the overhead they have in the call centers and also allows them to hit better SLAs in servicing their customers when they do have issues that have to be solved. So it's a classic major footprint, bringing your foot type of product.  In addition to that, we're focused on things that will help them drive engagement. So we've launched a direct deposit switching product, and you'll see us continue to do more to drive more engagement. Things like instant funding are another vehicle that makes the movement of money faster and better for our partners. And then last, we just launched our first product on both Galileo and Technisys SoFi, which is paying for. That product is now available for any of our partners. And if you think about the partners at Galileo, many of them are not playing the same segment that we are. We're at a very high-end customer with high FICO score and high income. Most of the scale in Galileo's partners is actually at the unbanked or underbanked. A Pay-in-4 product is much better for them than a secure card or unsecured loan or a credit card, and that product can be launched in a turnkey fashion with a much higher interchange of about 3% compared to what we're generating at 1% in debit. It does bring with it some risk and so we'll have to wait cautiously into that market with our partners. But it's another example of the innovation that we've driven that we now think we can get a return on revenue against. And the last thing I'll touch on is Connect. It's not something we've talked about on the call before, but we think it's a diamond in the rough, so to speak. It's an AI-driven customer service model that uses both voice and text. And that product is one that SoFi has now adopted, and that's after SoFi did a complete RFP of all the different choices and determined Connect to be the best choice for our company and we'll continue to invest in that product it's available to our partners as well.  And the last thing where I'd say about our strategy relates to the technology platform is that the opportunity to expand geographically is bigger than you could imagine. We have to really pace our level of investment. And while we're not expanding geographically today, there's a lot of penetration within the LatAm market, which is our area of focus, especially with Technisys in more than 12 markets, helping, cross-sell Galileo's products. Yes. The only other thing I'd add, Dan, as I did say in my prepared remarks that we're seeing the strong trend in member and product growth continue to Q1. We've, throughout the year, constantly iterating on marketing channels, on marketing messages, on life cycle marketing and leveraging the most efficient channels. And I feel like, in the fourth quarter, we -- it was a culmination of a lot of work over the last two years, and we saw the benefit of that. And as we started the new year, we continue to see that. So we feel really great about not just the growth rate in members as well as products, but the quality of those members and product adoption in addition to the cost of acquisition. Yes. And just to give you a little bit of history here, we had a partner that was helping us drive great success on the back-end fulfillment side of the equation. We do the -- we do the marketing to drive the demand at the top of the funnel. We do the underwriting for the loans. And after that, loan is locked. We partner with a film partner to get through all the all the steps after that.  That partner unfortunately got acquired. We were then required to make a technology platform switch with the new acquired company, which was costly and time-consuming. And ultimately, the economics that entity was seeing became quite onerous as rates increased, and we realized that the economic relationship that we had was changing, and we needed another partner.  We started pursuing other partners, quite frankly, well before that acquisition happened just needing diversification. And so we fast-tracked the second partner that we needed to transition to. That transition didn't happen as quickly as we would hope.  I will tell you, in the last two months, we've seen more progress there than we have in the last 18 months, and I'm encouraged by the progress the team has made, both in terms of the technology integration, the process flow, the ability to hit time-to-funding metrics and serve our members better. We're nowhere near perfect, but we're starting to move in the right direction for the first time in a while. In terms of the economic impact on the overall business, Chris was pretty clear in saying that it will ramp throughout the year. I would think about it as more second half of the year than the first half of the year. But the team is executing in a way that I think positions us really strongly to start stepping on the gas a little bit more as it relates to demand. We've had our foot off the gas, quite frankly, because we don't want to generate demand that we can't fulfill in a high-quality way. And we're starting to get to the point, I think, we'll be there by the second half of the year where we can step on the gas and start to see a much bigger market share gain there. We have such a small market share. Even with higher interest rates, I think there's a huge opportunity for us to drive revenue there as well as that revenue being profitable. In addition to that, we do, at some point, similar to the rest of our businesses, want to own end-to-end. We own lending from metal to glass, so to speak, and it gives us such advantages on iterating, on testing, on pricing, on credit, on user flow, on fraud, on risk. And we see the same thing now in SoFi Money, owning Galileo and having the benefit of Technisys as well.  And so at some point, in home volumes, we'll own the back end also. We'll always partner. It's great to have two sources of capacity, especially given our aspirations and how big we think this could be. It is a huge financial transaction for our members. It is emotional transaction, and we need to be able to scale it and meet the needs of all of our members, and that's where we're focused on long term. John, it was really hard to hear your question. I don't want to guess what your question was. Maybe you could just dial back in with a better connection. I heard something about B2B and that it was pretty muted after that. Yes. Perfect. Thank you. Yes, we can hear you. Yes. So the SMB opportunity, I think, is really an opportunity that's aligned with the type of member that we're acquiring in our core target. We don't have plans in 2023 to enter that market. We do believe it's an opportunity for us over the longer term to serve that market well. If you follow us on any social media, it's a constant requests that we get from people to launch small and medium business checking and savings, small medium business lending.  When the pandemic first started back in 2020 March time period, we were inundated with tons of small medium businesses coming on to SoFi and trying to apply for PPP loans. We clearly don't have small, medium lending now that we have a banking license. That is an area that we could go into, but we did at that point in time. We stood up a website that allowed us to take the traffic that came to SoFi and leverage lantern to send the traffic to a marketplace of small, medium business lenders. And it was very -- people were very happy with it. The demand, as a result of that, led us to realize that many of our members are operating small medium businesses and that we could serve them on the commercial side as well. But as I mentioned, it's not something that we do in 2023. I would never say that would say the same. We'll review it every quarter. If the student loan market came back sooner than expected, and some of the other things went our way in the economy and so forth, it may be something that we could focus on in the second half of the year. But right now, it's not on the funding list, but it's a huge opportunity for us. The only reason I mentioned it earlier was, we had asked -- been asked the question earlier about deposits and what happened if they grow too big, and that would be a great problem to have. If they grow in excess of what we're willing to originate on the personal loan side and SLR side and home loan side and credit cards, we would offer more lending products to make sure we're capturing that great resource of deposits to deploy against high-returning assets. And the only thing I would add on to that is something we were talking about as a team yesterday that doesn't get a lot of attention. But when you look at the asset side of our balance sheet and you look at the trend, and you look at our cash and cash equivalents, we finished the year at $1.4 billion of cash and cash approvals. What's not in that number is $424 million of restricted cash.  And then there's some investment securities, which is a combination of treasuries and government securities as well as loans or what we said, of about $400 million. The trend in that line has been continuing to increase, which speaks not only to the liquidity that we have but the equity that we have that we can deploy either against funding loans or funding the bank. And it's one of the important measures that we'll continue to give you a -- somewhat of a level of confidence on being able to fund the bank to grow more if we need to put more equity there. Great. Thank you for dialing in, so I want to end with a couple of comments. February marks my five-year anniversary at SoFi, and it's just very humbling what we've achieved during such an unprecedented time period, growing from less than $500 million of revenue to $1.5 billion at the end of 2022, 600,000 members to 5.2 million members and negative adjusted EBITDA to $140 million of EBITDA, plus raising $3.6 billion in capital, becoming a public company and receiving a federal bank license.  To have done all of that through two interest rate cycles, a recession, with the potential for another, a global pandemic, inflation at a 40-year high and in an incredibly competitive environment with significant access to near zero cost of capital is a remarkable five-year run. None of this, though, happens without the full faith of our Board and our shareholders, the persistent and unrelenting resolve of our people and a team that have done nothing short of extraordinary. Many can prognosticate about what lies ahead for the economy, interest rates, but in my view, the political background, the regulatory background remain very uncertain. And those exogenous factors are out of our control. But as it relates to what lies ahead, I will simply state my strongest belief that SoFi continues to be the best positioned company, to be the winner that takes most in the digital financial services sector of the future. Reaching the outcome is what we control, and what we remain steadfastly focused on to achieve. With that, thank you for calling in and listening to our fourth quarter results as well as our 2022 full year results. We'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you."

And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Anthony.\nAnthony Noto: Thank you, Maura, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results demonstrate the continued resilience of both our team and business and our ability to deliver another quarter of record revenue and EBITDA and strong overall operating results. A few key achievements from the third quarter include our sixth consecutive quarter of record adjusted net revenue of $419 million, up 51% year-over-year, reflecting record revenue in all three business segments; $44 million of record adjusted EBITDA, up 118% quarter-over-quarter; continued strong performance in member and product additions as well as cross-buy volume; further scaling of SoFi Bank with accelerating growth to surpass $5 billion in deposits, up 86% quarter-over-quarter; and savings of 125 basis points; and cost of funds versus using other sources of debt to fund loans. Another quarter of positive GAAP net income for SoFi Bank at $28 million at an 11% margin. Members and products each saw rapid year-over-year growth with continued strong cross-buy trends. The 424,000 new members in Q3 2022 brings total members to 4.7 million, up 61% year-over-year. We also added 635,000 new products in Q3, ending with nearly 7.2 million total products, up 69% year-over-year. Of these new adds, Financial Services products of 5.9 million at quarter end grew by 83% year-over-year, while Lending products of nearly 1.3 million were up 24%. The strength of our results once again underscores how our full suite of differentiated products and services provides the foundation for a uniquely diversified business that is able to endure through market cycles. Now I'd like to spend some time on segment level results, with a particular focus on the benefits of a diversified business drivers as well as the structural advantage of our bank charter. In Lending, our personal loan performance more than offset the continued lack of demand in student loan refinancing and the less robust performance of home loans. Student loan refi continues to be negatively impacted as federal borrowers await the end of the moratorium on federal student loan payments. Home loans face macro headwinds from rising rates while we continue the process of transitioning to new fulfillment partners. We originated a record of over $2.8 billion in personal loans in Q3, up 14% from $2.5 billion last quarter and nearly doubled the $1.6 billion in Q3 2021. The product continues to deliver and, most importantly, this is while maintaining our strict credit standards in attracting borrowers with high incomes and FICO scores. While these origination levels themselves are impressive, the strength of our balance sheet and diversification of our funding sources provide new options to fund Lending growth while driving efficiency with cost savings. These advantages are a direct result of SoFi Bank. Having more flexibility with our balance sheet allows us to generate more net interest margin revenue per loan and optimize returns, a critical advantage in light of the macro uncertainty. Additionally, by using our deposits to fund loans, we benefit from a lower cost of funding for loans and thus more profit per loan. In Q3 alone, the difference in our deposit cost of funds and other sources of debt was approximately 125 basis points versus 100 basis points in Q2, a powerful benefit in a rising rate environment. Lastly, we have a much more compelling value proposition in SoFi Checking and Savings as we can invest the greater revenue and profit per loan from the two benefits I just mentioned into an industry-leading APY, which drives direct deposit members resulting in high-quality deposits and great levels of engagement. This has led to higher average account balances even as average spend has increased. We exited the quarter with over $5 billion in total deposits, and 85% of SoFi Money deposits are from direct deposit members. In fact, 50% of newly funded SoFi Money accounts are setting up direct deposit by day 30 versus 37% in the second quarter, and this has had a significant impact on spending. Q3 annualized spend was 2 times full year 2021 total spend and Q3 spend per average funded account was up 22% quarter-over-quarter. SoFi Money members increased nearly 72% year-over-year to 2.3 million accounts while maintaining attractive demographics. In fact, the median FICO score for direct deposit accounts opened in the third quarter was 750. Given the quality of these members, we see ample opportunity for cross-buying in the future. Moving on to Financial Services more broadly, where net revenue nearly tripled year-over-year to $49 million and grew 61% from $30 million in Q2. We've continued to achieve strong member and product growth by iterating on products to ensure they are differentiated by four key factors, fast, selection, content and convenience, and continue to invest to make them work better when used together. We finished Q3 with 5.9 million Financial Services products, up 83% year-over-year and 4.6 times the total Lending products of 1.3 million. The increased scale in Financial Services helps drive cross-buy and marketing efficiencies. Financial Services sales and marketing spend as a percentage of net revenue was 58% in Q3 versus 81% the prior quarter and 105% in Q3 of last year. We achieved this improved efficiency even as we continue to scale our top-of-the-funnel products, which often do not contribute stand-alone to revenue for 12 to 18 months. This is due to the increasing monetization and attractiveness of these products, growing brand awareness and network effects. As mentioned, we continue to iterate and invest aggressively in our product suite, and that investment continues to pay dividends as members embrace our launches. Just in the third quarter, we introduced an increase in our Checking and Savings APY of up to 2.5% as of September 30. In addition to the unmatched value proposition, a host of free features and a unique rewards program. In fact, we're increasing our APY in savings to 3% this week to continue to drive more value for our members. Within SoFi Invest, we introduced new proprietary ETFs to the platform and remain on track to launch the much anticipated options trading product by year-end, now in beta testing. We've increasingly utilized our relay platform to acquire, educate and advise our members on their holistic financial picture and their next best move. We launched credit alerts in Q3, and we'll continue to add features to drive engagement. The relay platform has become a notable source of cross-buying, further bolstering the financial services productivity. We delivered unprecedented awareness growth as of Q3 2022 by delighting our target audience with compelling value propositions, reaching our target audience where they are effectively and efficiently, producing winning creative and leveraging data-driven tools to continue to get smarter. Transitioning to the Technology Platform, a critical element of SoFi's strategy. Not only is this segment a strong revenue and cash flow driver, but its two businesses, Galileo and Technisys, also contribute to two main tenets of SoFi strategy: faster innovation at lower cost and high-return, diversified revenue streams. As a reminder, we're a consumer technology company that delivers financial services products. We need to be a one-stop shop for major financial decisions in all the days in between. To do this, we want to own end-to-end technologies, and that's where our Technology Platform comes into play. Only we can truly understand the technologies that we need the most. We build them in a way that's both great for us and for everyone else in the ecosystem. In the third quarter, full segment revenue of $85 million grew 69% year-over-year, which included another quarter of record revenue from Galileo, with a 23% margin at the segment level or 30% if you exclude Technisys. Galileo's overall diversified growth strategy includes growth in new verticals, new products and new geographies. In Q3, Galileo signed 10 new clients and made big strides in its strategy, with a strong 30% of new deals in B2B and 40% of new deals outside the United States. Importantly, of these 10 new deals, 7 have existing subscribers, portfolios or payment businesses, reflecting continued demand for our services and new use cases for embedded fintechs from more mature organizations. In Q3, we further invested in our push into the B2B segment by shipping two core capabilities: first, account-level controls, which provides self-service opportunities for program managers to set tighter controls in real time at the account level for where and how funds can be spent while reducing fraudulent transactions; and second, real-time funding, which automatically funds an account in real time during the transaction process, optimizing the working capital needs of our SMB customers. I'll finish here by saying that we've been in an all-out sprint over the last five years to build out our digital product suite to meet our members' needs for every major financial decision in their lives in all the days in between. The benefits of our strategy to build a uniquely diversified business, combined with a national bank charter, not only positions SoFi to be the winner who takes most in the secular transition of financial services to digital but also provide greater durability through our market cycle. I'm excited about where we are today and even more excited about where we can go from here. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to review the financials for the quarter.\nChris Lapointe: Thanks, Anthony, and good morning, everyone. Overall, we had a great quarter with strong growth trends across the entire business. We achieved record revenue and record EBITDA. I'm going to walk you through some key financial highlights for the quarter and then share some color on our financial outlook. Unless otherwise stated, I'll be referring to adjusted results for the third quarter of 2022 versus third quarter of 2021. Our GAAP consolidated income statement and all reconciliations can be found in today's earnings release and the subsequent 10-Q filing, which will be made available next week. For the quarter, growth accelerated and we delivered record adjusted net revenue of $419 million, up 51% year-over-year and 18% sequentially from the prior quarter's record of $356 million. Adjusted EBITDA and margins improved year-over-year as we delivered a record $44 million at an 11% margin, representing 3x year-over-year growth on a dollar basis and nearly 700 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion. Sequentially, EBITDA was up $24 million and margins expanded nearly 500 basis points as we saw margin improvement across each of sales and marketing, technology and product development, G&A and ops functional expense lines. Now on to the segment level performance, where we saw a strong growth and record revenue across all three segments. In Lending, third quarter adjusted net revenue grew 38% year-over-year to $297 million. Results were driven by 93% growth in net interest income and 10% growth in noninterest income. Growth in net interest income was driven by a 70% year-over-year increase in average interest-earning assets and a 144 basis point year-over-year increase in average yields, resulting in an average net interest margin of 5.85% for the quarter. This represents 126 basis points of year-over-year and 62 basis points of sequential NIM expansion. Growth in noninterest income was a result of increased originations and strong personal loan and student loan sales execution. Q3 originations grew 2% year-over-year to $3.5 billion and were driven by record volumes in our personal loans business, which grew 71% year-over-year to $2.8 billion. However, both student loan and home loan originations were down by more than 50% year-over-year as we await the expiration of the moratorium on federal student loan payments coming in January, while rising rates and fulfillment issues continue to impact our home loans business. We achieved this top line growth while maintaining our stringent credit standards and disciplined focus on quality. Our personal loan borrowers weighted average income is $160,000, with a weighted average FICO score of 746. Our student loan borrowers weighted average income is $170,000 with a weighted average FICO of 771. This focus on quality has led to strong credit performance. Our on-balance sheet delinquency rates and charge-off rates remain healthy and are still below pre-COVID levels. Our on-balance sheet 90-day personal loan delinquency rate was 30 basis points in Q3 2022, while our annualized personal loan charge-off rate was 1.95%. Our on-balance sheet 90-day student loan delinquency rate was 11 basis points in Q3 2022, while our annualized student loan charge-off rate was 0.33%. As we have expressed in the past, it is reasonable to expect credit metrics to revert over time to more normalized pre-pandemic levels but continue to expect very healthy performance relative to broader industry levels. The Lending business delivered $181 million of contribution profit at a 61% margin, up from $118 million a year ago and a 55% margin. This improvement was driven by a mix shift to higher-margin personal loans revenue as well as ops efficiencies and fixed cost leverage across the entire segment. Shifting to our Tech Platform, where we delivered record net revenue of $85 million in the quarter, up 69% year-over-year, while record Galileo revenue was up 29% year-over-year. Overall, annual revenue growth was driven by 40% year-over-year Galileo account growth to $124 million in total as well as sequential growth in transactions per active account. The segment delivered a contribution profit of $20 million, representing a 23% margin and 30% if you were to exclude Technisys. Moving on to Financial Services, where net revenue of $49 million increased 288% year-over-year, with new all-time high revenue for SoFi Money and continued strong contributions from SoFi Credit Card, SoFi Invest and lending as a service. Overall monetization continues to improve with annualized revenue per product increasing for the second consecutive quarter to $34, up 112% year-over-year from $16 in the same prior year quarter and up 46% sequentially from $23. We reached 5.9 million Financial Services products in the quarter, which is up 83% year-over-year, and we continued to see strong product adds with 557,000 new products in the segment. We hit 2 million products in SoFi Money, $2.1 million in SoFi Invest and $1.6 million in relay. Contribution losses were $53 million in the quarter, which increased year-over-year, predominantly as a result of building our CECL reserves for the SoFi Credit Card business which is expected as we continue to grow in scale. In addition, we saw a year-over-year reduction in higher-margin digital assets revenue. Switching to our balance sheet, where we remain very well capitalized with ample cash and excess liquidity. The recent opening of SoFi Bank further reinforces our strong balance sheet and provides us with more flexibility and access to a lower cost of capital relative to alternative sources of funding. In Q3, assets grew by $3 billion as a result of adding loans to the balance sheet given the strong growth we continue to see in personal loan originations. On the liability side of the balance sheet, we saw tremendous growth in deposits as they grew to $5.0 billion, up $2.3 billion quarter-over-quarter. Because of this, we exited the quarter with $2.5 billion drawn on our $7.1 billion of warehouse capacity, which represents 35% of our total available capacity. Let me finish up with guidance. Throughout the last 12 months, we have demonstrated the benefit of having a diversified set of revenue streams and a keen focus on underwriting high-quality credit. We expect those benefits to persist going forward even in light of the existing macro backdrop. Our outlook also assumes a late Q4 2022 benefit in student loan originations, ahead of the January 2023 federal student loan payment moratorium exploration based on the trend that we experienced in 2021. This benefit is expected to partially offset seasonal Q4 softness we typically see in other lending products. For the full year of 2022, we now expect to deliver revenue of $1.517 billion to $1.522 billion, above our prior guidance of $1.508 billion to $1.513 billion and full year 2022 EBITDA of $115 million to $120 million, above our prior guidance of $104 million to $109 million. Overall, we couldn't be more proud of our Q3 results and continued progress. Having delivered nearly $1.7 billion of annualized revenue and over $170 million of annualized EBITDA, we continue to make great progress against our long-term growth objectives in the quarter and we remain very well capitalized to continue pursuing our ultimate goal of making SoFi a top financial institution. With that, let's begin the Q&A.\nMaura Cyr: Thank you, Chris. [Operator Instructions] Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Operator, please go ahead.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from Eugene Simuni from MoffettNathanson. Eugene, your line is open.\nEugene Simuni: I'll start by asking about the growth in members. Very strong quarter again, over 400,000 added. Can you talk a little bit about what customer acquisition channels are you finding more successful, where these members are coming from and how sustainable do you see the growth trajectory in the members.\nAnthony Noto: I would say there wasn't a meaningful change in the different channels that drove member growth. We're really happy with the trend that we're seeing in member growth. And I would say the quality of our members is increasing as well and the data that we have for our members is increasing as well, which gives us more opportunity to help our members get their money, right. What I'd say is we're really trying to target high-quality members with good compounding growth over years, not over any one quarter. So we're targeting 400,000 net new member adds per quarter. At some point, that could take a step function up. But right now, we're sort of balancing the growth of our member base with quality as well as making sure that we're building our technology and processes to meet our members need as we scale so meaningfully. The bank strategy has been a huge help to us. It's allowed us to not just drive member growth and SoFi Money and SoFi Checking and Savings, which lowers our cost of funding, but it also allows us to be more nimble in other areas like our relay product, and we can experiment much more with the relay product and having people connect their credit card accounts or their checking and savings accounts or their brokerage accounts and putting their real estate, and that information can then help us cross-sell into the checking sales account which is really attractive. We didn't have that same leverage point in the past, and so the combination of those two is also something that's new.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mihir Bhatia from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Mihir, your line is open.\nMihir Bhatia: I wanted to start with the student loan changes. Obviously, a fair amount of changes with the Biden administration passing the debt student loan -- passing -- announcing and then trying to implement this student loan plan. In addition to the loan forgiveness of course, changes to income-based repayment levels, too. I was just wondering, what is SoFi's view on the plan overall? And just can you discuss maybe some of the key points of the plan that will impact your business and how -- and the actions you are taking.\nAnthony Noto: We've been clear that we support targeted forgiveness programs and the announced programs that the administration released are aligned with what we thought would be a fair and balanced targeted view on programs. We think the most important thing for people that have federal student loans is clarity and consistency. And so we encourage administration to stay on track and to provide transparency and clarity on execution so they can make the best decisions on how they want to get their money right. We think the addressable market for student loan refinancing is quite large even with these changes. Many of the forgiveness programs will probably not be applicable to our member base and our target demographics, the income levels below, for qualification, our income is higher than the income level we have to be below, and a number of other factors that would cause the TAM to be still large. Now that TAM can increase and decrease, depending on where federal funds rates are and overall WACC is for that product in the marketplace, but the number of people that will still have federal student loans outstanding that could refinance is really large still.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Dolev from Mizuho. Dan, your line is now open.\nDan Dolev: A quick question, Anthony, and Chris, can you just give us a sense of like the cap trends that you've seen over this quarter and the last few quarters?\nChris Lapointe: So what I would say is we've made really good progress in the overall marketing efficiencies over the last few years, and that's been driven by growth in brand awareness, cross-buy and scaling our lower CAC products. If you were to look at Q3 '22, you'll see that our sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue decreased 400 basis points year-over-year and 200 basis points quarter-over-quarter. In terms of specific CAC trends I would say that we're acquiring members today at a level that supports our longer-term EBITDA margin target of 30%. When determining how much we're willing to spend to acquire a member on a day-to-day basis, we're looking at a host of different factors. We're looking at the lifetime value that, that member could achieve, and we're also looking at overall payback periods. What we've observed recently over the course of the last few quarters is that our overall LTV of financial services members has increased as a result of having the bank and focus on growing direct deposit members and are to that period are in the 12- to 18-month time frame. That has given us additional flexibility on CAC and the ability to scale the number of financial services products that we have. This growth in investment in Financial Services products has resulted in CAC efficiencies within our Lending products. And you'll see in the queue that our overall CAC for new Lending members decreased by 8% to 9%, both year-over-year and sequentially, and that's really helped contribute to the overall margin compression that we're seeing.\nAnthony Noto: The other thing I would just add to what Chris mentioned is something that we've learned in the Lending business and then something that I think applies now that we have a one-stop shop with all the other products. Sometimes it's misleading when a company drives low CAC. It has been the case that it was in Lending. If we drive CAC too low, we lower the quality of the borrower that we bring in and the life-of-loan losses of that portfolio can actually go up, which would more than offset the CAC savings. And so it's counterintuitive to think about CAC and Financial Services. What we focus on is what's the right CAC within a unit economic standpoint, whether that's a per account economics or that's per loan economics to drive an acceptable variable profit. So when we multiply that variable profit per account or per member by the number of people that have that product, that total variable profit dollars exceed our fixed costs and drive to our long-term 30% margin. So there will definitely be ups and downs in CAC based on mix shift, based on environments but know we're solving for the LTV equation and the right unit economics to drive to a 30% margin. It's not always the case that a lower CAC is good. You can have much lower quality members in money and checking account, for example. Our direct deposit growth has been really strong. I pay a lot more money for direct deposit customers than it would for just a funded customer because of all the benefits we get in debit interchange in addition to lower cost of funding on the loan side.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Noto: You're on mute.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Sorry. Can you hear me now? .\nAnthony Noto: Yes.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Sorry about that. Maybe this will be a little bit of a follow-up from the previous questions. SoFi Money accounts that you added, you pointed out, were more kind of direct deposit and kind of more likely to be richer. Any sense as to whether this is at least in part a function of kind of a pullback from kind of PE or venture capital funded other neobanks? And also, following up from those last answers, is there a way to dimension whether it's CAC profitability in terms of how you think about that benefit over the longer term, just given that they're more likely to purchase lots of products and, in particular, lending?\nAnthony Noto: We had really strong metrics in Checking and Savings and really high quality. 50% of our newly funded SoFi Money accounts are setting up direct deposits by day 30. That's up versus 37% in the second quarter. And if you benchmark that versus other companies, that's a really high percentage. The quality of those members from a credit standpoint is also very attractive. The median FICO score for direct deposit accounts opened in the third quarter was 750. That's a direct result of us architecting the product to meet the needs of our target member. We're going after high earners not well served. They have average income of over $100,000 per household. They have 680 FICO scores and higher. That doesn't mean we won't serve other people that are outside of that core demographic, that target. There are concentric circles around that, that will benefit from these products. But we architect that specifically to attract that type of number. That, combined with great targeted marketing and iteration over the last three years, has resulted in really strong quality as well us still maintaining pretty good growth. The other thing which doesn't get talked about too much because it's just scaling so significantly is the amount of spending that's happening on the platform. If you annualize our Q3 spend number to four quarters instead of one quarter, it's over 2x what we did in 2021. So really a substantial increase. And on a per account basis, we're up about 22% quarter-over-quarter in spending. So the strategy is really working and the bank license has allowed that to come to fruition, and we're really happy with the outcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Perito from Stifel. Michael, your line is now open.\nMichael Perito: I wanted to look ahead to next year a little bit, but not kind of financially, just strategically. I mean, obviously, a lot of the year-on-year improvement has really stemmed from the strong bank-related growth, the impressive direct deposit growth, the credit card debit interchange, the lending and on the personal loan side and the growing balance sheet. I'm just curious, obviously, you guys have to balance kind of the bottom line profitability and the balance sheet growth. But as you look ahead to next year, I mean, what's your appetite to continue to grow the bank balance sheet and drive higher NII? Just curious how you guys are kind of strategically thinking about that. That would be great.\nAnthony Noto: And Chris and I will tag team. I would say holistically, I'm really looking forward to having a year in which we have continuity and stability across markets and across company-specific initiatives. If I reflect back in the last five years, every year, we've had a major company-driven initiative or an economic backdrop or a market backdrop that's been somewhat volatile. Obviously, we've been dealing with the student loan monitoring for the last three years, and on top of that going public and on top of that switching to becoming a bank. We just haven't had a year in which all of our businesses have the wind at their back. And that is possible in 2023, and I'm very aware of the current outlook for the economic environment and inflation and interest rates. But if things sort of hit where consensus is, we're going to have a year in which all things could have a really strong tailwind. As I think about our growth versus investing, we're going to stick to what we've talked about in the past, barring any unforeseen acquisitions or major strategic initiatives that were unplanned, with what we call the 70-30 plan. We're going to reinvest 70% of incremental revenue in the business and drop 30% of incremental revenue to the bottom line to show progress towards our long-term margin of 30-plus percent on an EBITDA basis. And so the growth that we have this year is one that we want to compound for decades, not for just one year, and have it be consistent over time. So we will continue to reinvest in the business with that ratio. And we think we're in such early days in all of our products. The only thing that's gating our growth is driving awareness. And there's a lot of ways to drive awareness. One way is obviously paid marketing. Another way is while having your products and partnerships. And we'll continue to lever all three of those opportunities. But we've barely scratched the surface in how big we can be. And now with over 4.5 million members, we have our sights on high single digits and double digits after that and a very aggressive perspective on what the cross-buy opportunity will be for us. So we will invest meaningfully but against that ratio. And if the economic environment is worse than expected, then we'll adjust accordingly and make sure we deliver that ratio.\nMichael Perito: Our next question comes from John Hecht of Jefferies. John, your line is open.\nJohn Hecht: Just Chris, I'm wondering, can you maybe characterize or break down a little bit the gain on sale, just lots of interest in hedging versus the kind of executed gains. And also maybe characterize just general investor interest in the different products given the changing environment.\nChris Lapointe: Yes, sure. John, so in terms of our gain on sale margins for the quarter, our personal loans business was at 3.25% excluding hedge gains. And it was 4% when you include hedges associated loans sold in period. Student loan refinancing was 4.3%, excluding the hedge. And it was the same on a hedged basis given that all loans sold in period were in a fixed rate structure. And then our home loans gain on sale was negative 1.7%, excluding the hedge and 90 basis points including the hedges. What I would say in terms of overall appetite for our loans, things continue to be robust. We ended up selling over $1 billion of loans in the quarter. And like I said, given the fact that we have the bank today, we have sufficiently more flexibility than we had prior to that. We have sufficient excess liquidity. We have -- we just raised $3.6 billion of equity last year. We have a large and growing deposit base of north of $5 billion now. And we have $7.1 billion of warehouse capacity available to us, only 35% of which is drawn. So we have a ton of flexibility with respect to being able to hold loans on the balance sheet for a longer period of time. And we're going to seek to maximize ROE on every single loan that we underwrite in a given period of time.\nAnthony Noto: And one additional thing that I had just at the kind of first principle standpoint, we've been fortunate in that we have the technology data and process systems to test iteratively each week different price points and different credits. And so we've been able to effectively increase the weighted average coupon of our loans as Fed funds rate have increased, which gives us a benefit on the execution and the value of those loans, and at the same time, being able to reduce our cost of funding. The combination of those two with strong life-of-loan losses within our target range allows us to get to great value on a per loan basis that we're trying to drive maximum variable profit dollars within a certain ROE.\nChris Lapointe: Yes. And just building on that, to put it in more context, you'll see in the Q next week that the weighted average interest rate earned on our entire PL personal loans portfolio increased 60 basis points quarter-over-quarter for the second quarter in a row. And that 60 basis point increases on the entire portfolio, not just new in-period originations that occurred. So if you look at just new period originations, the actual quarter-over-quarter increase in WACC was substantially more.\nAnthony Noto: Which is just a phenomenal job by our team to maintain the profitability of our loans and still drive the growth that you're seeing at unprecedented levels in that product.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Barker of Piper Sandler. Kevin, your line is now open.\nKevin Barker: Just a follow-up on some of those comments around the gain on sale and everything. It looks like you originated about $2.8 billion of personal loans this quarter. And the growth on balance sheet, it was a similar amount. Is there some strategy whereby your holding all these loans or there are certain loans that are remaining on the balance sheet for an extended period of time? I know you talked about it earlier this year where you would hold them for average would push out. But is there something going on with the personal loan originations that would cause you to hold them on the balance sheet, maybe have the sales occur mostly in the fourth quarter?\nChris Lapointe: Yes. So what I would say is our strategy hasn't changed. Given the flexibility that we now have with the bank, we're able to hold loans for a longer period of time. And that was certainly something that we did in Q3 as well as Q2. What I would say is having the bank provides us with sufficiently additional flexibility and a new source of funding which allows us to grow that balance sheet and hold loans for a longer period of time. There are a few ways that we can grow loans on the balance sheet and generate net interest income. We can either originate, which has been the primary source of driving volume in terms of personal loans, but we can also repurchase loans. In addition to that, one of the things that we've done with a number of our whole loan forward flow agreements is structure them in a way where we have the right of first refusal to purchase loans when the buyer wants to sell. And we're starting to see more and more of that where, from time to time, we see a whole loan buyer come to us with the of first refusal to purchase loans. And given the credit quality and loss profile and return of the loans that we originally underwrite, we strongly consider that. So that's something we'll also take into consideration.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dominick Gabriele from Oppenheimer. Dominick, your line is now open.\nDominick Gabriele: Great results on revenue and EBITDA. I just wanted to ask, versus a lot of the other fintechs that have recently come to market, you've really been obtaining high-quality FICO customers versus lower tiers. And one of the very large banks recently talked about new entrants typically having to gain traction in the lowest tiers first, but that just doesn't seem to be the case for you guys and your strategy seems to be working. So maybe on a product level, how are you beating the competitors and the incumbents to obtain these higher FICO score customers versus the low end? It would be great to hear.\nAnthony Noto: Welcome. I'd say it's old school, focusing on the fundamentals, product, pricing, promotion, placement, the four piece. If you go back to 2018, when we first changed leadership of the company, one of our priorities was to focus on quality over quantity. And it was a really tough decision. We took our volume down meaningfully from where it was in 2017. In addition to that, we took it down relative to what the prior team thought they would be able to achieve. And the reason is we wanted to rearchitect the products so that on a per loan basis we can achieve, through the cycle, a 40% to 50% variable profit margin. I won't walk through the equation of how to get there, but we're happy to do that off-line if it's helpful. Well, we look at the variable profit margin by channel, by marketing channel. And we developed a much more sophisticated approach to pricing. There was only -- it only could price 50% of the loans at one price and 50% at another price, and we developed a whole construct to be able to do 36 sales across 6 different grids, so to speak, and it's gone way, way beyond that now. And so it's really hard to find people that don't necessarily need to refinance. It's really easy to find people that need to refinance. In addition, when you do find those people that may not necessarily need to refinance, you have to give them a cost savings or benefit relative to their other choices. So it needs to be compelling. You have to find them. But the price that you're giving them or the savings you're giving them has to be of greater value than what they're currently doing. And then you need to make sure you have the right operational controls, the right life of loan losses and credit processes to ensure that you underwrite appropriately with the right operating and CAC costs. The last thing I'd mention is our credit models continue to be updated based on on-property data, which helps us now more than before. We're trying to underwrite to free cash flow. And so the more information we have on your income, the more information we have on your spending, the better we can underwrite to free cash flow. So it's a combination of all those different things. And the last thing I'd mention is our time to fund the personal loan is two days. It used to be eight days. Our time to fund the student loan used to be in the mid- to high teens. Now it's in the single digits. That's also a factor that people underestimate in terms of the ability to meet the demands of that borrower when you do find them. In addition to that, we have a sense of urgency. We don't rush. We want to make sure we underwrite appropriately. But we have to be competitive using our technology and our operations to deliver a short time to fund.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citigroup. Ashwin, your line is open.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Anthony, Chris, good quarter, congratulations. I want to talk about the technology platform. If you can go through in sort of more granular fashion about the investments you're making in the platform and the client take-up of cloud banking. And then the sequential growth in Galileo accounts has decelerated the last few quarters. Is there an ongoing implementation or other efforts to reaccelerate that?\nAnthony Noto: So on the technology platform, we're really pleased with the growth that we're driving and even more so with the processes that have been undertaken to provide a stable, reliable and resilient platform for our partners and the pipeline of products in addition to the integration of Technisys and Galileo. The major investment that we've made over the last two years of owning Galileo was transitioning from on-prem into the cloud. And that transition is largely done. I think the report I've seen most recently is 99% of our authorizations are now in the cloud. And that's really going to provide great SLA performance for our partners and allow them to innovate faster and be more nimble using data real time to make more better decisions. We have a robust pipeline within Galileo for our partners, but we also have a robust pipeline for new verticals. We are definitely starting to migrate away from just pure B2C. We talked about the B2B customers that we've been able to attract on the last couple of quarters, and the pipeline there remains very robust. And generally, the B2B companies already have existing payment systems and payment supply for us to process. So when we convert those over, there will be a faster time to revenue and also get much higher probability. In addition to building products for B2B that are more controllable for them and meet their needs better in addition to just having the processing capability, we're also continuing to expand internationally with really strong trends throughout Latin America, both on the back of Galileo as well as Technisys, which was where it was strong to begin with. In addition to geographic expansion, we have a robust pipeline of products for our existing partners. We'll be launching paying for in the coming months. Paying for is a product that was built on Galileo and on Technisys. It will be the first product that's built across both processing and the core technology. And that will be a great product for that large installed base of 120-plus million accounts, many of which are B2C. And it's one that better suits the demand and the interest of the lower-income customers of our partners on the B2C side there. In terms of growth in the future, I would say we're not planning for accelerating growth, but the TAM is so large and we've made such large investments, that is a possibility, on a revenue standpoint as well as on a revenue per account standpoint. It's not something that we would forecast, but it's -- given it's so early in the transition of physical payment to digital and we're so early in the new launch of many of our products, but it's possible. It's not something that we will forecast. In terms of demand, we're focused much more on existing portfolios than we are on startups because of the known value that's there and hugely differentiated service that we have in the cloud as being end-to-end with core technology plus processing plus the front end. We are a much better solution than what's currently out in the marketplace for many financial institutions that are very scaled. And so those have longer lead times, but they'll have bigger paybacks and a much bigger impact to the absolute dollars that we generate in our revenue.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Ng from Goldman Sachs. Michael, your line is now open.\nMichael Ng: I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about deposits. It's encouraging to see the progress there. It seems like the deposit inflows have accelerated pretty meaningfully from the $100 million per week that you talked about earlier this year. Against the backdrop of the upcoming increase, what are your expectations for the deposit inflows run rate? And separately, are you seeing any changes or headwinds in deposit inflows from consumers investing directly into money markets or treasuries?\nAnthony Noto: We've definitely been winning share of deposits. We think we have an incredibly differentiated checking and savings account with high interest checking of 2.5%. No fees, free overdraft protection, you can spend with your phone, spend with your card. You can do person to-person payment, you can do bill pay, pre-roundups and a unique rewards program. So I think our product is unmatched when it comes to checking across those different dimensions, not to mention you will become a SoFi member and get a number of other benefits. We also introduced SoFi Plus, which is a way to pull together all of the different benefits you would get as a member in addition to a few incremental pieces of value on rewards step-ups. And that is a product that gets unlocked through direct deposit. And while it's very small and early from a standpoint, it's actually delivering the type of impact that we thought it would drive. So we're winning deposit share. I'll tell you we're taking it from the traditional banks. Someone asked the question earlier, and I've got to answer it, what are we seeing from the neobanks that are maybe focused on the underserved or neobanks more broadly, are they pulling back on marketing and not seeing strong growth? I think what we see in the industry is they're seeing great growth, and we're seeing great growth. And I think they're serving the underserved incredibly well, that were unbanked as well as underserved by traditional banks. But the vast, vast majority of what we're seeing is coming from the largest banks in the United States, and we're winning deposit share from them. We do watch the deposit trends more broadly in the industry, and it's clear that not only are the large banks losing deposits to digital companies like SoFi and fintech companies like SoFi, but they're also losing into money market funds. But we want to have an attractive rate that competes against all of the different options they have, including investment accounts and money market funds.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Adelson from Morgan Stanley. Jeff, your line is now open. \nJeff Adelson: Chris, just wanted to follow up on the loan growth question from earlier and maybe just honing in a little bit on the outlook from here. I know you mentioned some of those drivers, including the bank flexibility, repurchases, et cetera. But in terms of the kind of doubling of the loan hold period you've talked about from 3 to 6 months, is that now effectively in the run rate and should we more or less be thinking about the loan growth from here as kind of matching the percent growth in originations? Or is this something where you think you can continue to add loans at the same clip as your origination dollars, for instance? You added about $3 billion of sequential loan growth this quarter, which was roughly in line with your personal loan originations. And then just as a quick follow-up, wondering if you guys can give us an update on your Q-to-date October deposit growth.\nAnthony Noto: So I'll let Chris answer the question more numerically. I'll just share a perspective. The great thing about the financial services sector is that the factors for growth change constantly. Interest rates are changing. The economic environment is changing. People or the financial markets are changing. And I would tell you, being here five years, every quarter presents a different set of outcomes across all those market factors than we thought at the beginning of the quarter. And we run to where the opportunity is. And in some quarters, that opportunity may be driven by being able to raise WACC. In some quarters, the opportunity would be driven by a really strong securitization market. And some quarters are going to be driven by a really strong wholesale market. The most important thing is that we diversify our funding sources and we diversify our distribution as well as our ability to hold. And that gives us an ability to be nimble when the conditions change to go after those opportunities. And so I don't want anyone to think that it's a straight line, linear in any fashion. It's never been a straight line or linear in every fashion. Every quarter presents different opportunities that we can take advantage of. The thing has resulted from having a one-stop consumer-focused strategy is that we have these diversified businesses so that we can go in one direction or the other when things change. And the thing that I have found that gates our growth more than anything else isn't the market conditions, it's actually our ability to keep driving awareness and keep driving trial of our products and becoming a household brand name that's trusted. We could grow much faster if we spend more in marketing, it would be very profitable over the long term, but it will be less profitable in the near term. But the gating factor for us is how much do we want to drive awareness and trial. As it relates to your specific question about what this means in terms of loan growth on the balance sheet.\nChris Lapointe: Yes. So in terms of whether we're benefiting fully from the 6- to 7-month hold period at this point, I'll take you back to when we opened the bank, we started originating all of our SLR PL and home loans in about the March, April time frame, and we weren't fully originating until May. And at that point, it would take 6 to 7 months to really fully realize and get the benefit of the extended hold period. So we certainly saw a material uplift in net interest income in this quarter, in Q3, but we're still not going to see the full realized benefit of that 6 to 7 months hold until Q4 in the November time frame. So really good progress, but the full benefit will likely hit in Q4. And your other question on deposit growth into October, we aren't disclosing that.\nAnthony Noto: And the only other thing I'd add on deposit growth is that we did announce yesterday that we're moving the savings rate to 3% on APY and we'll continue to be nimble in the marketplace and ensure that we're in the top tier of value that we're adding to make sure we continue to get these high-quality deposits. The FICO score that I mentioned earlier and the conversion of open accounts to is really strong, and we would love to be more aggressive there, but we want to make sure we can maintain the quality.\nOperator: Our final question for today comes from David Chiaverini from Wedbush. David, your line is now open.\nDavid Chiaverini: Could you discuss the dynamics around the net interest margin and the outlook for the next few quarters. You just mentioned about how the savings product, APY, it's going up 50 basis points to 3%. And you mentioned earlier about loan pricing being up 60 basis points in the quarter. But could you kind of net those out for an outlook over the next few quarters?\nChris Lapointe: Yes. So we aren't providing specific guidance on our net interest margin, but what I would say is we've had really good success over the course of the last several quarters in terms of raising our overall yield, and that's a function of a mix shift towards more personal loans and the success in being able to raise our weighted average coupon 60 basis points across the entire portfolio for the last two quarters. In addition to that, our deposit betas have been roughly 50%. So when -- we're going to see natural and NIM expansion there. What I would say in terms of the go forward, there will be a number of things that will impact the overall NIM margin. And most predominantly, it will be our ability to keep pace with rising rates which we expect to be able to do on the personal loans product. But it will also have an -- it will also be impacted by the mix shift of student loans and home loans on the balance sheet. As we continue and expect a rebound in demand from student loan refinancing, those loans have a lower yield or weighted average coupon, which would have an impact on net interest margin. But overall, we're happy and proud of our ability to expand NIM and expect to be able to maintain these levels.\nAnthony Noto: Thanks, Chris. And before we wrap, I wanted to share some final thoughts. As we enter the last quarter of 2022, I would be remiss if I didn't take a moment and thank our entire SoFi team that has just been incredibly resilient in our ability to execute through volatile times to deliver a sixth quarter of record revenue and record EBITDA this quarter of $44 million. The results you see here are a direct result of our people and our people's ability to lead to meet our members. I can't help but be incredibly optimistic about the future of SoFi given the unprecedented results of the last two years and the resilience our team has shown. Even the toughest market conditions, quarter after quarter, we've delivered on our goals and exceed expectations across the board. It's an absolute privilege to lead this company as we help change people's lives every single day for the better. Our members need us more than ever and we'll continue to show up for them spades. There is no shortage of challenges ahead. But there has been no shortage of challenges every year since I joined nearly five years ago in 2018. And with each set of unique challenges, we've continued to rise to the occasion. And ultimately, we'll work tirelessly to be prepared as best we can for whatever we face ahead just as we have each year before. Until we talk next quarter. Thank you for your interest, and thank you for your support as our shareholders.\nOperator: Thank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Chris Lapointe",
            "content": "Thanks, Anthony, and good morning, everyone. Overall, we had a great quarter with strong growth trends across the entire business. We achieved record revenue and record EBITDA. I'm going to walk you through some key financial highlights for the quarter and then share some color on our financial outlook. Unless otherwise stated, I'll be referring to adjusted results for the third quarter of 2022 versus third quarter of 2021. Our GAAP consolidated income statement and all reconciliations can be found in today's earnings release and the subsequent 10-Q filing, which will be made available next week. For the quarter, growth accelerated and we delivered record adjusted net revenue of $419 million, up 51% year-over-year and 18% sequentially from the prior quarter's record of $356 million. Adjusted EBITDA and margins improved year-over-year as we delivered a record $44 million at an 11% margin, representing 3x year-over-year growth on a dollar basis and nearly 700 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion. Sequentially, EBITDA was up $24 million and margins expanded nearly 500 basis points as we saw margin improvement across each of sales and marketing, technology and product development, G&A and ops functional expense lines. Now on to the segment level performance, where we saw a strong growth and record revenue across all three segments. In Lending, third quarter adjusted net revenue grew 38% year-over-year to $297 million. Results were driven by 93% growth in net interest income and 10% growth in noninterest income. Growth in net interest income was driven by a 70% year-over-year increase in average interest-earning assets and a 144 basis point year-over-year increase in average yields, resulting in an average net interest margin of 5.85% for the quarter. This represents 126 basis points of year-over-year and 62 basis points of sequential NIM expansion. Growth in noninterest income was a result of increased originations and strong personal loan and student loan sales execution. Q3 originations grew 2% year-over-year to $3.5 billion and were driven by record volumes in our personal loans business, which grew 71% year-over-year to $2.8 billion. However, both student loan and home loan originations were down by more than 50% year-over-year as we await the expiration of the moratorium on federal student loan payments coming in January, while rising rates and fulfillment issues continue to impact our home loans business. We achieved this top line growth while maintaining our stringent credit standards and disciplined focus on quality. Our personal loan borrowers weighted average income is $160,000, with a weighted average FICO score of 746. Our student loan borrowers weighted average income is $170,000 with a weighted average FICO of 771. This focus on quality has led to strong credit performance. Our on-balance sheet delinquency rates and charge-off rates remain healthy and are still below pre-COVID levels. Our on-balance sheet 90-day personal loan delinquency rate was 30 basis points in Q3 2022, while our annualized personal loan charge-off rate was 1.95%. Our on-balance sheet 90-day student loan delinquency rate was 11 basis points in Q3 2022, while our annualized student loan charge-off rate was 0.33%. As we have expressed in the past, it is reasonable to expect credit metrics to revert over time to more normalized pre-pandemic levels but continue to expect very healthy performance relative to broader industry levels. The Lending business delivered $181 million of contribution profit at a 61% margin, up from $118 million a year ago and a 55% margin. This improvement was driven by a mix shift to higher-margin personal loans revenue as well as ops efficiencies and fixed cost leverage across the entire segment. Shifting to our Tech Platform, where we delivered record net revenue of $85 million in the quarter, up 69% year-over-year, while record Galileo revenue was up 29% year-over-year. Overall, annual revenue growth was driven by 40% year-over-year Galileo account growth to $124 million in total as well as sequential growth in transactions per active account. The segment delivered a contribution profit of $20 million, representing a 23% margin and 30% if you were to exclude Technisys. Moving on to Financial Services, where net revenue of $49 million increased 288% year-over-year, with new all-time high revenue for SoFi Money and continued strong contributions from SoFi Credit Card, SoFi Invest and lending as a service. Overall monetization continues to improve with annualized revenue per product increasing for the second consecutive quarter to $34, up 112% year-over-year from $16 in the same prior year quarter and up 46% sequentially from $23. We reached 5.9 million Financial Services products in the quarter, which is up 83% year-over-year, and we continued to see strong product adds with 557,000 new products in the segment. We hit 2 million products in SoFi Money, $2.1 million in SoFi Invest and $1.6 million in relay. Contribution losses were $53 million in the quarter, which increased year-over-year, predominantly as a result of building our CECL reserves for the SoFi Credit Card business which is expected as we continue to grow in scale. In addition, we saw a year-over-year reduction in higher-margin digital assets revenue. Switching to our balance sheet, where we remain very well capitalized with ample cash and excess liquidity. The recent opening of SoFi Bank further reinforces our strong balance sheet and provides us with more flexibility and access to a lower cost of capital relative to alternative sources of funding. In Q3, assets grew by $3 billion as a result of adding loans to the balance sheet given the strong growth we continue to see in personal loan originations. On the liability side of the balance sheet, we saw tremendous growth in deposits as they grew to $5.0 billion, up $2.3 billion quarter-over-quarter. Because of this, we exited the quarter with $2.5 billion drawn on our $7.1 billion of warehouse capacity, which represents 35% of our total available capacity. Let me finish up with guidance. Throughout the last 12 months, we have demonstrated the benefit of having a diversified set of revenue streams and a keen focus on underwriting high-quality credit. We expect those benefits to persist going forward even in light of the existing macro backdrop. Our outlook also assumes a late Q4 2022 benefit in student loan originations, ahead of the January 2023 federal student loan payment moratorium exploration based on the trend that we experienced in 2021. This benefit is expected to partially offset seasonal Q4 softness we typically see in other lending products. For the full year of 2022, we now expect to deliver revenue of $1.517 billion to $1.522 billion, above our prior guidance of $1.508 billion to $1.513 billion and full year 2022 EBITDA of $115 million to $120 million, above our prior guidance of $104 million to $109 million. Overall, we couldn't be more proud of our Q3 results and continued progress. Having delivered nearly $1.7 billion of annualized revenue and over $170 million of annualized EBITDA, we continue to make great progress against our long-term growth objectives in the quarter and we remain very well capitalized to continue pursuing our ultimate goal of making SoFi a top financial institution. With that, let's begin the Q&A. So what I would say is we've made really good progress in the overall marketing efficiencies over the last few years, and that's been driven by growth in brand awareness, cross-buy and scaling our lower CAC products. If you were to look at Q3 '22, you'll see that our sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue decreased 400 basis points year-over-year and 200 basis points quarter-over-quarter. In terms of specific CAC trends I would say that we're acquiring members today at a level that supports our longer-term EBITDA margin target of 30%. When determining how much we're willing to spend to acquire a member on a day-to-day basis, we're looking at a host of different factors. We're looking at the lifetime value that, that member could achieve, and we're also looking at overall payback periods. What we've observed recently over the course of the last few quarters is that our overall LTV of financial services members has increased as a result of having the bank and focus on growing direct deposit members and are to that period are in the 12- to 18-month time frame. That has given us additional flexibility on CAC and the ability to scale the number of financial services products that we have. This growth in investment in Financial Services products has resulted in CAC efficiencies within our Lending products. And you'll see in the queue that our overall CAC for new Lending members decreased by 8% to 9%, both year-over-year and sequentially, and that's really helped contribute to the overall margin compression that we're seeing. Yes, sure. John, so in terms of our gain on sale margins for the quarter, our personal loans business was at 3.25% excluding hedge gains. And it was 4% when you include hedges associated loans sold in period. Student loan refinancing was 4.3%, excluding the hedge. And it was the same on a hedged basis given that all loans sold in period were in a fixed rate structure. And then our home loans gain on sale was negative 1.7%, excluding the hedge and 90 basis points including the hedges. What I would say in terms of overall appetite for our loans, things continue to be robust. We ended up selling over $1 billion of loans in the quarter. And like I said, given the fact that we have the bank today, we have sufficiently more flexibility than we had prior to that. We have sufficient excess liquidity. We have -- we just raised $3.6 billion of equity last year. We have a large and growing deposit base of north of $5 billion now. And we have $7.1 billion of warehouse capacity available to us, only 35% of which is drawn. So we have a ton of flexibility with respect to being able to hold loans on the balance sheet for a longer period of time. And we're going to seek to maximize ROE on every single loan that we underwrite in a given period of time. Yes. And just building on that, to put it in more context, you'll see in the Q next week that the weighted average interest rate earned on our entire PL personal loans portfolio increased 60 basis points quarter-over-quarter for the second quarter in a row. And that 60 basis point increases on the entire portfolio, not just new in-period originations that occurred. So if you look at just new period originations, the actual quarter-over-quarter increase in WACC was substantially more. Yes. So what I would say is our strategy hasn't changed. Given the flexibility that we now have with the bank, we're able to hold loans for a longer period of time. And that was certainly something that we did in Q3 as well as Q2. What I would say is having the bank provides us with sufficiently additional flexibility and a new source of funding which allows us to grow that balance sheet and hold loans for a longer period of time. There are a few ways that we can grow loans on the balance sheet and generate net interest income. We can either originate, which has been the primary source of driving volume in terms of personal loans, but we can also repurchase loans. In addition to that, one of the things that we've done with a number of our whole loan forward flow agreements is structure them in a way where we have the right of first refusal to purchase loans when the buyer wants to sell. And we're starting to see more and more of that where, from time to time, we see a whole loan buyer come to us with the of first refusal to purchase loans. And given the credit quality and loss profile and return of the loans that we originally underwrite, we strongly consider that. So that's something we'll also take into consideration. Yes. So in terms of whether we're benefiting fully from the 6- to 7-month hold period at this point, I'll take you back to when we opened the bank, we started originating all of our SLR PL and home loans in about the March, April time frame, and we weren't fully originating until May. And at that point, it would take 6 to 7 months to really fully realize and get the benefit of the extended hold period. So we certainly saw a material uplift in net interest income in this quarter, in Q3, but we're still not going to see the full realized benefit of that 6 to 7 months hold until Q4 in the November time frame. So really good progress, but the full benefit will likely hit in Q4. And your other question on deposit growth into October, we aren't disclosing that. Yes. So we aren't providing specific guidance on our net interest margin, but what I would say is we've had really good success over the course of the last several quarters in terms of raising our overall yield, and that's a function of a mix shift towards more personal loans and the success in being able to raise our weighted average coupon 60 basis points across the entire portfolio for the last two quarters. In addition to that, our deposit betas have been roughly 50%. So when -- we're going to see natural and NIM expansion there. What I would say in terms of the go forward, there will be a number of things that will impact the overall NIM margin. And most predominantly, it will be our ability to keep pace with rising rates which we expect to be able to do on the personal loans product. But it will also have an -- it will also be impacted by the mix shift of student loans and home loans on the balance sheet. As we continue and expect a rebound in demand from student loan refinancing, those loans have a lower yield or weighted average coupon, which would have an impact on net interest margin. But overall, we're happy and proud of our ability to expand NIM and expect to be able to maintain these levels."

            "name": "Anthony Noto",
            "content": "Thank you, Maura, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results demonstrate the continued resilience of both our team and business and our ability to deliver another quarter of record revenue and EBITDA and strong overall operating results. A few key achievements from the third quarter include our sixth consecutive quarter of record adjusted net revenue of $419 million, up 51% year-over-year, reflecting record revenue in all three business segments; $44 million of record adjusted EBITDA, up 118% quarter-over-quarter; continued strong performance in member and product additions as well as cross-buy volume; further scaling of SoFi Bank with accelerating growth to surpass $5 billion in deposits, up 86% quarter-over-quarter; and savings of 125 basis points; and cost of funds versus using other sources of debt to fund loans. Another quarter of positive GAAP net income for SoFi Bank at $28 million at an 11% margin. Members and products each saw rapid year-over-year growth with continued strong cross-buy trends. The 424,000 new members in Q3 2022 brings total members to 4.7 million, up 61% year-over-year. We also added 635,000 new products in Q3, ending with nearly 7.2 million total products, up 69% year-over-year. Of these new adds, Financial Services products of 5.9 million at quarter end grew by 83% year-over-year, while Lending products of nearly 1.3 million were up 24%. The strength of our results once again underscores how our full suite of differentiated products and services provides the foundation for a uniquely diversified business that is able to endure through market cycles. Now I'd like to spend some time on segment level results, with a particular focus on the benefits of a diversified business drivers as well as the structural advantage of our bank charter. In Lending, our personal loan performance more than offset the continued lack of demand in student loan refinancing and the less robust performance of home loans. Student loan refi continues to be negatively impacted as federal borrowers await the end of the moratorium on federal student loan payments. Home loans face macro headwinds from rising rates while we continue the process of transitioning to new fulfillment partners. We originated a record of over $2.8 billion in personal loans in Q3, up 14% from $2.5 billion last quarter and nearly doubled the $1.6 billion in Q3 2021. The product continues to deliver and, most importantly, this is while maintaining our strict credit standards in attracting borrowers with high incomes and FICO scores. While these origination levels themselves are impressive, the strength of our balance sheet and diversification of our funding sources provide new options to fund Lending growth while driving efficiency with cost savings. These advantages are a direct result of SoFi Bank. Having more flexibility with our balance sheet allows us to generate more net interest margin revenue per loan and optimize returns, a critical advantage in light of the macro uncertainty. Additionally, by using our deposits to fund loans, we benefit from a lower cost of funding for loans and thus more profit per loan. In Q3 alone, the difference in our deposit cost of funds and other sources of debt was approximately 125 basis points versus 100 basis points in Q2, a powerful benefit in a rising rate environment. Lastly, we have a much more compelling value proposition in SoFi Checking and Savings as we can invest the greater revenue and profit per loan from the two benefits I just mentioned into an industry-leading APY, which drives direct deposit members resulting in high-quality deposits and great levels of engagement. This has led to higher average account balances even as average spend has increased. We exited the quarter with over $5 billion in total deposits, and 85% of SoFi Money deposits are from direct deposit members. In fact, 50% of newly funded SoFi Money accounts are setting up direct deposit by day 30 versus 37% in the second quarter, and this has had a significant impact on spending. Q3 annualized spend was 2 times full year 2021 total spend and Q3 spend per average funded account was up 22% quarter-over-quarter. SoFi Money members increased nearly 72% year-over-year to 2.3 million accounts while maintaining attractive demographics. In fact, the median FICO score for direct deposit accounts opened in the third quarter was 750. Given the quality of these members, we see ample opportunity for cross-buying in the future. Moving on to Financial Services more broadly, where net revenue nearly tripled year-over-year to $49 million and grew 61% from $30 million in Q2. We've continued to achieve strong member and product growth by iterating on products to ensure they are differentiated by four key factors, fast, selection, content and convenience, and continue to invest to make them work better when used together. We finished Q3 with 5.9 million Financial Services products, up 83% year-over-year and 4.6 times the total Lending products of 1.3 million. The increased scale in Financial Services helps drive cross-buy and marketing efficiencies. Financial Services sales and marketing spend as a percentage of net revenue was 58% in Q3 versus 81% the prior quarter and 105% in Q3 of last year. We achieved this improved efficiency even as we continue to scale our top-of-the-funnel products, which often do not contribute stand-alone to revenue for 12 to 18 months. This is due to the increasing monetization and attractiveness of these products, growing brand awareness and network effects. As mentioned, we continue to iterate and invest aggressively in our product suite, and that investment continues to pay dividends as members embrace our launches. Just in the third quarter, we introduced an increase in our Checking and Savings APY of up to 2.5% as of September 30. In addition to the unmatched value proposition, a host of free features and a unique rewards program. In fact, we're increasing our APY in savings to 3% this week to continue to drive more value for our members. Within SoFi Invest, we introduced new proprietary ETFs to the platform and remain on track to launch the much anticipated options trading product by year-end, now in beta testing. We've increasingly utilized our relay platform to acquire, educate and advise our members on their holistic financial picture and their next best move. We launched credit alerts in Q3, and we'll continue to add features to drive engagement. The relay platform has become a notable source of cross-buying, further bolstering the financial services productivity. We delivered unprecedented awareness growth as of Q3 2022 by delighting our target audience with compelling value propositions, reaching our target audience where they are effectively and efficiently, producing winning creative and leveraging data-driven tools to continue to get smarter. Transitioning to the Technology Platform, a critical element of SoFi's strategy. Not only is this segment a strong revenue and cash flow driver, but its two businesses, Galileo and Technisys, also contribute to two main tenets of SoFi strategy: faster innovation at lower cost and high-return, diversified revenue streams. As a reminder, we're a consumer technology company that delivers financial services products. We need to be a one-stop shop for major financial decisions in all the days in between. To do this, we want to own end-to-end technologies, and that's where our Technology Platform comes into play. Only we can truly understand the technologies that we need the most. We build them in a way that's both great for us and for everyone else in the ecosystem. In the third quarter, full segment revenue of $85 million grew 69% year-over-year, which included another quarter of record revenue from Galileo, with a 23% margin at the segment level or 30% if you exclude Technisys. Galileo's overall diversified growth strategy includes growth in new verticals, new products and new geographies. In Q3, Galileo signed 10 new clients and made big strides in its strategy, with a strong 30% of new deals in B2B and 40% of new deals outside the United States. Importantly, of these 10 new deals, 7 have existing subscribers, portfolios or payment businesses, reflecting continued demand for our services and new use cases for embedded fintechs from more mature organizations. In Q3, we further invested in our push into the B2B segment by shipping two core capabilities: first, account-level controls, which provides self-service opportunities for program managers to set tighter controls in real time at the account level for where and how funds can be spent while reducing fraudulent transactions; and second, real-time funding, which automatically funds an account in real time during the transaction process, optimizing the working capital needs of our SMB customers. I'll finish here by saying that we've been in an all-out sprint over the last five years to build out our digital product suite to meet our members' needs for every major financial decision in their lives in all the days in between. The benefits of our strategy to build a uniquely diversified business, combined with a national bank charter, not only positions SoFi to be the winner who takes most in the secular transition of financial services to digital but also provide greater durability through our market cycle. I'm excited about where we are today and even more excited about where we can go from here. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to review the financials for the quarter. I would say there wasn't a meaningful change in the different channels that drove member growth. We're really happy with the trend that we're seeing in member growth. And I would say the quality of our members is increasing as well and the data that we have for our members is increasing as well, which gives us more opportunity to help our members get their money, right. What I'd say is we're really trying to target high-quality members with good compounding growth over years, not over any one quarter. So we're targeting 400,000 net new member adds per quarter. At some point, that could take a step function up. But right now, we're sort of balancing the growth of our member base with quality as well as making sure that we're building our technology and processes to meet our members need as we scale so meaningfully. The bank strategy has been a huge help to us. It's allowed us to not just drive member growth and SoFi Money and SoFi Checking and Savings, which lowers our cost of funding, but it also allows us to be more nimble in other areas like our relay product, and we can experiment much more with the relay product and having people connect their credit card accounts or their checking and savings accounts or their brokerage accounts and putting their real estate, and that information can then help us cross-sell into the checking sales account which is really attractive. We didn't have that same leverage point in the past, and so the combination of those two is also something that's new. We've been clear that we support targeted forgiveness programs and the announced programs that the administration released are aligned with what we thought would be a fair and balanced targeted view on programs. We think the most important thing for people that have federal student loans is clarity and consistency. And so we encourage administration to stay on track and to provide transparency and clarity on execution so they can make the best decisions on how they want to get their money right. We think the addressable market for student loan refinancing is quite large even with these changes. Many of the forgiveness programs will probably not be applicable to our member base and our target demographics, the income levels below, for qualification, our income is higher than the income level we have to be below, and a number of other factors that would cause the TAM to be still large. Now that TAM can increase and decrease, depending on where federal funds rates are and overall WACC is for that product in the marketplace, but the number of people that will still have federal student loans outstanding that could refinance is really large still. The other thing I would just add to what Chris mentioned is something that we've learned in the Lending business and then something that I think applies now that we have a one-stop shop with all the other products. Sometimes it's misleading when a company drives low CAC. It has been the case that it was in Lending. If we drive CAC too low, we lower the quality of the borrower that we bring in and the life-of-loan losses of that portfolio can actually go up, which would more than offset the CAC savings. And so it's counterintuitive to think about CAC and Financial Services. What we focus on is what's the right CAC within a unit economic standpoint, whether that's a per account economics or that's per loan economics to drive an acceptable variable profit. So when we multiply that variable profit per account or per member by the number of people that have that product, that total variable profit dollars exceed our fixed costs and drive to our long-term 30% margin. So there will definitely be ups and downs in CAC based on mix shift, based on environments but know we're solving for the LTV equation and the right unit economics to drive to a 30% margin. It's not always the case that a lower CAC is good. You can have much lower quality members in money and checking account, for example. Our direct deposit growth has been really strong. I pay a lot more money for direct deposit customers than it would for just a funded customer because of all the benefits we get in debit interchange in addition to lower cost of funding on the loan side. You're on mute. Yes. We had really strong metrics in Checking and Savings and really high quality. 50% of our newly funded SoFi Money accounts are setting up direct deposits by day 30. That's up versus 37% in the second quarter. And if you benchmark that versus other companies, that's a really high percentage. The quality of those members from a credit standpoint is also very attractive. The median FICO score for direct deposit accounts opened in the third quarter was 750. That's a direct result of us architecting the product to meet the needs of our target member. We're going after high earners not well served. They have average income of over $100,000 per household. They have 680 FICO scores and higher. That doesn't mean we won't serve other people that are outside of that core demographic, that target. There are concentric circles around that, that will benefit from these products. But we architect that specifically to attract that type of number. That, combined with great targeted marketing and iteration over the last three years, has resulted in really strong quality as well us still maintaining pretty good growth. The other thing which doesn't get talked about too much because it's just scaling so significantly is the amount of spending that's happening on the platform. If you annualize our Q3 spend number to four quarters instead of one quarter, it's over 2x what we did in 2021. So really a substantial increase. And on a per account basis, we're up about 22% quarter-over-quarter in spending. So the strategy is really working and the bank license has allowed that to come to fruition, and we're really happy with the outcome. And Chris and I will tag team. I would say holistically, I'm really looking forward to having a year in which we have continuity and stability across markets and across company-specific initiatives. If I reflect back in the last five years, every year, we've had a major company-driven initiative or an economic backdrop or a market backdrop that's been somewhat volatile. Obviously, we've been dealing with the student loan monitoring for the last three years, and on top of that going public and on top of that switching to becoming a bank. We just haven't had a year in which all of our businesses have the wind at their back. And that is possible in 2023, and I'm very aware of the current outlook for the economic environment and inflation and interest rates. But if things sort of hit where consensus is, we're going to have a year in which all things could have a really strong tailwind. As I think about our growth versus investing, we're going to stick to what we've talked about in the past, barring any unforeseen acquisitions or major strategic initiatives that were unplanned, with what we call the 70-30 plan. We're going to reinvest 70% of incremental revenue in the business and drop 30% of incremental revenue to the bottom line to show progress towards our long-term margin of 30-plus percent on an EBITDA basis. And so the growth that we have this year is one that we want to compound for decades, not for just one year, and have it be consistent over time. So we will continue to reinvest in the business with that ratio. And we think we're in such early days in all of our products. The only thing that's gating our growth is driving awareness. And there's a lot of ways to drive awareness. One way is obviously paid marketing. Another way is while having your products and partnerships. And we'll continue to lever all three of those opportunities. But we've barely scratched the surface in how big we can be. And now with over 4.5 million members, we have our sights on high single digits and double digits after that and a very aggressive perspective on what the cross-buy opportunity will be for us. So we will invest meaningfully but against that ratio. And if the economic environment is worse than expected, then we'll adjust accordingly and make sure we deliver that ratio. And one additional thing that I had just at the kind of first principle standpoint, we've been fortunate in that we have the technology data and process systems to test iteratively each week different price points and different credits. And so we've been able to effectively increase the weighted average coupon of our loans as Fed funds rate have increased, which gives us a benefit on the execution and the value of those loans, and at the same time, being able to reduce our cost of funding. The combination of those two with strong life-of-loan losses within our target range allows us to get to great value on a per loan basis that we're trying to drive maximum variable profit dollars within a certain ROE. Which is just a phenomenal job by our team to maintain the profitability of our loans and still drive the growth that you're seeing at unprecedented levels in that product. Welcome. I'd say it's old school, focusing on the fundamentals, product, pricing, promotion, placement, the four piece. If you go back to 2018, when we first changed leadership of the company, one of our priorities was to focus on quality over quantity. And it was a really tough decision. We took our volume down meaningfully from where it was in 2017. In addition to that, we took it down relative to what the prior team thought they would be able to achieve. And the reason is we wanted to rearchitect the products so that on a per loan basis we can achieve, through the cycle, a 40% to 50% variable profit margin. I won't walk through the equation of how to get there, but we're happy to do that off-line if it's helpful. Well, we look at the variable profit margin by channel, by marketing channel. And we developed a much more sophisticated approach to pricing. There was only -- it only could price 50% of the loans at one price and 50% at another price, and we developed a whole construct to be able to do 36 sales across 6 different grids, so to speak, and it's gone way, way beyond that now. And so it's really hard to find people that don't necessarily need to refinance. It's really easy to find people that need to refinance. In addition, when you do find those people that may not necessarily need to refinance, you have to give them a cost savings or benefit relative to their other choices. So it needs to be compelling. You have to find them. But the price that you're giving them or the savings you're giving them has to be of greater value than what they're currently doing. And then you need to make sure you have the right operational controls, the right life of loan losses and credit processes to ensure that you underwrite appropriately with the right operating and CAC costs. The last thing I'd mention is our credit models continue to be updated based on on-property data, which helps us now more than before. We're trying to underwrite to free cash flow. And so the more information we have on your income, the more information we have on your spending, the better we can underwrite to free cash flow. So it's a combination of all those different things. And the last thing I'd mention is our time to fund the personal loan is two days. It used to be eight days. Our time to fund the student loan used to be in the mid- to high teens. Now it's in the single digits. That's also a factor that people underestimate in terms of the ability to meet the demands of that borrower when you do find them. In addition to that, we have a sense of urgency. We don't rush. We want to make sure we underwrite appropriately. But we have to be competitive using our technology and our operations to deliver a short time to fund. So on the technology platform, we're really pleased with the growth that we're driving and even more so with the processes that have been undertaken to provide a stable, reliable and resilient platform for our partners and the pipeline of products in addition to the integration of Technisys and Galileo. The major investment that we've made over the last two years of owning Galileo was transitioning from on-prem into the cloud. And that transition is largely done. I think the report I've seen most recently is 99% of our authorizations are now in the cloud. And that's really going to provide great SLA performance for our partners and allow them to innovate faster and be more nimble using data real time to make more better decisions. We have a robust pipeline within Galileo for our partners, but we also have a robust pipeline for new verticals. We are definitely starting to migrate away from just pure B2C. We talked about the B2B customers that we've been able to attract on the last couple of quarters, and the pipeline there remains very robust. And generally, the B2B companies already have existing payment systems and payment supply for us to process. So when we convert those over, there will be a faster time to revenue and also get much higher probability. In addition to building products for B2B that are more controllable for them and meet their needs better in addition to just having the processing capability, we're also continuing to expand internationally with really strong trends throughout Latin America, both on the back of Galileo as well as Technisys, which was where it was strong to begin with. In addition to geographic expansion, we have a robust pipeline of products for our existing partners. We'll be launching paying for in the coming months. Paying for is a product that was built on Galileo and on Technisys. It will be the first product that's built across both processing and the core technology. And that will be a great product for that large installed base of 120-plus million accounts, many of which are B2C. And it's one that better suits the demand and the interest of the lower-income customers of our partners on the B2C side there. In terms of growth in the future, I would say we're not planning for accelerating growth, but the TAM is so large and we've made such large investments, that is a possibility, on a revenue standpoint as well as on a revenue per account standpoint. It's not something that we would forecast, but it's -- given it's so early in the transition of physical payment to digital and we're so early in the new launch of many of our products, but it's possible. It's not something that we will forecast. In terms of demand, we're focused much more on existing portfolios than we are on startups because of the known value that's there and hugely differentiated service that we have in the cloud as being end-to-end with core technology plus processing plus the front end. We are a much better solution than what's currently out in the marketplace for many financial institutions that are very scaled. And so those have longer lead times, but they'll have bigger paybacks and a much bigger impact to the absolute dollars that we generate in our revenue. We've definitely been winning share of deposits. We think we have an incredibly differentiated checking and savings account with high interest checking of 2.5%. No fees, free overdraft protection, you can spend with your phone, spend with your card. You can do person to-person payment, you can do bill pay, pre-roundups and a unique rewards program. So I think our product is unmatched when it comes to checking across those different dimensions, not to mention you will become a SoFi member and get a number of other benefits. We also introduced SoFi Plus, which is a way to pull together all of the different benefits you would get as a member in addition to a few incremental pieces of value on rewards step-ups. And that is a product that gets unlocked through direct deposit. And while it's very small and early from a standpoint, it's actually delivering the type of impact that we thought it would drive. So we're winning deposit share. I'll tell you we're taking it from the traditional banks. Someone asked the question earlier, and I've got to answer it, what are we seeing from the neobanks that are maybe focused on the underserved or neobanks more broadly, are they pulling back on marketing and not seeing strong growth? I think what we see in the industry is they're seeing great growth, and we're seeing great growth. And I think they're serving the underserved incredibly well, that were unbanked as well as underserved by traditional banks. But the vast, vast majority of what we're seeing is coming from the largest banks in the United States, and we're winning deposit share from them. We do watch the deposit trends more broadly in the industry, and it's clear that not only are the large banks losing deposits to digital companies like SoFi and fintech companies like SoFi, but they're also losing into money market funds. But we want to have an attractive rate that competes against all of the different options they have, including investment accounts and money market funds. So I'll let Chris answer the question more numerically. I'll just share a perspective. The great thing about the financial services sector is that the factors for growth change constantly. Interest rates are changing. The economic environment is changing. People or the financial markets are changing. And I would tell you, being here five years, every quarter presents a different set of outcomes across all those market factors than we thought at the beginning of the quarter. And we run to where the opportunity is. And in some quarters, that opportunity may be driven by being able to raise WACC. In some quarters, the opportunity would be driven by a really strong securitization market. And some quarters are going to be driven by a really strong wholesale market. The most important thing is that we diversify our funding sources and we diversify our distribution as well as our ability to hold. And that gives us an ability to be nimble when the conditions change to go after those opportunities. And so I don't want anyone to think that it's a straight line, linear in any fashion. It's never been a straight line or linear in every fashion. Every quarter presents different opportunities that we can take advantage of. The thing has resulted from having a one-stop consumer-focused strategy is that we have these diversified businesses so that we can go in one direction or the other when things change. And the thing that I have found that gates our growth more than anything else isn't the market conditions, it's actually our ability to keep driving awareness and keep driving trial of our products and becoming a household brand name that's trusted. We could grow much faster if we spend more in marketing, it would be very profitable over the long term, but it will be less profitable in the near term. But the gating factor for us is how much do we want to drive awareness and trial. As it relates to your specific question about what this means in terms of loan growth on the balance sheet. And the only other thing I'd add on deposit growth is that we did announce yesterday that we're moving the savings rate to 3% on APY and we'll continue to be nimble in the marketplace and ensure that we're in the top tier of value that we're adding to make sure we continue to get these high-quality deposits. The FICO score that I mentioned earlier and the conversion of open accounts to is really strong, and we would love to be more aggressive there, but we want to make sure we can maintain the quality. Thanks, Chris. And before we wrap, I wanted to share some final thoughts. As we enter the last quarter of 2022, I would be remiss if I didn't take a moment and thank our entire SoFi team that has just been incredibly resilient in our ability to execute through volatile times to deliver a sixth quarter of record revenue and record EBITDA this quarter of $44 million. The results you see here are a direct result of our people and our people's ability to lead to meet our members. I can't help but be incredibly optimistic about the future of SoFi given the unprecedented results of the last two years and the resilience our team has shown. Even the toughest market conditions, quarter after quarter, we've delivered on our goals and exceed expectations across the board. It's an absolute privilege to lead this company as we help change people's lives every single day for the better. Our members need us more than ever and we'll continue to show up for them spades. There is no shortage of challenges ahead. But there has been no shortage of challenges every year since I joined nearly five years ago in 2018. And with each set of unique challenges, we've continued to rise to the occasion. And ultimately, we'll work tirelessly to be prepared as best we can for whatever we face ahead just as we have each year before. Until we talk next quarter. Thank you for your interest, and thank you for your support as our shareholders."

Our second quarter results demonstrate the continued resilience of both our team and business and our ability to deliver another quarter of record revenue, strong financial and operating results and a positive start to the third quarter. A few key achievements from the second quarter include another quarter of record adjusted net revenue with 50% year-over-year growth. our eighth consecutive quarter or two full years of positive adjusted EBITDA, which more than doubled quarter-over-quarter, demonstrating the acceleration we anticipated throughout the year; continued strong growth in members, products and cross by volume; our first full quarter of contribution from SoFi Bank, which allowed us to surpass $2.7 billion in deposits, up 135% quarter-over-quarter, and we're still in the early days; and importantly, our first quarter of positive GAAP net income for SoFi Bank at $25 million. The strength of our results achieved in the face of continued volatility in financial markets, along with the ever-changing political, fiscal and economic landscape, once again underscores how our full suite of differentiated products and services provides the financial foundation for a uniquely diversified business that is able to endure through market cycles. We are able to allocate resources toward the best growth opportunities across our diverse offerings, which has enabled us to exceed our performance targets despite continued headwinds in certain businesses. While so much in the world continues to shift around us, at SoFi, it's been a new normal for us for the last four years. So to us, it's business as usual. We've built our products and services to provide durable, high levels of growth with a specific economic profile, and that is what we are delivering. Now I'll run through the highlights of the financial results for the quarter. Total adjusted net revenue grew 50% year-over-year to a record $356 million, up 11% from the prior record set in Q1 2022. Strength in all three of our diverse business segments contributed to these results. Lending adjusted net revenue grew 46% year-over-year to $251 million led by continued outperformance in our personal loans business, which saw record origination levels of nearly $2.5 billion as well as strong sales execution. Financial services net revenue grew 78% year-over-year to $30 million, up nearly 30% for $24 million in Q1 with our largest contributors being record SoFi checking and savings revenue, along with continued strength in SoFi Credit Card, SoFi Invest and Lending as a Service. Technology platform net revenue grew 85% year-over-year to nearly $84 million with record Galileo revenues in our first full quarter of contribution from TechniSys. Importantly, Galileo revenue growth accelerated to 39% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA of just over $20 million increased 81% year-over-year and 134% sequentially. Members and products each saw accelerating quarter-over-quarter growth and their second highest quarter ever of new adds, and we continue to see strong cross-buy trends. The 450,000 new members in Q2 '22 represented our second highest quarter of new adds bring total members to $4.3 million, up 69% year-over-year. Our industry-leading APY was a strong driver of high-quality SoFi Money member growth, and increasing direct deposit conversions give us confidence that our growing member base is both durable and active on the platform. We also added 72,000 new products in Q2. This represents our second highest quarter of new product adds, ending with nearly 6.6 million total products, up 79% year-over-year. Of these new adds, financial services products of $5.4 million at quarter end doubled year-over-year, while lending products of more than 1.2 million were up 22%. The significant scale of our top-of-the-funnel products is driving greater and more efficient member growth and cross buy. Total cross bought products in the quarter increased 24% year-over-year, demonstrating continued success of our financial services productivity loop strategy. Now I'd like to spend some time touching on the segment level results. These highlight the benefits of our uniquely diversified model, the robust growth across all three business segments, increased efficiency driving improved profitability and our strong balance sheet with multiple funding sources, all of this with strong and stable credit metrics. First is lending, where we originated a record of nearly $2.5 billion of personal loans in Q2, up 22% from $2 billion last quarter and nearly double $1.3 billion in Q2 2021. This product continues to deliver even while we maintain our strict credit standards and attract borrowers with high incomes and FICO scores. Our personal loan performance more than offset the continued lack of demand and student loan financing, which is down to 25% of volume prior to the moratorium on federal student loan payments; and the performance of home loans, which faced macro headwinds from rising rates while we continue the process of transitioning to new fulfillment partners. We're also differentiated in lending by the strength of our balance sheet and the diversification of our funding sources, 2 points which are bolstered by having SoFi Bank. The bank charter could not have come at a better time and the economic benefits are already starting to positively impact our operating and financial results. First, the ability to offer an industry-leading APY and value prop has led to strong growth in SoFi Money members, high-quality deposits and great levels of engagement. Money members have increased nearly 92% year-over-year to 1.8 million accounts and growth in balances has accelerated significantly. We exited the quarter with $2.7 billion in deposits, and spend trends have improved significantly. To put this in perspective, it took three years to accumulate our first $1 billion of deposits and just three months to grow another $1.6 billion. In addition, approximately 80% of our deposits are from direct deposit members, demonstrating the quality and stickiness of these deposits. Second, as a result of this growth in high-quality deposits, we've been able to benefit from a lower cost of funding for loans while being able to pass on higher rates in our loans. In Q2 alone, the difference in our deposit cost of funding and warehouse cost of funding was approximately 100 basis points, and that delta will continue to grow in a rising rate environment. And third, deposit funding increases flexibility to capture more NIM and optimize returns, a critical advantage in light of notable macro uncertainty. We don't have to access sales channels in the face of suboptimal conditions, such as those we've witnessed more broadly in the asset-backed security market over the last few quarters. The power and the financial benefit of the bank is demonstrated clearly by our $25 million of positive GAAP net income in Q2 at a 13% margin. We also have $5.5 billion of book equity on our balance sheet, and approximately $7 billion in warehouse facilities that we can access to fund loans, over half of which is committed capital. Now on to Financial services, where we've continued to achieve strong member and product growth by iterating on our products to ensure they are differentiated by four key factors: fast, selection, content and convenience and continue to invest to make them work better when used together. We finished Q2 with 5.4 million financial services products. That's up 100% year-over-year and 4.5x total lending products of $1.2 million. The increased scale in financial services products creates even more scale in cross-buying and company-wide marketing efficiencies. Total sales and marketing spend as a percentage of adjusted net revenue declined for the second consecutive quarter even as we scale our top-of-funnel products, which often do not contribute stand-alone to revenue for 12 to 18 months. This is due to the increasing monetization and attractiveness of these products or increased brand awareness and network effects. Our investment in our products is paying off as members embrace their product launches in financial services introduced in the first quarter. SoFi checking and savings provides an unmatched value prop through an industry-leading APY of up to 1.8% as of Monday, July 25, a host of free features and a unique rewards program. This strategy is driving strong growth in direct deposit accounts, which in turn is driving strong growth in spend, which grew 29% quarter-over-quarter. Within SoFi invest, we launched extended hours trading and saw our first full quarter of margin investing. We remain on track to launch options by year-end as well as introduce new proprietary ETFs to the platform. We've increasingly utilized our relay platform to acquire, educate and advise our members on their holistic financial picture and their next best move. We added the Auto Tracker product to the existing real estate property tracker and credit score monitoring to add even more insights to members' financial health and support them as they navigate the economic landscape. This platform has become a notable source of cross-buying, further bolstering the financial services productivity loop strategy. Transitioning to our technology platform, a critical element of our strategy. Not only is this segment a strong revenue and cash flow driver. But its two businesses, Galileo and Technisys, also contribute to two main tenets of the SoFi strategy. Faster innovation at lower cost return diversified revenue streams. In the second quarter, both segment revenue grew of 85% year-over-year include the first full quarter of contribution from Technisys. On an organic basis, Galileo revenue grew 39% year-over-year, and Galileo enabled accounts grew 48% year-over-year, and this is with a 26% margin or 33% as exclude Technisys. Among Galileo’s evolving products, Galileo has added new B2B capabilities as well as a secured credit card offering. I'd like to focus on the B2B segment for a moment as it is enormous, and we're already making great strides. 30% of the Galileo client pipeline is now comprised of B2B deals up dramatically from 10% to 15% at this time last year as we quickly leverage these new capabilities to penetrate more opportunities. And considering the market opportunity in this segment, we estimate the B2B opportunity at $29 trillion with 50% of payments still via paper check. Just like in consumer banking, we have the capability and the opportunity to convert these to digital payments and virtual cards. This is a prime example of how we have driven technological innovation at Galileo to address more market segments and further diversify sources of growth. And Techisys continues to achieve milestones with its first core banking deal in Mexico and the launch of a new banking client in Brazil in the second quarter. In addition to new products and an increasingly diverse client list, Techisysand Galileo have yet another major source of growth, cross-selling among their complementary client bases, product sets and geographic footprints, bringing Techisysto the U.S. through Galileo and Galileo to LatAm through Technisys, suffice to say that teams are running after these opportunities, and we cannot be more excited. I'll finish here by saying that we have been in an all-out sprint over the last four years to build out our digital product suite to meet our members' needs for every major financial decision in their lives and over the days in between. The benefits of our strategy to build a uniquely diversified business, combined with a national bank license, not only positions SoFi to be the winner takes most in the sector transition of financial services digital but also provide greater durability through our market cycle. I'm excited about where we are today and even more excited about where we can go from here. With that, let me turn it over to Chris for a review of the financials for the quarter.\nChris Lapointe: Thanks, Anthony. Overall, we had a great quarter with strong growth trends across the entire business. We exceeded our financial guidance while achieving record revenue in our eighth consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA despite operating in a rapidly evolving macro backdrop. I'm going to walk you through some key financial highlights for the quarter and then share some color on our financial outlook. Unless otherwise stated, I'll be referring to adjusted results for the second quarter of 2022 versus second quarter of 2021. Our GAAP consolidated income statement and all reconciliations can be found in today's earnings release and the subsequent 10-Q filing, which will be available next week. For the quarter, growth accelerated and we delivered record adjusted net revenue of $356 million, up 50% year-over-year and 11% sequentially from the prior quarter's record of $322 million. Q2 revenue was $16 million above the high end of our guidance of $330 million to $340 million. Adjusted EBITDA and margins also doubled quarter-over-quarter as we delivered $20 million at a 6% margin coming in $5 million above the high end of our guidance of $5 million to $15 million. Now on to the segment level performance, where we saw strong growth and record revenue across all three segments. In lending, second quarter adjusted net revenue accelerated and grew 46% year-over-year to $251 million. Year-over-year growth in lending was driven by a doubling of our net interest income and 18% growth in noninterest income. Growth in net interest income was driven by an increase in asset yields as well as average loan balances, while growth in noninterest income was a result of an increase in originations and hedge gains. Q2 originations grew 9% year-over-year to $3.2 billion and we're driven by record volumes in our personal loans business, which grew 91% year-over-year to $2.5 billion. However, both student loan and home loan originations were down by more than 50% year-over-year as we continue to face headwinds from the moratorium on federal student loan payments and rising rates as well as fulfillment issues continue to impact our home loans business. We achieved this top line growth while maintaining our stringent credit standards and disciplined focus on quality. Our personal loans borrowers' weighted average income is $160,000 with a weighted average FICO score of 748. Our student loan borrowers weighted average income is $170,000 with a weighted average FICO of 773. This focus on quality has led to strong credit performance. Our on-balance sheet delinquency rates and charge-off rates remain extremely healthy and are still approximately 50% below pre-COVID levels. Our on-balance sheet 90-day personal loan delinquency rate was 21 basis points in the quarter, while our annualized personal loan charge-off rate was 1.25%. Our on-balance sheet 90-day student loan delinquency rate was 4 basis points in the quarter, while our annualized student loan charge-off rate was just 28 basis points. The lending business delivered $142 million of contribution profit at a 57% margin, up from $89 million a year ago and a 52% margin. This improvement was driven by a mix shift to higher-margin personal loans revenue as well as ops efficiencies and fixed cost leverage across the entire segment. Shifting to our tech platform, where we delivered net revenue of $84 million in the quarter, up 85% year-over-year, including our first full quarter impact from Technisys. If you were to exclude Technisys, Organic growth was 39% year-over-year, a meaningful increase from the 19% year-over-year growth achieved in the first quarter of the year. This acceleration was a result of sequential growth in transactions per active account and, to a lesser extent, by having a relatively easy comparison quarter as Q1 2022 annual growth was dampened as a result of stimulus benefits in Q1 2021. Overall, annual revenue growth was driven by 48% year-over-year Galileo account growth to $117 million in total. We also signed 12 new clients, 8 of which are in the B2B space, further diversifying our partner base. The segment delivered a contribution profit of $22 million, representing a 26% margin and 33% if you were to exclude Techisys. Moving on to financial services, where net revenue of $30 million increased 78% year-over-year with new all-time high revenue for SoFi Money and continued strong contributions from SoFi Credit Card, SoFi Invest and Lending as a Service. We were able to achieve this growth despite having a tough comparison quarter. As a reminder, Q2 2021 financial services revenue included $4.4 million of episodic revenues from advisory and IPO underwriting services. Excluding that $4.4 million in Q2 '21, our year-over-year growth would have been 140%. We reached 5.4 million financial services products in the quarter, which is up 100% year-over-year and at 639,000 new products. It was our second highest quarter ever of new product adds in the segment. We hit 1.8 million products in SoFi Money, $2 million in SoFi Invest and $1.3 million in Relay. Contribution losses were $54 million for the quarter, which increased year-over-year, predominantly as a result of building our CECL reserves for the SoFi Credit Card business, which is expected as we continue to grow in scale. In addition, we saw a year-over-year reduction in higher margin and digital assets revenue as well as episodic IPO and advisory revenue. Switching to our balance sheet, where we remain very well capitalized with ample cash and excess liquidity. The recent opening of SoFi Bank only reinforces the strength of our balance sheet and provides us with more flexibility and the ability to achieve a lower cost of capital relative to alternative sources of funding. In Q2, assets grew by approximately $400 million quarter-over-quarter as a result of adding approximately $1 billion of loans to the balance sheet given the strong growth we continue to see in personal loan originations. Offsetting the growth in loans, we had a $700 million decrease in cash as a result of funding the bank in Q1. The equity used to capitalize the bank was part of cash and cash equivalents shortly after funding the bank at the end of Q1. It has since been deployed and is generating a strong return by funding originations in the bank. On the liability side of the balance sheet, due to our strong deposit growth, we exited the quarter with only $1.6 billion drawn on our warehouse facilities, about 20% of our overall $7 billion worth of capacity, down from $2.7 billion in the first quarter of the year. Overall, we remain very well capitalized with ample cash and excess liquidity. Finishing up with guidance. Throughout the last 12 months, we have demonstrated the benefit of having a diversified set of revenue streams and a keen focus on continuing to underwrite high-quality credit. We expect those benefits to persist going forward even in light of the existing macro backdrop. Our outlook also assumes the federal student loan payment moratorium will last until January 2023, which would result in a late Q4 2022 benefit based on the trend experienced in 2021. In the second half of the year, we expect to deliver $830 million to $835 million of adjusted net revenue and $75 million to $80 million of adjusted EBITDA with a more significant portion of the revenue and EBITDA getting generated in Q4. This guidance implies full year 2022 revenues of $1.508 billion to $1.513 billion, above our prior guidance of $1.505 billion to $1.510 billion. Our second half guidance implies full year 2022 EBITDA of $104 million to $109 million, above our prior guidance of $100 million to $105 million. Overall, we couldn't be more proud of our Q2 results and continued progress. Having delivered over $1.4 billion of annualized revenue in our eighth consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA, we continue to make great progress against our long-term growth objectives in the quarter, and we remain very well capitalized to continue pursuing our ultimate goal of making SoFi a top financial institution. With that, let's begin the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler. You may proceed.\nKevin Barker: Could you talk about why you feel comfortable continuing to push to grow the personal loan space, even though we have an uncertain economic outlook? I mean I understand a lot of these personal loans are very high credit quality, with very high FICO scores and higher incomes relative to what we see out there in the market. But there's obviously a lot of uncertainty out there, and I'd just love to hear your view on those loans and why they continue to be an attractive growth investment profile.\nAnthony Noto: It's Anthony. In volatile markets like we're in today with discontinuing interest rates and other issues around the macroeconomic environment, individuals are looking for ways to lower their cost of debt. We're looking for ways to better save and better spend. And so the demand in this environment is going to be quite strong. It's very prudent that we focus on our core target and make sure we stick to our disciplined credit profile. We underwrite the free cash flow that we're using our credit lines today underwriting to a FICO score or anything else. And we're in an environment where some of the best credit profile individuals are out there looking to refinance their debt from higher variable cost debt into fixed rate debt and also fixed maturities so they can lower their cost of borrowing and also manage their budgets. And that's creating a lot of demand, and our team is doing a great job of providing a range of products to meet their demand. We're sticking to our credit profile that we've had for the last four years. That's proven out quite well. We managed to a have a loan loss of about 8%. And as long as we're able to do that, we continue to underwrite. Now the environment does change, and we have leading indicators that we're tracking and a profile that our risk team manages that gives us early warning signals. And as those change, we change how much we're willing to underwrite. I'll give you an example. If you go back to March of 2020, we saw a dislocation in some of the commercial paper markets and the repo markets. We're quite worried about the liquidity in the marketplace, and we pulled back meaningfully on how much we're willing to lend. And we did that based on our overall profile of the macroeconomic lead indicators. And we didn't turn back on the amount we were lending until those turn green again. So it's something we've done in the past, something that's proven to be quite prudent. And we feel like we have the right team and our history in place, and I'll let Chris talk about the actual performance of the loans and what we're seeing.\nChris Lapointe: Yes. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the overall demographic and credit profile of our personal loans remains extremely strong. Like I had mentioned, the weighted average income of our borrower is 160,000 with an average FICO score of 748, and we're seeing really good trends in terms of overall delinquency. For our personal loans business, 90-day delinquencies were at 21 basis points in the quarter, and that's roughly in line with where we were a year ago, which was at 18 basis points. And then in terms of overall charge-off rates, our personal loans business, was at 1.25% annualized, again, which is roughly in line with where we were a year ago at 1.2%, and both of those metrics are well below where we were prior to COVID.\nKevin Barker: And then you obviously had fairly strong fee income and growth in spread income in the lending segment, I'm assuming that the personal loans were a large contributor to that. Are you seeing any headwinds from changes in the securitization market or maybe changes in hedging costs given the volatility we see in the market today? Or is there any -- do you anticipate any additional headwinds from some of the volatility we see out there in the market today?\nChris Lapointe: No. Overall, we've seen a really good momentum and continued demand from our whole loan buyers. Overall demand for our loans in the quarter were extremely strong, which is obviously a testament to the quality of our paper and the credit profile of all borrowers. If you look at the quarter, and you'll see this in the queue next week, personal loan, whole loan sales were up both year-over-year and sequentially, where we ended up selling over $1.1 billion to whole loan buyers, which was a record quarter for us. And that's up 46% year-over-year and 15% sequentially. So overall, really good demand on the whole loan side, and we aren't seeing any deterioration there. In terms of the impact of rates on our overall margins, we've been able to successfully navigate and prudently raise our weighted average compound throughout the course of the last few quarters to keep pace with rising rates. And you'll see in our queue next week that the average income that we earned on our personal loans portfolio increased about 60 basis points quarter-over-quarter, and that's in line with what we saw in terms of rising benchmark rates.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Please proceed.\nDan Dolev: So can you -- my first question is, can you give us like sort of some recent consumer trends, maybe something on the members and on demographics? Like how have things changed in terms of your demographic and maybe noticed that cycle went up. So I would love to get an update on that.\nAnthony Noto: Yes. I already touched on the trends for lending. Outside of the trends for lending, I'll hit on technology platform and then also our financial services products. We're really happy with the performance of the financial services segment. We're starting to see great monetization there. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks, there couldn't be a better time to have become a bank that allows us, for the first time, to give a very attractive interest rate on checking to our members at 1.8% APY. It's funny. We're able to give them a better interest rate, it lower our cost. That 1.8% combined with our other sources of funding, lowers our cost of lending between our warehouse facilities and our cost of deposits by 100 basis points. So we're actually giving them 1.8% versus before when they got 30 or 40 or 50 basis points, and we're actually saving 100 basis points on top of it. That's driven great demand for our checking savings account and great direct deposit activity, and the direct deposit activity then leads to higher spending. So as we mentioned in the call, we saw a meaningful increase sequentially in the spending and also year-over-year. I would say our spending is really about taking market share because we're taking it from large banks and their deposits customers which we do look at the members that we have to find these spending is so strong but again we’re up in credit and income so we may not be representative of the broader United States of the economic activity and the pressure may be doing our customer is tracting quite well in this environment. As it relates to investing, you'll see that we were able to grow both checking and savings SoFi money by close to 90% and invest at 90% as well. And we saw net inflows there, which is quite remarkable in this market environment, you'd expect that the opposite. So our differentiation and invest is coming through, and we've done surveys of our members to understand why we are seeing that positive flows from them. And 50% is from people that are trying to catch up in life, they didn't invest when they were younger and they're trying to get more money to work now. So you had the benefit of compounding. And the other 50% are people that are seen it as an opportunity to buy in at lower valuations. So exactly the trend you'd want to see. And for those that aren't familiar with SoFi Invest product, while we're a one-stop shop overall for financial services products, we're also one-stop shop in invest because we have single stocks without commissions, fractional shares which we pioneered. We have our own robo advisory portfolios. And then in addition to that, we have proprietary ETFs and crypto currencies that can be purchased on the platform. So we're seeing really strong demand there. And the team is also doing a great job as it relates to our insurance products, which is really a lead generation product. And you see all those revenue streams coming through in the financial services segment. As it relates to the technology platform, we're seeing strong growth in the number of accounts and activity per account, and that's a broader swath of consumers than just those that are at SoFi. So our acceleration of revenue growth there was quite impressive in the quarter and something that we're happy to see.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.\nDominick Gabriele: Great. I was just curious, could you talk about your -- your expense flexibility to continue to drive adjusted EBITDA margin and dollars even in perhaps a slower macro environment, both within the segments and in nonsegment expense? And then I just have a follow-up.\nAnthony Noto: Yes. So one of the things I want make sure everyone has a historical perspective on this. In March of 2020, the President of United States decided that those with federal student loans didn't have to make payments. We've now been in that environment for 2.5 years. That was one of our largest and most profitable businesses at that time. We've gone on to drive $1 billion of revenue in 2021 and our first full year EBITDA profitability, and we're doing record revenue quarters in 2022 with improving profitability as well as we talked about. So we've been in a mode of optimization on the cost side of the equation, for 2.5 years. This is not a new thing for us. And so we try to manage the business so that we'll drive both growth and durable improving profitability through the cycle, which is what you've seen so far. We have a lot of flexibility. We're investing at a really high rate. If you look at our lending business, it's operating at really strong profitability. It's not as profitable as it would otherwise be with the student loan business, but still quite profitable. Our technology segment revenue, as Chris mentioned, has very high margin. And that's with us absorbing Technisys, which is really a breakeven business at this point given the magnitude of the investment that we're making. And then we're making a really sizable investment in customer acquisition costs in our financial services segment, which has a lot of upside to profitability and some huge milestones in front of us. I'll let Chris talk through the path there.\nChris Lapointe: Yes. So in terms of the overall path to profitability within financial services, you'll see in our 10-Q disclosure next week that we break out directly attributable expenses for each of those segments. As Anthony mentioned, both lending and tech platform are sufficiently profitable. And then on the financial services side, if you were to look at our variable profit, excluding marketing spend, you would see that we've been profitable over the course of the last several quarters, and we expect to be able to cover that marketing spend by the end of this year and be variable profit positive. At that point, it's all about scaling that segment sufficiently in order to cover our fixed costs, which we expect to be able to do by the end of next year, so the end of 2023. So overall, really good progress has been made, and we're well on our path.\nDominick Gabriele: Absolutely. No, I think that the adjusted EBITDA margin probably surprised people to the upside this quarter. It's great to see. And if you just think about -- you've been building a diverse set of revenue streams focused on interest rate cycle proof of your business. Personal loans were up quite nicely. How has the demand changed for your products? Even in the financial segment, I noticed perhaps as the ARPUs up a little bit more, how would you expect this shift in your -- the demand for your products as rates keep rising potentially?\nAnthony Noto: In the personal loan segment, the demand will continue to increase as people that have variable rate debt and also debt that may not be longer term need to refinance. People that have short-term debt and variable rate debt, they need to extend the length of the debt and get into a fixed rate payment that they can consolidate down to and get the debt paid off. On the investing side, we're clearly a market share gainer there to see the growth that we are in our invest members, and net flows is likely unique in the sector. And I think the disruption that's happening more broadly for the fintech-focused brokerage or invest accounts is going to be a benefit to SoFi given our stability and the fact that we have deposit funding with a bank that were EBITDA positive consistently for two years. And so we have a lot of capital on the balance sheet. We could be a really safe home for a lot of people that are worried about their capital getting chopped in some way from dislocations in private companies and public companies in the brokerage space. As it relates to student loans, we, in our guidance and our outlook still assume the moratorium will end until 2023. If it ends sooner, we'd expect the demand for that product to really go through the roof and be back to normalized levels that we saw in 2019 and Q1 of 2020, which, as Chris mentioned, was over $2 billion of origination and that would be a huge tailwind that allows us to step on the gas even more because it's a really profitable business and high incremental profit margins. On the technology services side for Galileo and Technisys, we're in an environment companies really need to drive greater efficiency in their businesses and drive down costs, which means they need to upgrade their technology platforms. And we are a perfect company to partner with them, whether it's on the core banking technology or payment processing and everything that's in between. We truly have an end-to-end solution for them in WC&H and soon to be on the credit side as well as a whole host of other products that the team at Techisys working on. And all have a single-point solutions that we also have Techisys that are quite advantageous from both a functionality standpoint and a cost standpoint. So we're really excited about the amount of demand we're seeing there. And I mentioned it's not just in the consumer area, but also the B2B area, and a lot of the enterprise payment technology doesn't exist today for people that do digital payments. They're largely still doing paper payments, and we can enable a lower cost there as well. So we're excited about that. On the insurance side, it's been relatively steady, but we're gaining market share there as a lead generator. And then as lending as a service, I think the more disruptive the credit markets are, the more people look to lower their cost and lending if they're not a bank to be able to need the higher life of loan losses and charge-offs they may be experiencing.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great, and congratulations on all of the success milestones in the bank. Related to that, and it's probably a better question this quarter than when I asked it last quarter, you mentioned the 80% of your deposit flows coming from direct deposit customers. Could you talk a little bit about what the increase in direct deposit customers could do for your various businesses, including the spending and SoFi Money and the persistence of other products? .\nAnthony Noto: Yes. One of the things that we've seen going back to our overall strategy of using our different products to build our relationship with members. And from that relationship, they'll trust their reliability. So when they want to use a second product, they choose us, and we get great financial and operating leverage in addition to more data to better serve them to help them get their money right. What we've seen in the SoFi Money product, the checking and savings account product, as we've raised the APY, the quality of the customer, their FICO score, their credit profile has also increased. -- in fact, sets us up really well for future opportunities to serve them on the lending side. I would say the members that we're acquiring through SoFi Money, they need less borrowing than the members we've had in the past, but they have higher -- they have higher credit profiles, which is unveiled well for the future cross-buying over business. They also have more money to invest, which would help our invest business in addition to other areas that we see as opportunities with them. So the aggregation of more money members with higher credit profiles and more direct deposits is really positive. Once we have the direct deposit, we know what types of bills they have. We know if they have -- they're sitting on paths that they're not investing. We know if they're overextended with credit card payments or student loan payments or mortgage payments. So it's a treasure to of information that helps us serve them much better. The second thing I'd say is that as we've added those direct to pilot customers, we've seen really strong spending trends, and we have a 1% interchange on our debit card today, and so that business kind of fits as well as the benefit of the data. And then activation\nMoshe Orenbuch: And as a follow-up -- I'm sorry, go ahead.\nAnthony Noto: I was going to say on activation rate side of the equation, we're industry benchmarks for percent of funded accounts that are converting to direct deposits.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Just as a follow-up, you had noted that you added a number of new B2B customers and very large TAM. Could you talk about what that process is, how long does it take and how large that could be as a revenue stream for your tech platform over the next year or two.\nAnthony Noto: Yes. I'd say the sales cycle differs by the stage of company. Segment does matter, but stage of company matters more. So earlier-stage companies, the sales cycle is much shorter. More mature companies, the sales cycle is much larger. The benefit of existing companies with installed bases or existing payment needs is that you don't have to build their business over time. It's they're all right. It seems to be transitioned either from physical payments to digital and you grow quite rapidly or you can work off of an old platform to a new platform. So in many ways, getting more existing partners as opposed to early-stage companies could help accelerate growth there. On the financial services side, the non-B2B side, we're in conversation with the large banks in the United States and outside the United States. But previously, we were not in conversations with before we own Technisys. So the combination of Technisys and Galileo is a pretty powerful combination that gives payment processing and core end-to-end solution, which is a great opportunity for an existing large financial institution to move to a modern stack and benefit from all the innovation that we're driving in addition to the lower costs. On the B2B side, it's just an area that we hadn't invested in meaningfully in the past. We have many B2B customers, but there is a product set that they need for us to capture more of the opportunity that comes to us. And that's the big difference between where we are today and than in the past. The demand was there. We just didn't have the product set built out, which the team has invested in this year. So we're excited about that as well.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of John Hecht with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nJohn Hecht: Guys, reiterate all the congratulations. First one, and you touched on some of this, but you used to kind of onboard new customers that I think predominantly through student loans. Obviously, that calculus has changed. So maybe talk about what are the new -- kind of what's the mix shift in terms of onboarding and cross-selling and revenue ramp given the changing atmosphere.\nChris Lapointe: Yes. So overall, we've seen a pretty significant shift over the course of the last few years in terms of the number of lending products to financial services products. But right now, the number of financial services products as a ratio of lending products is 4.5:1. And we're seeing a lot of top of funnel, low customer acquisition costs members coming through the funnel, through financial services. And as Anthony mentioned in his prepared remarks, we saw a 24% increase in overall cross buy rates, which is predominantly coming from those financial services products, which is helping us get efficient -- much more efficient on overall marketing spend. And you'll see in the results that we were more efficient in terms of both the cost to acquire a new member as well as marketing spend as a percentage of revenue quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.\nJohn Hecht: And then moving on to the technology platform. You got a lot going on there between geographical expansion and I think some vertical integration, I mean and then B2B, I think, too. How do we think about composition revenues and then the source of revenues? I mean is it all a take-rate type of thing? Or are there other alternative sources of revenues as you guys expand and diversify that?\nChris Lapointe: Yes. So for -- right now, within the Tech platform, our Galileo business makes money through transactions every time someone swipes a card or there's an API call, we collect pennies on the dollar. In terms of Technisys, that's more of a recurring revenue stream SaaS-type model, and we expect to continue to grow into that business and diversify the overall revenue streams.\nAnthony Noto: And just one clarification, Galileo business. we have a fixed rate on those transactions. And on the API calls, it's not a percentage of the interchange or a percentage of the transaction size. So if the basket size gets smaller, it doesn't change what we get paid. We get paid by transaction or by API call.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jeff Adelson with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nJeff Adelson: So you had a pretty good quarter. You'd be by revenues on about $15 million to $25 million and $5 million to $15 million on the EBITDA relative to the old 2Q guide. And I'm just kind of curious, it looks like you only took up the full year '22 guide by roughly $3 million to $4 million. Just wondering if there's something going on in the back half of the year that we should be looking for maybe. Or are you building maybe in a degree of conservatism in your outlook here?\nChris Lapointe: Yes. What I would say is in terms of the overall H2 guide, our goal is always to provide the research and investor community with our best outlook on the business at any given point in time. Given where we are in the year, we remain very comfortable with the trajectory of our business and our guide, particularly in light of the uncertainty related to the macro environment that we're experiencing right now. So overall, still very optimistic in the forward outlook, but if this is our best view at this point. .\nJeff Adelson: And then just maybe switching to the gain on sale. Since we're not getting in the queue until next week, I think you said. Could you maybe break out how much of a hedge gain you saw this quarter? I think last quarter, you had about $160 million -- just wondering how much of the $140 million this quarter came from that. And then as a part of that, do you think you could also break out the hedge versus on hedge gain on sale margins you're seeing by product this quarter?\nChris Lapointe: Absolutely. So in terms of overall hedge gains for the quarter, we ended up generating $75 million in the quarter. In terms of the actual gain on sale margins, I'll give you both unhedged and with hedged gains. For personal loans, it was 3.4% excluding the hedge and 4.5%, including hedge gains. Our student loan business was 99.8% excluding the hedge and north of 4% including the hedge. And then our home loans business was at an execution of about 95% but north of 1.5% when including the hedge. What I would say in terms of overall sustainability and durability of these margins, we've been able to sustain these gain on sale margins inclusive of hedge gains in this 104% level for our personal loans and SLR business and 111% to 102 in home loans. -- and that's primarily a result of the proven hedging strategy that we have but also a function of being able to keep pace with rate increases and pass those through to our weighted average coupon. Like I said earlier, you'll see in the queue that the average interest earned on our overall PL portfolio increased 60 basis points quarter-over-quarter, and that's in line with the increase that we observed with comparable benchmark rates. Now that's not a perfect indication of how much we increased our weighted average coupon on in-period originations, but it does give you a sense for our success in being able to raise back while continuing to drive growth in originations.\nJeff Adelson: And then you've done a pretty good job so far raising deposits with the new bank and growing your loans accordingly. Just wondering, as we think about this kind of doubling of your whole period and a pretty good strength in the personal loan originations. Is it unreasonable to assume that with the doubling of the loan hold period at a minimum, you could probably double your loan balances by early next year with one year under your belt. You were at $6 billion or $7 billion when you got the bank. I mean is it unreasonable to assume that could hit $12 billion or $14 billion over time or by next year?\nChris Lapointe: Yes. I don't think we're going to provide guidance on the actual bank balance sheet or the amount that we're going to grow loans. But what I would say is over the course of Q2, we ended up growing overall deposits by over $100 million per week. And the second thing I would say is we have sufficient equity capital both at the bank and the bank holding company to fulfill our overall origination plan. We do want to maximize the value of the bank and enforce us, so it will depend on the environment, and all the rest of our businesses were objective would be to grow at a healthy clip.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Eugene Simuni with MoffatNathanson. Please proceed.\nEugene Simuni: I wanted to come back to personal loans for a minute. Obviously, very, very strong growth trajectory here talked a bunch about the strong demand overall given interest rate environment. But can you talk a little bit about your success in gaining market share in this market. It's a very competitive market. Obviously, a lot of providers, a lot of innovative providers. What's the edge? And how do you maintain that market share gain momentum going forward?\nAnthony Noto: Yes. We have a very small market share in personal loans, but we are gaining share. We think about the differentiators for all of our products on four dimensions, five really, but four unique ones: fast, selection, content, convenience. And then the fifth one is having our products work better together, i.e., you get a lower interest rate if you also do direct deposit as an example. So fast. We want to be the fastest place to apply for a loan, the fastest place to be approved for a loan, and the fastest place to get funded for a loan. And on personal loans, we try to get it down to two days. It used to be eight or nine days. Why is that the case? People, they don't want to wait for a decision. They want to know they have a solution to wherever their problem is. And so we want to do that very quickly, and we work every day to do so. And I think we're as competitive as anyone. I'd be shocked if anyone was faster than us. There's also a rescission period that we have to consider. But we can get it down to two or three days, and we do that quite often. Second is I think about selection. Selection is not just the term and the type of rate. It's also other elements of that loan, one of which is pricing. And because we are a bank and our cost of funding is meaningfully lower now, we could be much more aggressive on pricing. And we're pretty, I would say, surgical as it relates to the relation between the credit profile and the pricing profile we developed back in 2018, six different grids of about 36 cells that are constantly used to figure out where there's an opportunity in pricing relative to credit. And so that's a sophisticated process that's done each week, and it's been built on four years of data. The second element of that is marketing and understanding which channels provide the best borrowers. And it's not just the best borrower in terms of demand, but it's about their variable profit. And so we're trying to optimize for 40% to 50% of variable profit margin on a per loan basis, and we want to maximize dollars there. We know which channels perform the best on uneconomic basis, and so our marketing can be a lot more efficient. And it's generally hard to find people that are good credit profiles because they're not always necessarily looking for money, and you're trying to find a great solution for them. So those are a couple of the elements that we use on a singular basis of the products to differentiate. We also increasingly are doing things, like I mentioned, to make our products work better when you use them together. So giving you an advantage if you're also a direct deposit customer and the rate that we offer you. We've done historically auto payments as a discount to the rate, but direct deposit is now another lever that we can use from a differentiated standpoint that others cannot use or don't have, and you'll see us continue to do better together types of things to get there.\nEugene Simuni: And then a quick follow-up. Just on the macro environment, you mentioned that you're looking at a broad range of kind of early warning indicators. Obviously, you're looking at a lot of data across your 4 million user base. Are you seeing any indications of any deterioration in kind of a macro environment? And maybe you can speak a little bit -- in a little bit more detail what macro scenario are you assuming for your second half guide?\nAnthony Noto: Yes. Because we're focused on a specific segment of the population and a specific credit profile of the population. We're going to look at different metrics that necessarily tie to GDP growth or inflation, et cetera. I don't want to get into all the details of all the different metrics. The team -- the risk team utilizes that framework. They provide us with early warning levels. We use red, green and yellow. They change quite frequently. We look at them every month. There have been some months in the past that were more red than months that we've currently had. And so there's not going to be something you can look at and say, \"This means X, Y or Z for SoFi. Our team is looking at that broad range of indicators and using that to create each one of the metrics. And ultimately, when we get to a certain level of things being read, we lend less, which is what we get back in March of 2020. And once we lend less, we don't turn it back on until they turn back to yellow or green. So it's something we monitor all the time. If you look at the second quarter, April was more negative than May or June. May and June were more positive in April. So it's an ever-changing environment. I don't want to give you any indication of what it's going to be tomorrow or what it was yesterday. Our guidance reflects what it's been and where we think it's going to be. And then the only other thing I'd point to is the actual performance of our loan, which Chris talked about.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today's Q&A session. I will now hand the call over to Anthony Noto for closing remarks. .\nAnthony Noto: Thank you, and thank you for everyone for your thoughts today and spending time on our call. I want to end with a couple of points. I'm incredibly humbled by the privilege to lead SoFi and work with so many passionate people that have built our company day by day and in branch. Rolling time and time again to each challenge we've faced all in service and changing the lives for so many people. I would have never predicted that we could deliver superior growth with record revenue quarter after quarter in 2021 and now again in 2022, while our student loan refinancing business operates at 25% to 50% of normalized levels for the last 2.5 years, and we still delivered 8 quarters of positive EBITDA. We went public, we've raised over $3.5 billion, and we have teamed a very hard to accomplish goal in becoming a national bank. But that is exactly what we've done here today and last quarter and the quarter before that. Our members need our help like never before and our ability to help them is unmatched by any company that I am aware of. The responsibility that comes with that rare position is great, but the personal and professional satisfaction when we deliver is even greater. I am in awe of the impact we have on our members. While no one day has a dramatic impact relative to others, the cumulative impact of the last 1,620 days is dramatic, which is why we have to remain focused like never before on ensuring that we continue to move with urgency, with purpose, with a winning mindset and a founder's mentality to make progress every minute of every hour of every day so that the aggregate impact remains unmatched. Until next quarter, we thank you for your interest in SoFi. Thank you very much.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

            "content": "Thanks, Anthony. Overall, we had a great quarter with strong growth trends across the entire business. We exceeded our financial guidance while achieving record revenue in our eighth consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA despite operating in a rapidly evolving macro backdrop. I'm going to walk you through some key financial highlights for the quarter and then share some color on our financial outlook. Unless otherwise stated, I'll be referring to adjusted results for the second quarter of 2022 versus second quarter of 2021. Our GAAP consolidated income statement and all reconciliations can be found in today's earnings release and the subsequent 10-Q filing, which will be available next week. For the quarter, growth accelerated and we delivered record adjusted net revenue of $356 million, up 50% year-over-year and 11% sequentially from the prior quarter's record of $322 million. Q2 revenue was $16 million above the high end of our guidance of $330 million to $340 million. Adjusted EBITDA and margins also doubled quarter-over-quarter as we delivered $20 million at a 6% margin coming in $5 million above the high end of our guidance of $5 million to $15 million. Now on to the segment level performance, where we saw strong growth and record revenue across all three segments. In lending, second quarter adjusted net revenue accelerated and grew 46% year-over-year to $251 million. Year-over-year growth in lending was driven by a doubling of our net interest income and 18% growth in noninterest income. Growth in net interest income was driven by an increase in asset yields as well as average loan balances, while growth in noninterest income was a result of an increase in originations and hedge gains. Q2 originations grew 9% year-over-year to $3.2 billion and we're driven by record volumes in our personal loans business, which grew 91% year-over-year to $2.5 billion. However, both student loan and home loan originations were down by more than 50% year-over-year as we continue to face headwinds from the moratorium on federal student loan payments and rising rates as well as fulfillment issues continue to impact our home loans business. We achieved this top line growth while maintaining our stringent credit standards and disciplined focus on quality. Our personal loans borrowers' weighted average income is $160,000 with a weighted average FICO score of 748. Our student loan borrowers weighted average income is $170,000 with a weighted average FICO of 773. This focus on quality has led to strong credit performance. Our on-balance sheet delinquency rates and charge-off rates remain extremely healthy and are still approximately 50% below pre-COVID levels. Our on-balance sheet 90-day personal loan delinquency rate was 21 basis points in the quarter, while our annualized personal loan charge-off rate was 1.25%. Our on-balance sheet 90-day student loan delinquency rate was 4 basis points in the quarter, while our annualized student loan charge-off rate was just 28 basis points. The lending business delivered $142 million of contribution profit at a 57% margin, up from $89 million a year ago and a 52% margin. This improvement was driven by a mix shift to higher-margin personal loans revenue as well as ops efficiencies and fixed cost leverage across the entire segment. Shifting to our tech platform, where we delivered net revenue of $84 million in the quarter, up 85% year-over-year, including our first full quarter impact from Technisys. If you were to exclude Technisys, Organic growth was 39% year-over-year, a meaningful increase from the 19% year-over-year growth achieved in the first quarter of the year. This acceleration was a result of sequential growth in transactions per active account and, to a lesser extent, by having a relatively easy comparison quarter as Q1 2022 annual growth was dampened as a result of stimulus benefits in Q1 2021. Overall, annual revenue growth was driven by 48% year-over-year Galileo account growth to $117 million in total. We also signed 12 new clients, 8 of which are in the B2B space, further diversifying our partner base. The segment delivered a contribution profit of $22 million, representing a 26% margin and 33% if you were to exclude Techisys. Moving on to financial services, where net revenue of $30 million increased 78% year-over-year with new all-time high revenue for SoFi Money and continued strong contributions from SoFi Credit Card, SoFi Invest and Lending as a Service. We were able to achieve this growth despite having a tough comparison quarter. As a reminder, Q2 2021 financial services revenue included $4.4 million of episodic revenues from advisory and IPO underwriting services. Excluding that $4.4 million in Q2 '21, our year-over-year growth would have been 140%. We reached 5.4 million financial services products in the quarter, which is up 100% year-over-year and at 639,000 new products. It was our second highest quarter ever of new product adds in the segment. We hit 1.8 million products in SoFi Money, $2 million in SoFi Invest and $1.3 million in Relay. Contribution losses were $54 million for the quarter, which increased year-over-year, predominantly as a result of building our CECL reserves for the SoFi Credit Card business, which is expected as we continue to grow in scale. In addition, we saw a year-over-year reduction in higher margin and digital assets revenue as well as episodic IPO and advisory revenue. Switching to our balance sheet, where we remain very well capitalized with ample cash and excess liquidity. The recent opening of SoFi Bank only reinforces the strength of our balance sheet and provides us with more flexibility and the ability to achieve a lower cost of capital relative to alternative sources of funding. In Q2, assets grew by approximately $400 million quarter-over-quarter as a result of adding approximately $1 billion of loans to the balance sheet given the strong growth we continue to see in personal loan originations. Offsetting the growth in loans, we had a $700 million decrease in cash as a result of funding the bank in Q1. The equity used to capitalize the bank was part of cash and cash equivalents shortly after funding the bank at the end of Q1. It has since been deployed and is generating a strong return by funding originations in the bank. On the liability side of the balance sheet, due to our strong deposit growth, we exited the quarter with only $1.6 billion drawn on our warehouse facilities, about 20% of our overall $7 billion worth of capacity, down from $2.7 billion in the first quarter of the year. Overall, we remain very well capitalized with ample cash and excess liquidity. Finishing up with guidance. Throughout the last 12 months, we have demonstrated the benefit of having a diversified set of revenue streams and a keen focus on continuing to underwrite high-quality credit. We expect those benefits to persist going forward even in light of the existing macro backdrop. Our outlook also assumes the federal student loan payment moratorium will last until January 2023, which would result in a late Q4 2022 benefit based on the trend experienced in 2021. In the second half of the year, we expect to deliver $830 million to $835 million of adjusted net revenue and $75 million to $80 million of adjusted EBITDA with a more significant portion of the revenue and EBITDA getting generated in Q4. This guidance implies full year 2022 revenues of $1.508 billion to $1.513 billion, above our prior guidance of $1.505 billion to $1.510 billion. Our second half guidance implies full year 2022 EBITDA of $104 million to $109 million, above our prior guidance of $100 million to $105 million. Overall, we couldn't be more proud of our Q2 results and continued progress. Having delivered over $1.4 billion of annualized revenue in our eighth consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA, we continue to make great progress against our long-term growth objectives in the quarter, and we remain very well capitalized to continue pursuing our ultimate goal of making SoFi a top financial institution. With that, let's begin the Q&A. Yes. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the overall demographic and credit profile of our personal loans remains extremely strong. Like I had mentioned, the weighted average income of our borrower is 160,000 with an average FICO score of 748, and we're seeing really good trends in terms of overall delinquency. For our personal loans business, 90-day delinquencies were at 21 basis points in the quarter, and that's roughly in line with where we were a year ago, which was at 18 basis points. And then in terms of overall charge-off rates, our personal loans business, was at 1.25% annualized, again, which is roughly in line with where we were a year ago at 1.2%, and both of those metrics are well below where we were prior to COVID. No. Overall, we've seen a really good momentum and continued demand from our whole loan buyers. Overall demand for our loans in the quarter were extremely strong, which is obviously a testament to the quality of our paper and the credit profile of all borrowers. If you look at the quarter, and you'll see this in the queue next week, personal loan, whole loan sales were up both year-over-year and sequentially, where we ended up selling over $1.1 billion to whole loan buyers, which was a record quarter for us. And that's up 46% year-over-year and 15% sequentially. So overall, really good demand on the whole loan side, and we aren't seeing any deterioration there. In terms of the impact of rates on our overall margins, we've been able to successfully navigate and prudently raise our weighted average compound throughout the course of the last few quarters to keep pace with rising rates. And you'll see in our queue next week that the average income that we earned on our personal loans portfolio increased about 60 basis points quarter-over-quarter, and that's in line with what we saw in terms of rising benchmark rates. Yes. So in terms of the overall path to profitability within financial services, you'll see in our 10-Q disclosure next week that we break out directly attributable expenses for each of those segments. As Anthony mentioned, both lending and tech platform are sufficiently profitable. And then on the financial services side, if you were to look at our variable profit, excluding marketing spend, you would see that we've been profitable over the course of the last several quarters, and we expect to be able to cover that marketing spend by the end of this year and be variable profit positive. At that point, it's all about scaling that segment sufficiently in order to cover our fixed costs, which we expect to be able to do by the end of next year, so the end of 2023. So overall, really good progress has been made, and we're well on our path. Yes. So overall, we've seen a pretty significant shift over the course of the last few years in terms of the number of lending products to financial services products. But right now, the number of financial services products as a ratio of lending products is 4.5:1. And we're seeing a lot of top of funnel, low customer acquisition costs members coming through the funnel, through financial services. And as Anthony mentioned in his prepared remarks, we saw a 24% increase in overall cross buy rates, which is predominantly coming from those financial services products, which is helping us get efficient -- much more efficient on overall marketing spend. And you'll see in the results that we were more efficient in terms of both the cost to acquire a new member as well as marketing spend as a percentage of revenue quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Yes. So for -- right now, within the Tech platform, our Galileo business makes money through transactions every time someone swipes a card or there's an API call, we collect pennies on the dollar. In terms of Technisys, that's more of a recurring revenue stream SaaS-type model, and we expect to continue to grow into that business and diversify the overall revenue streams. Yes. What I would say is in terms of the overall H2 guide, our goal is always to provide the research and investor community with our best outlook on the business at any given point in time. Given where we are in the year, we remain very comfortable with the trajectory of our business and our guide, particularly in light of the uncertainty related to the macro environment that we're experiencing right now. So overall, still very optimistic in the forward outlook, but if this is our best view at this point. . Absolutely. So in terms of overall hedge gains for the quarter, we ended up generating $75 million in the quarter. In terms of the actual gain on sale margins, I'll give you both unhedged and with hedged gains. For personal loans, it was 3.4% excluding the hedge and 4.5%, including hedge gains. Our student loan business was 99.8% excluding the hedge and north of 4% including the hedge. And then our home loans business was at an execution of about 95% but north of 1.5% when including the hedge. What I would say in terms of overall sustainability and durability of these margins, we've been able to sustain these gain on sale margins inclusive of hedge gains in this 104% level for our personal loans and SLR business and 111% to 102 in home loans. -- and that's primarily a result of the proven hedging strategy that we have but also a function of being able to keep pace with rate increases and pass those through to our weighted average coupon. Like I said earlier, you'll see in the queue that the average interest earned on our overall PL portfolio increased 60 basis points quarter-over-quarter, and that's in line with the increase that we observed with comparable benchmark rates. Now that's not a perfect indication of how much we increased our weighted average coupon on in-period originations, but it does give you a sense for our success in being able to raise back while continuing to drive growth in originations. Yes. I don't think we're going to provide guidance on the actual bank balance sheet or the amount that we're going to grow loans. But what I would say is over the course of Q2, we ended up growing overall deposits by over $100 million per week. And the second thing I would say is we have sufficient equity capital both at the bank and the bank holding company to fulfill our overall origination plan. We do want to maximize the value of the bank and enforce us, so it will depend on the environment, and all the rest of our businesses were objective would be to grow at a healthy clip."

            "name": "Anthony Noto",
            "content": "Thank you, Mara. And good afternoon, everyone. Our second quarter results demonstrate the continued resilience of both our team and business and our ability to deliver another quarter of record revenue, strong financial and operating results and a positive start to the third quarter. A few key achievements from the second quarter include another quarter of record adjusted net revenue with 50% year-over-year growth. our eighth consecutive quarter or two full years of positive adjusted EBITDA, which more than doubled quarter-over-quarter, demonstrating the acceleration we anticipated throughout the year; continued strong growth in members, products and cross by volume; our first full quarter of contribution from SoFi Bank, which allowed us to surpass $2.7 billion in deposits, up 135% quarter-over-quarter, and we're still in the early days; and importantly, our first quarter of positive GAAP net income for SoFi Bank at $25 million. The strength of our results achieved in the face of continued volatility in financial markets, along with the ever-changing political, fiscal and economic landscape, once again underscores how our full suite of differentiated products and services provides the financial foundation for a uniquely diversified business that is able to endure through market cycles. We are able to allocate resources toward the best growth opportunities across our diverse offerings, which has enabled us to exceed our performance targets despite continued headwinds in certain businesses. While so much in the world continues to shift around us, at SoFi, it's been a new normal for us for the last four years. So to us, it's business as usual. We've built our products and services to provide durable, high levels of growth with a specific economic profile, and that is what we are delivering. Now I'll run through the highlights of the financial results for the quarter. Total adjusted net revenue grew 50% year-over-year to a record $356 million, up 11% from the prior record set in Q1 2022. Strength in all three of our diverse business segments contributed to these results. Lending adjusted net revenue grew 46% year-over-year to $251 million led by continued outperformance in our personal loans business, which saw record origination levels of nearly $2.5 billion as well as strong sales execution. Financial services net revenue grew 78% year-over-year to $30 million, up nearly 30% for $24 million in Q1 with our largest contributors being record SoFi checking and savings revenue, along with continued strength in SoFi Credit Card, SoFi Invest and Lending as a Service. Technology platform net revenue grew 85% year-over-year to nearly $84 million with record Galileo revenues in our first full quarter of contribution from TechniSys. Importantly, Galileo revenue growth accelerated to 39% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA of just over $20 million increased 81% year-over-year and 134% sequentially. Members and products each saw accelerating quarter-over-quarter growth and their second highest quarter ever of new adds, and we continue to see strong cross-buy trends. The 450,000 new members in Q2 '22 represented our second highest quarter of new adds bring total members to $4.3 million, up 69% year-over-year. Our industry-leading APY was a strong driver of high-quality SoFi Money member growth, and increasing direct deposit conversions give us confidence that our growing member base is both durable and active on the platform. We also added 72,000 new products in Q2. This represents our second highest quarter of new product adds, ending with nearly 6.6 million total products, up 79% year-over-year. Of these new adds, financial services products of $5.4 million at quarter end doubled year-over-year, while lending products of more than 1.2 million were up 22%. The significant scale of our top-of-the-funnel products is driving greater and more efficient member growth and cross buy. Total cross bought products in the quarter increased 24% year-over-year, demonstrating continued success of our financial services productivity loop strategy. Now I'd like to spend some time touching on the segment level results. These highlight the benefits of our uniquely diversified model, the robust growth across all three business segments, increased efficiency driving improved profitability and our strong balance sheet with multiple funding sources, all of this with strong and stable credit metrics. First is lending, where we originated a record of nearly $2.5 billion of personal loans in Q2, up 22% from $2 billion last quarter and nearly double $1.3 billion in Q2 2021. This product continues to deliver even while we maintain our strict credit standards and attract borrowers with high incomes and FICO scores. Our personal loan performance more than offset the continued lack of demand and student loan financing, which is down to 25% of volume prior to the moratorium on federal student loan payments; and the performance of home loans, which faced macro headwinds from rising rates while we continue the process of transitioning to new fulfillment partners. We're also differentiated in lending by the strength of our balance sheet and the diversification of our funding sources, 2 points which are bolstered by having SoFi Bank. The bank charter could not have come at a better time and the economic benefits are already starting to positively impact our operating and financial results. First, the ability to offer an industry-leading APY and value prop has led to strong growth in SoFi Money members, high-quality deposits and great levels of engagement. Money members have increased nearly 92% year-over-year to 1.8 million accounts and growth in balances has accelerated significantly. We exited the quarter with $2.7 billion in deposits, and spend trends have improved significantly. To put this in perspective, it took three years to accumulate our first $1 billion of deposits and just three months to grow another $1.6 billion. In addition, approximately 80% of our deposits are from direct deposit members, demonstrating the quality and stickiness of these deposits. Second, as a result of this growth in high-quality deposits, we've been able to benefit from a lower cost of funding for loans while being able to pass on higher rates in our loans. In Q2 alone, the difference in our deposit cost of funding and warehouse cost of funding was approximately 100 basis points, and that delta will continue to grow in a rising rate environment. And third, deposit funding increases flexibility to capture more NIM and optimize returns, a critical advantage in light of notable macro uncertainty. We don't have to access sales channels in the face of suboptimal conditions, such as those we've witnessed more broadly in the asset-backed security market over the last few quarters. The power and the financial benefit of the bank is demonstrated clearly by our $25 million of positive GAAP net income in Q2 at a 13% margin. We also have $5.5 billion of book equity on our balance sheet, and approximately $7 billion in warehouse facilities that we can access to fund loans, over half of which is committed capital. Now on to Financial services, where we've continued to achieve strong member and product growth by iterating on our products to ensure they are differentiated by four key factors: fast, selection, content and convenience and continue to invest to make them work better when used together. We finished Q2 with 5.4 million financial services products. That's up 100% year-over-year and 4.5x total lending products of $1.2 million. The increased scale in financial services products creates even more scale in cross-buying and company-wide marketing efficiencies. Total sales and marketing spend as a percentage of adjusted net revenue declined for the second consecutive quarter even as we scale our top-of-funnel products, which often do not contribute stand-alone to revenue for 12 to 18 months. This is due to the increasing monetization and attractiveness of these products or increased brand awareness and network effects. Our investment in our products is paying off as members embrace their product launches in financial services introduced in the first quarter. SoFi checking and savings provides an unmatched value prop through an industry-leading APY of up to 1.8% as of Monday, July 25, a host of free features and a unique rewards program. This strategy is driving strong growth in direct deposit accounts, which in turn is driving strong growth in spend, which grew 29% quarter-over-quarter. Within SoFi invest, we launched extended hours trading and saw our first full quarter of margin investing. We remain on track to launch options by year-end as well as introduce new proprietary ETFs to the platform. We've increasingly utilized our relay platform to acquire, educate and advise our members on their holistic financial picture and their next best move. We added the Auto Tracker product to the existing real estate property tracker and credit score monitoring to add even more insights to members' financial health and support them as they navigate the economic landscape. This platform has become a notable source of cross-buying, further bolstering the financial services productivity loop strategy. Transitioning to our technology platform, a critical element of our strategy. Not only is this segment a strong revenue and cash flow driver. But its two businesses, Galileo and Technisys, also contribute to two main tenets of the SoFi strategy. Faster innovation at lower cost return diversified revenue streams. In the second quarter, both segment revenue grew of 85% year-over-year include the first full quarter of contribution from Technisys. On an organic basis, Galileo revenue grew 39% year-over-year, and Galileo enabled accounts grew 48% year-over-year, and this is with a 26% margin or 33% as exclude Technisys. Among Galileo's evolving products, Galileo has added new B2B capabilities as well as a secured credit card offering. I'd like to focus on the B2B segment for a moment as it is enormous, and we're already making great strides. 30% of the Galileo client pipeline is now comprised of B2B deals up dramatically from 10% to 15% at this time last year as we quickly leverage these new capabilities to penetrate more opportunities. And considering the market opportunity in this segment, we estimate the B2B opportunity at $29 trillion with 50% of payments still via paper check. Just like in consumer banking, we have the capability and the opportunity to convert these to digital payments and virtual cards. This is a prime example of how we have driven technological innovation at Galileo to address more market segments and further diversify sources of growth. And Techisys continues to achieve milestones with its first core banking deal in Mexico and the launch of a new banking client in Brazil in the second quarter. In addition to new products and an increasingly diverse client list, Techisysand Galileo have yet another major source of growth, cross-selling among their complementary client bases, product sets and geographic footprints, bringing Techisysto the U.S. through Galileo and Galileo to LatAm through Technisys, suffice to say that teams are running after these opportunities, and we cannot be more excited. I'll finish here by saying that we have been in an all-out sprint over the last four years to build out our digital product suite to meet our members' needs for every major financial decision in their lives and over the days in between. The benefits of our strategy to build a uniquely diversified business, combined with a national bank license, not only positions SoFi to be the winner takes most in the sector transition of financial services digital but also provide greater durability through our market cycle. I'm excited about where we are today and even more excited about where we can go from here. With that, let me turn it over to Chris for a review of the financials for the quarter. It's Anthony. In volatile markets like we're in today with discontinuing interest rates and other issues around the macroeconomic environment, individuals are looking for ways to lower their cost of debt. We're looking for ways to better save and better spend. And so the demand in this environment is going to be quite strong. It's very prudent that we focus on our core target and make sure we stick to our disciplined credit profile. We underwrite the free cash flow that we're using our credit lines today underwriting to a FICO score or anything else. And we're in an environment where some of the best credit profile individuals are out there looking to refinance their debt from higher variable cost debt into fixed rate debt and also fixed maturities so they can lower their cost of borrowing and also manage their budgets. And that's creating a lot of demand, and our team is doing a great job of providing a range of products to meet their demand. We're sticking to our credit profile that we've had for the last four years. That's proven out quite well. We managed to a have a loan loss of about 8%. And as long as we're able to do that, we continue to underwrite. Now the environment does change, and we have leading indicators that we're tracking and a profile that our risk team manages that gives us early warning signals. And as those change, we change how much we're willing to underwrite. I'll give you an example. If you go back to March of 2020, we saw a dislocation in some of the commercial paper markets and the repo markets. We're quite worried about the liquidity in the marketplace, and we pulled back meaningfully on how much we're willing to lend. And we did that based on our overall profile of the macroeconomic lead indicators. And we didn't turn back on the amount we were lending until those turn green again. So it's something we've done in the past, something that's proven to be quite prudent. And we feel like we have the right team and our history in place, and I'll let Chris talk about the actual performance of the loans and what we're seeing. Yes. I already touched on the trends for lending. Outside of the trends for lending, I'll hit on technology platform and then also our financial services products. We're really happy with the performance of the financial services segment. We're starting to see great monetization there. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks, there couldn't be a better time to have become a bank that allows us, for the first time, to give a very attractive interest rate on checking to our members at 1.8% APY. It's funny. We're able to give them a better interest rate, it lower our cost. That 1.8% combined with our other sources of funding, lowers our cost of lending between our warehouse facilities and our cost of deposits by 100 basis points. So we're actually giving them 1.8% versus before when they got 30 or 40 or 50 basis points, and we're actually saving 100 basis points on top of it. That's driven great demand for our checking savings account and great direct deposit activity, and the direct deposit activity then leads to higher spending. So as we mentioned in the call, we saw a meaningful increase sequentially in the spending and also year-over-year. I would say our spending is really about taking market share because we're taking it from large banks and their deposits customers which we do look at the members that we have to find these spending is so strong but again we're up in credit and income so we may not be representative of the broader United States of the economic activity and the pressure may be doing our customer is tracting quite well in this environment. As it relates to investing, you'll see that we were able to grow both checking and savings SoFi money by close to 90% and invest at 90% as well. And we saw net inflows there, which is quite remarkable in this market environment, you'd expect that the opposite. So our differentiation and invest is coming through, and we've done surveys of our members to understand why we are seeing that positive flows from them. And 50% is from people that are trying to catch up in life, they didn't invest when they were younger and they're trying to get more money to work now. So you had the benefit of compounding. And the other 50% are people that are seen it as an opportunity to buy in at lower valuations. So exactly the trend you'd want to see. And for those that aren't familiar with SoFi Invest product, while we're a one-stop shop overall for financial services products, we're also one-stop shop in invest because we have single stocks without commissions, fractional shares which we pioneered. We have our own robo advisory portfolios. And then in addition to that, we have proprietary ETFs and crypto currencies that can be purchased on the platform. So we're seeing really strong demand there. And the team is also doing a great job as it relates to our insurance products, which is really a lead generation product. And you see all those revenue streams coming through in the financial services segment. As it relates to the technology platform, we're seeing strong growth in the number of accounts and activity per account, and that's a broader swath of consumers than just those that are at SoFi. So our acceleration of revenue growth there was quite impressive in the quarter and something that we're happy to see. Yes. So one of the things I want make sure everyone has a historical perspective on this. In March of 2020, the President of United States decided that those with federal student loans didn't have to make payments. We've now been in that environment for 2.5 years. That was one of our largest and most profitable businesses at that time. We've gone on to drive $1 billion of revenue in 2021 and our first full year EBITDA profitability, and we're doing record revenue quarters in 2022 with improving profitability as well as we talked about. So we've been in a mode of optimization on the cost side of the equation, for 2.5 years. This is not a new thing for us. And so we try to manage the business so that we'll drive both growth and durable improving profitability through the cycle, which is what you've seen so far. We have a lot of flexibility. We're investing at a really high rate. If you look at our lending business, it's operating at really strong profitability. It's not as profitable as it would otherwise be with the student loan business, but still quite profitable. Our technology segment revenue, as Chris mentioned, has very high margin. And that's with us absorbing Technisys, which is really a breakeven business at this point given the magnitude of the investment that we're making. And then we're making a really sizable investment in customer acquisition costs in our financial services segment, which has a lot of upside to profitability and some huge milestones in front of us. I'll let Chris talk through the path there. In the personal loan segment, the demand will continue to increase as people that have variable rate debt and also debt that may not be longer term need to refinance. People that have short-term debt and variable rate debt, they need to extend the length of the debt and get into a fixed rate payment that they can consolidate down to and get the debt paid off. On the investing side, we're clearly a market share gainer there to see the growth that we are in our invest members, and net flows is likely unique in the sector. And I think the disruption that's happening more broadly for the fintech-focused brokerage or invest accounts is going to be a benefit to SoFi given our stability and the fact that we have deposit funding with a bank that were EBITDA positive consistently for two years. And so we have a lot of capital on the balance sheet. We could be a really safe home for a lot of people that are worried about their capital getting chopped in some way from dislocations in private companies and public companies in the brokerage space. As it relates to student loans, we, in our guidance and our outlook still assume the moratorium will end until 2023. If it ends sooner, we'd expect the demand for that product to really go through the roof and be back to normalized levels that we saw in 2019 and Q1 of 2020, which, as Chris mentioned, was over $2 billion of origination and that would be a huge tailwind that allows us to step on the gas even more because it's a really profitable business and high incremental profit margins. On the technology services side for Galileo and Technisys, we're in an environment companies really need to drive greater efficiency in their businesses and drive down costs, which means they need to upgrade their technology platforms. And we are a perfect company to partner with them, whether it's on the core banking technology or payment processing and everything that's in between. We truly have an end-to-end solution for them in WC&H and soon to be on the credit side as well as a whole host of other products that the team at Techisys working on. And all have a single-point solutions that we also have Techisys that are quite advantageous from both a functionality standpoint and a cost standpoint. So we're really excited about the amount of demand we're seeing there. And I mentioned it's not just in the consumer area, but also the B2B area, and a lot of the enterprise payment technology doesn't exist today for people that do digital payments. They're largely still doing paper payments, and we can enable a lower cost there as well. So we're excited about that. On the insurance side, it's been relatively steady, but we're gaining market share there as a lead generator. And then as lending as a service, I think the more disruptive the credit markets are, the more people look to lower their cost and lending if they're not a bank to be able to need the higher life of loan losses and charge-offs they may be experiencing. Yes. One of the things that we've seen going back to our overall strategy of using our different products to build our relationship with members. And from that relationship, they'll trust their reliability. So when they want to use a second product, they choose us, and we get great financial and operating leverage in addition to more data to better serve them to help them get their money right. What we've seen in the SoFi Money product, the checking and savings account product, as we've raised the APY, the quality of the customer, their FICO score, their credit profile has also increased. -- in fact, sets us up really well for future opportunities to serve them on the lending side. I would say the members that we're acquiring through SoFi Money, they need less borrowing than the members we've had in the past, but they have higher -- they have higher credit profiles, which is unveiled well for the future cross-buying over business. They also have more money to invest, which would help our invest business in addition to other areas that we see as opportunities with them. So the aggregation of more money members with higher credit profiles and more direct deposits is really positive. Once we have the direct deposit, we know what types of bills they have. We know if they have -- they're sitting on paths that they're not investing. We know if they're overextended with credit card payments or student loan payments or mortgage payments. So it's a treasure to of information that helps us serve them much better. The second thing I'd say is that as we've added those direct to pilot customers, we've seen really strong spending trends, and we have a 1% interchange on our debit card today, and so that business kind of fits as well as the benefit of the data. And then activation I was going to say on activation rate side of the equation, we're industry benchmarks for percent of funded accounts that are converting to direct deposits. Yes. I'd say the sales cycle differs by the stage of company. Segment does matter, but stage of company matters more. So earlier-stage companies, the sales cycle is much shorter. More mature companies, the sales cycle is much larger. The benefit of existing companies with installed bases or existing payment needs is that you don't have to build their business over time. It's they're all right. It seems to be transitioned either from physical payments to digital and you grow quite rapidly or you can work off of an old platform to a new platform. So in many ways, getting more existing partners as opposed to early-stage companies could help accelerate growth there. On the financial services side, the non-B2B side, we're in conversation with the large banks in the United States and outside the United States. But previously, we were not in conversations with before we own Technisys. So the combination of Technisys and Galileo is a pretty powerful combination that gives payment processing and core end-to-end solution, which is a great opportunity for an existing large financial institution to move to a modern stack and benefit from all the innovation that we're driving in addition to the lower costs. On the B2B side, it's just an area that we hadn't invested in meaningfully in the past. We have many B2B customers, but there is a product set that they need for us to capture more of the opportunity that comes to us. And that's the big difference between where we are today and than in the past. The demand was there. We just didn't have the product set built out, which the team has invested in this year. So we're excited about that as well. And just one clarification, Galileo business. we have a fixed rate on those transactions. And on the API calls, it's not a percentage of the interchange or a percentage of the transaction size. So if the basket size gets smaller, it doesn't change what we get paid. We get paid by transaction or by API call. Yes. We have a very small market share in personal loans, but we are gaining share. We think about the differentiators for all of our products on four dimensions, five really, but four unique ones: fast, selection, content, convenience. And then the fifth one is having our products work better together, i.e., you get a lower interest rate if you also do direct deposit as an example. So fast. We want to be the fastest place to apply for a loan, the fastest place to be approved for a loan, and the fastest place to get funded for a loan. And on personal loans, we try to get it down to two days. It used to be eight or nine days. Why is that the case? People, they don't want to wait for a decision. They want to know they have a solution to wherever their problem is. And so we want to do that very quickly, and we work every day to do so. And I think we're as competitive as anyone. I'd be shocked if anyone was faster than us. There's also a rescission period that we have to consider. But we can get it down to two or three days, and we do that quite often. Second is I think about selection. Selection is not just the term and the type of rate. It's also other elements of that loan, one of which is pricing. And because we are a bank and our cost of funding is meaningfully lower now, we could be much more aggressive on pricing. And we're pretty, I would say, surgical as it relates to the relation between the credit profile and the pricing profile we developed back in 2018, six different grids of about 36 cells that are constantly used to figure out where there's an opportunity in pricing relative to credit. And so that's a sophisticated process that's done each week, and it's been built on four years of data. The second element of that is marketing and understanding which channels provide the best borrowers. And it's not just the best borrower in terms of demand, but it's about their variable profit. And so we're trying to optimize for 40% to 50% of variable profit margin on a per loan basis, and we want to maximize dollars there. We know which channels perform the best on uneconomic basis, and so our marketing can be a lot more efficient. And it's generally hard to find people that are good credit profiles because they're not always necessarily looking for money, and you're trying to find a great solution for them. So those are a couple of the elements that we use on a singular basis of the products to differentiate. We also increasingly are doing things, like I mentioned, to make our products work better when you use them together. So giving you an advantage if you're also a direct deposit customer and the rate that we offer you. We've done historically auto payments as a discount to the rate, but direct deposit is now another lever that we can use from a differentiated standpoint that others cannot use or don't have, and you'll see us continue to do better together types of things to get there. Yes. Because we're focused on a specific segment of the population and a specific credit profile of the population. We're going to look at different metrics that necessarily tie to GDP growth or inflation, et cetera. I don't want to get into all the details of all the different metrics. The team -- the risk team utilizes that framework. They provide us with early warning levels. We use red, green and yellow. They change quite frequently. We look at them every month. There have been some months in the past that were more red than months that we've currently had. And so there's not going to be something you can look at and say, \"This means X, Y or Z for SoFi. Our team is looking at that broad range of indicators and using that to create each one of the metrics. And ultimately, when we get to a certain level of things being read, we lend less, which is what we get back in March of 2020. And once we lend less, we don't turn it back on until they turn back to yellow or green. So it's something we monitor all the time. If you look at the second quarter, April was more negative than May or June. May and June were more positive in April. So it's an ever-changing environment. I don't want to give you any indication of what it's going to be tomorrow or what it was yesterday. Our guidance reflects what it's been and where we think it's going to be. And then the only other thing I'd point to is the actual performance of our loan, which Chris talked about. Thank you, and thank you for everyone for your thoughts today and spending time on our call. I want to end with a couple of points. I'm incredibly humbled by the privilege to lead SoFi and work with so many passionate people that have built our company day by day and in branch. Rolling time and time again to each challenge we've faced all in service and changing the lives for so many people. I would have never predicted that we could deliver superior growth with record revenue quarter after quarter in 2021 and now again in 2022, while our student loan refinancing business operates at 25% to 50% of normalized levels for the last 2.5 years, and we still delivered 8 quarters of positive EBITDA. We went public, we've raised over $3.5 billion, and we have teamed a very hard to accomplish goal in becoming a national bank. But that is exactly what we've done here today and last quarter and the quarter before that. Our members need our help like never before and our ability to help them is unmatched by any company that I am aware of. The responsibility that comes with that rare position is great, but the personal and professional satisfaction when we deliver is even greater. I am in awe of the impact we have on our members. While no one day has a dramatic impact relative to others, the cumulative impact of the last 1,620 days is dramatic, which is why we have to remain focused like never before on ensuring that we continue to move with urgency, with purpose, with a winning mindset and a founder's mentality to make progress every minute of every hour of every day so that the aggregate impact remains unmatched. Until next quarter, we thank you for your interest in SoFi. Thank you very much."

As always, we encourage you to evaluate SoFi’s performance on an annual basis as quarterly results can be affected by unexpected events that are outside our control. Now, I will turn the call over to Anthony.\nAnthony Noto: Thank you, Andrea and good afternoon everyone. I am incredibly proud of our first quarter performance given the resilience we have demonstrated to deliver the strong results we are reporting today and our positive trends thus far in the second quarter. A few of the key achievements in the quarter include another quarter of record adjusted net revenue with 49% year-over-year growth, our seventh consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA, continued strong growth in members, products and cross byline, the successful launch of SoFi Bank and our new SoFi checking and saves account offering, both of which are already contributing to our results. In announcing and closing the acquisition of Technisys to accelerate our innovation while also serving as a critical platform that accelerates our progress in building the AWS of fintech. The strength of our results achieved despite volatile markets and the changing political, fiscal and economic landscape also demonstrate how our strategy of building a full suite of differentiated products and services has actually created a uniquely diversified business that cannot only endure, but outperform across market cycles. Because of the depth and breadth of our offering, we are able to make swift and critical adjustments in priorities and spend as conditions evolve in order to capitalize on growth opportunities and exceed our performance targets. I am proud of how our team has successfully navigated each new challenge and opportunity. And in doing so, not only positioned SoFi for long-term sustainable success, but to be the company best positioned to be the winner that takes most in consumer fintech. Now, I will run through the highlights of the financial results for the quarter. We achieved record total adjusted net revenue of $322 million, up 49% year-over-year and 15% higher than the prior record set in Q4 2021. Strong growth in all three business segments drove these record results. Lending adjusted net revenue of $244 million increased 45% year-over-year and 17% sequentially despite the sixth extension of the moratorium on federal student loan payments, which has kept our student loan origination volumes at less than half of pre-pandemic levels. Financial Services adjusted net revenue of nearly $24 million increased 264% year-over-year with the largest contributions coming from record SoFi Money revenues and continued strength in SoFi Credit Card, SoFi Invest and Lending as a Service. Technology platform adjusted net revenue of nearly $61 million increased 32% with record Galileo revenues and a small contribution from our new Technisys multi-core technology business. Adjusted EBITDA of nearly $9 million increased 110% year-over-year and 89% sequentially. We are also very pleased with the member and product growth we achieved in the first quarter. We added 408,000 new members in Q1 ‘22, our third highest quarter of new member adds, ending with nearly 3.9 million total members, up 70% year-over-year. Notably, maintaining this growth momentum while opening a new bank was no small feat for our team. At a moment’s notice, we had to navigate the operating and technological complexity of transitioning SoFi Money CMA accounts to the new SoFi checking and savings offering, which also required changes to our affiliate partners as well as our marketing and advertising campaigns creative and collateral. We added 689,000 new products in Q1 ‘22, our second highest quarter of new product adds ending with nearly 5.9 million total products and 84% annual increase. Financial Services products of $4.7 million at quarter end grew 155% year-over-year, while lending products of more than 1.1 million were up 20%. The significant scale that we now have in our SoFi Money, SoFi Invest, SoFi Credit card and relay member bases is driving even greater cross-buying. Our number of total cross-brought products in the quarter increased 22% year-over-year, demonstrating the continued success of our financial services productivity loop strategy. Our strong momentum in member, product and cross-buy growth also reflects the success we have achieved in building the SoFi brand over the last year. We committed to investing more in product and brand marketing once we reach the appropriate scale and unit economics last year. That investment is already paying off well beyond our expectations, and we’re just getting started. We took a giant step forward in achieving our goal of becoming a household brand name via our SoFi Stadium affiliation, the success of our integrated multimedia campaigns and the virality of the influencers we partner with. Our marketing team worked with 30 content creators across TikTok, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube, with a combined reach of more than 300 million throughout the NFL season and the post season. Their efforts amplified the branding of SoFi and SoFi Stadium and together drove more than 270 million impressions. Our unaided brand awareness, which had already increased more than 70% throughout 2021 more than doubled on Super Bowl weekend to an all-time high. We generated the highest SoFi related search by of all time on game day with nearly 230,000 and the most new visitors to our site since the mean stock raise in January of ‘21. And even without an ad, SoFi had nearly 5x more online searches than the top-performing Super Bowl ad that air. Now I’d like to discuss how our strategy to build the only vertically integrated one-stop shop for digital financial services has resulted in a uniquely diversified business model. In lending, we originated a record of more than $2 billion in personal loans in Q1 2022, up from $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021 and $1.3 billion in Q1 of 2021. Our results reflect years of investing to maintain an attractive credit profile and increasing our ability to capture more share of the $1 trillion market. Our personal loan performance more than offset the continued lack of demand in student loan refinancing and the underperformance of home loans as we transition and onboard new fulfillment partners. We are also seeing the benefit of our ongoing investment to build and maintain a robust risk management framework in the current rising rate environment. We are constantly iterating, learning and iterating some more while using data that goes well beyond traditional industry-specific underwriting data to drive the innovation in our credit underwriting models. We’re also increasingly leveraging machine learning tools to improve the member experience throughout the funnel from application to income verification to approval. Because of these disciplines, our personal loan delinquencies and life of loan losses remain at record lows, even as we hit new origination records, while demand to buy SoFi’s personal loans has remained robust. The profile of our borrower is very attractive to loan buyers. Our personal loan borrowers’ weighted average income is $160,000 with a weighted average FICO score of 746. While our student loan borrowers weighted average income is $170,000 with a weighted average FICO score of 775. Let me say those numbers again, given how impressive they are. Our personal loan borrowers’ weighted average income is $160,000 with a weighted average FICO score of 746. While our student loan borrowers weighted average income is $170,000 and weighted average FICO score of 775. We are also differentiated in lending by the strength of our balance sheet and the diversification of our funding sources. Today, we have $5.5 billion of book equity on our balance sheet and about $7 billion in warehouse facilities we can access to fund loans. Not to mention the more than $1.5 billion currently and SoFi’s checking and saving deposits we’ve raised so far at SoFi’s Bank, which are growing by $100 million weekly. As we scale the bank, we are gaining even more flexibility in lending. We are already achieving savings by using our own deposits rather than warehouse facilities to fund loans. We’ve just started moving towards holding loans 6 months on average versus 3, which allows us to collect more net interest income. This also creates a more rational pricing environment for our paper as we leverage our ability to hold loans for longer should pricing not be acceptable. And we can now introduce new loan types and pricing models that improve our competitive positioning. In Financial Services, we have continued to achieve strong member and product growth by iterating on our products to ensure they are differentiated by 4 key factors: fast, selection, content and convenience, and continuing to invest to make them work better when they’re used together. We finished the first quarter with 4.7 million total financial services products, a 111% annual increase and more than 4x our total lending products of 1.1 million. The more scale in financial services products creates even more scale and cross-buying and thus, large marketing efficiencies. Just 1 year ago, that ratio was 2.4:1, and 2 years ago, lending products actually outnumbered financial services products by a factor of 1.6:1. Members have embraced the product launches and financial services introduced in the first quarter. We launched margin lending and SoFi Invest, which is one of the most common member requests. Another common to request is extended hours trading, which we will launch in the coming weeks and options, which we are targeting introducing by year-end. We introduced no fee crypto transactions for SoFi Money members that do direct deposit, and we are assessing other possible crypto products to provide even more value to our members. Last but certainly not least, SoFi’s Checking and savings provides an unmatched value proposition through an industry-leading API of up to 1.25%, a host of free features and a unique rewards program. The strategy is paying off as we’ve seen strong growth in direct deposit accounts and spending, while deposits have accelerated further since we announced the API increase of 25 basis points last month. Transitioning now to our technology platform, which remains a critical element of SoFi’s strategy, allowing us to innovate at a rapid pace while providing diversified high-return revenue streams and an efficient cost structure, already a market leader among U.S. based neobanks, Galileo continues to expand its client base to include B2B and enterprise clients as adoption of modern cloud-based digital payments and banking has opened up new verticals and client types, use cases and opportunities. For example, we launched two new clients in the first quarter that offer innovative working capital models for B2B and small- to medium-sized businesses. Technology platform enabled clients accounts increased 58% year-over-year in the first quarter to $110 million through new client acquisition and growth from existing clients. The large installed customer bases of Galileo clients also provide unique growth opportunities for existing capabilities like instant provisioning, dynamic fraud engine and 2-day early paycheck as well as financial and engagement products in our pipeline that can drive greater customer activity like instant funding and direct deposit switching. Our March acquisition of Technisys further differentiates our technology platform by allowing us to incorporate a next-generation multiproduct core banking technology into our lending and financial services platforms and it enhances our value proposition for Galileo clients. This type of vertical integration enables faster innovation and growth as well as greater operating efficiencies. Technisys also brings a complementary footprint of established banks, digital banks and fintechs in Latin America, adding to the robust growth opportunity of Galileo’s existing presence in Mexico and Colombia. Galileo and Technisys are already going to market together to offer new products and services to the Galileo clients looking to expand their lineup. Early reception among existing Galileo and Technisys clients in the U.S. and LatAm has been very positive. I’ll finish here by saying that we have been in an all-out sprint over the last 4 years to build out our digital product suite to meet our members’ needs for every major functional decision in their lives and all the days in between. The benefits of our strategy to build a uniquely diversified business, combined with the national banking license, not only positions SoFi to be the winner takes most in the sector transition of financial services to digital, but also provide greater durability through a market cycle. I am excited about where we are today and where we can go from here. With that, let me turn over to Chris for a review of the financials for the quarter.\nChris Lapointe: Thanks, Anthony. Overall, we had a great quarter with strong growth trends across the entire business. We exceeded our financial guidance while achieving record revenue and our seventh consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA despite operating in a rapidly evolving macro environment. I am going to walk you through some key financial highlights for the quarter and then share some color on our financial outlook. Unless otherwise stated, I will be referring to adjusted results for the first quarter of 2022 versus first quarter of 2021. Our GAAP consolidated income statement and all reconciliations can be found in today’s earnings release and 10-Q filings. For the quarter, we delivered record adjusted net revenue of $322 million up 49% year-over-year and up 15% sequentially from the prior quarter’s record of $280 million and $37 million above the high-end of our guidance of $280 million to $285 million. We also delivered $9 million of adjusted EBITDA, which came in $4 million above the high-end of our guidance of $0 million to $5 million. Looking at some of the annual trends, we have generated $1.1 billion of adjusted net revenue over the last 12 months, a 49% increase from the same prior year period. In addition, our Q1 annualized run-rate was nearly $1.3 billion of revenue. We also generated $35 million of positive EBITDA over the last 12 months. Now, on to the segment level performance, where we saw strong growth in record revenue across all three segments. In lending, first quarter adjusted net revenue accelerated for the second quarter in a row and grew 45% year-over-year to $244 million versus 30% in Q4 ‘21 and 21% in Q3 ‘21. Growth in lending was driven by 82% year-over-year growth in net interest income and 29% growth in non-interest income. Growth in net interest income was driven by improvements in NIM, both yield and cost of capital, an increase in loan balances, which grew to $7 billion, predominantly as a result of holding loans for a longer period of time, a very early benefit of having the bank as well as 30% growth in funded volume. The largest contributor of funded volume growth was our personal loans business, which grew 151% or $1.2 billion year-over-year to $2 billion in originations for the quarter, a new high for us and up 23% sequentially. This origination number is more than double our quarterly pre-pandemic average of $933 million in 2019. We were able to achieve this growth while maintaining our stringent credit standards and disciplined focus on quality. Our personal loan delinquency rates and charge-off rates have improved year-over-year. In Q1, 90-day personal loan delinquencies as a percentage of loans on the balance sheet improved to 14 basis points in Q1 ‘22, while our annualized personal loan charge-off rate was 1.0%. Both 90-day delinquency and the annualized charge-off rates in our student loan refinancing business also remained extremely healthy at 5 basis points and 27 basis points respectively. The increase in non-interest income was driven by growth in originations, strong sales execution and prudent hedging. The lending business delivered $133 million of contribution profit at a 54% margin, up from $88 million a year ago and a 52% margin. This improvement was driven by ops efficiencies and fixed cost leverage. Shifting to our tech platform, where we delivered net revenue of $61 million in the quarter, up 32% year-over-year versus a tough comparison driven by stimulus benefits and a rapid evolution from cash to digital payments in the same prior year period. Galileo contributed record revenue while Technisys contributed a small amount following the close of the transaction in March. Overall, revenue growth was driven by 58% year-over-year Galileo account growth to $110 million in total. We also signed 10 new clients 2 of which are in the B2B space, further diversifying our partner base. Contribution profit of $18 million represented a 30% margin, which is in line with the 20% to 30% margin range we have guided to in the near term, given the opportunities for growth. As discussed previously, we remain committed to investing in the platform to ensure that our tech platform is well positioned to capitalize on the secular shift from physical to digital payments and rising overall demand for more fintech services. Moving on to Financial Services, where adjusted net revenue of $24 million increased 264% year-over-year with new all-time high revenues for SoFi Money, which is now transitioning to SoFi checking and savings and continued strong contributions from SoFi Credit Card, SoFi Invest and Lending as a Service. Improved monetization and exponential growth in financial services products drove our performance. Annualized revenue per financial services product increased 73% year-over-year and the number of products grew 2.2x year-over-year to 4.7 million in Q1 ‘22. All products were up approximately 100% year-over-year and SoFi Credit card was up 500% year-over-year. We hit 1.6 million products in SoFi money, 1.8 million in SoFi Invest and 1.1 million in Relay. Contribution losses were $50 million for the quarter, which increased year-over-year, predominantly as a result of now having a credit card business and needing to build our CECL reserves, which is expected as we continue to grow in scale. As of the end of Q1, the reserves are in line with industry peers. Excluding these reserves, contribution losses were $36.5 million or up $1 million year-over-year. The next thing I want to address is our balance sheet. Overall, we are very well capitalized with ample cash and excess liquidity. The recent opening of SoFi Bank only reinforces the strength of our balance sheet and provides us with more flexibility and the ability to further lower our cost of capital. In Q1, our balance sheet grew by approximately $3 billion, and that was driven by three factors: first, cash equivalents and restricted cash increased by approximately $900 million, primarily as a result of an increase in pledge activity to capitalize the bank as well as increases in deposits at SoFi Bank, which totaled $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter. Second, loan balances grew approximately $1.2 billion as a result of holding loans for a slightly longer period of time. And third, we had a $900 million increase in goodwill and intangibles related to our acquisition of Technisys. We exited the quarter with $2.8 billion drawn on our warehouse facilities, which is approximately 40% of our overall $7 billion of capacity. Our current book value is $5.5 billion and our capital and leverage ratios are extremely strong, both at the bank and at the bank holding company level. Alright. I’ll finish up with guidance. Throughout the last 12 months, we have demonstrated the benefit of having a diversified set of revenue streams and a keen focus on continuing to underwrite high-quality credit. We expect those benefits to persist going forward, particularly in light of the existing macro backdrop. For Q2, we expect another strong quarter of growth with $330 million to $340 million of adjusted net revenue up 39% to 43% year-over-year and expect $5 million to $15 million of adjusted EBITDA. For the full year of 2022, we are raising guidance and now expect to deliver $1.505 billion to $1.510 billion in adjusted net revenue, exceeding our recently provided full year guidance of $1.47 billion, and expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA of $100 million to $105 million above our recently provided guidance of $100 million. Overall, we couldn’t be more proud of our Q1 results and continued progress. Having delivered nearly $1.3 billion of annualized revenue and our seventh consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA, we continue to make great progress against our long-term growth objectives in Q1 ‘22 and remain very well capitalized to continue pursuing our ultimate goal of making SoFi a top financial institution. With that, let’s begin the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Please proceed.\nDan Dolev: Hi, guys. Hi, Anthony. Hi, Chris. Great quarter here.\nAnthony Noto: Hi, Dan.\nDan Dolev: Hey, guys. I have sort of like maybe a longer-term question. And I think I was actually surprised to see the stock trade down today so much. And I think a lot of it had to do because he reported after upstart. And I think there is a lot of confusion out there in the market from the calls that we’re getting from investors about the nuances and the differences between the quality of SoFi and some of your competitors. Can you maybe talk to what people are misunderstanding here and what they are missing when they are sort of putting you in that group? Thank you.\nAnthony Noto: Thanks, Dan. I’ll start and hand it over to Chris to talk about the demographics and the credit profile of our members. I would say the basis between SoFi and all the other call it, FinTech 2.0 companies moving Square and PayPal out of that equation, so more recently public companies. The biggest overage is we’re building a one-stop shop with a broad suite of digital financial products for our members. We’re trying to build a lifetime relationship with them to be there for everyone of the major funds decision their lives and all the days in between. And we’re doing that through a vertical integrated model so that we have best-of-breed products from a consumer standpoint, but also best of breed unit economics, and that will allow us to have a competitive advantage. And as we build that vertical integration, we’re building technologies that we’re turning into businesses as we have with Galileo and Technisys, and that results from a financial standpoint with a highly diversified business. Within our Lending segment, we have four different types of loans. We’re not just in personal loans or also in steel refinancing or in-school loans and in mortgages. Within the technology platform, there is two primary businesses there, but there is more to be additive Technisys and Galileo, and they are incredibly complementary. It’s a very high-margin business, accelerates our rate of innovation, giving us a low-cost advantage and giving us a return on our own technology development and lifting the all goes for the industry. And in our third segment, the Financial Services segment is highly diversified with SoFi checking and savings, SoFi Invest, even within SoFi Invest, we’re not just in crypto, we’re not just in single stocks, we’re also ETFs are also in down, and then we have a credit card, which, over time, will build out that portfolio. We have one today. We also do insurance as a regeneration business we have the related businesses. So we’re very diversified. And one of the biggest reasons why we’ve been able to navigate the challenges of the last 4 years, and there have been multiple of challenges every year, whether it’s economic or industry-related or credit related is because we have that diversification and can reallocate our resources toward the best growth opportunities are, and that’s why we continue to deliver record revenues despite the negative impact on the still in moratorium. The last big thing I’d mention, and Chris will give you the details is we’re going after a high-end customer, mass-affluent, high net wealth individuals to have a great credit profile, high income, and they need the products and services that we develop and most of the big banks have walked away from that price we have products. They don’t offer mortgages. They are not in brokerage or they don’t have personal financial management where they don’t have curies. And so that results in us having a pretty diversified business. We’ve been EBITDA profitable for the last seven quarters, and we’re on our way to being GAAP profitable and we’re generating positive cash flow reporting EBITDA less CapEx and building our book value. And we have substantial book value. But that’s been sort of the biggest point to describe how we’re positioned. I will have Chris give you the details on our income and our credit profile.\nChris Lapointe: Yes. Thanks, Dan. What I would say is just echoing what Anthony said, our demographic credit profile of our member base is extremely strong, and we see that playing into our results. The weighted average income of our student loan refinancing borrowers is $170,000 with an average FICO of 775. The average income of our personal loan borrowers is $160,000 with an average FICO of 746. And then our overall credit profile and risk metrics are trending really well, both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. In terms of 90-day delinquencies, our PL 90-day delinquencies are at 14 basis points which is down year-over-year and sequentially. And our student loan refinancing delinquencies remained really healthy at just 5 basis points. And then from a charge-off perspective, those remain really healthy as well and are trending in the right direction with our personal loans annualized charge-offs at 1.04%. And student loan at 27 basis points. And the last thing I’d add is we have the most unique funding strategy and distribution strategy that makes a low-cost operator in lending. We built the business end-to-end on from metal to glass, but we’ve also built out diversified distribution of our loans. We can sell whole loans, which is a great diversified market for us. We can hold loans because we are a bank, we use deposits to fund them at a low cost, and we can access the ABS market if and when we think it’s appropriate. And so we have a great competitive advantage in low cost but also an ability to get really strong premiums for the credit that Chris just described due to distribution have from our capital markets.\nDan Dolev: Got it. Thank you. Super helpful. And can I ask one quick follow-up here. We’re getting some questions today post that on the EBITDA for the second half. I know – I mean, we’ve done the work. We know it has to do with the longer duration in deposits. But maybe can you can you quickly bridge for investors like sort of the bridge from where we are in the first and the second quarter to that $40 millionish ramp in the second half that would be helpful? Thanks again.\nChris Lapointe: Yes, absolutely. So we aren’t providing specific segment level or product level detail, but to at least how folks think about the bridge from where we are to the $100 million and $105 million guide. I would think about it in two buckets. First, the bank is going to start contributing much more meaningfully in the back half of this year. But we’re really proud to say that all new applications for our lending products are going through the bank end of a few weeks ago. Deposit growth is going extremely well. And as a result, we’re going to start benefiting from a lower cost of capital, and we’re going to start seeing the benefits play out of being able to hold loans for a longer period of time at scale in the back half of the year. And then the second thing, the second bucket is related to growth in some of our higher-margin businesses, specifically our personal loans business in [indiscernible]. So collectively, those are the main things that we bridge us from where we are today to the guide.\nDan Dolev: Got it. Thank you so much again. Great quarter.\nAnthony Noto: Thank you, Dan.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nJohn Hecht: Good afternoon, guys. Yes, I echo those congratulations on good numbers in a choppy environment. So my first question is just I know it’s very early on, but maybe can you give us kind of your perspective on early progress within the bank and kind of what KPIs you’re looking for and what we should look out for over time?\nAnthony Noto: Thank you, John. One of the key strategies of having the bank license and being able to offer a super differentiated checking and saving accounts. When we originally launched SoFi Money, we were not a bank back in 2019, and we were sort of be holding the interest rate that we could get from suite partners. But now as a bank, we could provide – we can offer the interest rate that we think is most attractive. And currently, we’re offering up to 1.25% on checking if you do direct deposit with us and get a host of other benefits as a member and other benefits in that account be charging the fees. We do free roundups, you have overdraft protection, you get a free certified financial planner, our relationship in addition to all the breakthrough get on other loans, etcetera. We’ve seen tremendous uptake of that product since we launched it. I will say, and as in my prepared remarks, it is incredibly challenging waiting for the Federal Reserve and OCC to give us the final approval, if it wasn’t clear when they are going to do it or if they were going to do it given the political environment we’re in. And so we were sitting ready with marketing and collateral and plans and technology and operations, ready to flip the switch. But once we did that, it took a while to get things rolling in Q1, and we came out of Q1 and Q2 really seeing the benefits. Our direct deposit uptake is up 60% on a conversion basis and the number of direct deposit accounts added per week has doubled in Q2 versus Q1. And as Chris mentioned, we’re up to over $1.5 billion of deposits, and it’s growing about $100 million of deposits per week, and the feedback from an NPS for basis is really strong. So we couldn’t be happier with that competitive advantage that we now have. As we bring people into the top of the funnel, it increased the amount of cross-buying we have, as you know like a personal loan product we doubled our variable profit per loan [indiscernible] invest into that and money is really one of the faster products we think to start with as you [indiscernible]. And our customer addition costs there are very attractive and we’re actually leading and even more because the LTV is putting out to be even higher than we thought based on early indications. So really happy with that product. The second thing I’d say is it took a mile dip in the back of the bank and go through the process. And there are plans that we have specifically like the checking same account and funding our new loans in the bank. But there are other opportunities to now is coming to life, such as having a sponsored in business that we can partner with Galileo on. They have B2B partners out there adding. There is a lot of them in the EUV channel. Well, we can be a sponsor bank in B2B. And so that’s the new revenue stream that we’re working on with the regulators to launch and with our partners there. So there is a number of other things that will come down the pipeline as a result of having the bank has weren’t contemplated until we actually got the license.\nJohn Hecht: That’s very helpful. I appreciate all that detail. A follow-up question. Maybe just because it’s been a volatile market. I think credit spreads are drifting around, and obviously, interest rates are moving upward. Maybe talk about the components of the gain on sale? And is there any kind of different trends you’re observing on your different asset types and kind of the outlook for that?\nChris Lapointe: Yes, I can take that one, John. So what I would say is that there are a few important things to note when thinking about the overall trends in gain on sale margins, especially on a quarter-to-quarter basis, and there are a number of factors that’s been playing to that, most predominantly rates, spreads, and then obviously, the price that we’re charging on the loans that we sell. In addition to those factors, it’s really important to incorporate the impact of hedge gains and losses, which are critical, particularly in an environment that we’re in right now. So in Q1, our gain on sale margins, excluding hedge gains, were 4.2% and they were north of 4.5% once you include hedges associated with loans sold in period. Our student loan refinancing business had gain on sale margin of 1.5%, excluding the hedge and north of 4% once you include hedges. And then our home loans business was negative 60 basis points, excluding the hedge and north of 2% once you include that. So they have been relatively consistent on a hedge ducted basis over the course of the last several quarters, and we expect them to be able to maintain that. The only other thing I would say as it relates to our lending business is that we obviously seek to maximize profit dollars in our lending business and stay within a 40% to 50% contribution margin range, and we obviously have a number of levers to do that. Despite the rapidly rising rate environment that we’ve been going through over the course of the last quarter plus, we were still able to deliver $133 billion of contribution dollars at a 54% margin across our entire portfolio, even as rates went up 80 to 150 basis points across the curve.\nAnthony Noto: And one of the other things I would just add, John, the benefit of those that closed the company back in ‘18 and ‘19. When we joined in 2018, Michelle and I were looking at 4 to 5 rate increases throughout ‘18 and ‘19. And we rapidly developed a strategy of being able to test six different 6x6 grid simultaneous in the marketplace. And at that time, the company really had the ability to test two prices. We spent the better part of 2018 not just testing all these different prices of building that capability, but also understanding the unit economics by marketing channel and just an add over time. So the level of sophistication we have in marketing pricing and credit is really built over the last 4 years. So as rates are going up, even though our funding costs are going down, we are being prudent about making sure we have the right price for the right credit through constantly testing and also leveraging different channels that we now have certain types of loan losses and quality performance. In addition to that, we have an early warning framework that our risk team has built out that we actually executed at the beginning of 2020 to be in a pandemic to make sure that we’re in a position to be able to pull back as economic conditions start to provide main indicators that are at risk. So we’re playing on both ends of the spectrum offensively with pricing and channels and then if the market turns over in some way, that’s not what was predicted. We can also put it back the other way.\nJohn Hecht: Wonderful. Thanks very much.\nAnthony Noto: You are welcome.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.\nDominick Gabriele: Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. And great results. If you just think about your investment initiatives how many of the – how may have those changed since the end of the year ‘21 versus today since the market seems to be signaling a change in consumer environment? Have you changed any of your kind of investment dollar targets for your various business mix? And then I just have a follow-up. Thanks so much.\nAnthony Noto: The answer is yes. And it’s been like that every quarter since we launched the business. We do an annual planning process that starts in the fall or sets the priorities for the company for the following year. We did that in September and October when we had our six priorities. The team then does their bottoms that financial plans against those six priorities and then we start the year. Around mid-February, we start what’s called a large revised forecast, which will be a revision of the plan based on everything we’ve learned. And so, all the market conditions that change from December, January, February and the performance of our business get factored into that realized forecast. We put through that same process every quarter. That’s what allows us to assess where are things going well, there are things more challenging than we thought, how do we reallocate our resources against that umbrellas priorities to deliver the results. So – and we do a weekly latest call process as well, evaluating all the integrated details across all our funnels and our products and our financial performance so when we go into that revised forecast, we are not starting from scratch, we have built it on the back of 7 or 8 weeks of actual results in the quarter and what we are seeing in forward curves and the competitive environment, etcetera. So it’s a constant process. And when you have the diverse set of bits that we have, it gives you lot of advantages and they are not stuck in one on silo. I am not going to give you the specifics, because it’s multifaceted. But obviously, the personal loan business did much better. We saw that opportunity and we leaned into it. Student loan business got negatively impacted by the President’s unexpected extensive moratorium. We have pulled back significantly in the marketing there and reallocated it. In fact, we are starting to reallocate more aggressively to things like checking savings because we are seeing the flow-through to the loans and higher LTV justifying more investment there. So, it’s a constant data-driven process.\nDominick Gabriele: Great. And then just for my follow-up, if we just think about the moratorium versus the floating idea of perhaps even $10,000 of debt relief within student lending. How does that impact the business versus the moratorium? And I really do appreciate the early remarks on the high-income customers. I would assume those folks maybe took out larger loans on average than just the average loan within student there. So, any color you could provide on how that might affect your business and how you are thinking about that dynamic between the moratorium and the $10,000 per person that forgiveness? Thanks so much.\nAnthony Noto: Yes. Absolutely. I will try to give a broader perspective on this to educate those that may not be aware. So, prior to the pandemic, our student loan refinancing business had an average loan size of about $70,000. So, the average loan that was being refinanced was $70,000. And we are doing over $2 billion of quarterly re-financings. Since then, we have operated at 50% or below other than the fourth quarter when people have thought that more term was going to end in January, and we saw a big surge in late November and December. So, about $70,000, the demographics, Chris mentioned have generally been the same. What people should understand is any one is already refinanced with us would not be eligible for a Federal student loan forgiveness because they now have private loans. The Federal student loan forgiveness that’s been talked about has ranged from $10,000 for everybody. The $10,000 for those that weren’t economically below a certain income class to $50,000 for everybody, with the present buying campaign behind was $10,000 of forgiveness for those that had a need hit and quantify it. What has been talked about more recently, the President said I am not interested in $50,000 if you give us per person and his point and his advisors are pointing more towards $10,000 of forgiveness below a certain economic level. There is a lot of debates on an economic level for everything for $75,000 of income to $125,000 of income. The best thing for SoFi and for SoFi shareholders in our business is if he announces – the best thing is he had the more return than we just move on. But that’s unlikely, what’s more likely is some of them would forgive us. If there is some level of forgiveness, $10,000 and below, I think it would be great for our business. Now you may say, that applies to everybody, even if it applies to everybody. There is a cohort of people that have been waiting and waiting and waiting for student loan forgiveness and they have not refinanced. And that’s in our demographic as well. Once there actually is forgiveness, there is nothing to wait for anymore. You now know what the plan is, and you have to make a decision. Well, if you had $70,000 loans, which is our target market, and you get $10,000 forgiveness, you are still refinancing $60,000, but the number of people that we will be refinancing will be magnitudes greater than it was in the past because there is really no reason to wait any longer, especially with rates going up, I mean there is likely not going to be a second wave or forgiveness. The area where there is $10,000 forgiveness for people the $125,000 is really advantageous to us given the demographics that we set at a weighted average income of $170,000. And so that’s the way I would think about it. In terms of our financial guidance, we have assumed that the more time will extend all the way through 2022. So, our guidance that Chris mentioned of $1.505 billion to $1.510 billion is an assumption that the still business does not recover. In fact, it continues to be relatively depressed and exceeding even more.\nDominick Gabriele: Excellent. Thanks so much for all that color.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nMike Ng: Hey. Good afternoon. I just wanted to ask about the origination outlook for home loans specifically. I know you called out some fulfillment partner issues. Can you just talk a little bit about whether you see that easing in the back half and could home loan originations accelerate? And then could you also just talk about the backdrop of competition and the softening refinance environment, how does that affect how you think about home loan originations for this year and next? Thank you.\nAnthony Noto: Yes. We do have an opportunity to significantly improve the value proposition to our members at home loans and our execution on the operational side. The execution on the operational side is what’s holding us back. We are – we have moved from the existing partner to one entirely new partner. In doing that move, things having preceded as fast as we would have liked, which is a great highlight for how the diversification of our business allows us to overcome something that’s underperformed. And so two things have happened in the home loan business. One, we have moved to that new partner and there is growing pains and execution pain there. At the same time, the team has had the additional challenge of the mix of home loans moving from refinancing more towards purchase. Purchase is a different operational process, as you can imagine. And it’s really critical in those scenarios that you hit closing dates, etcetera. And so we are erring on the side of trying to provide the best level of service we can. And so we really haven’t stepped on the gas pedal as it relates to driving top of the final demand, because we want to make sure we can get the backlog of loans that we have in the system, especially in purchase through the system successfully. There are definitely challenges there, and we underperformed in the quarter. I am confident the team has the right plan and will work its way out throughout the course of the year. It’s a product our members at still 60% of the home loans we do are or more from existing members. It’s one of the most important financial decisions they will make. It’s one of the probably biggest emotional decision in that building, and we need to be there for them to give them a great product and a great service and it is still a huge opportunity for us given how few loans we have done for our members and the magnitude of the user base that we now have, not to mention selling share from as the first product.\nMike Ng: Great. Thank you very much for the thoughts Anthony.\nAnthony Noto: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Mihir Bhatia from Bank of America. Please proceed.\nMihir Bhatia: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe just to start, can you just talk about your macro expectations for the rest of the year?\nChris Lapointe: Yes, absolutely. So, in terms of the overall macro expectations, we are assuming that rates will continue to increase what we have baked into our forward guidance is that we would have seven additional rate hikes between now and the end of the year.\nMihir Bhatia: Got it. And then anything – and then the rest of it, any other color you can provide beyond just the rate hike, just what are you assuming for, I guess unemployment, consumer health, those kinds of things, anything at all you can provide there?\nAnthony Noto: Yes. We are assuming that the inflationary environment space so much where it is today, we are not assuming a recession. We do have early warning frameworks that will allow us to get in front of some type of deterioration in the economy that’s of the magnitude that would have an impact on life loan losses. We have been doing this for a couple of years way through the cycle forward. And so we will be vigilant on that front. But right now, those indicators are showing relatively strong demand and a relatively stable economic environment. And as Chris mentioned, the performance of our credit has been quite positive.\nMihir Bhatia: Great. Thank you. That’s helpful. And that’s quite consistent with what we have heard from others too. So, I think that’s good. I think one other question I just had just a follow-up in terms of – I think John asked about KPIs within the bank earlier, and I apologize if I missed this. So, did you give the direct deposit penetration rate maybe with your members and just the amount of cross-sell you are seeing between bank deposit holders and your other loans? Thank you.\nChris Lapointe: We have not given the specific numbers and specific KPIs. That’s something we will evaluate over time. The only thing I said was that the weekly adds have doubled since we were payment to Q2 versus Q1. And on prior calls, we have seen a good ramp increase based on our strategic focus in the area by adding critical elements of value to the equation. But the checking and savings conversion in the highest sort of 1.25% have really taken to the next level. As I mentioned, it’s – it’s up 2.7x in Q2 versus Q1. And we have seen an increasing conversion of account funded to direct deposit of 60% with interest.\nMihir Bhatia: Understood. Thank you and good execution again for the quarter. Thank you.\nAnthony Noto: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Tim Chiodo with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.\nTim Chiodo: Great. Thanks a lot for taking the question. I wanted to dig into the Financial Services segment for the non-interest income, so strong growth year-over-year, absolutely. But when we look at it on a quarter-over-quarter basis, maybe there is just some seasonality there. Maybe you could just help us in the modeling of how we should think about the non-interest income for that segment into Q2, Q3 and really for the rest of the year?\nChris Lapointe: Yes, I can take that one, Tim. So, what I would say is we saw really good momentum year-over-year, as you alluded to. Quarter-over-quarter, we saw a sequential growth in products of about 15%. Money and credit card combined delivered $10 million of revenue in the quarter that was up $2 million or 22% sequentially. That was primarily driven by interchange as well as some NIM our Lantern and Pagaya businesses combined or lending as a service delivered $8 million on the quarter. That was up $2 million sequentially or 30%. And then our invest business delivered $5 million of revenue. What I would say in terms of the forward outlook, again, we don’t provide it at the product level, but we do expect to see continued strong momentum in growth in product count across all of the products as well as improvement in monetization. If you look at our annualized revenue per product in the financial services business, that was up 73% year-over-year. So, we have made really good improvements over the last several quarters and continuing to monetize those products and numbers, and we expect that to continue going forward. And the way that that’s going to increase is through continuing to drive continuing to try and spend. We are seeing really good trends in that right now, especially opening the bank. And then obviously, launching new products and features like options that we expect to do by the end of this year. And there is one thing to remember, I think people know the just in case, we will have the bank for a full quarter in Q2, which will benefit that segment versus only one month in Q1.\nTim Chiodo: Excellent. Great. Thanks a lot. Chris, appreciate that. The other one was just a quick follow-up. Just so you made a comment that kind of caught my attention in the prepared remarks around strong new accounts at Galileo, for sure. But then also, you mentioned in terms of new customers, couple that were in the B2B area, if you could just put some additional context around that, that would be really appreciated?\nAnthony Noto: So, our product at Galileo, the platform lends itself not just to consumer-driven and Galileo has been a leader in the B2C space and neobanks since its inception. Since we bought it, we have seen an increasingly amount of demand in enterprise space. The number two partner within Galileo, which has been number two for years, is actually enterprise customer and not a consumer customer. So, it has that flexibility. And so we have signed a number of enterprise partners, some of which that is for accounts payable, accounts receivable payments and working capital in addition to other types of businesses that are in the fee economy. So, we are not naming specific names. We will announce those in conjunction with our partners as opposed to during our earnings call, but that’s increasingly a big channel for us, and we have a product pipeline to better serve the enterprise and SMB space holistically based on the demand we are seeing.\nTim Chiodo: Thanks a lot. Thank you, Anthony. Appreciate it. Thanks for taking those questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Adelson with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nJeff Adelson: Hi, good evening Anthony and Chris. I just wanted to understand the trajectory of personal loan growth here in your assumptions, a really nice quarter for that line. What kind of growth maybe are you assuming in your guidance for the rest of the year? And then just as you kind of look under the hood there, are you seeing more demand from your customers for that product, or I mean, if I understood, Anthony, your comments correctly earlier, it sounds like you are putting more marketing dollars out of that area. And could you also kind of help us understand how your ability to pass through interest rates is going there? It looks like from the Q, you were able to increase the rate there, about 40 bps Q-on-Q and you have got the 2-year rate going up 160 bps roughly. So, I just want to understand all those little drivers there?\nAnthony Noto: Yes. On the personal loans side, I will let Chris talk about the outlook. In terms of driving demand, I noted a couple of macro things and the things that we are doing on the macro side. As interest rates go higher, we saw this in ‘18 and ‘19, we see people refinancing at a variable rate debt, like credit card debt and other high rate variable debt into fixed rate and term loan debt. And so our product is really conducive to doing that, and we capture that demand. Additionally, as rates go higher, if you go back and look at our advertise in 2018 and ‘19, you will see we had a use case advertising behind home improvement. So, as interest rates go higher and individuals look to remodel their homes instead of buying new homes on that product also benefits. One of the things that you can do now that we weren’t that able to do in 2018 and ‘19 as we can market the product to our existing customers. And when we were going public, we provided a presentation that showed you the percent of our loans that were cross bought, and it’s averaging the 20% to 30% range. And so as the business has grown, it stayed in that range, and that’s a really efficient way for us to market to our customers. And so we will be leveraging that through this environment as well. In terms of the trajectory of any outer quarters, I will let Chris talk to that.\nChris Lapointe: Yes. So, in terms of the trajectory, we are providing forward guidance on originations. But as you know, we saw a really good growth at 151% year-over-year, and we ended up exiting the quarter with about 5.5% market share when you look at the overall TAM of our credit bonds, and that’s in comparison to about 4% in Q1 of 2021. So, we do expect to be able to continue gaining share over the course of 2022. And if rates continue to increase, we do expect the market to continue to expand.\nAnthony Noto: And the other thing I would just mention on the marketing side, we can afford to be a little bit more aggressive on the marketing front and open the after a little bit because of our decline monetization strategy. This is a product where we are proving 30% of the applicants. Previously, the other 70% were sort of lost and so we launched Lantern and now we are leading as a service that we have in our own application process. And so we can be a little bit more aggressive on marketing and drive return against that because our declines to be monetized in those two ways.\nChris Lapointe: Yes. And then the one last thing to address your final question about passing rate increases through WAC, especially in the PL business, we have made really good progress on increasing pricing and demand has remained extremely robust as you saw in the quarter. Overall, on the balance sheet and through our originations in the quarter, we were successfully able to raise WAC both NPL and SLR. So, making really good progress there and it’s showing up in the results.\nJeff Adelson: And then if I could just have a follow-up on the student loans side. Assuming that the student loan moratorium does go away at year-end or even before then, is it a reasonable way of thinking about your guidance here going forward, maybe that the original 2023 or – I am sorry, the original 2022 number for EBITDA of around $250 million is potentially the right way to think about 2023?\nChris Lapointe: Yes. We are not providing specific guidance around 2023. At this point, we shared the quarterly impact on the SLR business and the result of the impact from the extension. But at this point, we are not prepared to talk about 2023.\nAnthony Noto: So, the one thing I will say is, as the business comes back or if it doesn’t, as we exit 2022, we will go back towards the 30% incremental EBITDA margin philosophy. And the reason why I am emphasizing that is there is a lot of different ways to think about shareholder value creation. We believe return on invested capital is the most highly correlated metric with shareholder value creation. I think it’s better than ROE. We will look at both for us to get to the return invested capital that we think we can achieve in our mix of businesses. that’s in the 30%-plus range. We have to have a 30% EBITDA margin and both capital utilization, as we say on the CapEx side of the equation, which generates great closure from EBITDA to free cash flow, which is then to build our book value. And so as we exit turning to with or without student loans, will be back to a 30% incremental EBITDA margin. If we have the benefit of the student loan business, that would just be more incremental revenue and more incremental EBITDA at the 30% rate.\nJeff Adelson: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: That is the end of our Q&A session. Now, I will turn the call over to SoFi, CEO, Anthony Noto, for closing remarks.\nAnthony Noto: Thank you all. Thank you for everyone for joining us this afternoon or evening where you are. Before we wrap, I wanted to share some final thoughts. At SoFi, we are no stranger to adversity. As we near the halfway point of 2022, there is no shortage of challenges ahead, but there has been no shortage of challenges every year since we joined back in February of 2018. And with each set of unique challenges we have written to case each time. I cannot predict the future, but I can assure you that we have the best strategy in the most diversified set of businesses that have delivered superior consistent financial performance that generating both high-growth in revenue and strong profits as measured by EBITDA. We also have significant financial resources with more than $5 billion in capital and a battle-tested team. Most importantly, I can assure you that we will work tirelessly to be prepared as best we can wherever we face ahead, just as we have over the last 4 years. I love our team. I love our strategy. I love our company, and I love where I work. I wake up every day, and try to be a better leader than the day before and reminding myself that those who are in. Until we talk next time, thank you for your interest in SoFi, and thank you for your support.\nOperator: That concludes the SoFi Q1 2022 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Chris Lapointe",
            "content": "Thanks, Anthony. Overall, we had a great quarter with strong growth trends across the entire business. We exceeded our financial guidance while achieving record revenue and our seventh consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA despite operating in a rapidly evolving macro environment. I am going to walk you through some key financial highlights for the quarter and then share some color on our financial outlook. Unless otherwise stated, I will be referring to adjusted results for the first quarter of 2022 versus first quarter of 2021. Our GAAP consolidated income statement and all reconciliations can be found in today's earnings release and 10-Q filings. For the quarter, we delivered record adjusted net revenue of $322 million up 49% year-over-year and up 15% sequentially from the prior quarter's record of $280 million and $37 million above the high-end of our guidance of $280 million to $285 million. We also delivered $9 million of adjusted EBITDA, which came in $4 million above the high-end of our guidance of $0 million to $5 million. Looking at some of the annual trends, we have generated $1.1 billion of adjusted net revenue over the last 12 months, a 49% increase from the same prior year period. In addition, our Q1 annualized run-rate was nearly $1.3 billion of revenue. We also generated $35 million of positive EBITDA over the last 12 months. Now, on to the segment level performance, where we saw strong growth in record revenue across all three segments. In lending, first quarter adjusted net revenue accelerated for the second quarter in a row and grew 45% year-over-year to $244 million versus 30% in Q4 ‘21 and 21% in Q3 ‘21. Growth in lending was driven by 82% year-over-year growth in net interest income and 29% growth in non-interest income. Growth in net interest income was driven by improvements in NIM, both yield and cost of capital, an increase in loan balances, which grew to $7 billion, predominantly as a result of holding loans for a longer period of time, a very early benefit of having the bank as well as 30% growth in funded volume. The largest contributor of funded volume growth was our personal loans business, which grew 151% or $1.2 billion year-over-year to $2 billion in originations for the quarter, a new high for us and up 23% sequentially. This origination number is more than double our quarterly pre-pandemic average of $933 million in 2019. We were able to achieve this growth while maintaining our stringent credit standards and disciplined focus on quality. Our personal loan delinquency rates and charge-off rates have improved year-over-year. In Q1, 90-day personal loan delinquencies as a percentage of loans on the balance sheet improved to 14 basis points in Q1 ‘22, while our annualized personal loan charge-off rate was 1.0%. Both 90-day delinquency and the annualized charge-off rates in our student loan refinancing business also remained extremely healthy at 5 basis points and 27 basis points respectively. The increase in non-interest income was driven by growth in originations, strong sales execution and prudent hedging. The lending business delivered $133 million of contribution profit at a 54% margin, up from $88 million a year ago and a 52% margin. This improvement was driven by ops efficiencies and fixed cost leverage. Shifting to our tech platform, where we delivered net revenue of $61 million in the quarter, up 32% year-over-year versus a tough comparison driven by stimulus benefits and a rapid evolution from cash to digital payments in the same prior year period. Galileo contributed record revenue while Technisys contributed a small amount following the close of the transaction in March. Overall, revenue growth was driven by 58% year-over-year Galileo account growth to $110 million in total. We also signed 10 new clients 2 of which are in the B2B space, further diversifying our partner base. Contribution profit of $18 million represented a 30% margin, which is in line with the 20% to 30% margin range we have guided to in the near term, given the opportunities for growth. As discussed previously, we remain committed to investing in the platform to ensure that our tech platform is well positioned to capitalize on the secular shift from physical to digital payments and rising overall demand for more fintech services. Moving on to Financial Services, where adjusted net revenue of $24 million increased 264% year-over-year with new all-time high revenues for SoFi Money, which is now transitioning to SoFi checking and savings and continued strong contributions from SoFi Credit Card, SoFi Invest and Lending as a Service. Improved monetization and exponential growth in financial services products drove our performance. Annualized revenue per financial services product increased 73% year-over-year and the number of products grew 2.2x year-over-year to 4.7 million in Q1 ‘22. All products were up approximately 100% year-over-year and SoFi Credit card was up 500% year-over-year. We hit 1.6 million products in SoFi money, 1.8 million in SoFi Invest and 1.1 million in Relay. Contribution losses were $50 million for the quarter, which increased year-over-year, predominantly as a result of now having a credit card business and needing to build our CECL reserves, which is expected as we continue to grow in scale. As of the end of Q1, the reserves are in line with industry peers. Excluding these reserves, contribution losses were $36.5 million or up $1 million year-over-year. The next thing I want to address is our balance sheet. Overall, we are very well capitalized with ample cash and excess liquidity. The recent opening of SoFi Bank only reinforces the strength of our balance sheet and provides us with more flexibility and the ability to further lower our cost of capital. In Q1, our balance sheet grew by approximately $3 billion, and that was driven by three factors: first, cash equivalents and restricted cash increased by approximately $900 million, primarily as a result of an increase in pledge activity to capitalize the bank as well as increases in deposits at SoFi Bank, which totaled $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter. Second, loan balances grew approximately $1.2 billion as a result of holding loans for a slightly longer period of time. And third, we had a $900 million increase in goodwill and intangibles related to our acquisition of Technisys. We exited the quarter with $2.8 billion drawn on our warehouse facilities, which is approximately 40% of our overall $7 billion of capacity. Our current book value is $5.5 billion and our capital and leverage ratios are extremely strong, both at the bank and at the bank holding company level. Alright. I'll finish up with guidance. Throughout the last 12 months, we have demonstrated the benefit of having a diversified set of revenue streams and a keen focus on continuing to underwrite high-quality credit. We expect those benefits to persist going forward, particularly in light of the existing macro backdrop. For Q2, we expect another strong quarter of growth with $330 million to $340 million of adjusted net revenue up 39% to 43% year-over-year and expect $5 million to $15 million of adjusted EBITDA. For the full year of 2022, we are raising guidance and now expect to deliver $1.505 billion to $1.510 billion in adjusted net revenue, exceeding our recently provided full year guidance of $1.47 billion, and expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA of $100 million to $105 million above our recently provided guidance of $100 million. Overall, we couldn't be more proud of our Q1 results and continued progress. Having delivered nearly $1.3 billion of annualized revenue and our seventh consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA, we continue to make great progress against our long-term growth objectives in Q1 ‘22 and remain very well capitalized to continue pursuing our ultimate goal of making SoFi a top financial institution. With that, let's begin the Q&A. Yes. Thanks, Dan. What I would say is just echoing what Anthony said, our demographic credit profile of our member base is extremely strong, and we see that playing into our results. The weighted average income of our student loan refinancing borrowers is $170,000 with an average FICO of 775. The average income of our personal loan borrowers is $160,000 with an average FICO of 746. And then our overall credit profile and risk metrics are trending really well, both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. In terms of 90-day delinquencies, our PL 90-day delinquencies are at 14 basis points which is down year-over-year and sequentially. And our student loan refinancing delinquencies remained really healthy at just 5 basis points. And then from a charge-off perspective, those remain really healthy as well and are trending in the right direction with our personal loans annualized charge-offs at 1.04%. And student loan at 27 basis points. And the last thing I'd add is we have the most unique funding strategy and distribution strategy that makes a low-cost operator in lending. We built the business end-to-end on from metal to glass, but we've also built out diversified distribution of our loans. We can sell whole loans, which is a great diversified market for us. We can hold loans because we are a bank, we use deposits to fund them at a low cost, and we can access the ABS market if and when we think it's appropriate. And so we have a great competitive advantage in low cost but also an ability to get really strong premiums for the credit that Chris just described due to distribution have from our capital markets. Yes, absolutely. So we aren't providing specific segment level or product level detail, but to at least how folks think about the bridge from where we are to the $100 million and $105 million guide. I would think about it in two buckets. First, the bank is going to start contributing much more meaningfully in the back half of this year. But we're really proud to say that all new applications for our lending products are going through the bank end of a few weeks ago. Deposit growth is going extremely well. And as a result, we're going to start benefiting from a lower cost of capital, and we're going to start seeing the benefits play out of being able to hold loans for a longer period of time at scale in the back half of the year. And then the second thing, the second bucket is related to growth in some of our higher-margin businesses, specifically our personal loans business in [indiscernible]. So collectively, those are the main things that we bridge us from where we are today to the guide. Yes, I can take that one, John. So what I would say is that there are a few important things to note when thinking about the overall trends in gain on sale margins, especially on a quarter-to-quarter basis, and there are a number of factors that's been playing to that, most predominantly rates, spreads, and then obviously, the price that we're charging on the loans that we sell. In addition to those factors, it's really important to incorporate the impact of hedge gains and losses, which are critical, particularly in an environment that we're in right now. So in Q1, our gain on sale margins, excluding hedge gains, were 4.2% and they were north of 4.5% once you include hedges associated with loans sold in period. Our student loan refinancing business had gain on sale margin of 1.5%, excluding the hedge and north of 4% once you include hedges. And then our home loans business was negative 60 basis points, excluding the hedge and north of 2% once you include that. So they have been relatively consistent on a hedge ducted basis over the course of the last several quarters, and we expect them to be able to maintain that. The only other thing I would say as it relates to our lending business is that we obviously seek to maximize profit dollars in our lending business and stay within a 40% to 50% contribution margin range, and we obviously have a number of levers to do that. Despite the rapidly rising rate environment that we've been going through over the course of the last quarter plus, we were still able to deliver $133 billion of contribution dollars at a 54% margin across our entire portfolio, even as rates went up 80 to 150 basis points across the curve. Yes, absolutely. So, in terms of the overall macro expectations, we are assuming that rates will continue to increase what we have baked into our forward guidance is that we would have seven additional rate hikes between now and the end of the year. We have not given the specific numbers and specific KPIs. That's something we will evaluate over time. The only thing I said was that the weekly adds have doubled since we were payment to Q2 versus Q1. And on prior calls, we have seen a good ramp increase based on our strategic focus in the area by adding critical elements of value to the equation. But the checking and savings conversion in the highest sort of 1.25% have really taken to the next level. As I mentioned, it's – it's up 2.7x in Q2 versus Q1. And we have seen an increasing conversion of account funded to direct deposit of 60% with interest. Yes, I can take that one, Tim. So, what I would say is we saw really good momentum year-over-year, as you alluded to. Quarter-over-quarter, we saw a sequential growth in products of about 15%. Money and credit card combined delivered $10 million of revenue in the quarter that was up $2 million or 22% sequentially. That was primarily driven by interchange as well as some NIM our Lantern and Pagaya businesses combined or lending as a service delivered $8 million on the quarter. That was up $2 million sequentially or 30%. And then our invest business delivered $5 million of revenue. What I would say in terms of the forward outlook, again, we don't provide it at the product level, but we do expect to see continued strong momentum in growth in product count across all of the products as well as improvement in monetization. If you look at our annualized revenue per product in the financial services business, that was up 73% year-over-year. So, we have made really good improvements over the last several quarters and continuing to monetize those products and numbers, and we expect that to continue going forward. And the way that that's going to increase is through continuing to drive continuing to try and spend. We are seeing really good trends in that right now, especially opening the bank. And then obviously, launching new products and features like options that we expect to do by the end of this year. And there is one thing to remember, I think people know the just in case, we will have the bank for a full quarter in Q2, which will benefit that segment versus only one month in Q1. Yes. So, in terms of the trajectory, we are providing forward guidance on originations. But as you know, we saw a really good growth at 151% year-over-year, and we ended up exiting the quarter with about 5.5% market share when you look at the overall TAM of our credit bonds, and that's in comparison to about 4% in Q1 of 2021. So, we do expect to be able to continue gaining share over the course of 2022. And if rates continue to increase, we do expect the market to continue to expand. Yes. And then the one last thing to address your final question about passing rate increases through WAC, especially in the PL business, we have made really good progress on increasing pricing and demand has remained extremely robust as you saw in the quarter. Overall, on the balance sheet and through our originations in the quarter, we were successfully able to raise WAC both NPL and SLR. So, making really good progress there and it's showing up in the results. Yes. We are not providing specific guidance around 2023. At this point, we shared the quarterly impact on the SLR business and the result of the impact from the extension. But at this point, we are not prepared to talk about 2023."

            "name": "Anthony Noto",
            "content": "Thank you, Andrea and good afternoon everyone. I am incredibly proud of our first quarter performance given the resilience we have demonstrated to deliver the strong results we are reporting today and our positive trends thus far in the second quarter. A few of the key achievements in the quarter include another quarter of record adjusted net revenue with 49% year-over-year growth, our seventh consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA, continued strong growth in members, products and cross byline, the successful launch of SoFi Bank and our new SoFi checking and saves account offering, both of which are already contributing to our results. In announcing and closing the acquisition of Technisys to accelerate our innovation while also serving as a critical platform that accelerates our progress in building the AWS of fintech. The strength of our results achieved despite volatile markets and the changing political, fiscal and economic landscape also demonstrate how our strategy of building a full suite of differentiated products and services has actually created a uniquely diversified business that cannot only endure, but outperform across market cycles. Because of the depth and breadth of our offering, we are able to make swift and critical adjustments in priorities and spend as conditions evolve in order to capitalize on growth opportunities and exceed our performance targets. I am proud of how our team has successfully navigated each new challenge and opportunity. And in doing so, not only positioned SoFi for long-term sustainable success, but to be the company best positioned to be the winner that takes most in consumer fintech. Now, I will run through the highlights of the financial results for the quarter. We achieved record total adjusted net revenue of $322 million, up 49% year-over-year and 15% higher than the prior record set in Q4 2021. Strong growth in all three business segments drove these record results. Lending adjusted net revenue of $244 million increased 45% year-over-year and 17% sequentially despite the sixth extension of the moratorium on federal student loan payments, which has kept our student loan origination volumes at less than half of pre-pandemic levels. Financial Services adjusted net revenue of nearly $24 million increased 264% year-over-year with the largest contributions coming from record SoFi Money revenues and continued strength in SoFi Credit Card, SoFi Invest and Lending as a Service. Technology platform adjusted net revenue of nearly $61 million increased 32% with record Galileo revenues and a small contribution from our new Technisys multi-core technology business. Adjusted EBITDA of nearly $9 million increased 110% year-over-year and 89% sequentially. We are also very pleased with the member and product growth we achieved in the first quarter. We added 408,000 new members in Q1 ‘22, our third highest quarter of new member adds, ending with nearly 3.9 million total members, up 70% year-over-year. Notably, maintaining this growth momentum while opening a new bank was no small feat for our team. At a moment's notice, we had to navigate the operating and technological complexity of transitioning SoFi Money CMA accounts to the new SoFi checking and savings offering, which also required changes to our affiliate partners as well as our marketing and advertising campaigns creative and collateral. We added 689,000 new products in Q1 ‘22, our second highest quarter of new product adds ending with nearly 5.9 million total products and 84% annual increase. Financial Services products of $4.7 million at quarter end grew 155% year-over-year, while lending products of more than 1.1 million were up 20%. The significant scale that we now have in our SoFi Money, SoFi Invest, SoFi Credit card and relay member bases is driving even greater cross-buying. Our number of total cross-brought products in the quarter increased 22% year-over-year, demonstrating the continued success of our financial services productivity loop strategy. Our strong momentum in member, product and cross-buy growth also reflects the success we have achieved in building the SoFi brand over the last year. We committed to investing more in product and brand marketing once we reach the appropriate scale and unit economics last year. That investment is already paying off well beyond our expectations, and we're just getting started. We took a giant step forward in achieving our goal of becoming a household brand name via our SoFi Stadium affiliation, the success of our integrated multimedia campaigns and the virality of the influencers we partner with. Our marketing team worked with 30 content creators across TikTok, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube, with a combined reach of more than 300 million throughout the NFL season and the post season. Their efforts amplified the branding of SoFi and SoFi Stadium and together drove more than 270 million impressions. Our unaided brand awareness, which had already increased more than 70% throughout 2021 more than doubled on Super Bowl weekend to an all-time high. We generated the highest SoFi related search by of all time on game day with nearly 230,000 and the most new visitors to our site since the mean stock raise in January of ‘21. And even without an ad, SoFi had nearly 5x more online searches than the top-performing Super Bowl ad that air. Now I'd like to discuss how our strategy to build the only vertically integrated one-stop shop for digital financial services has resulted in a uniquely diversified business model. In lending, we originated a record of more than $2 billion in personal loans in Q1 2022, up from $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021 and $1.3 billion in Q1 of 2021. Our results reflect years of investing to maintain an attractive credit profile and increasing our ability to capture more share of the $1 trillion market. Our personal loan performance more than offset the continued lack of demand in student loan refinancing and the underperformance of home loans as we transition and onboard new fulfillment partners. We are also seeing the benefit of our ongoing investment to build and maintain a robust risk management framework in the current rising rate environment. We are constantly iterating, learning and iterating some more while using data that goes well beyond traditional industry-specific underwriting data to drive the innovation in our credit underwriting models. We're also increasingly leveraging machine learning tools to improve the member experience throughout the funnel from application to income verification to approval. Because of these disciplines, our personal loan delinquencies and life of loan losses remain at record lows, even as we hit new origination records, while demand to buy SoFi's personal loans has remained robust. The profile of our borrower is very attractive to loan buyers. Our personal loan borrowers' weighted average income is $160,000 with a weighted average FICO score of 746. While our student loan borrowers weighted average income is $170,000 with a weighted average FICO score of 775. Let me say those numbers again, given how impressive they are. Our personal loan borrowers' weighted average income is $160,000 with a weighted average FICO score of 746. While our student loan borrowers weighted average income is $170,000 and weighted average FICO score of 775. We are also differentiated in lending by the strength of our balance sheet and the diversification of our funding sources. Today, we have $5.5 billion of book equity on our balance sheet and about $7 billion in warehouse facilities we can access to fund loans. Not to mention the more than $1.5 billion currently and SoFi's checking and saving deposits we've raised so far at SoFi's Bank, which are growing by $100 million weekly. As we scale the bank, we are gaining even more flexibility in lending. We are already achieving savings by using our own deposits rather than warehouse facilities to fund loans. We've just started moving towards holding loans 6 months on average versus 3, which allows us to collect more net interest income. This also creates a more rational pricing environment for our paper as we leverage our ability to hold loans for longer should pricing not be acceptable. And we can now introduce new loan types and pricing models that improve our competitive positioning. In Financial Services, we have continued to achieve strong member and product growth by iterating on our products to ensure they are differentiated by 4 key factors: fast, selection, content and convenience, and continuing to invest to make them work better when they're used together. We finished the first quarter with 4.7 million total financial services products, a 111% annual increase and more than 4x our total lending products of 1.1 million. The more scale in financial services products creates even more scale and cross-buying and thus, large marketing efficiencies. Just 1 year ago, that ratio was 2.4:1, and 2 years ago, lending products actually outnumbered financial services products by a factor of 1.6:1. Members have embraced the product launches and financial services introduced in the first quarter. We launched margin lending and SoFi Invest, which is one of the most common member requests. Another common to request is extended hours trading, which we will launch in the coming weeks and options, which we are targeting introducing by year-end. We introduced no fee crypto transactions for SoFi Money members that do direct deposit, and we are assessing other possible crypto products to provide even more value to our members. Last but certainly not least, SoFi's Checking and savings provides an unmatched value proposition through an industry-leading API of up to 1.25%, a host of free features and a unique rewards program. The strategy is paying off as we've seen strong growth in direct deposit accounts and spending, while deposits have accelerated further since we announced the API increase of 25 basis points last month. Transitioning now to our technology platform, which remains a critical element of SoFi's strategy, allowing us to innovate at a rapid pace while providing diversified high-return revenue streams and an efficient cost structure, already a market leader among U.S. based neobanks, Galileo continues to expand its client base to include B2B and enterprise clients as adoption of modern cloud-based digital payments and banking has opened up new verticals and client types, use cases and opportunities. For example, we launched two new clients in the first quarter that offer innovative working capital models for B2B and small- to medium-sized businesses. Technology platform enabled clients accounts increased 58% year-over-year in the first quarter to $110 million through new client acquisition and growth from existing clients. The large installed customer bases of Galileo clients also provide unique growth opportunities for existing capabilities like instant provisioning, dynamic fraud engine and 2-day early paycheck as well as financial and engagement products in our pipeline that can drive greater customer activity like instant funding and direct deposit switching. Our March acquisition of Technisys further differentiates our technology platform by allowing us to incorporate a next-generation multiproduct core banking technology into our lending and financial services platforms and it enhances our value proposition for Galileo clients. This type of vertical integration enables faster innovation and growth as well as greater operating efficiencies. Technisys also brings a complementary footprint of established banks, digital banks and fintechs in Latin America, adding to the robust growth opportunity of Galileo's existing presence in Mexico and Colombia. Galileo and Technisys are already going to market together to offer new products and services to the Galileo clients looking to expand their lineup. Early reception among existing Galileo and Technisys clients in the U.S. and LatAm has been very positive. I'll finish here by saying that we have been in an all-out sprint over the last 4 years to build out our digital product suite to meet our members' needs for every major functional decision in their lives and all the days in between. The benefits of our strategy to build a uniquely diversified business, combined with the national banking license, not only positions SoFi to be the winner takes most in the sector transition of financial services to digital, but also provide greater durability through a market cycle. I am excited about where we are today and where we can go from here. With that, let me turn over to Chris for a review of the financials for the quarter. Hi, Dan. Thanks, Dan. I'll start and hand it over to Chris to talk about the demographics and the credit profile of our members. I would say the basis between SoFi and all the other call it, FinTech 2.0 companies moving Square and PayPal out of that equation, so more recently public companies. The biggest overage is we're building a one-stop shop with a broad suite of digital financial products for our members. We're trying to build a lifetime relationship with them to be there for everyone of the major funds decision their lives and all the days in between. And we're doing that through a vertical integrated model so that we have best-of-breed products from a consumer standpoint, but also best of breed unit economics, and that will allow us to have a competitive advantage. And as we build that vertical integration, we're building technologies that we're turning into businesses as we have with Galileo and Technisys, and that results from a financial standpoint with a highly diversified business. Within our Lending segment, we have four different types of loans. We're not just in personal loans or also in steel refinancing or in-school loans and in mortgages. Within the technology platform, there is two primary businesses there, but there is more to be additive Technisys and Galileo, and they are incredibly complementary. It's a very high-margin business, accelerates our rate of innovation, giving us a low-cost advantage and giving us a return on our own technology development and lifting the all goes for the industry. And in our third segment, the Financial Services segment is highly diversified with SoFi checking and savings, SoFi Invest, even within SoFi Invest, we're not just in crypto, we're not just in single stocks, we're also ETFs are also in down, and then we have a credit card, which, over time, will build out that portfolio. We have one today. We also do insurance as a regeneration business we have the related businesses. So we're very diversified. And one of the biggest reasons why we've been able to navigate the challenges of the last 4 years, and there have been multiple of challenges every year, whether it's economic or industry-related or credit related is because we have that diversification and can reallocate our resources toward the best growth opportunities are, and that's why we continue to deliver record revenues despite the negative impact on the still in moratorium. The last big thing I'd mention, and Chris will give you the details is we're going after a high-end customer, mass-affluent, high net wealth individuals to have a great credit profile, high income, and they need the products and services that we develop and most of the big banks have walked away from that price we have products. They don't offer mortgages. They are not in brokerage or they don't have personal financial management where they don't have curies. And so that results in us having a pretty diversified business. We've been EBITDA profitable for the last seven quarters, and we're on our way to being GAAP profitable and we're generating positive cash flow reporting EBITDA less CapEx and building our book value. And we have substantial book value. But that's been sort of the biggest point to describe how we're positioned. I will have Chris give you the details on our income and our credit profile. Thank you, Dan. Thank you, John. One of the key strategies of having the bank license and being able to offer a super differentiated checking and saving accounts. When we originally launched SoFi Money, we were not a bank back in 2019, and we were sort of be holding the interest rate that we could get from suite partners. But now as a bank, we could provide – we can offer the interest rate that we think is most attractive. And currently, we're offering up to 1.25% on checking if you do direct deposit with us and get a host of other benefits as a member and other benefits in that account be charging the fees. We do free roundups, you have overdraft protection, you get a free certified financial planner, our relationship in addition to all the breakthrough get on other loans, etcetera. We've seen tremendous uptake of that product since we launched it. I will say, and as in my prepared remarks, it is incredibly challenging waiting for the Federal Reserve and OCC to give us the final approval, if it wasn't clear when they are going to do it or if they were going to do it given the political environment we're in. And so we were sitting ready with marketing and collateral and plans and technology and operations, ready to flip the switch. But once we did that, it took a while to get things rolling in Q1, and we came out of Q1 and Q2 really seeing the benefits. Our direct deposit uptake is up 60% on a conversion basis and the number of direct deposit accounts added per week has doubled in Q2 versus Q1. And as Chris mentioned, we're up to over $1.5 billion of deposits, and it's growing about $100 million of deposits per week, and the feedback from an NPS for basis is really strong. So we couldn't be happier with that competitive advantage that we now have. As we bring people into the top of the funnel, it increased the amount of cross-buying we have, as you know like a personal loan product we doubled our variable profit per loan [indiscernible] invest into that and money is really one of the faster products we think to start with as you [indiscernible]. And our customer addition costs there are very attractive and we're actually leading and even more because the LTV is putting out to be even higher than we thought based on early indications. So really happy with that product. The second thing I'd say is it took a mile dip in the back of the bank and go through the process. And there are plans that we have specifically like the checking same account and funding our new loans in the bank. But there are other opportunities to now is coming to life, such as having a sponsored in business that we can partner with Galileo on. They have B2B partners out there adding. There is a lot of them in the EUV channel. Well, we can be a sponsor bank in B2B. And so that's the new revenue stream that we're working on with the regulators to launch and with our partners there. So there is a number of other things that will come down the pipeline as a result of having the bank has weren't contemplated until we actually got the license. And one of the other things I would just add, John, the benefit of those that closed the company back in ‘18 and ‘19. When we joined in 2018, Michelle and I were looking at 4 to 5 rate increases throughout ‘18 and ‘19. And we rapidly developed a strategy of being able to test six different 6x6 grid simultaneous in the marketplace. And at that time, the company really had the ability to test two prices. We spent the better part of 2018 not just testing all these different prices of building that capability, but also understanding the unit economics by marketing channel and just an add over time. So the level of sophistication we have in marketing pricing and credit is really built over the last 4 years. So as rates are going up, even though our funding costs are going down, we are being prudent about making sure we have the right price for the right credit through constantly testing and also leveraging different channels that we now have certain types of loan losses and quality performance. In addition to that, we have an early warning framework that our risk team has built out that we actually executed at the beginning of 2020 to be in a pandemic to make sure that we're in a position to be able to pull back as economic conditions start to provide main indicators that are at risk. So we're playing on both ends of the spectrum offensively with pricing and channels and then if the market turns over in some way, that's not what was predicted. We can also put it back the other way. You are welcome. The answer is yes. And it's been like that every quarter since we launched the business. We do an annual planning process that starts in the fall or sets the priorities for the company for the following year. We did that in September and October when we had our six priorities. The team then does their bottoms that financial plans against those six priorities and then we start the year. Around mid-February, we start what's called a large revised forecast, which will be a revision of the plan based on everything we've learned. And so, all the market conditions that change from December, January, February and the performance of our business get factored into that realized forecast. We put through that same process every quarter. That's what allows us to assess where are things going well, there are things more challenging than we thought, how do we reallocate our resources against that umbrellas priorities to deliver the results. So – and we do a weekly latest call process as well, evaluating all the integrated details across all our funnels and our products and our financial performance so when we go into that revised forecast, we are not starting from scratch, we have built it on the back of 7 or 8 weeks of actual results in the quarter and what we are seeing in forward curves and the competitive environment, etcetera. So it's a constant process. And when you have the diverse set of bits that we have, it gives you lot of advantages and they are not stuck in one on silo. I am not going to give you the specifics, because it's multifaceted. But obviously, the personal loan business did much better. We saw that opportunity and we leaned into it. Student loan business got negatively impacted by the President's unexpected extensive moratorium. We have pulled back significantly in the marketing there and reallocated it. In fact, we are starting to reallocate more aggressively to things like checking savings because we are seeing the flow-through to the loans and higher LTV justifying more investment there. So, it's a constant data-driven process. Yes. Absolutely. I will try to give a broader perspective on this to educate those that may not be aware. So, prior to the pandemic, our student loan refinancing business had an average loan size of about $70,000. So, the average loan that was being refinanced was $70,000. And we are doing over $2 billion of quarterly re-financings. Since then, we have operated at 50% or below other than the fourth quarter when people have thought that more term was going to end in January, and we saw a big surge in late November and December. So, about $70,000, the demographics, Chris mentioned have generally been the same. What people should understand is any one is already refinanced with us would not be eligible for a Federal student loan forgiveness because they now have private loans. The Federal student loan forgiveness that's been talked about has ranged from $10,000 for everybody. The $10,000 for those that weren't economically below a certain income class to $50,000 for everybody, with the present buying campaign behind was $10,000 of forgiveness for those that had a need hit and quantify it. What has been talked about more recently, the President said I am not interested in $50,000 if you give us per person and his point and his advisors are pointing more towards $10,000 of forgiveness below a certain economic level. There is a lot of debates on an economic level for everything for $75,000 of income to $125,000 of income. The best thing for SoFi and for SoFi shareholders in our business is if he announces – the best thing is he had the more return than we just move on. But that's unlikely, what's more likely is some of them would forgive us. If there is some level of forgiveness, $10,000 and below, I think it would be great for our business. Now you may say, that applies to everybody, even if it applies to everybody. There is a cohort of people that have been waiting and waiting and waiting for student loan forgiveness and they have not refinanced. And that's in our demographic as well. Once there actually is forgiveness, there is nothing to wait for anymore. You now know what the plan is, and you have to make a decision. Well, if you had $70,000 loans, which is our target market, and you get $10,000 forgiveness, you are still refinancing $60,000, but the number of people that we will be refinancing will be magnitudes greater than it was in the past because there is really no reason to wait any longer, especially with rates going up, I mean there is likely not going to be a second wave or forgiveness. The area where there is $10,000 forgiveness for people the $125,000 is really advantageous to us given the demographics that we set at a weighted average income of $170,000. And so that's the way I would think about it. In terms of our financial guidance, we have assumed that the more time will extend all the way through 2022. So, our guidance that Chris mentioned of $1.505 billion to $1.510 billion is an assumption that the still business does not recover. In fact, it continues to be relatively depressed and exceeding even more. Yes. We do have an opportunity to significantly improve the value proposition to our members at home loans and our execution on the operational side. The execution on the operational side is what's holding us back. We are – we have moved from the existing partner to one entirely new partner. In doing that move, things having preceded as fast as we would have liked, which is a great highlight for how the diversification of our business allows us to overcome something that's underperformed. And so two things have happened in the home loan business. One, we have moved to that new partner and there is growing pains and execution pain there. At the same time, the team has had the additional challenge of the mix of home loans moving from refinancing more towards purchase. Purchase is a different operational process, as you can imagine. And it's really critical in those scenarios that you hit closing dates, etcetera. And so we are erring on the side of trying to provide the best level of service we can. And so we really haven't stepped on the gas pedal as it relates to driving top of the final demand, because we want to make sure we can get the backlog of loans that we have in the system, especially in purchase through the system successfully. There are definitely challenges there, and we underperformed in the quarter. I am confident the team has the right plan and will work its way out throughout the course of the year. It's a product our members at still 60% of the home loans we do are or more from existing members. It's one of the most important financial decisions they will make. It's one of the probably biggest emotional decision in that building, and we need to be there for them to give them a great product and a great service and it is still a huge opportunity for us given how few loans we have done for our members and the magnitude of the user base that we now have, not to mention selling share from as the first product. Thank you. Yes. We are assuming that the inflationary environment space so much where it is today, we are not assuming a recession. We do have early warning frameworks that will allow us to get in front of some type of deterioration in the economy that's of the magnitude that would have an impact on life loan losses. We have been doing this for a couple of years way through the cycle forward. And so we will be vigilant on that front. But right now, those indicators are showing relatively strong demand and a relatively stable economic environment. And as Chris mentioned, the performance of our credit has been quite positive. Thank you. So, our product at Galileo, the platform lends itself not just to consumer-driven and Galileo has been a leader in the B2C space and neobanks since its inception. Since we bought it, we have seen an increasingly amount of demand in enterprise space. The number two partner within Galileo, which has been number two for years, is actually enterprise customer and not a consumer customer. So, it has that flexibility. And so we have signed a number of enterprise partners, some of which that is for accounts payable, accounts receivable payments and working capital in addition to other types of businesses that are in the fee economy. So, we are not naming specific names. We will announce those in conjunction with our partners as opposed to during our earnings call, but that's increasingly a big channel for us, and we have a product pipeline to better serve the enterprise and SMB space holistically based on the demand we are seeing. Yes. On the personal loans side, I will let Chris talk about the outlook. In terms of driving demand, I noted a couple of macro things and the things that we are doing on the macro side. As interest rates go higher, we saw this in ‘18 and ‘19, we see people refinancing at a variable rate debt, like credit card debt and other high rate variable debt into fixed rate and term loan debt. And so our product is really conducive to doing that, and we capture that demand. Additionally, as rates go higher, if you go back and look at our advertise in 2018 and ‘19, you will see we had a use case advertising behind home improvement. So, as interest rates go higher and individuals look to remodel their homes instead of buying new homes on that product also benefits. One of the things that you can do now that we weren't that able to do in 2018 and ‘19 as we can market the product to our existing customers. And when we were going public, we provided a presentation that showed you the percent of our loans that were cross bought, and it's averaging the 20% to 30% range. And so as the business has grown, it stayed in that range, and that's a really efficient way for us to market to our customers. And so we will be leveraging that through this environment as well. In terms of the trajectory of any outer quarters, I will let Chris talk to that. And the other thing I would just mention on the marketing side, we can afford to be a little bit more aggressive on the marketing front and open the after a little bit because of our decline monetization strategy. This is a product where we are proving 30% of the applicants. Previously, the other 70% were sort of lost and so we launched Lantern and now we are leading as a service that we have in our own application process. And so we can be a little bit more aggressive on marketing and drive return against that because our declines to be monetized in those two ways. So, the one thing I will say is, as the business comes back or if it doesn't, as we exit 2022, we will go back towards the 30% incremental EBITDA margin philosophy. And the reason why I am emphasizing that is there is a lot of different ways to think about shareholder value creation. We believe return on invested capital is the most highly correlated metric with shareholder value creation. I think it's better than ROE. We will look at both for us to get to the return invested capital that we think we can achieve in our mix of businesses. that's in the 30%-plus range. We have to have a 30% EBITDA margin and both capital utilization, as we say on the CapEx side of the equation, which generates great closure from EBITDA to free cash flow, which is then to build our book value. And so as we exit turning to with or without student loans, will be back to a 30% incremental EBITDA margin. If we have the benefit of the student loan business, that would just be more incremental revenue and more incremental EBITDA at the 30% rate. Thank you all. Thank you for everyone for joining us this afternoon or evening where you are. Before we wrap, I wanted to share some final thoughts. At SoFi, we are no stranger to adversity. As we near the halfway point of 2022, there is no shortage of challenges ahead, but there has been no shortage of challenges every year since we joined back in February of 2018. And with each set of unique challenges we have written to case each time. I cannot predict the future, but I can assure you that we have the best strategy in the most diversified set of businesses that have delivered superior consistent financial performance that generating both high-growth in revenue and strong profits as measured by EBITDA. We also have significant financial resources with more than $5 billion in capital and a battle-tested team. Most importantly, I can assure you that we will work tirelessly to be prepared as best we can wherever we face ahead, just as we have over the last 4 years. I love our team. I love our strategy. I love our company, and I love where I work. I wake up every day, and try to be a better leader than the day before and reminding myself that those who are in. Until we talk next time, thank you for your interest in SoFi, and thank you for your support."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SoFi Technologies Q4 2023 and Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. With that, you may begin your conference.\nMaura Cyr: Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to SoFi's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me today to talk about our results and recent events are Anthony Noto, CEO; and Christopher Lapointe, CFO. You can find the presentation accompanying our earnings release on the Investor Relations section of our website. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations and forecasts, and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include, but are not limited to, our competitive advantage and strategy, macroeconomic conditions and outlook, future products and services, and future business and financial performance. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are described in today's press release and our subsequent filings made with the SEC, including our upcoming Form 10-K. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Anthony.\nAnthony Noto: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. 2023 was a remarkable year for SoFi. We achieved multiple records and realized many of our aspirations despite seismic geopolitical and macroeconomic events. We demonstrated that we have built a business to thrive in a host of challenging environments, reacting swiftly to change, driving our business forward with standout financial performance, while continuing to serve our member's needs. Our 2023 results have reinforced my conviction in our long-term potential and our ability to achieve our aspiration to become a top 10 financial institution. I'd like to highlight some of our notable achievements for the year. We reached GAAP net income profitability in the fourth quarter and are positioned to continue to drive positive GAAP net income in 2024. We grew adjusted net revenue by 35% for the year to a record of $2.1 billion, while adjusted EBITDA of $432 million increased 200% versus 2022. This represents a 54% incremental margin and a 21% consolidated EBITDA margin for the full year compared to our long-term margin target of 30%, which we achieved in the fourth quarter of 2023. Total members and products, both grew over 40%, with 2.3 million new members in 2023 for a total of 7.5 million members and we added 3.2 million new products for a total of 11 million products at year end. We continue to diversify our revenue with Financial Services and the Tech Platform contributing 40% of four quarter adjusted net revenue up from 34% in the year ago quarter. Our Financial Services segment achieved positive contribution profit in the third quarter, which ramped further in the fourth quarter. We completed a dramatic shift in Tech Platform's product offering and focus, positioning us to capture the massive opportunity in the traditional banking sector in addition to tech and consumer companies looking to provide financial services. In Lending, 72% of adjusted net revenue was from net interest income compared to 48% in fiscal year '22. Net interest income offers a more recurring and predictable cash revenue stream to compared to non-interest income. We generated $334 million in tangible book value growth, which is now set to accelerate in 2024. Total deposits grew by $11.3 billion in 2023 to $18.6 billion and over 90% of our consumer deposits are from direct deposit members. SoFi Bank reported net income of nearly $350 million, a 21% margin with a return on tangible equity of 15.9% in its first full year of formation. To put some of these achievements in the context of a longer-term perspective, I'll note the following: When comparing our business to fiscal year 2018, which is when I joined SoFi and we embarked on our new strategy, we have grown annual adjusted net revenue by more than 8x, annual EBITDA by almost 3x or $660 million, members by more than 11x, total products by 16x, and consolidated net interest income by nearly 5x. And since adding several Financial Services products in 2019, we have grown annual Financial Services revenue to more than $430 million, Financial Services products to $9.5 million in total, and Financial Services products now comprise 85% of our total products. The fourth quarter really capped an exceptional year. Record adjusted net revenue of $594 million accelerated to 34% year-over-year growth, while record adjusted EBITDA of $181 million to 159% with a 30% consolidated EBITDA margin. This EBITDA margin is up 14 percentage points year-over-year and is now equal to our long-term target of 30%. Financial Services segment contribution profit grew to $25 million, an 18% margin versus $3.3 million last quarter and the negative $44 million in the year ago quarter. Our deposits grew by a record of nearly $3 billion in the quarter. Tech Platform segment revenue growth accelerated to 13% year-over-year and it's way to 20% in next year with a 32% contribution margin versus 20% in the year ago quarter. In Lending, 76% of adjusted net revenue was net interest income up 43% year-over-year to $263 million. We point this out because $263 million in cash revenue is 2x greater than our directly attributable segment expenses of $120 million. Segment contribution margin improved by over 500 basis points sequentially to 65%. Company consolidated GAAP earnings per share was $0.02, with GAAP net income totaling $48 million versus a $40 million loss in the year ago quarter. SoFi bank's net income of $129 million represents a 27% margin, an annualized return on equity of 16.8%. In terms of our balance sheet, we grew tangible book value for the sixth consecutive quarter by $204 million at the consolidated level, reaching $3.5 billion in total. Our total capital ratio improved to 15.3% from 14.5% last quarter, helped by organic tangible book growth, over $1billion in loan sales, capital optimization moves, and an opportunistic convertible debt repurchase of $72 million. From a member and product perspective, in the fourth quarter we added 585,000 new members for a total of over $7.5 million members and 695,000 new products for a total of over 11 million products. Now I'd like to spend some time touching on quarterly segment level results. Lending adjusted net revenue of $347 million grew 10% year-over-year, again, it's a difficult comparison of 51% year-over-year growth in the year ago quarter. Personal loan originations grew 31% year-over-year to $3.2 billion, student loan originations grew 95% year-over-year to $790 million, and home loan originations increased 193% year-over-year to $309 million. Within the Financial Services, net revenue grew 115% year-over-year and 18% sequentially to $139 million, driven by continued strong monetization within the segment. We achieved $25 million in contribution profit, despite our significant investment across Money, Credit Card, and Invest. As we noted last quarter, the Credit Card and Invest businesses are still in heavy investment mode with losses of over $100 million annually on a run rate basis. Through unit economic optimization and greater scale, these businesses will eventually see positive contribution profit, similar to how we delivered with SoFi Money. We continue to see strong growth in SoFi Money products, and importantly, high quality deposits and great levels of engagement. This has led to higher average account balances, even as average spend has increased. SoFi Money products have increased 54% year-over-year or by nearly 1.2 million to 3.4 million accounts. As important is the quality of these members with a median FICO of 744 for our direct deposit portfolio, and hence we see ample opportunity for cross-buy. In terms of engagement, over 50% of our newly funded SoFi Money accounts are setting up direct deposit by day 30. This account primacy drive spending, which exceeded $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter, debit transactions of volume. This is up nearly 3x year-over-year and represents more than $6 billion of annualized debit transaction volume. Our Invest products excluding crypto from all periods grew 20% year-over-year to a total of $2.1 million with AUM increasing 54% year-over-year. We've continued to launch exciting new products that meet our members needs in Financial Services to further accelerate new member growth and cross-buy. Just today for instance, we announced the launch of alternative investments and mutual funds. With the launch of alts SoFi is granting yet another opportunity for everyday investors to access, invest in opportunities, traditionally reserved for institutional investors and the ultra-wealthy. For our Tech Platform, revenue of $97 million accelerated to 13% growth year-over-year, are from 6% in Q3. We continue to make significant strides in our strategy of leveraging, our unique product suite to pursue diversified growth and larger, more durable revenue opportunities. We start to see evidence of this strategy in the fourth quarter, as growth was driven not just by continued strong organic growth with existing partners and new product adoption by them, but also by notable contributions from increasingly diversified clients, which have launched within the last six months. As mentioned last quarter, demand from traditional financial institutions and non-financial categories remained strong. While lead times for winning RFPs and ensuing integrations are measured in many quarters, not months, the transition to modern processing and modern cores is playing out in real-time, the way we envisioned it. On the product side, we continue to build and ship a diverse range of products for multiple sectors. Most notably, we launched an expense management solution in partnership with Mastercard that provides clients in the B2B sector with insights into corporate card spend. We launched same-day ACH (ph), which allows account holders faster access to funds and helps mitigate risk tied to transactional delays. And we launched a risk data mark and data pipeline for our Payments Risk Platform, which is seeing rapid adoption from existing clients. With that, let me turn it over to Chris, who will review of the financials for the quarter and our 2024 outlook. I'll return to review our multi-year outlook after Chris shares his thoughts.\nChristopher Lapointe: Thanks, Anthony. The Q4 and full year 2023 results really proved once again that our diversified and differentiated business model drives SoFi's durability and long-term growth potential. I'm going to walk through key financial highlights in our financial outlook. Unless otherwise stated, I'll be referring to adjusted results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 versus fourth quarter and full year of 2022. Our GAAP consolidated income statement and all reconciliations can be found in today's earnings release and the subsequent 10-K filing, which will be made available next month. For the quarter, we delivered record adjusted net revenue of $594 million with growth accelerating to 34% year-over-year and 12% sequentially from the third quarter's record of $531 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $181 million at a 30% margin, which is our long-term target margin up over 80% from the prior record quarter of $98 million. This represented over 14 percentage points of year-over-year margin improvement and 12 percentage points of sequential margin improvement, demonstrating significant operating leverage across all functional expense lines. In fact, sales and marketing declined as a percentage of adjusted net revenue for the fifth consecutive quarter. Total operating expenses declined roughly 17 points as a percentage of adjusted net revenue year-over-year. Overall, this resulted in a 74% incremental adjusted EBITDA margin year-over-year. We achieved GAAP profitability this quarter for the first time, with GAAP net income reaching $48 million, an $88 million improvement year-over-year, and an incremental margin of 55%. We saw continued year-over-year leverage in stock-based compensation, dropping to 12% of adjusted net revenue versus 16% in the prior year period on our path to our longer-term goal of single digit stock based compensation margins. For the full year, we delivered $2.1 billion of adjusted net revenue, up 35% year-over-year from $1.5 billion in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA rose 201% year-over-year to $432 million at a 21% adjusted EBITDA margin. Our full year net loss was $54 million and $0.10 per share, excluding the goodwill impairment charge taken in Q3. We exceeded the high end of our most recent revenue and EBITDA guidance by $9 million and $36 million, respectively, by leveraging our unique suite of products and services, nimble asset and resource allocation, as well as a relentless focus on unit economics and risk management. Now on to the segment level performance. In Lending, fourth quarter adjusted net revenue grew 10% year-over-year to $347 million with $226 million of contribution profit at a 65% margin, up from $209 million a year ago. These results were driven by 43% year-over-year growth in our net interest income, while non-interest income was down by 36%, primarily driven by increased losses and pre-payments. Growth in net interest income was driven by an 82% year-over-year increase in average interest earning assets and 122 basis point year-over-year increase in average yields. This resulted in an average net interest margin of 6.02% for the quarter, up 3 basis points sequentially and 8 basis points year-over-year. I'd also highlight our $2.9 billion of deposit growth in the quarter compared to the $1.6 billion of net loan growth on the balance sheet. The 218 basis points of cost savings between our deposits and our warehouse facilities has resulted in a meaningful benefit to our net interest margin. It also underscores the benefits of having the option of holding loans on balance sheet, when advantageous in collecting net interest income. We expect to maintain a healthy net interest margin and benefit from the continued mix toward deposit funding along with our demonstrated high loan WAC betas. On the non-interest income side, Q4 originations grew 45% year-over-year to $4.3 billion and were driven by growth across all three products, even as we continue tightening and underwriting against our stringent credit standards. We saw typical seasonality and intentionally planned for lower originations in our personal loans business, with originations of $3.2 billion, up 31% year-over-year and down 17% sequentially. Our student loans business saw origination volume nearly double year-over-year and declined 14% sequentially to $790 million. Home loans grew by 193% year-over-year and declined 13% sequentially to $309 million. Our personal loan borrowers weighted average income is $171,000 with a weighted average FICO score of 744. Our student loan borrowers weighted average income is $154,000 with a weighted average FICO of 781. Our Q4 on-balance sheet delinquency rates and charge-off rates continue as anticipated to normalize back toward pre-COVID levels. Our on-balance sheet 90-day personal loan delinquency rate was 56 basis points, while our annualized personal loan charge-off rate was 4.0%. Our on-balance sheet 90-day student loan delinquency rate was 13 basis points, while our annualized student loan charge-off rate was 59 basis points. We continue to expect healthy performance relative to broader industry levels. In the fourth quarter, we sold portions of our personal loan and home loan portfolios, totaling $1.2 billion, approximately $875 million in personal loans principal and $350 million in home loan principal. In terms of the personal loan sales, we closed a previously disclosed $375 million securitization with BlackRock, where we sold both bonds and the resid (ph) at an execution level of 105.1% enclosed an additional $500 million of loans in whole loan form to multiple parties at a blended execution of 105.6%. These had similar structures to other recent personal loan sales with cash proceeds at par or at a premium to par, and the majority of the premium comprised of the contractual servicing fees that are capitalized. These deals included a small loss share provision that is above our base assumption of losses and immaterial relative to the exposure we would otherwise have had if we held the loans. In the quarter, we executed $415 million of senior secured financing, which will show up on our detailed balance sheet as senior secured loans held for investment at amortized costs. These loans have a fixed term structure and are secured against the underlying assets, therefore equivalent to investment grade bonds if you were to do a securitization for the same pool of collateral. In addition, these loans are priced at market rates, which not only helps to diversify our balance sheet, but also provides an additional return above our cost of funding and a yield similar to the net interest margin of our loans, which are unsecured. Now turning to our fair value marks and key assumptions. Our personal loans are marked at 104.9% as of the year end, up from 104.0% at the end of Q3. This was a function of the discount rate decreasing by 103 basis points, which was driven by the underlying benchmark rate declining by 90 basis points and spreads tightening by 13 basis points. Notably, the benchmark rate change and the spread change are empirical as they are actual market observed inputs, not assumptions. Partially offsetting the decrease in discount rate was an increase in the annual default rate assumption from 4.6% to 4.8%, as well as an increase in the annual prepayment speed assumptions from 20% to 23%, which has an immaterial impact on the overall change in the mark. When a borrower prepays, we are still capturing the principal and the impact to the value of the assets is only based on the premium above par at a given point in time, which is very small relative to the principal outstanding. We expect default rates to continue to normalize to pre-COVID life of loan loss levels of approximately 7% to 8%. For our student loan portfolio, the fair value mark at year end increased to 103.8% versus 101.5% at the end of Q3. This was a function of the portfolio WAC increasing by 24 basis points and the discount rate decreasing by 57 basis points driven by the underlying benchmark rate declining by 86 basis points and spreads widening by 29 basis points. Partially offsetting the decrease in discount rate was an increase in the annual default rate assumption from 0.5% to 0.6%. Importantly, the fair value benefits resulting from interest rate decreases as well as personal loan spread tightening was offset nearly one for one by hedge losses and spread widening in our SLR business. So there was no net revenue benefit in the quarter due to discount rate input changes. For the full year lending adjusted net revenue grew 21% to $1.3 billion and the segment delivered $823 million of contribution profit at a 62% margin. Moving on to Financial Services, where net revenue of $139 million increased 115% year-over-year with new all-time high revenue for SoFi Money, Credit Card and lending as a service, as well as continued contributions from SoFi Invest. Overall monetization continues to improve with annualized revenue per product of $59, up nearly 50% year-over-year versus $40 in Q4 2022 and up 10% sequentially. This is driven by higher deposits and member spending levels in SoFi Money, greater AUM and monetizable features in SoFi Invest and robust growth within SoFi Credit Card spend. We reached 9.5 million Financial Services products in the quarter, which is up 45% year-over-year with 626,000 new products in the quarter. We reached nearly 3.4 million products in SoFi Money, 2.4 million in SoFi Invest, and 3.3 million in Relay. Contribution profit reached $25 million for the quarter even as we continue to invest aggressively against the ample opportunities to rapidly grow this operating segment with attractive returns. Full year segment revenue of $437 million is 2.6 times the $168 million we delivered in 2022 and we broke even on a contribution basis for the full year. Shifting to our Tech platform, where we delivered record net revenue of $97 million in the quarter, up 13% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. Annual revenue growth was driven by continued monetization of existing clients along with new deals signed in new client segments. Galileo accounts grew 11% year-over year to $145 million. The segment delivered a contribution profit of $31 million, representing a 32% margin. We continue to leverage investments made to integrate Galileo and Technisys and position the segment for higher rates of diversified, durable growth going forward. We expect Tech platform revenue to continue accelerating in 2024, with strong margins. For the full year, the Tech platform segment grew revenue 12% to $352 million and delivered $95 million of contribution profit at a 27% margin. Switching to our balance sheet, where we remain very well capitalized with ample cash and liquidity. In Q4 assets grew by $2.1 billion as a result of $1.6 billion growth in loans and approximately $400 million of growth in cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities. On the liability side, deposits grew by $2.9 billion sequentially to $18.6 billion. Importantly, deposit growth outpaced net loan growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. As a result, we were able to reduce warehouse facilities utilized by over $700 million, resulting in more efficient funding costs as we continue to ramp the portion of loans that are funded by deposits. We exited the quarter with $3.2 billion drawn on our $9 billion of warehouse facilities. We grew tangible book value for the sixth consecutive quarter by a record $204 million to nearly $3.5 billion. In the fourth quarter, we opportunistically executed the buyback of a small portion of our outstanding convertible bonds, which was additive to our GAAP net income by $14.6 million, accretive to GAAP EPS, and additive to our total risk based capital ratio by more than 30 basis points. Additionally, we entered into a credit default swap arrangement for $2.5 billion of refinanced student loans. These loans were reclassified as held for investment versus held for sale based on the fact that we intend to hold these loans until maturity given the more attractive returns relative to pricing trends we see in the market today. We do not expect to see that price dynamic changing. The reclassification is consistent with fair value accounting practices and has no overall impact on our revenue and profitability. The credit default swap, however, does improve capital ratios as it significantly lowers the risk weighting for these assets, and increased our total risk based capital ratios by greater than 1% in the quarter. In terms of our regulatory capital ratios, our total capital ratio of 15.3% at year-end improved from 14.5% last quarter, and remains comfortably above the regulatory minimum of 10.5%. Let me finish up with our outlook. Before going through specific numbers, I want to review some of the larger macro assumptions that underpin our financial guide. We assume a contraction in GDP in 2024, an increase in unemployment to higher than 5% and broadly a continuation of uncertain capital markets activity and continued normalization of consumer credit. From an interest rate perspective, we are assuming four rate cuts in response to a contracting economy, higher unemployment, and deterioration and normalization in credit performance, with Fed funds rate reaching approximately 4.5% by Q4 2024. Before I summarize 2024 annual guidance, I want to give some high level thoughts by segment. 2024 will be a transitional year for SoFi as the Tech platform and Financial Services segments together will drive our growth and increase from 38% of total adjusted net revenue in 2023 to approximately 50% for all of 2024. Specifically, we expect our Tech platform and Financial Services segments, when taken together to grow 50% or more, with the financial services segment growing approximately 75% year-over-year and Tech platform growing approximately 20% year-over-year. We are taking a conservative and pragmatic approach toward our Lending segment revenue, expecting to largely maintain it, given our concerns about the 2024 macro environment as it relates to uncertainty on rates, the economy, and industry liquidity. Therefore, we will manage the Lending segment revenue to be 92% to 95% of 2023 lending revenue. This very conservative view of lending, reflects our choice to limit lending growth below both the much higher level of demand we have had and expect to continue to see in 2024 and the capacity that we have. Fortunately for us, the scale and profitability we have achieved in our tech platform and financial services segments allows us to intentionally limit growth of our lending businesses in periods of uncertainty, while still maintaining an attractive overall growth rate, significant profit, cash generation, and book value growth. Even with our conservative view of the Lending business, we expect 50% growth in revenue of Tech platform and Financial Services combined, and to add at least 2.3 million new members in 2024, which represents 30% growth. Within Lending, our personal loan originations could be relatively flat or down versus 2023, while student loan originations could grow just modestly and home loans growth could be correlated with rate decreases. In terms of capital and liquidity, our total risk based capital ratio improved to 15.3%, up from 14.5% in Q3 demonstrating our ability to effectively manage our balance sheet and capital ratios through growth in GAAP net income, opportunistic capital efficiency transactions, and loan sales. In terms of our lending capacity, we have the ability to originate $18 billion to $20 billion in loans in 2024, while keeping capital ratios well north of regulatory minimums. And that's based on growth in tangible book value, amortization of existing loans, and previously announced loan sales. To be specific, we expect to generate $300 million to $500 million of tangible book value in 2024, which translates to approximately $2.4 billion to $4 billion of incremental capacity. Second, loans are amortizing or paying down an annual rate of $8.4 billion. Third, we have our previously announced $2 billion forward flow agreement, in addition to a number of on-the-run loan sale transactions we expect to execute, similar to the sales achieved in Q4. And lastly, we have headroom in our capital ratio. Having said that, we intend to originate less than the $18 billion to $20 billion in capacity, and this is based on the factors I outlined previously. With that, let me turn to specific guidance. For 2024, even with our conservative view of the Lending business at 92% to 95% of 2023 revenue, we expect 50% growth in revenue of Tech platform and Financial Services combined and to add at least 2.3 million new members, which represents 30% year-over-year growth. We anticipate adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 20% in the first quarter, ramping to our long term target margin of 30% by year end, which equates to a range for 2024 EBITDA of $580 million to $590 million. For the full year 2024, we expect expenses under the EBITDA line to be roughly equivalent in aggregate in dollar terms compared to 2023, excluding the 2023 reported goodwill impairment expense. That equates to full year GAAP net income in the range of $95 million to $105 million and GAAP EPS in the range of $0.07 to $0.08. We expect growth and tangible book value of $300 million to $500 million for the year and to end the year with a total capital ratio north of 14%. For Q1 2024, we expect to deliver adjusted net revenue of $550 million to $560 million, adjusted EBITDA of $110 million to $120 million, and GAAP net income in the range of $10 million to $20 million. Now, let me turn it back to Anthony for thoughts on our medium term outlook.\nAnthony Noto: Given the number of milestones we have achieved since we transitioned the strategy of the company when I joined six years ago, as well as the fact that 2024 will be a transitional year, we thought it would be helpful to provide a longer-term perspective beyond 2024. For the 2023 through 2026 time period, we see 20% to 25% compound annual revenue growth, assuming no meaningful change in the macro environment and no significant new business launches or acquisitions, such as small medium business checking and savings, or small medium business lending, a broader asset management business, insurance, a broader credit card portfolio, new technology verticals for the technology platform business, or new geographies. The 20% to 25% compound annual revenue growth from 2023 through 2026 assumes a compound analytic growth rate of 50% for Financial Services revenue, mid-20s percent for Tech platform revenue, and mid-teens for the Lending segment revenue. Simply put, this growth only reflects the benefits of the investments we've made in our existing businesses paired with continuing to build brand awareness, trust and adoption by new members and driving cross-buy from existing members. The earnings power associated with this growth is notable and could drive between $0.55 and $0.80 per share in GAAP EPS in 2026. Moreover, we see 20% to 25% EPS growth beyond 2026, reflecting both the continued growth of the core businesses we've just described, plus the added benefit from new business lines launched in the 2024 through 2026 time period that begin to scale and impact beyond 2026. Make no mistake, the long-term opportunity for SoFi remains unchanged, and we continue to believe we are just getting started. There are endless opportunities for investment and growth, and we remain focused on the right types of durable growth for the stage of our company and within the environment in which we operate. In summary, we could not be more proud of the results of SoFi in 2023, or even more encouraged by the prospects ahead of us. We have demonstrated the benefit of having a member centric approach and being a one stop shop to help our members get their money right, resulting in having a diversified, high growth set of revenue streams, multiple cost efficient sources of capital, a team focused on underwriting high quality credit, and a high degree of operating leverage as we scale the business to be the winner that takes most in the digital financial services sector. With that, let's begin the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from John Hecht from Jefferies. John, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJohn Hecht: Yeah. Good morning, guys. Thanks very much for all the details about the intermediate term goal and I appreciate you taking my question. You guys are taking a fairly conservative look at the economy. I think that's dictating or guiding kind of how you want to balance the growth between the Lending segment and the non-lending segments this year. And I'm just wondering, if things kind of pan out a little better than expected, would that change the trajectory? And then how do we think about kind of Lending segment versus non-lending segments as we get into next year?\nAnthony Noto: Yeah. I think if the economic backdrop is vastly different, it'll change the trajectory, both up and down, I would think about that, both ways, could be worse could be better. As I think about the different businesses, some things that could give us tailwind, if we do see rate declines, our home loan business really would benefit from refinancing in the mortgage business and would benefit from greater purchases. Right now, rates are quite high and it stifled the growth in that market, but that would be a benefit. We really love the home loan business for a couple of reasons. Number one, it's probably the largest and most emotional financial decision people will make in their lives. And if we're going to be there for a relationship with our members, we have to be there for that decision. It also is one of the most risky. If someone overpays for a house or takes on too much debt in their mortgage, it could eliminate their ability to have discretionary income to invest. And if you do that in your 20s and 30s, it's really hard to catch up later. So it's a really critical product for us, delivering on our mission. It's also a great economic product. We largely do agency mortgages, which means we use our capital just to underwrite it, but then we can sell it, through the government agency windows, which benefits the balance sheet quite meaningfully. So that's one business that would be capital light generally, if we do agency mortgages that would benefit from lower rates. The second business that would benefit from that is as rates come down, you'll see more people looking to get yield in other products like Invest, in offset to rates coming down some may believe that our SoFi Money product may not grow as fast. What I'd say is, from an interest rate standpoint, we are committed to providing a top-tier APY in addition to no fees and all the functionality that we provide with a two-day early paycheck and the ability to earn reward points and do person to person payments and bill pay and all the other benefits of that product. But because we are an originator and we do generate yield against those deposits, as you know, 6.1% this quarter, we're going to be able to maintain a competitive advantage in what rate we give on SoFi Money. I would say, if the rate cuts are in fact 6 times instead of what we're forecasting at 4, I do worry about the economy. I don't see a world in which we have six rate cuts and we have a strong economic backdrop. The market quickly switched from, in late October, going from higher for longer to six rate cuts in a matter of 90 days. That tells you how bifurcated the market is and how concerning things can switch so quickly. So we want to be conservative in our outlook as it relates to risk. We have the benefit of being able to be conservative in our outlook because of what we've done in growing the Financial Services segment and the Technology Platform segment. And now that the Financial Services segment is profitable on a contribution profit basis, we can grow even faster and it doesn't drive our losses up. We're still in significant investment mode there because of the acquisition cost on Invest and on Credit Card and on SoFi Money, but overall its profitable and we can grow it very fast and benefit from that high margin revenue and the margins increasing. And same thing with the Tech Platform, we invested meaningfully over the last three years in the Tech Platform. We're now in margin expansion mode and revenue acceleration mode. So having all three businesses is a direct result of our broad-based strategy of giving consumers what they need to get their money right, but also results in more durable and diverse revenue streams. In a situation where the economy is weaker than expected, losses will go up. We've seen trends across the industry. The all bank data is very telling in charge-off rates and delinquencies, as well as reserves for losses that indicate that normalization is happening across the spectrum and we want to be prudent to make sure we factor that into our risk profile. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is from Andrew Jeffrey from Truist. Andrew, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hi. Good morning. I appreciate you taking the question. Anthony, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the company's anticipated balance between growth? I'm thinking specifically in the financial products segment and profitability. You've achieved at least this quarter, your long term margin targets and ostensibly you continue to generate really good LTV to CAC. So are there any factors that limit growth in terms of the financial products segment or could we actually see that accelerate as the business becomes a little more balanced away from lending?\nAnthony Noto: Thank you for your question. The contribution margin in that business was break even for the full year and improved meaningfully in the fourth quarter. I would say, the major limit on our growth in the Financial Services segment is how much we want to spend on building awareness and marketing. We have really good customer acquisition cost profiles in the businesses, especially SoFi Money. It's got the best payback period, but we're doing really well in Invest. Investors shouldn't go to sleep on our Invest business. As we mentioned in the call, the AUM increased more than 50%. We launched alternative asset classes today. We continue to give consumers access to products that are typically only available for the wealthy, and we're bringing them to mainstream. We did that with IPOs and now with alternate investments today, which we'll continue to build out also. And in the Credit Card business, we've really hunkered down there and pulled back to make sure we have the credit profile right, our market segmentation right, and most importantly, like we did in Money, make sure we have the unit economics right, and I feel like we've made great progress there. So within that segment, it really comes down to how much we want to spend in driving marketing. The products have payback periods anywhere from 12 months to 36 months. So ultimately, we want to manage the overall business to a 30% incremental EBITDA margin and so we'll invest up to that point. And that's how to think about the limit to growth. But in terms of the opportunity, if we wanted to spend more and not hold ourselves to that balance between growth and a 30% incremental EBITDA margin, we could grow even faster. The market -- the product market fit is so great, it's just a question of how much you want to dial it up or down.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Reggie Smith from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nReginald Smith: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Chris, I think you said that personal loan charge-offs were 4%, I believe, for the full year, I was wondering, if you could tell us what that was for the fourth quarter? I was -- I guess my math, and it could totally be off, I had you guys at like 3.1% through the first three quarters of the year, and that would imply, I think, like a 6% loss rate in the fourth quarter. So I don't know if I'm wrong there, like any color there will be helpful?\nChristopher Lapointe: Yeah. No worries. Hey, Reggie. In terms of the fourth quarter, what you heard in my prepared remarks was accurate for the fourth quarter. So our NCO rate for the personal loans business was 4.0%. That was up from 3.44% in Q3 of 2023. As Anthony had alluded to, we do expect a continued normalization towards pre-COVID levels and life of loan losses in the 7% to 8% range.\nAnthony Noto: Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Dolev from Mizuho. Dan, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDan Dolev: Thank you. Hey, guys. Excellent quarter. Nice work. Anthony, maybe a question for you. You provided a nice outlook on profitability into 2026. Can you maybe give us your comfort level on the earnings -- the long-term earnings power of the business? Thank you.\nAnthony Noto: Yeah. I think that there's two important indicators for the long-term earnings power of the business, which is what have we done to date and then what's the sort of incremental way to think about profitability? So 30% EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter is a huge milestone for us. I cannot tell you the number of people that I mentioned, our long-term margin at 30% too that were naysayers there. So I'm really proud of the scale that we've achieved at over $2 billion of revenue, but equally proud of what we've done from a profitability standpoint to have 35% revenue growth, which accelerated with a 30% actual EBITDA margin and GAAP profitability shows you the earnings potential of this business. The margin could be much higher than 30%, but we're sticking to that as our long-term margin today. As I think about 2026 in that time period, a margin profile in the 30s is what would help us get there and would make it achievable. If you think about our businesses individually than collectively, as a series of unit economic businesses, where we're architecting the revenue per account, the variable cost per account, to the variable profit margin that obviously exceeds the customer acquisition cost by a meaningful margin and then pays back after 12 months to 24 months. As you scale that variable profit per account, you're going at a fixed cost base. Once you get that above the fixed cost base, the incremental unit economics just drops to the bottom line, and our unit economics are greater than 30%, which means our long-term margins could be greater than 30%, but we're going to stick with that right now for our long term margin. It's quite surprising, we achieved it so early, while we're still growing, so that should be a great indication of what the future could bring. But we're not going to push it higher than that because we want to make sure we hold ourselves accountable to some constraints on what we invest in while balancing growth versus profitability and marching towards higher ROE and greater tangible book value growth. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Adelson from Morgan Stanley. Jeff, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJeffrey Adelson: Hey. Thanks, guys. I appreciate you taking my questions. I just wanted to dig in on -- follow up on Reggie's question a little bit and dig in on the credit on the personal loan book. I know you did modestly increase the life of loss expectation there to 4.8% this quarter. I guess when we look at some of the ABS data, it does look like the data continues to get worse and we have other lenders out there in the consumer world that have flagged that losses should also get worse this year. So I'm wondering, if you could help us frame, where you have your expectations for 2024 credit on the loss side going there. Is there a world where you see that overshooting the kind of 4.8% life of loan expectation this year, or do you think that it could kind of hold there? And then as a follow up, I'm wondering you could also provide the dollar benefit to NII you got this quarter or revenues this quarter from the new secured financing you announced? Thanks.\nChristopher Lapointe: Yeah. Sure. So on the actual PL losses, I just want to be clear, when I mentioned the 4.0% NCO rate, that was an annual loss rate where we expect it to normalize too is 7% to 8% life of loan, which translates closer to a 4.8% to 5%-ish annualized loss rate, which we expect to occur in the first half of 2024. The reason that we get confident that we are going to peak out at those levels is that if you look at our NCOs for Q4 of 2023, about 15% of those net charge-offs are related to credits that we have removed from the system and that comprises about 3% of the overall UPB on the balance sheet. That's expected to get down to less than 1% by the end of the year. In terms of your second question, around the benefit from revenue from secured financing that we announced, we did about $450 million in the quarter as I alluded to in my prepared remarks. The actual revenue generation associated with that in period was immaterial given time of sales.\nAnthony Noto: And the only other thing I'd add is that, our backdrop for credit and credit performance and normalization is tied to our economic outlook. Obviously, in a more challenging economic outlook, those assumptions would likely not hold to be true and we'd obviously manage the business differently. I would say the one thing that's been true over the last six years that I've been here is whatever we thought would happen with the economy isn't actually what's happened with the economy. And we have to be nimble and smart and read all the macroeconomic data points and our own business performances to adjust accordingly. So I don't want anyone to think that the outlook that we have is in all economic backdrops. It's not. It's for the very specific one that we outlined. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Ng from Goldman Sachs. Michael, please go ahead.\nMichael Ng: Hey, good morning. Thank you very much for the question. I appreciate all the revenue guidance by segment for 2024. I was just wondering, if you could talk a little bit about the contribution profit outlook, key things to consider for each segment and any specifics around 2024 by segment would be helpful? Thank you.\nAnthony Noto: The way to think about it is, the Lending business is meaningfully profitable, very high contribution profit margins there. For those that have been following us for a long time, you'll remember the comments that we've made about ensuring that our loans have a 40% to 50% variable profit margin per loan, so that those loans will be durable through the cycle and we remain focused on achieving that. The second thing, I'd say is on the Technology Platform, the margins contracted there quite meaningfully prior to this year as we invested in moving to the cloud from on-prem, and we invested in new architecture and new products and services, and we're now seeing the benefit of those investments coming in, higher revenue and more operating leverage. And you saw the nice contribution profit margin expansion there, which you can continue to see with more revenue. It's a business that once you exceed your fixed cost, the incremental profitability is quite meaningful. And in the Financial Services segment, it's a lot harder to talk homogeneously because there's so many different businesses there. Chris said on the call that we're losing over $100 million a year from a contribution profit standpoint across the different businesses we're investing. Despite the fact that we achieved $25 million in the quarter of contribution profit, we're still losing meaningfully in businesses like Credit Card and SoFi Invest because of the acquisition costs there, but also because the fixed costs are not covered by the variable profit yet. And so that business has a lot of upside in contribution profit. We have think about it by business and where those businesses are in their development cycle and so Invest and Credit Card are very early in their investment cycle and therefore losing a lot of money. SoFi Money is now variable profit positive and carrying the weight of the profitability of their overall business. We also have some ancillary businesses in there that are high margin, that are small dollars that contribute nicely, but they're not the biggest contributor to that area. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Vincent Caintic from Stephens. Vincent, please go ahead, your line is open.\nVincent Caintic: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions and I appreciate all the details. Going back to the breakout expectations, I wanted to focus on, sort of your expectations for how that affects loan sales and what your pipeline looks like for loan sales. Should we expect an acceleration in loan sales in 2024, if rates continue to go down? And then, on the fair value mark, does the current fair value marks actually reflect the four rate cuts already, or should we expect that discount rate to decline and therefore increase the fair value mark as time goes on? Thank you.\nChristopher Lapointe: Yeah. Sure. In terms of the overall demand for our loans, the demand remains extremely robust. You saw that we did over $1 billion of sales in Q4, $875 million of which came from unsecured personal loan sales with a $375 million securitization and $500 million of sales in whole loan format. We do expect demand to remain robust. We're seeing that already in Q1. As a reminder, we do have a forward -- $2 billion forward flow arrangement in 2024 with a party that has bought loans from us over the course of the last few quarters that will stay intact throughout the year. And then we do expect robust demand on other -- on the run loan transactions that we've done, akin to what we did in Q4. So overall, really good demand as strong execution levels as demonstrated in my prepared remarks. In terms of the fair market value marks, these include the four rate cuts already. Our marks are reflective of a point in time. So as of the end of Q4, the marks reflect what the underlying benchmark rate as of December 31.\nAnthony Noto: So they don't reflect the four rate cuts going forward. The other thing I'd say is, as we think about our durability of our loans, we have continued to reduce our credit box. In this late December, we reduced underwriting by eliminating what we call tier six and seven, which is the higher end of our FICO band. As those that know the company, we underwrite 685 going higher and our average is much higher than 680 in the mid-7s as we talked about earlier. But as we progress through the year, we have reduced our credit box and we continue to do so. And in December, making a relatively big change on six and seven, so that our loans are durable through the cycle, whether we hold them on balance sheet or we sell them.\nChristopher Lapointe: And then the only other thing I would add, just to follow on to my point around, do the marks include the four rate cuts? As you all know, what we hedge interest rate exposure on our loans. So when interest rate drops, the value of the loan increases, but that's offset by hedge losses. Similar to what happened in Q4, we saw meaningful interest rate reductions, but we also had meaningful hedge losses that offset that.\nAnthony Noto: Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question we have time for today is from Dominick Gabriele from Oppenheimer. Dominick, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDominick Gabriele: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for the question and the color across the call. So maybe, Anthony, you can talk to us or Chris through the assumptions that lead to your mid-20% revenue growth within the Tech Platform, that'd be really helpful. Maybe including, if possible, breaking it down by the new client wins, pipeline for deals, customer ads, anything you can provide, I feel like this target is likely going to be of significant importance moving forward. Thanks so much.\nAnthony Noto: Yeah. We're not going to get into that level of detail. We're in the market in conversations with dozens of potential partners across the spectrum of the diversified customer base we have. We have an ongoing dialogue with everything from government-related deals for child support and benefits from the federal government all the way to new consumer Financial Services offerings from large established non-financial services brands all the way to big, large traditional banks in our country. The drivers of the business are quite simple. We have an underlying payment processing platform that you should think about generating revenue based on two factors. One, getting paid based on the transactions that occur in that platform, the volume of those transactions, and the price for those transactions in addition to the APIs that we provide. Within the Technology Processing platform, we provide APIs for account opening, for bill pay, for two-day early paychecks, for person-to-person payments, for Payment Risk Platform fraud capabilities. And so different partners use different APIs and the more they use, the more we get paid, but it also drives the more transactions. In addition to that, we have other products like Konecta, which is a natural language chatbot that uses machine learning. We also have a product called Payment Risk Platform, where we're helping people decide instantaneously on the risk of a transaction and whether or not it should be authorized or not, and we get paid for each one of those authorizations. In addition to that, we have Technisys banking core, which is a much larger decision for any institution use, but think of a core as an operating system. Our Technisys capability we bought for one big reason. We have a lot of products at SoFi. Those products all have different operating systems. We want them to run on one platform, one operating system, and we want that system to be extensible to new products that don't even exist today. In the Financial Services industry, many banks, and financial companies have many cores. In fact, they probably have more cores than products, because many of them were aggregated roll-ups of other banks that had different cores for checking and savings. Not to mention they have different cores for products like credit card versus checking and savings, or even for loans. And so Technisys enables a company to have one platform running different cores for different products, and it's extensible into different areas. One example of that is SoFi's Buy Now Pay Later. We launched Buy Now Pay Later with Galileo and Technisys and SoFi. It was the first product on all three technologies and we did it in a very short period of time and it's a great product that is easy for the consumer to use and can be authorized right in the application itself. And so that is another driver of the overall revenue streams. We also do services for digital solutions. We do build front ends for apps in addition to other types of digital services as it relates to the app and product development. So there's no one answer to your question other than more partners, more accounts and more products per account, which drives the revenue from those factors that I just laid out. That ends our prepared remarks and questions. I wanted to finalize our comments today by just sharing with you some final thoughts. I'll finish here by saying how proud I’m of our team's relentless ability to not just persevere through the disruption and volatility of the industry throughout the year, but to deliver record results. I couldn't feel more blessed by more than 7.5 million members that have been so critical in making our vision of being a one-stop shop for all your financial needs become such an amazing reality. The benefits of our strategy resulting in a uniquely diversified business that is unmatched by any digital only provider in our scale, capability, and competitive advantages, not only positions SoFi to be the winner that takes most in the sector transition of Financial Services to digital, but also provide greater durability through a market cycle. I'm excited about where we are today, and even more excited about where we can go from here. Thank you for dialing into our call and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.\nOperator: Good-bye. Thank you everyone for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your lines and have a lovely day.",

            "name": "Christopher Lapointe",
            "content": "Thanks, Anthony. The Q4 and full year 2023 results really proved once again that our diversified and differentiated business model drives SoFi's durability and long-term growth potential. I'm going to walk through key financial highlights in our financial outlook. Unless otherwise stated, I'll be referring to adjusted results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 versus fourth quarter and full year of 2022. Our GAAP consolidated income statement and all reconciliations can be found in today's earnings release and the subsequent 10-K filing, which will be made available next month. For the quarter, we delivered record adjusted net revenue of $594 million with growth accelerating to 34% year-over-year and 12% sequentially from the third quarter's record of $531 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $181 million at a 30% margin, which is our long-term target margin up over 80% from the prior record quarter of $98 million. This represented over 14 percentage points of year-over-year margin improvement and 12 percentage points of sequential margin improvement, demonstrating significant operating leverage across all functional expense lines. In fact, sales and marketing declined as a percentage of adjusted net revenue for the fifth consecutive quarter. Total operating expenses declined roughly 17 points as a percentage of adjusted net revenue year-over-year. Overall, this resulted in a 74% incremental adjusted EBITDA margin year-over-year. We achieved GAAP profitability this quarter for the first time, with GAAP net income reaching $48 million, an $88 million improvement year-over-year, and an incremental margin of 55%. We saw continued year-over-year leverage in stock-based compensation, dropping to 12% of adjusted net revenue versus 16% in the prior year period on our path to our longer-term goal of single digit stock based compensation margins. For the full year, we delivered $2.1 billion of adjusted net revenue, up 35% year-over-year from $1.5 billion in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA rose 201% year-over-year to $432 million at a 21% adjusted EBITDA margin. Our full year net loss was $54 million and $0.10 per share, excluding the goodwill impairment charge taken in Q3. We exceeded the high end of our most recent revenue and EBITDA guidance by $9 million and $36 million, respectively, by leveraging our unique suite of products and services, nimble asset and resource allocation, as well as a relentless focus on unit economics and risk management. Now on to the segment level performance. In Lending, fourth quarter adjusted net revenue grew 10% year-over-year to $347 million with $226 million of contribution profit at a 65% margin, up from $209 million a year ago. These results were driven by 43% year-over-year growth in our net interest income, while non-interest income was down by 36%, primarily driven by increased losses and pre-payments. Growth in net interest income was driven by an 82% year-over-year increase in average interest earning assets and 122 basis point year-over-year increase in average yields. This resulted in an average net interest margin of 6.02% for the quarter, up 3 basis points sequentially and 8 basis points year-over-year. I'd also highlight our $2.9 billion of deposit growth in the quarter compared to the $1.6 billion of net loan growth on the balance sheet. The 218 basis points of cost savings between our deposits and our warehouse facilities has resulted in a meaningful benefit to our net interest margin. It also underscores the benefits of having the option of holding loans on balance sheet, when advantageous in collecting net interest income. We expect to maintain a healthy net interest margin and benefit from the continued mix toward deposit funding along with our demonstrated high loan WAC betas. On the non-interest income side, Q4 originations grew 45% year-over-year to $4.3 billion and were driven by growth across all three products, even as we continue tightening and underwriting against our stringent credit standards. We saw typical seasonality and intentionally planned for lower originations in our personal loans business, with originations of $3.2 billion, up 31% year-over-year and down 17% sequentially. Our student loans business saw origination volume nearly double year-over-year and declined 14% sequentially to $790 million. Home loans grew by 193% year-over-year and declined 13% sequentially to $309 million. Our personal loan borrowers weighted average income is $171,000 with a weighted average FICO score of 744. Our student loan borrowers weighted average income is $154,000 with a weighted average FICO of 781. Our Q4 on-balance sheet delinquency rates and charge-off rates continue as anticipated to normalize back toward pre-COVID levels. Our on-balance sheet 90-day personal loan delinquency rate was 56 basis points, while our annualized personal loan charge-off rate was 4.0%. Our on-balance sheet 90-day student loan delinquency rate was 13 basis points, while our annualized student loan charge-off rate was 59 basis points. We continue to expect healthy performance relative to broader industry levels. In the fourth quarter, we sold portions of our personal loan and home loan portfolios, totaling $1.2 billion, approximately $875 million in personal loans principal and $350 million in home loan principal. In terms of the personal loan sales, we closed a previously disclosed $375 million securitization with BlackRock, where we sold both bonds and the resid (ph) at an execution level of 105.1% enclosed an additional $500 million of loans in whole loan form to multiple parties at a blended execution of 105.6%. These had similar structures to other recent personal loan sales with cash proceeds at par or at a premium to par, and the majority of the premium comprised of the contractual servicing fees that are capitalized. These deals included a small loss share provision that is above our base assumption of losses and immaterial relative to the exposure we would otherwise have had if we held the loans. In the quarter, we executed $415 million of senior secured financing, which will show up on our detailed balance sheet as senior secured loans held for investment at amortized costs. These loans have a fixed term structure and are secured against the underlying assets, therefore equivalent to investment grade bonds if you were to do a securitization for the same pool of collateral. In addition, these loans are priced at market rates, which not only helps to diversify our balance sheet, but also provides an additional return above our cost of funding and a yield similar to the net interest margin of our loans, which are unsecured. Now turning to our fair value marks and key assumptions. Our personal loans are marked at 104.9% as of the year end, up from 104.0% at the end of Q3. This was a function of the discount rate decreasing by 103 basis points, which was driven by the underlying benchmark rate declining by 90 basis points and spreads tightening by 13 basis points. Notably, the benchmark rate change and the spread change are empirical as they are actual market observed inputs, not assumptions. Partially offsetting the decrease in discount rate was an increase in the annual default rate assumption from 4.6% to 4.8%, as well as an increase in the annual prepayment speed assumptions from 20% to 23%, which has an immaterial impact on the overall change in the mark. When a borrower prepays, we are still capturing the principal and the impact to the value of the assets is only based on the premium above par at a given point in time, which is very small relative to the principal outstanding. We expect default rates to continue to normalize to pre-COVID life of loan loss levels of approximately 7% to 8%. For our student loan portfolio, the fair value mark at year end increased to 103.8% versus 101.5% at the end of Q3. This was a function of the portfolio WAC increasing by 24 basis points and the discount rate decreasing by 57 basis points driven by the underlying benchmark rate declining by 86 basis points and spreads widening by 29 basis points. Partially offsetting the decrease in discount rate was an increase in the annual default rate assumption from 0.5% to 0.6%. Importantly, the fair value benefits resulting from interest rate decreases as well as personal loan spread tightening was offset nearly one for one by hedge losses and spread widening in our SLR business. So there was no net revenue benefit in the quarter due to discount rate input changes. For the full year lending adjusted net revenue grew 21% to $1.3 billion and the segment delivered $823 million of contribution profit at a 62% margin. Moving on to Financial Services, where net revenue of $139 million increased 115% year-over-year with new all-time high revenue for SoFi Money, Credit Card and lending as a service, as well as continued contributions from SoFi Invest. Overall monetization continues to improve with annualized revenue per product of $59, up nearly 50% year-over-year versus $40 in Q4 2022 and up 10% sequentially. This is driven by higher deposits and member spending levels in SoFi Money, greater AUM and monetizable features in SoFi Invest and robust growth within SoFi Credit Card spend. We reached 9.5 million Financial Services products in the quarter, which is up 45% year-over-year with 626,000 new products in the quarter. We reached nearly 3.4 million products in SoFi Money, 2.4 million in SoFi Invest, and 3.3 million in Relay. Contribution profit reached $25 million for the quarter even as we continue to invest aggressively against the ample opportunities to rapidly grow this operating segment with attractive returns. Full year segment revenue of $437 million is 2.6 times the $168 million we delivered in 2022 and we broke even on a contribution basis for the full year. Shifting to our Tech platform, where we delivered record net revenue of $97 million in the quarter, up 13% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. Annual revenue growth was driven by continued monetization of existing clients along with new deals signed in new client segments. Galileo accounts grew 11% year-over year to $145 million. The segment delivered a contribution profit of $31 million, representing a 32% margin. We continue to leverage investments made to integrate Galileo and Technisys and position the segment for higher rates of diversified, durable growth going forward. We expect Tech platform revenue to continue accelerating in 2024, with strong margins. For the full year, the Tech platform segment grew revenue 12% to $352 million and delivered $95 million of contribution profit at a 27% margin. Switching to our balance sheet, where we remain very well capitalized with ample cash and liquidity. In Q4 assets grew by $2.1 billion as a result of $1.6 billion growth in loans and approximately $400 million of growth in cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities. On the liability side, deposits grew by $2.9 billion sequentially to $18.6 billion. Importantly, deposit growth outpaced net loan growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. As a result, we were able to reduce warehouse facilities utilized by over $700 million, resulting in more efficient funding costs as we continue to ramp the portion of loans that are funded by deposits. We exited the quarter with $3.2 billion drawn on our $9 billion of warehouse facilities. We grew tangible book value for the sixth consecutive quarter by a record $204 million to nearly $3.5 billion. In the fourth quarter, we opportunistically executed the buyback of a small portion of our outstanding convertible bonds, which was additive to our GAAP net income by $14.6 million, accretive to GAAP EPS, and additive to our total risk based capital ratio by more than 30 basis points. Additionally, we entered into a credit default swap arrangement for $2.5 billion of refinanced student loans. These loans were reclassified as held for investment versus held for sale based on the fact that we intend to hold these loans until maturity given the more attractive returns relative to pricing trends we see in the market today. We do not expect to see that price dynamic changing. The reclassification is consistent with fair value accounting practices and has no overall impact on our revenue and profitability. The credit default swap, however, does improve capital ratios as it significantly lowers the risk weighting for these assets, and increased our total risk based capital ratios by greater than 1% in the quarter. In terms of our regulatory capital ratios, our total capital ratio of 15.3% at year-end improved from 14.5% last quarter, and remains comfortably above the regulatory minimum of 10.5%. Let me finish up with our outlook. Before going through specific numbers, I want to review some of the larger macro assumptions that underpin our financial guide. We assume a contraction in GDP in 2024, an increase in unemployment to higher than 5% and broadly a continuation of uncertain capital markets activity and continued normalization of consumer credit. From an interest rate perspective, we are assuming four rate cuts in response to a contracting economy, higher unemployment, and deterioration and normalization in credit performance, with Fed funds rate reaching approximately 4.5% by Q4 2024. Before I summarize 2024 annual guidance, I want to give some high level thoughts by segment. 2024 will be a transitional year for SoFi as the Tech platform and Financial Services segments together will drive our growth and increase from 38% of total adjusted net revenue in 2023 to approximately 50% for all of 2024. Specifically, we expect our Tech platform and Financial Services segments, when taken together to grow 50% or more, with the financial services segment growing approximately 75% year-over-year and Tech platform growing approximately 20% year-over-year. We are taking a conservative and pragmatic approach toward our Lending segment revenue, expecting to largely maintain it, given our concerns about the 2024 macro environment as it relates to uncertainty on rates, the economy, and industry liquidity. Therefore, we will manage the Lending segment revenue to be 92% to 95% of 2023 lending revenue. This very conservative view of lending, reflects our choice to limit lending growth below both the much higher level of demand we have had and expect to continue to see in 2024 and the capacity that we have. Fortunately for us, the scale and profitability we have achieved in our tech platform and financial services segments allows us to intentionally limit growth of our lending businesses in periods of uncertainty, while still maintaining an attractive overall growth rate, significant profit, cash generation, and book value growth. Even with our conservative view of the Lending business, we expect 50% growth in revenue of Tech platform and Financial Services combined, and to add at least 2.3 million new members in 2024, which represents 30% growth. Within Lending, our personal loan originations could be relatively flat or down versus 2023, while student loan originations could grow just modestly and home loans growth could be correlated with rate decreases. In terms of capital and liquidity, our total risk based capital ratio improved to 15.3%, up from 14.5% in Q3 demonstrating our ability to effectively manage our balance sheet and capital ratios through growth in GAAP net income, opportunistic capital efficiency transactions, and loan sales. In terms of our lending capacity, we have the ability to originate $18 billion to $20 billion in loans in 2024, while keeping capital ratios well north of regulatory minimums. And that's based on growth in tangible book value, amortization of existing loans, and previously announced loan sales. To be specific, we expect to generate $300 million to $500 million of tangible book value in 2024, which translates to approximately $2.4 billion to $4 billion of incremental capacity. Second, loans are amortizing or paying down an annual rate of $8.4 billion. Third, we have our previously announced $2 billion forward flow agreement, in addition to a number of on-the-run loan sale transactions we expect to execute, similar to the sales achieved in Q4. And lastly, we have headroom in our capital ratio. Having said that, we intend to originate less than the $18 billion to $20 billion in capacity, and this is based on the factors I outlined previously. With that, let me turn to specific guidance. For 2024, even with our conservative view of the Lending business at 92% to 95% of 2023 revenue, we expect 50% growth in revenue of Tech platform and Financial Services combined and to add at least 2.3 million new members, which represents 30% year-over-year growth. We anticipate adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 20% in the first quarter, ramping to our long term target margin of 30% by year end, which equates to a range for 2024 EBITDA of $580 million to $590 million. For the full year 2024, we expect expenses under the EBITDA line to be roughly equivalent in aggregate in dollar terms compared to 2023, excluding the 2023 reported goodwill impairment expense. That equates to full year GAAP net income in the range of $95 million to $105 million and GAAP EPS in the range of $0.07 to $0.08. We expect growth and tangible book value of $300 million to $500 million for the year and to end the year with a total capital ratio north of 14%. For Q1 2024, we expect to deliver adjusted net revenue of $550 million to $560 million, adjusted EBITDA of $110 million to $120 million, and GAAP net income in the range of $10 million to $20 million. Now, let me turn it back to Anthony for thoughts on our medium term outlook. Yeah. No worries. Hey, Reggie. In terms of the fourth quarter, what you heard in my prepared remarks was accurate for the fourth quarter. So our NCO rate for the personal loans business was 4.0%. That was up from 3.44% in Q3 of 2023. As Anthony had alluded to, we do expect a continued normalization towards pre-COVID levels and life of loan losses in the 7% to 8% range. Yeah. Sure. So on the actual PL losses, I just want to be clear, when I mentioned the 4.0% NCO rate, that was an annual loss rate where we expect it to normalize too is 7% to 8% life of loan, which translates closer to a 4.8% to 5%-ish annualized loss rate, which we expect to occur in the first half of 2024. The reason that we get confident that we are going to peak out at those levels is that if you look at our NCOs for Q4 of 2023, about 15% of those net charge-offs are related to credits that we have removed from the system and that comprises about 3% of the overall UPB on the balance sheet. That's expected to get down to less than 1% by the end of the year. In terms of your second question, around the benefit from revenue from secured financing that we announced, we did about $450 million in the quarter as I alluded to in my prepared remarks. The actual revenue generation associated with that in period was immaterial given time of sales. Yeah. Sure. In terms of the overall demand for our loans, the demand remains extremely robust. You saw that we did over $1 billion of sales in Q4, $875 million of which came from unsecured personal loan sales with a $375 million securitization and $500 million of sales in whole loan format. We do expect demand to remain robust. We're seeing that already in Q1. As a reminder, we do have a forward -- $2 billion forward flow arrangement in 2024 with a party that has bought loans from us over the course of the last few quarters that will stay intact throughout the year. And then we do expect robust demand on other -- on the run loan transactions that we've done, akin to what we did in Q4. So overall, really good demand as strong execution levels as demonstrated in my prepared remarks. In terms of the fair market value marks, these include the four rate cuts already. Our marks are reflective of a point in time. So as of the end of Q4, the marks reflect what the underlying benchmark rate as of December 31. And then the only other thing I would add, just to follow on to my point around, do the marks include the four rate cuts? As you all know, what we hedge interest rate exposure on our loans. So when interest rate drops, the value of the loan increases, but that's offset by hedge losses. Similar to what happened in Q4, we saw meaningful interest rate reductions, but we also had meaningful hedge losses that offset that."

            "name": "Anthony Noto",
            "content": "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. 2023 was a remarkable year for SoFi. We achieved multiple records and realized many of our aspirations despite seismic geopolitical and macroeconomic events. We demonstrated that we have built a business to thrive in a host of challenging environments, reacting swiftly to change, driving our business forward with standout financial performance, while continuing to serve our member's needs. Our 2023 results have reinforced my conviction in our long-term potential and our ability to achieve our aspiration to become a top 10 financial institution. I'd like to highlight some of our notable achievements for the year. We reached GAAP net income profitability in the fourth quarter and are positioned to continue to drive positive GAAP net income in 2024. We grew adjusted net revenue by 35% for the year to a record of $2.1 billion, while adjusted EBITDA of $432 million increased 200% versus 2022. This represents a 54% incremental margin and a 21% consolidated EBITDA margin for the full year compared to our long-term margin target of 30%, which we achieved in the fourth quarter of 2023. Total members and products, both grew over 40%, with 2.3 million new members in 2023 for a total of 7.5 million members and we added 3.2 million new products for a total of 11 million products at year end. We continue to diversify our revenue with Financial Services and the Tech Platform contributing 40% of four quarter adjusted net revenue up from 34% in the year ago quarter. Our Financial Services segment achieved positive contribution profit in the third quarter, which ramped further in the fourth quarter. We completed a dramatic shift in Tech Platform's product offering and focus, positioning us to capture the massive opportunity in the traditional banking sector in addition to tech and consumer companies looking to provide financial services. In Lending, 72% of adjusted net revenue was from net interest income compared to 48% in fiscal year '22. Net interest income offers a more recurring and predictable cash revenue stream to compared to non-interest income. We generated $334 million in tangible book value growth, which is now set to accelerate in 2024. Total deposits grew by $11.3 billion in 2023 to $18.6 billion and over 90% of our consumer deposits are from direct deposit members. SoFi Bank reported net income of nearly $350 million, a 21% margin with a return on tangible equity of 15.9% in its first full year of formation. To put some of these achievements in the context of a longer-term perspective, I'll note the following: When comparing our business to fiscal year 2018, which is when I joined SoFi and we embarked on our new strategy, we have grown annual adjusted net revenue by more than 8x, annual EBITDA by almost 3x or $660 million, members by more than 11x, total products by 16x, and consolidated net interest income by nearly 5x. And since adding several Financial Services products in 2019, we have grown annual Financial Services revenue to more than $430 million, Financial Services products to $9.5 million in total, and Financial Services products now comprise 85% of our total products. The fourth quarter really capped an exceptional year. Record adjusted net revenue of $594 million accelerated to 34% year-over-year growth, while record adjusted EBITDA of $181 million to 159% with a 30% consolidated EBITDA margin. This EBITDA margin is up 14 percentage points year-over-year and is now equal to our long-term target of 30%. Financial Services segment contribution profit grew to $25 million, an 18% margin versus $3.3 million last quarter and the negative $44 million in the year ago quarter. Our deposits grew by a record of nearly $3 billion in the quarter. Tech Platform segment revenue growth accelerated to 13% year-over-year and it's way to 20% in next year with a 32% contribution margin versus 20% in the year ago quarter. In Lending, 76% of adjusted net revenue was net interest income up 43% year-over-year to $263 million. We point this out because $263 million in cash revenue is 2x greater than our directly attributable segment expenses of $120 million. Segment contribution margin improved by over 500 basis points sequentially to 65%. Company consolidated GAAP earnings per share was $0.02, with GAAP net income totaling $48 million versus a $40 million loss in the year ago quarter. SoFi bank's net income of $129 million represents a 27% margin, an annualized return on equity of 16.8%. In terms of our balance sheet, we grew tangible book value for the sixth consecutive quarter by $204 million at the consolidated level, reaching $3.5 billion in total. Our total capital ratio improved to 15.3% from 14.5% last quarter, helped by organic tangible book growth, over $1billion in loan sales, capital optimization moves, and an opportunistic convertible debt repurchase of $72 million. From a member and product perspective, in the fourth quarter we added 585,000 new members for a total of over $7.5 million members and 695,000 new products for a total of over 11 million products. Now I'd like to spend some time touching on quarterly segment level results. Lending adjusted net revenue of $347 million grew 10% year-over-year, again, it's a difficult comparison of 51% year-over-year growth in the year ago quarter. Personal loan originations grew 31% year-over-year to $3.2 billion, student loan originations grew 95% year-over-year to $790 million, and home loan originations increased 193% year-over-year to $309 million. Within the Financial Services, net revenue grew 115% year-over-year and 18% sequentially to $139 million, driven by continued strong monetization within the segment. We achieved $25 million in contribution profit, despite our significant investment across Money, Credit Card, and Invest. As we noted last quarter, the Credit Card and Invest businesses are still in heavy investment mode with losses of over $100 million annually on a run rate basis. Through unit economic optimization and greater scale, these businesses will eventually see positive contribution profit, similar to how we delivered with SoFi Money. We continue to see strong growth in SoFi Money products, and importantly, high quality deposits and great levels of engagement. This has led to higher average account balances, even as average spend has increased. SoFi Money products have increased 54% year-over-year or by nearly 1.2 million to 3.4 million accounts. As important is the quality of these members with a median FICO of 744 for our direct deposit portfolio, and hence we see ample opportunity for cross-buy. In terms of engagement, over 50% of our newly funded SoFi Money accounts are setting up direct deposit by day 30. This account primacy drive spending, which exceeded $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter, debit transactions of volume. This is up nearly 3x year-over-year and represents more than $6 billion of annualized debit transaction volume. Our Invest products excluding crypto from all periods grew 20% year-over-year to a total of $2.1 million with AUM increasing 54% year-over-year. We've continued to launch exciting new products that meet our members needs in Financial Services to further accelerate new member growth and cross-buy. Just today for instance, we announced the launch of alternative investments and mutual funds. With the launch of alts SoFi is granting yet another opportunity for everyday investors to access, invest in opportunities, traditionally reserved for institutional investors and the ultra-wealthy. For our Tech Platform, revenue of $97 million accelerated to 13% growth year-over-year, are from 6% in Q3. We continue to make significant strides in our strategy of leveraging, our unique product suite to pursue diversified growth and larger, more durable revenue opportunities. We start to see evidence of this strategy in the fourth quarter, as growth was driven not just by continued strong organic growth with existing partners and new product adoption by them, but also by notable contributions from increasingly diversified clients, which have launched within the last six months. As mentioned last quarter, demand from traditional financial institutions and non-financial categories remained strong. While lead times for winning RFPs and ensuing integrations are measured in many quarters, not months, the transition to modern processing and modern cores is playing out in real-time, the way we envisioned it. On the product side, we continue to build and ship a diverse range of products for multiple sectors. Most notably, we launched an expense management solution in partnership with Mastercard that provides clients in the B2B sector with insights into corporate card spend. We launched same-day ACH (ph), which allows account holders faster access to funds and helps mitigate risk tied to transactional delays. And we launched a risk data mark and data pipeline for our Payments Risk Platform, which is seeing rapid adoption from existing clients. With that, let me turn it over to Chris, who will review of the financials for the quarter and our 2024 outlook. I'll return to review our multi-year outlook after Chris shares his thoughts. Given the number of milestones we have achieved since we transitioned the strategy of the company when I joined six years ago, as well as the fact that 2024 will be a transitional year, we thought it would be helpful to provide a longer-term perspective beyond 2024. For the 2023 through 2026 time period, we see 20% to 25% compound annual revenue growth, assuming no meaningful change in the macro environment and no significant new business launches or acquisitions, such as small medium business checking and savings, or small medium business lending, a broader asset management business, insurance, a broader credit card portfolio, new technology verticals for the technology platform business, or new geographies. The 20% to 25% compound annual revenue growth from 2023 through 2026 assumes a compound analytic growth rate of 50% for Financial Services revenue, mid-20s percent for Tech platform revenue, and mid-teens for the Lending segment revenue. Simply put, this growth only reflects the benefits of the investments we've made in our existing businesses paired with continuing to build brand awareness, trust and adoption by new members and driving cross-buy from existing members. The earnings power associated with this growth is notable and could drive between $0.55 and $0.80 per share in GAAP EPS in 2026. Moreover, we see 20% to 25% EPS growth beyond 2026, reflecting both the continued growth of the core businesses we've just described, plus the added benefit from new business lines launched in the 2024 through 2026 time period that begin to scale and impact beyond 2026. Make no mistake, the long-term opportunity for SoFi remains unchanged, and we continue to believe we are just getting started. There are endless opportunities for investment and growth, and we remain focused on the right types of durable growth for the stage of our company and within the environment in which we operate. In summary, we could not be more proud of the results of SoFi in 2023, or even more encouraged by the prospects ahead of us. We have demonstrated the benefit of having a member centric approach and being a one stop shop to help our members get their money right, resulting in having a diversified, high growth set of revenue streams, multiple cost efficient sources of capital, a team focused on underwriting high quality credit, and a high degree of operating leverage as we scale the business to be the winner that takes most in the digital financial services sector. With that, let's begin the Q&A. Yeah. I think if the economic backdrop is vastly different, it'll change the trajectory, both up and down, I would think about that, both ways, could be worse could be better. As I think about the different businesses, some things that could give us tailwind, if we do see rate declines, our home loan business really would benefit from refinancing in the mortgage business and would benefit from greater purchases. Right now, rates are quite high and it stifled the growth in that market, but that would be a benefit. We really love the home loan business for a couple of reasons. Number one, it's probably the largest and most emotional financial decision people will make in their lives. And if we're going to be there for a relationship with our members, we have to be there for that decision. It also is one of the most risky. If someone overpays for a house or takes on too much debt in their mortgage, it could eliminate their ability to have discretionary income to invest. And if you do that in your 20s and 30s, it's really hard to catch up later. So it's a really critical product for us, delivering on our mission. It's also a great economic product. We largely do agency mortgages, which means we use our capital just to underwrite it, but then we can sell it, through the government agency windows, which benefits the balance sheet quite meaningfully. So that's one business that would be capital light generally, if we do agency mortgages that would benefit from lower rates. The second business that would benefit from that is as rates come down, you'll see more people looking to get yield in other products like Invest, in offset to rates coming down some may believe that our SoFi Money product may not grow as fast. What I'd say is, from an interest rate standpoint, we are committed to providing a top-tier APY in addition to no fees and all the functionality that we provide with a two-day early paycheck and the ability to earn reward points and do person to person payments and bill pay and all the other benefits of that product. But because we are an originator and we do generate yield against those deposits, as you know, 6.1% this quarter, we're going to be able to maintain a competitive advantage in what rate we give on SoFi Money. I would say, if the rate cuts are in fact 6 times instead of what we're forecasting at 4, I do worry about the economy. I don't see a world in which we have six rate cuts and we have a strong economic backdrop. The market quickly switched from, in late October, going from higher for longer to six rate cuts in a matter of 90 days. That tells you how bifurcated the market is and how concerning things can switch so quickly. So we want to be conservative in our outlook as it relates to risk. We have the benefit of being able to be conservative in our outlook because of what we've done in growing the Financial Services segment and the Technology Platform segment. And now that the Financial Services segment is profitable on a contribution profit basis, we can grow even faster and it doesn't drive our losses up. We're still in significant investment mode there because of the acquisition cost on Invest and on Credit Card and on SoFi Money, but overall its profitable and we can grow it very fast and benefit from that high margin revenue and the margins increasing. And same thing with the Tech Platform, we invested meaningfully over the last three years in the Tech Platform. We're now in margin expansion mode and revenue acceleration mode. So having all three businesses is a direct result of our broad-based strategy of giving consumers what they need to get their money right, but also results in more durable and diverse revenue streams. In a situation where the economy is weaker than expected, losses will go up. We've seen trends across the industry. The all bank data is very telling in charge-off rates and delinquencies, as well as reserves for losses that indicate that normalization is happening across the spectrum and we want to be prudent to make sure we factor that into our risk profile. Next question? Thank you for your question. The contribution margin in that business was break even for the full year and improved meaningfully in the fourth quarter. I would say, the major limit on our growth in the Financial Services segment is how much we want to spend on building awareness and marketing. We have really good customer acquisition cost profiles in the businesses, especially SoFi Money. It's got the best payback period, but we're doing really well in Invest. Investors shouldn't go to sleep on our Invest business. As we mentioned in the call, the AUM increased more than 50%. We launched alternative asset classes today. We continue to give consumers access to products that are typically only available for the wealthy, and we're bringing them to mainstream. We did that with IPOs and now with alternate investments today, which we'll continue to build out also. And in the Credit Card business, we've really hunkered down there and pulled back to make sure we have the credit profile right, our market segmentation right, and most importantly, like we did in Money, make sure we have the unit economics right, and I feel like we've made great progress there. So within that segment, it really comes down to how much we want to spend in driving marketing. The products have payback periods anywhere from 12 months to 36 months. So ultimately, we want to manage the overall business to a 30% incremental EBITDA margin and so we'll invest up to that point. And that's how to think about the limit to growth. But in terms of the opportunity, if we wanted to spend more and not hold ourselves to that balance between growth and a 30% incremental EBITDA margin, we could grow even faster. The market -- the product market fit is so great, it's just a question of how much you want to dial it up or down. Next question? Yeah. I think that there's two important indicators for the long-term earnings power of the business, which is what have we done to date and then what's the sort of incremental way to think about profitability? So 30% EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter is a huge milestone for us. I cannot tell you the number of people that I mentioned, our long-term margin at 30% too that were naysayers there. So I'm really proud of the scale that we've achieved at over $2 billion of revenue, but equally proud of what we've done from a profitability standpoint to have 35% revenue growth, which accelerated with a 30% actual EBITDA margin and GAAP profitability shows you the earnings potential of this business. The margin could be much higher than 30%, but we're sticking to that as our long-term margin today. As I think about 2026 in that time period, a margin profile in the 30s is what would help us get there and would make it achievable. If you think about our businesses individually than collectively, as a series of unit economic businesses, where we're architecting the revenue per account, the variable cost per account, to the variable profit margin that obviously exceeds the customer acquisition cost by a meaningful margin and then pays back after 12 months to 24 months. As you scale that variable profit per account, you're going at a fixed cost base. Once you get that above the fixed cost base, the incremental unit economics just drops to the bottom line, and our unit economics are greater than 30%, which means our long-term margins could be greater than 30%, but we're going to stick with that right now for our long term margin. It's quite surprising, we achieved it so early, while we're still growing, so that should be a great indication of what the future could bring. But we're not going to push it higher than that because we want to make sure we hold ourselves accountable to some constraints on what we invest in while balancing growth versus profitability and marching towards higher ROE and greater tangible book value growth. Next question, please. And the only other thing I'd add is that, our backdrop for credit and credit performance and normalization is tied to our economic outlook. Obviously, in a more challenging economic outlook, those assumptions would likely not hold to be true and we'd obviously manage the business differently. I would say the one thing that's been true over the last six years that I've been here is whatever we thought would happen with the economy isn't actually what's happened with the economy. And we have to be nimble and smart and read all the macroeconomic data points and our own business performances to adjust accordingly. So I don't want anyone to think that the outlook that we have is in all economic backdrops. It's not. It's for the very specific one that we outlined. Next question, please. The way to think about it is, the Lending business is meaningfully profitable, very high contribution profit margins there. For those that have been following us for a long time, you'll remember the comments that we've made about ensuring that our loans have a 40% to 50% variable profit margin per loan, so that those loans will be durable through the cycle and we remain focused on achieving that. The second thing, I'd say is on the Technology Platform, the margins contracted there quite meaningfully prior to this year as we invested in moving to the cloud from on-prem, and we invested in new architecture and new products and services, and we're now seeing the benefit of those investments coming in, higher revenue and more operating leverage. And you saw the nice contribution profit margin expansion there, which you can continue to see with more revenue. It's a business that once you exceed your fixed cost, the incremental profitability is quite meaningful. And in the Financial Services segment, it's a lot harder to talk homogeneously because there's so many different businesses there. Chris said on the call that we're losing over $100 million a year from a contribution profit standpoint across the different businesses we're investing. Despite the fact that we achieved $25 million in the quarter of contribution profit, we're still losing meaningfully in businesses like Credit Card and SoFi Invest because of the acquisition costs there, but also because the fixed costs are not covered by the variable profit yet. And so that business has a lot of upside in contribution profit. We have think about it by business and where those businesses are in their development cycle and so Invest and Credit Card are very early in their investment cycle and therefore losing a lot of money. SoFi Money is now variable profit positive and carrying the weight of the profitability of their overall business. We also have some ancillary businesses in there that are high margin, that are small dollars that contribute nicely, but they're not the biggest contributor to that area. Next question? So they don't reflect the four rate cuts going forward. The other thing I'd say is, as we think about our durability of our loans, we have continued to reduce our credit box. In this late December, we reduced underwriting by eliminating what we call tier six and seven, which is the higher end of our FICO band. As those that know the company, we underwrite 685 going higher and our average is much higher than 680 in the mid-7s as we talked about earlier. But as we progress through the year, we have reduced our credit box and we continue to do so. And in December, making a relatively big change on six and seven, so that our loans are durable through the cycle, whether we hold them on balance sheet or we sell them. Next question, please. Yeah. We're not going to get into that level of detail. We're in the market in conversations with dozens of potential partners across the spectrum of the diversified customer base we have. We have an ongoing dialogue with everything from government-related deals for child support and benefits from the federal government all the way to new consumer Financial Services offerings from large established non-financial services brands all the way to big, large traditional banks in our country. The drivers of the business are quite simple. We have an underlying payment processing platform that you should think about generating revenue based on two factors. One, getting paid based on the transactions that occur in that platform, the volume of those transactions, and the price for those transactions in addition to the APIs that we provide. Within the Technology Processing platform, we provide APIs for account opening, for bill pay, for two-day early paychecks, for person-to-person payments, for Payment Risk Platform fraud capabilities. And so different partners use different APIs and the more they use, the more we get paid, but it also drives the more transactions. In addition to that, we have other products like Konecta, which is a natural language chatbot that uses machine learning. We also have a product called Payment Risk Platform, where we're helping people decide instantaneously on the risk of a transaction and whether or not it should be authorized or not, and we get paid for each one of those authorizations. In addition to that, we have Technisys banking core, which is a much larger decision for any institution use, but think of a core as an operating system. Our Technisys capability we bought for one big reason. We have a lot of products at SoFi. Those products all have different operating systems. We want them to run on one platform, one operating system, and we want that system to be extensible to new products that don't even exist today. In the Financial Services industry, many banks, and financial companies have many cores. In fact, they probably have more cores than products, because many of them were aggregated roll-ups of other banks that had different cores for checking and savings. Not to mention they have different cores for products like credit card versus checking and savings, or even for loans. And so Technisys enables a company to have one platform running different cores for different products, and it's extensible into different areas. One example of that is SoFi's Buy Now Pay Later. We launched Buy Now Pay Later with Galileo and Technisys and SoFi. It was the first product on all three technologies and we did it in a very short period of time and it's a great product that is easy for the consumer to use and can be authorized right in the application itself. And so that is another driver of the overall revenue streams. We also do services for digital solutions. We do build front ends for apps in addition to other types of digital services as it relates to the app and product development. So there's no one answer to your question other than more partners, more accounts and more products per account, which drives the revenue from those factors that I just laid out. That ends our prepared remarks and questions. I wanted to finalize our comments today by just sharing with you some final thoughts. I'll finish here by saying how proud I'm of our team's relentless ability to not just persevere through the disruption and volatility of the industry throughout the year, but to deliver record results. I couldn't feel more blessed by more than 7.5 million members that have been so critical in making our vision of being a one-stop shop for all your financial needs become such an amazing reality. The benefits of our strategy resulting in a uniquely diversified business that is unmatched by any digital only provider in our scale, capability, and competitive advantages, not only positions SoFi to be the winner that takes most in the sector transition of Financial Services to digital, but also provide greater durability through a market cycle. I'm excited about where we are today, and even more excited about where we can go from here. Thank you for dialing into our call and we look forward to talking to you next quarter."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and thank you for attending SoFi's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All lines will be muted during the presentation portion of the call, with an opportunity for questions-and-answers at the end. At this time, I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Maura Cyr from SoFi Investor Relations. Maura, please go ahead.\nMaura Cyr: Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to SoFi's third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me today to talk about our results and recent events are Anthony Noto, CEO; Chris Lapointe, CFO. You can find the presentation accompanying our earnings release on the Investor Relations section of our website. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations and forecasts and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include, but are not limited to, our competitive advantage and strategy, macroeconomic conditions and outlook, future products and services and future business and financial performance. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are described in today's press release and our most recent Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as our subsequent filings made with the SEC, including our upcoming Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Anthony.\nAnthony Noto: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before my formal remarks, I want to take a moment to recognize the devastating tragedy that is currently taking place in Israel, Gaza, and the surrounding regions. It's been incredibly difficult to witness the acts of terrorism and resulting war unfold over the past couple of weeks, and what is sure to be tough days to come. The murder of innocent people is unacceptable in any form, and it's beyond belief that such actions are unfolding in the world today. With that, let's turn to our third quarter results. The third quarter at SoFi marked our 10th consecutive quarter of record revenue and fifth consecutive quarter of record adjusted EBITDA. We delivered strong diversified growth with record revenue and improved margins across all three of our business segments. Among our notable achievements in the quarter, I want to highlight two major milestones. First, 67% of our absolute growth in adjusted net revenue dollars was driven by the non-lending businesses, specifically, the Technology Platform and Financial Services segments; and second, our Financial Services segment achieved positive contribution profit for the first time, making all three reported segments profitable while bolstering our consolidated profitability even while we continue to invest aggressively for high levels of compounding for years to come. These overall results are a testament to our ability to outperform in difficult or rapidly changing environments, but also our ability to deliver on our goals and our overall mission while maintaining financial discipline and continuously setting new operational and financial records. I'm excited to share more about this quarter's notable achievements. A few key financial achievements from the third quarter include: adjusted net revenue of $531 million was 22% year-over-year. And importantly, all three segments recorded record revenue and we continue to diversify the revenue composition. Adjusted EBITDA of $98 million, represented a 48% incremental margin and a record 18% consolidated margin. Our Financial Services segment achieved positive contribution profit of $3.3 million at a 30% margin versus a $4 million loss last quarter and a $53 million loss in the year ago quarter. Our Technology Platform segment had a contribution margin of 36% versus 20% in Q2 and 23% in the year ago quarter. In our Lending segment, more than 77% of our adjusted net revenue was net interest income, which grew 90% year-over-year to $265 million, nearly 2x lending directly attributable expenses of $139 million. That's to say our net interest income is now nearly 2 times greater than our expenses. Segment contribution margin improved by nearly 300 basis points sequentially to 60%. At the company level, excluding one-time items, incremental GAAP net income margin of 48% resulted in a loss of just $19.5 million versus $48 million loss last quarter and a $74 million loss in the year ago quarter. Earnings per share loss, excluding the impact of goodwill impairment was $0.03 per share. SoFi Bank reported $84.8 million of GAAP net income at a 19.3% margin, representing 13% annualized turn on tangible equity. We remain well on track for GAAP profitability for the overall company by Q4 and the years that follow. From a balance sheet perspective, our unique value proposition in SoFi continues to fuel high-quality deposits that increased by a record of $2.9 billion sequentially, and we ended the quarter with nearly $15.7 billion in total deposits. Importantly, more than 90% of our consumer deposits are from sticky direct deposit customers, and 98% of our deposits are insured. Our cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, remained healthy at $2.8 billion, reinforcing our strong liquidity position. We grew tangible book value for the third consecutive quarter by a record of $68 million at the consolidated level. On a trailing 12-month basis, we generated $171 million in tangible book value growth. From a member and product perspective, we added 717,000 new members in Q3 '23, bringing total members to nearly 7 million, up 47% year-over-year and acceleration in growth. Our highest quarter ever of new products in Q3 of $1 million brought total products to $10.4 million at quarter end growing by 45% year-over-year, also an acceleration with record product additions in both lending and financial services. Even with this rapid growth in members, overall products per member remains at 1.5x, reinforcing the appeal of our robust product suite and multiproduct adoption by existing members. Financial Services products of 8.9 million at quarter end grew by 50% year-over-year, while Lending products of over 1.6 million were up 24% year-over-year. I am incredibly proud of these accomplishments and the progress achieved on our march to making SoFi a household brand name. Unaided brand awareness continues to grow as a result of successfully executing viral marketing campaigns bolstered by key events at SoFi Stadium, improving customer satisfaction, driving word-of-mouth and the result of us truly helping people get their money right. Now I'd like to spend some time touching on the segment level results and trends. Lending adjusted net revenue of $342 million grew 15% year-over-year. The personal loans business maintained its strength in the quarter with record originations up 38% from Q3 '22. Student loans, as expected, saw some increasing demand ahead of the resumption of student loan payments marking our highest origination quarter since Q1 of 2022. Within home loans, total originations were up 46% sequentially and 64% year-over-year despite a continued challenging rate environment for both purchase and refi. We continue to fully leverage the benefits of our bank license to drive greater economics in both our Lending and Financial Services businesses. This has resulted in strong net interest income and sequential net interest margin expansion as lower cost deposits on our balance sheet have grown. As of the end of Q3, over 65% of our loans were funded by deposits, and our $2.9 billion of new deposits raised in the quarter were essential in funding our $5.2 billion of total originations and $2.8 billion in net loan growth in the most cost effectively. Our lending capacity remains robust with over $27 billion in total capacity to fund loans and meet liquidity needs, which includes our $15.7 billion of deposits, $3 billion of equity capital and over $8.4 billion of warehouse capacity. Lastly, the bank contributes to strong growth in SoFi Money products, high-quality deposits and great levels of engagement. This has led to higher average account balances even as average spend has increased. SoFi Money products have increased nearly 53% year-over-year to 3.1 million accounts. Given the quality of these members with a median FICO of 743 for our direct deposit portfolio, we see ample opportunity for cross buy. More than 50% of newly funded SoFi Money accounts are setting up direct deposit by day 30. And this account primacy, as expected, has had a significant impact on spending, which exceeded $1 billion in quarterly debit transactions volume, up 3.2x year-over-year and represents more than $5 billion of annualized debit transaction volume. Within Financial Services more broadly, net revenue grew 142% year-over-year and 21% sequentially to $118 million, driven by continued strong monetization within the segment, which Chris will cover in more detail later. What is most impressive in the Financial Services segment is that we reached $3.3 million in contribution profit despite still spending significantly across money, credit card and invest. Moreover, the credit card and invest businesses are still in heavy investment mode, generating significant losses at a run rate of well over $100 million annually, as they scale acquisition in order to achieve variable profitability, they will eventually see positive contribution profit similar to how we delivered with SoFi Money. Selection is one of our key points of differentiation across our products. During Q3, we enabled our investment members to participate in three initial public offerings, including the ODDITY IPO, the Instacart IPO and the ARM IPO, providing retail investors access to IPOs at IPO prices, which was once unthinkable is just another way we are working to help level the playing field for our members. This differentiation helps bring more people onto the platform while increasing brand awareness and member growth. We were delighted to see such high quality demand in these offerings and growth in our member base. For our Technology Platform, full segment revenue of $89.9 million saw a slight acceleration in growth of 6% year-over-year. Importantly, as noted previously, we expect the year-over-year growth rate in Technology Platform revenue to continue to accelerate into Q4 with increased contribution from new partners to the platform along with greater product adoption among the existing partners. Tech Platform's overall diversified growth strategy includes growth in new vertical segments such as B2B and traditional financial institutions, new products and geographies and a focus on partners with large existing customer bases with more durable revenue streams and growth prospects. In Q3, Tech Platform made significant strides against this strategy with the majority of new signed clients bringing existing customer bases and portfolios, which drives much faster time to revenue generation compared to a startup, along with a growing pipeline of joint opportunities selling combined Galileo and Technisys offerings into an expanded customer base. The demand from traditional financial institutions and new categories is the most robust that we've seen. While the lead times for winning RFPs and ensuing integrations are long, measured in many quarters, not months, their transition to modern processing and modern cores is playing out in real time the way we envisioned it would. On the product side, we continue to build and ship a diverse range of products for multiple sectors. We launched a corporate credit solution, which is designed to modernize expense management for both financial and non-financial corporations by introducing a central account with a single credit limit. In addition, we've expanded our Buy Now Pay Later offering to allow lenders to offer it as a form of working capital loans for the small business clients, a great example of the joint Galileo and Technisys capabilities. And third, Galileo powered experienced launch of an innovative debit card program that allows users to improve their credit scores. From a geographic perspective, we received MasterCard certification to provide our payment cards and processing services and five new LatAm countries. Additionally, we have continue to see great product update and new stand-alone products such as our payments risk platform product, which has recently been launched to the entire financial services ecosystem not just existing Galileo clients, as well as Konecta, our natural language AI-driven intelligent digital assistant, which provides faster resolution of customer contacts and reduced contacts per customer for our partners as well as SoFi. I'll finish here by saying how proud I am of the teams relentless ability to not just persevere through the disruption and volatility of the financial services industry in the first three quarters of the year, but to deliver record results. I could not feel more blessed by our great team's ability to execute and importantly, our more than 7 million members that have been so critical in making our vision of being a one-stop shop for all your financial needs become such an amazing reality. With that, let me turn it over to Chris for a review of the financials for the quarter and our outlook.\nChristopher Lapointe: Thanks, Anthony. Overall, we had a great quarter with strong growth trends across the entire business. We achieved record revenue and adjusted EBITDA despite operating in a rapidly evolving macro backdrop with notable financial services industry headwinds. I'm going to walk you through some key financial highlights for the quarter and then share some color on our financial outlook. Unless otherwise stated, I'll be referring to adjusted results for the third quarter of 2023 versus third quarter of 2022. Our GAAP consolidated income statement and all reconciliations can be found in today's earnings release and the subsequent 10-Q filing, which will be made available next week. For the quarter, top line growth remained strong as we delivered record adjusted net revenue of $531 million, up 27% year-over-year and 9% sequentially from the second quarter's record of $489 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $98 million, an 18% margin, also ahead of the prior record quarter at $77 million. This represented over 7 points year-over-year and nearly 3 points of sequential margin improvement demonstrating significant operating leverage across all functional expense lines. In fact, sales and marketing declined as a percentage of adjusted net revenue for the fourth consecutive quarter with marketing intensity 349 basis points lower relative to Q3 '22. Overall, this resulted in a 48% incremental adjusted EBITDA margin year-over-year. If you look at marketing expense per new member, this quarter saw a 17% decline versus last quarter and a 32% decline versus the year ago quarter. This is a function of increased monetization of our member base and investments made in all of our operating segments as well as continued improvement in marketing efficiency and success of our financial services productivity loop. Our GAAP net losses were $267 million this quarter. Excluding the one-time impairment expense of $247 million, net losses would have been $19.5 million, which is a $55 million improvement year-over-year. We saw notable year-over-year leverage in stock-based compensation with SBC dropping to 12% of adjusted net revenue versus 19% in the prior year period. Our incremental GAAP net income margin would have been 48% for the quarter, excluding the one-time goodwill impairment expense. This is a non-cash charge that has no impact on tangible book value, which grew by $68 million to $3.3 billion. We remain committed to achieving GAAP net income profitability in Q4 2023. In terms of GAAP EPS, our reported loss of $0.29, when adjusted to exclude the one-time impairment expense would equate to a loss of $0.03. Now on to the segment level performance, where we saw a strong year-over-year growth across all three segments. In Lending, third quarter adjusted net revenue grew 15% year-over-year to $342 million. Results were driven by a 90% year-over-year growth in our net interest income, while non-interest income was down 51%. Growth in net interest income was driven by 113% year-over-year increase in average interest-earning assets and a 244 basis point year-over-year increase in average yields, resulting in an average net interest margin of 5.99% for the quarter, which is a 13 basis point expansion year-over-year and importantly, a 25 basis point expansion versus Q2 2023. I'd also highlight our $2.9 billion of deposit growth in the quarter compared to the $2.8 billion of net loan growth on the balance sheet period-over-period. With 219 basis points of cost savings between our deposits and our warehouse facilities, this has resulted in a meaningful benefit to our net interest margin and has underscored the advantage of holding loans on the balance sheet and collecting net interest income. We expect to maintain very healthy net interest margin as a result of two things: first, the mix of funding will continue to move toward deposit funding, which is currently north of 60%, and second, we will continue to pass on benchmark rate increases for new loan originations. On the non-interest income side, Q3 originations grew 48% year-over-year to $5.2 billion, and were driven by strong performance from all three products, even as we continued our unrelenting focus of underwriting against our stringent credit standards. We saw record volumes in our personal loans business which grew 38% year-over-year and 4% sequentially to $3.9 billion. Our student loans business saw origination volume double year-over-year and grew notably on a sequential basis to $919 million ahead of the resumption of payments. Home loans grew by 64% year-over-year and 46% sequentially. And this growth despite continued headwinds from the current rate environment, stems from the early benefits of the integration of Wyndham Capital, which has allowed us to add deep fulfillment expertise into our tech stack and better fill member demand. In the third quarter, we sold portions of our personal loan and home loans portfolio. In terms of in-period sales execution levels, we sold personal loans at an execution level of 105.1% and will be sold home loans at a weighted average execution level of 100.2%. In addition, last week, we executed a $100 million sale of personal loans at a 105.1% execution to the same partner who purchased personal loans in Q3 and we agreed to terms with that same partner for a $2 billion forward flow agreement at similar execution levels. We are also in the market, including in discussions with funds and accounts managed by BlackRock with respect to a $375 million securitization at favorable execution levels, and that is expected to close mid-November. Our personal loan borrowers' weighted average income is $167,000 with a weighted average FICO score of 744. Our student loan borrowers weighted average income is $180,000 with a weighted average FICO of 781. Our on-balance sheet delinquency rates and charge-off rates remain healthy and are still below pre-COVID levels. Our on-balance sheet 90-day personal loan delinquency rate was 48 basis points in Q3 '23, while our annualized personal loan charge-off rate was 3.44%. Our on-balance sheet 90-day student loan delinquency rate was 14 basis points in Q3 '23, while our annualized student loan charge-off rate was 38 basis points. We continue to expect very healthy performance relative to broader industry levels. The Lending business delivered $204 million of contribution profit at a 60% margin, up from $181 million a year ago, which represented a 61% margin. Shifting to our Tech Platform, where we delivered record net revenue of $90 million in the quarter, up 6% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Annual revenue growth was driven primarily by Galileo account growth to $137 million in total. The segment delivered a contribution profit of $32 million, representing a 36% margin, up significantly quarter-over-quarter as we leverage investments made to integrate Galileo and Technisys and to position the segment for higher rates of diversified durable growth going forward. We expect the Technology Platform segment revenue to see an acceleration in Q4 with ongoing strong margins as we leverage prior investments. Moving on to Financial Services, where net revenue of $118 million increased to 142% year-over-year with new all-time high revenue for SoFi Money and Invest and continued strong contributions from SoFi Credit Card and Lending as a Service. Overall monetization continues to improve, with annualized revenue per product of $53, up 61% year-over-year versus $33 in Q3 '22, and up nearly 8% sequentially, driven by higher deposits and member spending levels in SoFi Money, greater AUM and monetizable features in SoFi Invest and stability within SoFi Credit Card spend. We reached 8.9 million Financial Services products in the quarter, which is up 50% year-over-year, and we saw record product adds with 957,000 new products in the segment. We hit nearly 3.1 million products in SoFi Money, 2.5 million in SoFi Invest and 3 million in Relay. For the first-time, this segment reached positive contribution profit at $3.3 million for the quarter and we continue to expect positive contribution in the segment in Q4 '23 and beyond. This is while we continue to invest aggressively against ample opportunities to rapidly grow this operating segment with attractive returns. Switching to our balance sheet, where we remain very well capitalized with ample cash and liquidity. Now more than ever, SoFi Bank reinforces our strong balance sheet and provides us with more flexibility and access to a lower cost of capital relative to alternative sources of funding. In Q3, assets grew by $2.4 billion as a result of strong growth in both student and personal loans. On the liability side of the balance sheet, we continued strong growth in deposits, reaching $15.7 billion, up $2.9 billion sequentially versus $2.7 billion in the prior quarter and $2.7 billion in Q1. Important to note that deposit growth outpaced loan growth for the third consecutive quarter, resulting in more efficient funding costs and a lower reliance on warehouse lines as we ramp the portion of loans that are funded by deposits versus other sources of capital. Because of this, we exited the quarter with $4 billion drawn on our $8.4 billion of warehouse facilities. This further highlights our strong liquidity position, particularly in this market. In terms of our regulatory capital ratios, our total capital ratio of 14.5% as of the end of the quarter remains comfortably above the regulatory minimum of 10.5%. Throughout the last 12 months, we have demonstrated the benefit of having a diversified high growth set of revenue streams, multiple cost-efficient sources of capital, a keen focus on underwriting high-quality credit and a high degree of operating leverage as we scale the business. We expect those benefits to persist going forward even in light of the existing macro backdrop. For the full year of 2023, we now expect to deliver revenue of $2.045 billion to $2.065 billion, above our prior guidance of $1.974 billion to $2.034 billion and full year 2023 EBITDA of $386 million to $396 million above our prior guidance of $333 million to $343 million. For the full year, this represents 33% to 34% adjusted net revenue growth, 19% adjusted EBITDA margin and a 48% incremental adjusted EBITDA margin, meaning we expect to drop 48% of all incremental revenue to the bottom line, despite growing at more than 30%. In terms of depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation expense, we expect mid to high-single digit percentage increases in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter results. With that, let's begin the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now open the line for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Andrew Jeffrey of Truist. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. [Technical Difficulty]\nAnthony Noto: Sorry, Andrw. Go ahead.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Okay. Great. Thanks. Appreciate it. I wanted to ask about the decision to sell some personal loans sort of how you arrive at the decision as to which loans you sell and you got great execution in the quarter. Could you compare that to the marks or the assumptions for those loans that you continue to hold on the balance sheet?\nChristopher Lapointe: Yeah. Sure. Thanks for the question. So what I would say here is that we've really built a nice high quality balance sheet that's generating net interest income that's nearly 2 times the costs are directly attributable to expenses to that -- to that segment. Now despite cutting credit and driving up quality of our loans, we are still and will continue to see a lot more opportunity to originate more high quality loans. So selling at these attractive prices at the 105.1% that I mentioned, plus having the opportunity to originate more is optimal at this point. In terms of how the execution compares to where the loans are marked on the book, we sold that 105.1%, and the book is marked at 104.0% which is down 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter despite the weighted average coupon on the overall portfolio increasing.\nAnthony Noto: Operator, next question? Operator, can we take the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Hecht of Jefferies. John, your line is open.\nJohn Hecht: Good morning, guys. Congratulations on the good quarter. I'm just wondering, you've got a resumption of growth in student lending demand, you're still growing the other products too. I'm kind of -- I'm wondering how do we think about kind of the mix at the bank and the NIM at the bank over the next few quarters as the -- particularly the student lending reversed to normal demand sequences?\nAnthony Noto: Yes, it's definitely going to play in our favor. The way, I think about it is, we have a pretty good hand on how we allocate capital. And we're going to allocate the capital based on what's going to give us the best balanced returns. As Chris mentioned, we've grown the balance sheet really well over the last two years since having the bank is generating an impressive amount of net interest income. It's more than covering our cost there. In the quarter, you saw that we drove 67% of our growth in absolute dollars from non-lending from the Tech Platform and from Financial Services. I think you should expect that type of trend to continue in that -- it's balanced or skewed more towards non-lending. As we think about our balance sheet and we think about the student loan business in particular, what I'd say is, we saw exactly the trend that we expected in student loans in the quarter, which was a slight bump relative to where we've been in the past. We don't expect to see a step function change in student loan originations for a couple of reasons. One, I think student loan borrowers, federal student (ph) borrowers are refinancing for the two reasons we mentioned. One is savings specifically in cost relative to their current rate and getting a lower rate, and then others that are looking to lower their monthly payment, some of which are doing that at actually a higher rate than they are today. And so we think that will be a slow steady climb as people hit each month of having to pay their bill. The second factors are decisions. We're going to be very prudent in how we allocate capital to maximize returns. And now that we have four effective loan platforms to allocate that capital to – it’ll really be driven by the opportunity each before being home loans, in school loans, in school student loans, student loan refinancing and then personal loans. The other thing I would just mention is that we did see an acceleration growth in the Technology Platform. The pipeline there is pretty visible and it's the most robust that I've seen. It will take quarters to answer RFPs not months and to integrate partners. But we made the transition of that business over a year ago, and we'll start to anniversary, the tougher comps in Q4, and we'll see an acceleration in that business as well. So really strong prospects and Tech Platform, great trends in Financial services. So think about SLR and PL being additive to growth, not the driver of growth as we go into '24.\nChristopher Lapointe: And then the only other thing I would add, John, in terms of the actual NIM margin specifically, what we are expecting those to remain very healthy throughout the remainder of the year, but we are taking a bit of a conservative approach, and that's what's currently embedded in our guidance. Reason for that is obviously as a result of increases in cost of funds and various pricing strategies as well as a mix shift into student loan refinancing.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Dan Dolev of Mizuho. Your line is open.\nDan Dolev: Hey, guys. Terrific results. Really, really strong. I just have one question. We're at the end of October now. Can you maybe talk about overall trends, consumer health, everything you're seeing into the fourth quarter? There's obviously a lot of debate out there in terms of the overall health of the consumer. I'm sure you're seeing a lot of it. So I would appreciate some comments on that in your business. Thank you.\nAnthony Noto: Sure. First, I'd like to caveat on my comments with the fact that we are relatively unique and that we're a secular grower, not a cyclical grower at this point. Yes, there are cycles in some of our businesses with the vast majority of our growth is us taking market share from existing incumbents as opposed to an indication of the economy or the economic cycle. So secular growth to driving force. That said, we continue to see really strong demand for our products and really strong consumer trends. In SoFi Money, we're seeing balances increase on a per account basis, not just new accounts adding to our deposits. We're also seeing increased spending on a per account basis, not just because we're adding new accounts. And so those two positive underlying trends. We've also seen the quality of our deposits remain strong. 90% of our deposits are from direct deposit customers and 98% are insured deposits, which means they're not just high quality, but they're diversified. In addition to that, our Invest business continues to benefit from the growth of our member base overall and cross buying, and we see nice trends there from an assets under management standpoint. As it relates to loans, we're seeing unprecedented demand for unsecured personal loans. And obviously, we saw an uptick in student loan refinancing. I think the student loan refinancing trend will -- that we report will be more driven by what we decide to underwrite than the actual demand. And I think you can see the same for our personal loans which has been the case for the last two years. We’ve continue to reduce the credits that we're willing to approve, and we're seeing continued strong demand even in higher credits and higher quality. And so Chris, would you add anything to that?\nChristopher Lapointe: No.\nAnthony Noto: Thank you, Dan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mihir Bhatia of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nMihir Bhatia: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the Technology segment. You saw a nice uptick in the contribution margin there this quarter. And I wanted to ask a couple of questions there. Just wanted to get some more details. A, is like, in the -- what drove the uptick in Galileo accounts this quarter? And then, on the contribution margin side, is a big investment period in that segment done at this point? Like, what -- where should you expect segments to trend? And as you grow internationally, is there a difference in the revenue or margin profile between a U.S. account or a Latin American account that we should be just keeping in mind as we think about modeling this business out over the next few years? Thank you.\nAnthony Noto: Thank you for your question. And I'll talk about the overall trends in terms of demand and account growth, and Chris will talk about the leverage that we're getting there and where we are in an investment cycle, which we've talked about in the last couple of years. The demand within the Technology Platform segment is as robust as we've seen. Strategically, we pivoted away about a year, 1.5 years ago from signing up a high number of accounts each quarter that would have a low volume to focusing on larger customers that were more durable and that could not just survive in the economic cycle, but that also could it be durable through the lack of financing in the private market. In addition to focusing on larger customers that are more durable, we started to build out other verticals such as the B2B channel with the products that we have, they serve both B2C companies and B2B companies. In addition to that, we focused on non-financial institutions that have large customer bases and financial institutions do have a large customer base as well to get to times of revenue much faster. We'll start to see the benefits of that slowly gradually hit the revenue number over the next 18 months to 24 months. It won't be a step functional. I don’t want to mislead anybody there, but it will be a nice, steady climb on a nice steady slope. The results of our strategic switch are really paying dividends. And right now, we're in RFP status with a number of large financial institutions. We've actually won a regional bank deal, that's one component of a larger piece of their business that will come on over the next 18 months to 24 months. But the pipeline is very strong in both financial institutions, incumbent banks and non-financial institutions as well as B2B. And so, the growth prospects that we're expecting there really started to come through in a much bigger way as many institutions are under pressure to upgrade their technology and to go after new growth opportunities. I'll let Chris talk about the expenses.\nChristopher Lapointe: Yeah. In terms of the declining attributable costs as well as the margin expansion that we saw at 36%, this is part in due to realizing the benefits of early investments that we've made in these businesses to push technological and product development and to integrate the two platforms. In addition, Q2 was elevated as a result of a few one-time items, including FX and country-related taxes. And then in Q3, we benefited from lower comp and benefits as a result of maxing out on payroll taxes for the year and a few other one-time items. As far as the margin profile looking ahead, you can expect continued strong margin performance as we've already made so many investments to integrate the two businesses and position the combined entity to leverage demand from a broader mix of clients with more durable revenue streams. Overall, we’re expecting margins to be in the upper 20s to 30% in the near term.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Barker of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nKevin Barker: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow up on some of the movements on the balance sheet, particularly the loan sales. We saw capital ratios come down a bit, but it seems like this $2 billion forward flow agreement will release some of that. And also tangible equity grew $68 million. Just given these factors, where do you expect capital ratios to rift over the next couple of quarters? Particularly, if we start to see a larger amount of loans come on balance sheet due to forward flow agreements. Thank you.\nChristopher Lapointe: Yeah. Hey, Kevin. So our total capital ratio, you'll see in the disclosure is 14.5%, that's 400 basis points above our 10.5% regulatory minimum. We aren't currently providing a specific outlook in that ratio. But what I would say is that there are a number of tailwinds that will help bolster our capital ratios. First, we have a growing book value -- we've been growing book value for the last five quarters in a row and expect to sustain that going forward, particularly as we reach GAAP profitability in Q4. As you mentioned, $68 million of tangible book value growth this past quarter and 171 over the course of the last 12 months. Second, we have a robust demand and pipeline of loan buyers that solid execution levels. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are selling $475 million in Q4 at a favorable execution. And we have a $2 billion forward flow lined up at favorable execution. And then third, the size of our loan book and the relatively short duration of personal loans, in particular, the amortization on a quarterly basis is quite material now. Between our personal loans business and the student loan refinancing business in quarter three, amortization or paydowns was $2 billion or $8 billion on an annualized basis. So those three factors combined are going to enable us to continue to originate high quality loans while maintaining healthy total ratios.\nAnthony Noto: The only other thing I'd add, Kevin, is in the call, I mentioned the fact that some of our financial services business are still an aggressive mode of investing, and they have a rescale yet the way the money business has and some of our other businesses within the Financial Services segment. I mentioned that on an annualized basis, we're losing well over $100 million in a couple of those businesses, that's a discretionary expense that we could decide to be more conservative on and drive to profitability faster. The scale that we have in our member base now at over 7 million members really gives us a significant opportunity just to market to our own members in a bigger way to help them get their money right with additional products and services that meet their needs based on the data that we have. And I can't underscore that enough. So that more than $100 million in losses from just two businesses, annualized is also an opportunity if we need to go down that path as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thank you and congratulations on the quarter. I want to ask about member growth. And this is, I think, the first-time in a very long time that we've seen a reacceleration in member growth, wanted to get down into what's driving that? Was that driven by particular member product combinations? Should we expect the sustenance of maybe a slightly higher level of member growth now? Any commentary there?\nAnthony Noto: Yeah. We had a really strong quarter member growth as well as product growth. We exceed -- we set a record in member growth at over 700,000 and a record in product growth with more than $1 million for the first time. I mentioned on last quarter's call that we're starting to see and we're continuing to see this quarter the compounding effects of everything working together across marketing and product as well as the experience in satisfaction word-of-mouth. We've been focused on driving unaided brand awareness because it makes the rest of our marketing more efficient as that goes up, our performance marketing has better performance and it's much more efficient. The second thing is, as you scale your data and information, you're hopeful that you can increase marketing and maintain those levels of efficiency. And I'd say that's been the biggest shift this year as that our marketing efficiencies have maintained as we spent more money, but clearly, we're spending more dollars, but we're getting greater yield from what we're spending, and that's also a factor. But the team has just done a great job of allocating 25% of marketing to brand building, which drives on unaided brand awareness and efficiently spending the other 75% against performance marketing, and then cross-buying continues to be very positive, reinforcing our overall one-stop shop mentality. In terms of the outlook for member growth and product growth, what I'd say is, we have largely been averaging in the 400,000 range for members. I wouldn't start assuming we're going to average over 600,000 or 700,000 today. I think you could start to focus on 500,000 plus members in a quarter and keep it with a five-handle on it, and we’ll see how the quarter goes and how we’re doing overall. We’ve really been focused on driving to profitability. And as we go into 2024, we haven’t set our plans yet. So I wouldn’t set this at a new level. It was an extraordinary quarter. Can we repeat this quarter? Yes, but I wouldn’t plan on it. So I keep the outlook for members in the 500,000 range for now.\nOperator: The next question today comes from Jeff Adelson of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJeffrey Adelson: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. So I think, just looking at the guidance for the full year, it looks like 4Q '23, you're -- it looks like you're looking for something like a 28% to 32% revenue growth exit rate for the year. Just thinking through next year, I know it's early still, but if rates stay where they are at these elevated levels, is that a good number to be thinking about for next year or is there any reason it shouldn't stay where it is? And how should we be thinking about the different revenue components? Should we be seeing continued strength in NII, a little bit less than the fee income, maybe a little more intact platform? And then, Chris, if I could just ask really quick on the $100 million of loans, I think you said you sold at 105.1%. Is that an unhedged or hedge number? And could you just maybe speak quickly to what those loans were? Were they more seasoned or more new originations? Thanks.\nAnthony Noto: Thanks for the question. The first thing I'd say is, the opportunity we have to drive growth is significant. We can drive compounding growth for years, given how large these markets are and their low level of market share. What we choose to grow in 2024 will be a function of the environment as we get through the fourth quarter and where things shape (ph) in January. So we've taken an approach that we give full year guidance at the beginning of the year after we report Q4, so we'll do that again and then will update you each quarter. So I don't want to dig into the details of 2024 because there's a lot left to be decided in '23 as well as in January. Clearly, the Fed has some tough decisions to make, and that could impact the year, so I don't want to make any assumptions on where rates are, especially using a scenario where they're flat versus where they could be up 25 basis points or even 50 basis points as we start the new year. But suffice to say the growth opportunities are in front of us are quite significant, and we can use a lot of different levers that drive that growth. The one thing I will say as we look into 2024, to reiterate what I said earlier, 67% of the growth in absolute dollars in revenue year-over-year were from non-lending businesses. As you go into 2024, you should assume that personal loans and student loans will be additive to growth, not the drivers of growth. Our Technology Platform business and our Financial Services segment business will be the drivers of growth, and we'll supplement that on the lending side. In addition to that, we're committed to GAAP profitability in the fourth quarter of 2023 and for the full year 2024. So those are two guideposts to think about. And then the last I'd say is, we're really focused on tangible book value growth on the trailing 12-month basis in my remarks. And then Chris, we talked about driving over $107 million of tangible book value growth, we're just getting started there. So that's another pillar you could think about.\nChristopher Lapointe: Yes. And then, Jeff, in terms of your question about the $100 million sale in Q4, that was at 105.1% on an unhedged basis. In terms of the actual pool of loans that we sold, we'll get into more details on loan sales in our next quarterly call, specifically as they relate to Q4. But what I would say is that it's generally reflective of the overall portfolio. This specific pool had slightly higher weighted average coupon than the average, but there are other offsetting inputs as well to it. So it's a blend, but we don't talk about the specific loan pools that we’re selling.\nOperator: The next question in the queue comes from Michael Ng of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nMichael Ng: Hey. Good morning. I just have two questions, one for Anthony and one for Chris. First, Anthony, on just sales and marketing efficiency per new member, I wanted to follow up on an earlier question, which was just around that point. Anything you could tell us about in terms of like how sales and marketing per new members becoming more efficient? Do you see continuing opportunities to drive efficiency and effectiveness there? And then for Chris, I wanted to ask about the discount rate changes for personal loans and student loans relative to last quarter. I think the PL discount rate went up by 50 basis points, student loans went up by 40 basis points. Any color there in terms of that increase in the context of how benchmark rates have changed and any other key factors? Thank you.\nAnthony Noto: On the sales and marketing side, there are many factors that are driving efficiency, but I'm going to just focus on the big macro factor. There are others that are much more detail. Over the long term, as we drive our native brand awareness higher, all rest of the money that we spend will be more efficient. If people know the brand, if they trust the brand and we're a household brand name, the promotions we do will have a higher click-through rate, the conversion that we have to new customers and new products will also have a greater efficiency. And so as we scale the business and scale the unaided brand awareness, those will be the two macro drivers. Many other factors in there, tied to (ph) data and channels and additional technologies like artificial intelligence and other algorithms that we have and for retargeting, et cetera. But the biggest factor is going to be unaided brand awareness and the scale that we have.\nChristopher Lapointe: And then in terms of the underlying inputs of our marks and the discount rate move specifically, I'll hit on both PL and SLR, and some of the movements there. So in Q3, the fair market value mark and our PL loans decreased from 104.1% to 104.0%, so it was down 10 basis points. That was a function of the discount rate increasing by 50 basis points. Embedded in that discount rate assumption was that benchmark rates increased 17 basis points, that's a two-year swap, and then spread assumptions widened by about 33 points. And then, we had CPRs increasing and collectively, those were offset by a 20 basis point increase in the weighted average coupon. The one thing that's important to note in the personal loans business is that our actual CDR rates realized in Q3 were 3.44% versus an assumed 4.6% embedded in the marks. So that means what we're actually observing in terms of losses are about 116 basis points per year or 175 basis points over the life of the loan below what is actually embedded in the 104.0% mark. And then, within SLR, the fair market value mark for our student loans decreased from 101.9% to 101.4%, that was 50 basis points, and that was a function of the discount rate increasing by 40 basis points. Our benchmark rates increased by about 35 basis points and then spread assumptions widened slightly. This was offset by a 30 basis point increase in VAT (ph) and prepayment rates ended up decreasing by about 10 basis points.\nOperator: Next in the queue, we have a question from Dominick Gabriele of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nDominick Gabriele: Hey. Good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. I was just curious about if the environment stays roughly the way it is today for demand for your products, on the origination side, in particular, how should we be thinking about the current level of personal loans versus the current level of student loans? And I only asked because given where the quarter went, it feels like you could actually see an acceleration of revenue growth next year. And so, I was just curious what -- how you're feeling about the demand for your products and the current level and market penetration rate that you have in these products? Thanks so much.\nAnthony Noto: Thanks. I can appreciate your enthusiasm. And if we wanted to accelerate revenue growth for next year, we absolutely could, given how low our market shares in all these different businesses. But under this scenario where you have higher for longer, I think we all need to be realistic of what that means for the industry. The demand for our products and higher for longer, as you mentioned will continue to be robust and the opportunity for us to capture that will also be strong. But we can’t just think about SoFi, we also have to think about the other market participants. I do think hire for longer will absolutely put pressure on other financial companies that unlike SoFi are not benefiting from growing deposits and that faced notable interest rate risk because they either don’t hedge. They lack the ability to pass on higher rates the way that we are able to, and those are two really important points. It allows us to manage our assets and liabilities in real time and to do it at a micro level down to the loan level. Higher for longer could put pressure on these other financial companies and in that environment, we would want to be a lot more conservative and actually see something like personal loans, not grow very much at all, and student loans grow marginally. And so as we think about higher for longer, what we think about being very balanced, not because of the opportunity in front of us, but because the tool that may happen around us. As I said earlier, think about personal loans and student loans being additive to growth and the Tech Platform and the Financial Services segment as being the driver of growth. Those are low capital businesses, in fact, nearly capital-free. I’ve also hit the point of profitability, which allows us to step on the gas to drive even more scale on them. We haven’t talked about it yet on the call, but it was not an easy progress over the last six years in which we invested heavily in SoFi Money, SoFi Invest, SoFi Credit Card, SoFi Relay, our land turn product, our app work business, and a number of other businesses that are in that Financial Services segment for it to go from a loss of over $50 million a year ago to a positive profit on a contribution basis of $3 million this year, gives us license to grow that in a much bigger way because we don’t absorb losses the way we were previously. We’re still losing quite a bit of money and invest in credit card given their investment modes but we can really step on the gas on the other products to drive great scale and profitability there. So it’s a great option for us to have. But higher for longer may not be the center for next year. But if you actually believe that’s the scenario, we’re going to be conservative. We’re still going to have really strong growth, but we’ll be very balanced, especially on the origination side.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today comes from Vincent Caintic of Stephens. Please go ahead.\nVincent Caintic: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. And it's great to hear the positive reiteration of positive GAAP net income in the fourth quarter. Just wondering, when we look forward on that trend, and you've talked about revenues accelerating increased efficiencies in the business. So should we expect the profitability of the business to actually continue to accelerate from here or are there investments or something else that you'd like to make in the meantime and how we should anticipate that profitability? Thank you.\nAnthony Noto: Yeah. Obviously, in the fourth quarter, we're expecting the profitability to increase since we go from not generating positive GAAP earnings to generate positive GAAP earnings for the first time. We're committed to generating GAAP -- positive GAAP earnings for all of 2024. We will -- we're still in investment mode, but we have to balance growth versus investment. I would think about the -- what we talked about earlier this year from an investment standpoint, that will focus on 30% incremental EBITDA margins and 20% incremental GAAP net income margins as a guiding factor and how much will adopt to the bottom line versus reinvest in the business. Obviously, this year, we've been well ahead of the 30% incremental EBITDA margin while still maintaining growth. In fact, what I'd say is, I can't find another company that's driven the level of consistent growth that we have in revenue as well as our member base and product base while driving such significant improvement in profitability and building a high quality deposit and funding base and diversifying it, in addition to growing tangible book value by the level that I mentioned. We'll continue to make sure that we balance growth versus profitability next year, and we're committed to GAAP profitability for the full year in that 30% incremental EBITDA margin and 20% GAAP net income margin at a minimum.\nOperator: Thank you. We have no further questions in the queue. So I'll turn the call back over to Anthony Noto for any closing remarks.\nAnthony Noto: Thank you for your questions. I want to end up with the following outlook. I remain confident that no company is better positioned than SoFi to be the winner that takes most in the digital transformation of financial services. Building the technology capabilities to offer our complete suite of financial products on your mobile phone and to support our scale of over 10 million products and over $2 billion in run rate annual revenue has proven to be a daunting challenge, a daunting challenge not just for the most well-equipped incumbent banks and from institutions, but also for the most innovative entrepreneurs. Add to that, the regulatory requirements and sizable financial capital and resources required and it's fair to conclude, SoFi is in a class of one. I could not be prouder of our SoFi team for getting us to this point and thankful to our more than 7 million members whose lives we impact every day. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to addressing you in the next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Christopher Lapointe",
            "content": "Thanks, Anthony. Overall, we had a great quarter with strong growth trends across the entire business. We achieved record revenue and adjusted EBITDA despite operating in a rapidly evolving macro backdrop with notable financial services industry headwinds. I'm going to walk you through some key financial highlights for the quarter and then share some color on our financial outlook. Unless otherwise stated, I'll be referring to adjusted results for the third quarter of 2023 versus third quarter of 2022. Our GAAP consolidated income statement and all reconciliations can be found in today's earnings release and the subsequent 10-Q filing, which will be made available next week. For the quarter, top line growth remained strong as we delivered record adjusted net revenue of $531 million, up 27% year-over-year and 9% sequentially from the second quarter's record of $489 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $98 million, an 18% margin, also ahead of the prior record quarter at $77 million. This represented over 7 points year-over-year and nearly 3 points of sequential margin improvement demonstrating significant operating leverage across all functional expense lines. In fact, sales and marketing declined as a percentage of adjusted net revenue for the fourth consecutive quarter with marketing intensity 349 basis points lower relative to Q3 '22. Overall, this resulted in a 48% incremental adjusted EBITDA margin year-over-year. If you look at marketing expense per new member, this quarter saw a 17% decline versus last quarter and a 32% decline versus the year ago quarter. This is a function of increased monetization of our member base and investments made in all of our operating segments as well as continued improvement in marketing efficiency and success of our financial services productivity loop. Our GAAP net losses were $267 million this quarter. Excluding the one-time impairment expense of $247 million, net losses would have been $19.5 million, which is a $55 million improvement year-over-year. We saw notable year-over-year leverage in stock-based compensation with SBC dropping to 12% of adjusted net revenue versus 19% in the prior year period. Our incremental GAAP net income margin would have been 48% for the quarter, excluding the one-time goodwill impairment expense. This is a non-cash charge that has no impact on tangible book value, which grew by $68 million to $3.3 billion. We remain committed to achieving GAAP net income profitability in Q4 2023. In terms of GAAP EPS, our reported loss of $0.29, when adjusted to exclude the one-time impairment expense would equate to a loss of $0.03. Now on to the segment level performance, where we saw a strong year-over-year growth across all three segments. In Lending, third quarter adjusted net revenue grew 15% year-over-year to $342 million. Results were driven by a 90% year-over-year growth in our net interest income, while non-interest income was down 51%. Growth in net interest income was driven by 113% year-over-year increase in average interest-earning assets and a 244 basis point year-over-year increase in average yields, resulting in an average net interest margin of 5.99% for the quarter, which is a 13 basis point expansion year-over-year and importantly, a 25 basis point expansion versus Q2 2023. I'd also highlight our $2.9 billion of deposit growth in the quarter compared to the $2.8 billion of net loan growth on the balance sheet period-over-period. With 219 basis points of cost savings between our deposits and our warehouse facilities, this has resulted in a meaningful benefit to our net interest margin and has underscored the advantage of holding loans on the balance sheet and collecting net interest income. We expect to maintain very healthy net interest margin as a result of two things: first, the mix of funding will continue to move toward deposit funding, which is currently north of 60%, and second, we will continue to pass on benchmark rate increases for new loan originations. On the non-interest income side, Q3 originations grew 48% year-over-year to $5.2 billion, and were driven by strong performance from all three products, even as we continued our unrelenting focus of underwriting against our stringent credit standards. We saw record volumes in our personal loans business which grew 38% year-over-year and 4% sequentially to $3.9 billion. Our student loans business saw origination volume double year-over-year and grew notably on a sequential basis to $919 million ahead of the resumption of payments. Home loans grew by 64% year-over-year and 46% sequentially. And this growth despite continued headwinds from the current rate environment, stems from the early benefits of the integration of Wyndham Capital, which has allowed us to add deep fulfillment expertise into our tech stack and better fill member demand. In the third quarter, we sold portions of our personal loan and home loans portfolio. In terms of in-period sales execution levels, we sold personal loans at an execution level of 105.1% and will be sold home loans at a weighted average execution level of 100.2%. In addition, last week, we executed a $100 million sale of personal loans at a 105.1% execution to the same partner who purchased personal loans in Q3 and we agreed to terms with that same partner for a $2 billion forward flow agreement at similar execution levels. We are also in the market, including in discussions with funds and accounts managed by BlackRock with respect to a $375 million securitization at favorable execution levels, and that is expected to close mid-November. Our personal loan borrowers' weighted average income is $167,000 with a weighted average FICO score of 744. Our student loan borrowers weighted average income is $180,000 with a weighted average FICO of 781. Our on-balance sheet delinquency rates and charge-off rates remain healthy and are still below pre-COVID levels. Our on-balance sheet 90-day personal loan delinquency rate was 48 basis points in Q3 '23, while our annualized personal loan charge-off rate was 3.44%. Our on-balance sheet 90-day student loan delinquency rate was 14 basis points in Q3 '23, while our annualized student loan charge-off rate was 38 basis points. We continue to expect very healthy performance relative to broader industry levels. The Lending business delivered $204 million of contribution profit at a 60% margin, up from $181 million a year ago, which represented a 61% margin. Shifting to our Tech Platform, where we delivered record net revenue of $90 million in the quarter, up 6% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Annual revenue growth was driven primarily by Galileo account growth to $137 million in total. The segment delivered a contribution profit of $32 million, representing a 36% margin, up significantly quarter-over-quarter as we leverage investments made to integrate Galileo and Technisys and to position the segment for higher rates of diversified durable growth going forward. We expect the Technology Platform segment revenue to see an acceleration in Q4 with ongoing strong margins as we leverage prior investments. Moving on to Financial Services, where net revenue of $118 million increased to 142% year-over-year with new all-time high revenue for SoFi Money and Invest and continued strong contributions from SoFi Credit Card and Lending as a Service. Overall monetization continues to improve, with annualized revenue per product of $53, up 61% year-over-year versus $33 in Q3 '22, and up nearly 8% sequentially, driven by higher deposits and member spending levels in SoFi Money, greater AUM and monetizable features in SoFi Invest and stability within SoFi Credit Card spend. We reached 8.9 million Financial Services products in the quarter, which is up 50% year-over-year, and we saw record product adds with 957,000 new products in the segment. We hit nearly 3.1 million products in SoFi Money, 2.5 million in SoFi Invest and 3 million in Relay. For the first-time, this segment reached positive contribution profit at $3.3 million for the quarter and we continue to expect positive contribution in the segment in Q4 '23 and beyond. This is while we continue to invest aggressively against ample opportunities to rapidly grow this operating segment with attractive returns. Switching to our balance sheet, where we remain very well capitalized with ample cash and liquidity. Now more than ever, SoFi Bank reinforces our strong balance sheet and provides us with more flexibility and access to a lower cost of capital relative to alternative sources of funding. In Q3, assets grew by $2.4 billion as a result of strong growth in both student and personal loans. On the liability side of the balance sheet, we continued strong growth in deposits, reaching $15.7 billion, up $2.9 billion sequentially versus $2.7 billion in the prior quarter and $2.7 billion in Q1. Important to note that deposit growth outpaced loan growth for the third consecutive quarter, resulting in more efficient funding costs and a lower reliance on warehouse lines as we ramp the portion of loans that are funded by deposits versus other sources of capital. Because of this, we exited the quarter with $4 billion drawn on our $8.4 billion of warehouse facilities. This further highlights our strong liquidity position, particularly in this market. In terms of our regulatory capital ratios, our total capital ratio of 14.5% as of the end of the quarter remains comfortably above the regulatory minimum of 10.5%. Throughout the last 12 months, we have demonstrated the benefit of having a diversified high growth set of revenue streams, multiple cost-efficient sources of capital, a keen focus on underwriting high-quality credit and a high degree of operating leverage as we scale the business. We expect those benefits to persist going forward even in light of the existing macro backdrop. For the full year of 2023, we now expect to deliver revenue of $2.045 billion to $2.065 billion, above our prior guidance of $1.974 billion to $2.034 billion and full year 2023 EBITDA of $386 million to $396 million above our prior guidance of $333 million to $343 million. For the full year, this represents 33% to 34% adjusted net revenue growth, 19% adjusted EBITDA margin and a 48% incremental adjusted EBITDA margin, meaning we expect to drop 48% of all incremental revenue to the bottom line, despite growing at more than 30%. In terms of depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation expense, we expect mid to high-single digit percentage increases in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter results. With that, let's begin the Q&A. Yeah. Sure. Thanks for the question. So what I would say here is that we've really built a nice high quality balance sheet that's generating net interest income that's nearly 2 times the costs are directly attributable to expenses to that -- to that segment. Now despite cutting credit and driving up quality of our loans, we are still and will continue to see a lot more opportunity to originate more high quality loans. So selling at these attractive prices at the 105.1% that I mentioned, plus having the opportunity to originate more is optimal at this point. In terms of how the execution compares to where the loans are marked on the book, we sold that 105.1%, and the book is marked at 104.0% which is down 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter despite the weighted average coupon on the overall portfolio increasing. And then the only other thing I would add, John, in terms of the actual NIM margin specifically, what we are expecting those to remain very healthy throughout the remainder of the year, but we are taking a bit of a conservative approach, and that's what's currently embedded in our guidance. Reason for that is obviously as a result of increases in cost of funds and various pricing strategies as well as a mix shift into student loan refinancing. No. Yeah. In terms of the declining attributable costs as well as the margin expansion that we saw at 36%, this is part in due to realizing the benefits of early investments that we've made in these businesses to push technological and product development and to integrate the two platforms. In addition, Q2 was elevated as a result of a few one-time items, including FX and country-related taxes. And then in Q3, we benefited from lower comp and benefits as a result of maxing out on payroll taxes for the year and a few other one-time items. As far as the margin profile looking ahead, you can expect continued strong margin performance as we've already made so many investments to integrate the two businesses and position the combined entity to leverage demand from a broader mix of clients with more durable revenue streams. Overall, we're expecting margins to be in the upper 20s to 30% in the near term. Yeah. Hey, Kevin. So our total capital ratio, you'll see in the disclosure is 14.5%, that's 400 basis points above our 10.5% regulatory minimum. We aren't currently providing a specific outlook in that ratio. But what I would say is that there are a number of tailwinds that will help bolster our capital ratios. First, we have a growing book value -- we've been growing book value for the last five quarters in a row and expect to sustain that going forward, particularly as we reach GAAP profitability in Q4. As you mentioned, $68 million of tangible book value growth this past quarter and 171 over the course of the last 12 months. Second, we have a robust demand and pipeline of loan buyers that solid execution levels. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are selling $475 million in Q4 at a favorable execution. And we have a $2 billion forward flow lined up at favorable execution. And then third, the size of our loan book and the relatively short duration of personal loans, in particular, the amortization on a quarterly basis is quite material now. Between our personal loans business and the student loan refinancing business in quarter three, amortization or paydowns was $2 billion or $8 billion on an annualized basis. So those three factors combined are going to enable us to continue to originate high quality loans while maintaining healthy total ratios. Yes. And then, Jeff, in terms of your question about the $100 million sale in Q4, that was at 105.1% on an unhedged basis. In terms of the actual pool of loans that we sold, we'll get into more details on loan sales in our next quarterly call, specifically as they relate to Q4. But what I would say is that it's generally reflective of the overall portfolio. This specific pool had slightly higher weighted average coupon than the average, but there are other offsetting inputs as well to it. So it's a blend, but we don't talk about the specific loan pools that we're selling. And then in terms of the underlying inputs of our marks and the discount rate move specifically, I'll hit on both PL and SLR, and some of the movements there. So in Q3, the fair market value mark and our PL loans decreased from 104.1% to 104.0%, so it was down 10 basis points. That was a function of the discount rate increasing by 50 basis points. Embedded in that discount rate assumption was that benchmark rates increased 17 basis points, that's a two-year swap, and then spread assumptions widened by about 33 points. And then, we had CPRs increasing and collectively, those were offset by a 20 basis point increase in the weighted average coupon. The one thing that's important to note in the personal loans business is that our actual CDR rates realized in Q3 were 3.44% versus an assumed 4.6% embedded in the marks. So that means what we're actually observing in terms of losses are about 116 basis points per year or 175 basis points over the life of the loan below what is actually embedded in the 104.0% mark. And then, within SLR, the fair market value mark for our student loans decreased from 101.9% to 101.4%, that was 50 basis points, and that was a function of the discount rate increasing by 40 basis points. Our benchmark rates increased by about 35 basis points and then spread assumptions widened slightly. This was offset by a 30 basis point increase in VAT (ph) and prepayment rates ended up decreasing by about 10 basis points."

            "name": "Anthony Noto",
            "content": "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before my formal remarks, I want to take a moment to recognize the devastating tragedy that is currently taking place in Israel, Gaza, and the surrounding regions. It's been incredibly difficult to witness the acts of terrorism and resulting war unfold over the past couple of weeks, and what is sure to be tough days to come. The murder of innocent people is unacceptable in any form, and it's beyond belief that such actions are unfolding in the world today. With that, let's turn to our third quarter results. The third quarter at SoFi marked our 10th consecutive quarter of record revenue and fifth consecutive quarter of record adjusted EBITDA. We delivered strong diversified growth with record revenue and improved margins across all three of our business segments. Among our notable achievements in the quarter, I want to highlight two major milestones. First, 67% of our absolute growth in adjusted net revenue dollars was driven by the non-lending businesses, specifically, the Technology Platform and Financial Services segments; and second, our Financial Services segment achieved positive contribution profit for the first time, making all three reported segments profitable while bolstering our consolidated profitability even while we continue to invest aggressively for high levels of compounding for years to come. These overall results are a testament to our ability to outperform in difficult or rapidly changing environments, but also our ability to deliver on our goals and our overall mission while maintaining financial discipline and continuously setting new operational and financial records. I'm excited to share more about this quarter's notable achievements. A few key financial achievements from the third quarter include: adjusted net revenue of $531 million was 22% year-over-year. And importantly, all three segments recorded record revenue and we continue to diversify the revenue composition. Adjusted EBITDA of $98 million, represented a 48% incremental margin and a record 18% consolidated margin. Our Financial Services segment achieved positive contribution profit of $3.3 million at a 30% margin versus a $4 million loss last quarter and a $53 million loss in the year ago quarter. Our Technology Platform segment had a contribution margin of 36% versus 20% in Q2 and 23% in the year ago quarter. In our Lending segment, more than 77% of our adjusted net revenue was net interest income, which grew 90% year-over-year to $265 million, nearly 2x lending directly attributable expenses of $139 million. That's to say our net interest income is now nearly 2 times greater than our expenses. Segment contribution margin improved by nearly 300 basis points sequentially to 60%. At the company level, excluding one-time items, incremental GAAP net income margin of 48% resulted in a loss of just $19.5 million versus $48 million loss last quarter and a $74 million loss in the year ago quarter. Earnings per share loss, excluding the impact of goodwill impairment was $0.03 per share. SoFi Bank reported $84.8 million of GAAP net income at a 19.3% margin, representing 13% annualized turn on tangible equity. We remain well on track for GAAP profitability for the overall company by Q4 and the years that follow. From a balance sheet perspective, our unique value proposition in SoFi continues to fuel high-quality deposits that increased by a record of $2.9 billion sequentially, and we ended the quarter with nearly $15.7 billion in total deposits. Importantly, more than 90% of our consumer deposits are from sticky direct deposit customers, and 98% of our deposits are insured. Our cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, remained healthy at $2.8 billion, reinforcing our strong liquidity position. We grew tangible book value for the third consecutive quarter by a record of $68 million at the consolidated level. On a trailing 12-month basis, we generated $171 million in tangible book value growth. From a member and product perspective, we added 717,000 new members in Q3 '23, bringing total members to nearly 7 million, up 47% year-over-year and acceleration in growth. Our highest quarter ever of new products in Q3 of $1 million brought total products to $10.4 million at quarter end growing by 45% year-over-year, also an acceleration with record product additions in both lending and financial services. Even with this rapid growth in members, overall products per member remains at 1.5x, reinforcing the appeal of our robust product suite and multiproduct adoption by existing members. Financial Services products of 8.9 million at quarter end grew by 50% year-over-year, while Lending products of over 1.6 million were up 24% year-over-year. I am incredibly proud of these accomplishments and the progress achieved on our march to making SoFi a household brand name. Unaided brand awareness continues to grow as a result of successfully executing viral marketing campaigns bolstered by key events at SoFi Stadium, improving customer satisfaction, driving word-of-mouth and the result of us truly helping people get their money right. Now I'd like to spend some time touching on the segment level results and trends. Lending adjusted net revenue of $342 million grew 15% year-over-year. The personal loans business maintained its strength in the quarter with record originations up 38% from Q3 '22. Student loans, as expected, saw some increasing demand ahead of the resumption of student loan payments marking our highest origination quarter since Q1 of 2022. Within home loans, total originations were up 46% sequentially and 64% year-over-year despite a continued challenging rate environment for both purchase and refi. We continue to fully leverage the benefits of our bank license to drive greater economics in both our Lending and Financial Services businesses. This has resulted in strong net interest income and sequential net interest margin expansion as lower cost deposits on our balance sheet have grown. As of the end of Q3, over 65% of our loans were funded by deposits, and our $2.9 billion of new deposits raised in the quarter were essential in funding our $5.2 billion of total originations and $2.8 billion in net loan growth in the most cost effectively. Our lending capacity remains robust with over $27 billion in total capacity to fund loans and meet liquidity needs, which includes our $15.7 billion of deposits, $3 billion of equity capital and over $8.4 billion of warehouse capacity. Lastly, the bank contributes to strong growth in SoFi Money products, high-quality deposits and great levels of engagement. This has led to higher average account balances even as average spend has increased. SoFi Money products have increased nearly 53% year-over-year to 3.1 million accounts. Given the quality of these members with a median FICO of 743 for our direct deposit portfolio, we see ample opportunity for cross buy. More than 50% of newly funded SoFi Money accounts are setting up direct deposit by day 30. And this account primacy, as expected, has had a significant impact on spending, which exceeded $1 billion in quarterly debit transactions volume, up 3.2x year-over-year and represents more than $5 billion of annualized debit transaction volume. Within Financial Services more broadly, net revenue grew 142% year-over-year and 21% sequentially to $118 million, driven by continued strong monetization within the segment, which Chris will cover in more detail later. What is most impressive in the Financial Services segment is that we reached $3.3 million in contribution profit despite still spending significantly across money, credit card and invest. Moreover, the credit card and invest businesses are still in heavy investment mode, generating significant losses at a run rate of well over $100 million annually, as they scale acquisition in order to achieve variable profitability, they will eventually see positive contribution profit similar to how we delivered with SoFi Money. Selection is one of our key points of differentiation across our products. During Q3, we enabled our investment members to participate in three initial public offerings, including the ODDITY IPO, the Instacart IPO and the ARM IPO, providing retail investors access to IPOs at IPO prices, which was once unthinkable is just another way we are working to help level the playing field for our members. This differentiation helps bring more people onto the platform while increasing brand awareness and member growth. We were delighted to see such high quality demand in these offerings and growth in our member base. For our Technology Platform, full segment revenue of $89.9 million saw a slight acceleration in growth of 6% year-over-year. Importantly, as noted previously, we expect the year-over-year growth rate in Technology Platform revenue to continue to accelerate into Q4 with increased contribution from new partners to the platform along with greater product adoption among the existing partners. Tech Platform's overall diversified growth strategy includes growth in new vertical segments such as B2B and traditional financial institutions, new products and geographies and a focus on partners with large existing customer bases with more durable revenue streams and growth prospects. In Q3, Tech Platform made significant strides against this strategy with the majority of new signed clients bringing existing customer bases and portfolios, which drives much faster time to revenue generation compared to a startup, along with a growing pipeline of joint opportunities selling combined Galileo and Technisys offerings into an expanded customer base. The demand from traditional financial institutions and new categories is the most robust that we've seen. While the lead times for winning RFPs and ensuing integrations are long, measured in many quarters, not months, their transition to modern processing and modern cores is playing out in real time the way we envisioned it would. On the product side, we continue to build and ship a diverse range of products for multiple sectors. We launched a corporate credit solution, which is designed to modernize expense management for both financial and non-financial corporations by introducing a central account with a single credit limit. In addition, we've expanded our Buy Now Pay Later offering to allow lenders to offer it as a form of working capital loans for the small business clients, a great example of the joint Galileo and Technisys capabilities. And third, Galileo powered experienced launch of an innovative debit card program that allows users to improve their credit scores. From a geographic perspective, we received MasterCard certification to provide our payment cards and processing services and five new LatAm countries. Additionally, we have continue to see great product update and new stand-alone products such as our payments risk platform product, which has recently been launched to the entire financial services ecosystem not just existing Galileo clients, as well as Konecta, our natural language AI-driven intelligent digital assistant, which provides faster resolution of customer contacts and reduced contacts per customer for our partners as well as SoFi. I'll finish here by saying how proud I am of the teams relentless ability to not just persevere through the disruption and volatility of the financial services industry in the first three quarters of the year, but to deliver record results. I could not feel more blessed by our great team's ability to execute and importantly, our more than 7 million members that have been so critical in making our vision of being a one-stop shop for all your financial needs become such an amazing reality. With that, let me turn it over to Chris for a review of the financials for the quarter and our outlook. Sorry, Andrw. Go ahead. Operator, next question? Operator, can we take the next question. Yes, it's definitely going to play in our favor. The way, I think about it is, we have a pretty good hand on how we allocate capital. And we're going to allocate the capital based on what's going to give us the best balanced returns. As Chris mentioned, we've grown the balance sheet really well over the last two years since having the bank is generating an impressive amount of net interest income. It's more than covering our cost there. In the quarter, you saw that we drove 67% of our growth in absolute dollars from non-lending from the Tech Platform and from Financial Services. I think you should expect that type of trend to continue in that -- it's balanced or skewed more towards non-lending. As we think about our balance sheet and we think about the student loan business in particular, what I'd say is, we saw exactly the trend that we expected in student loans in the quarter, which was a slight bump relative to where we've been in the past. We don't expect to see a step function change in student loan originations for a couple of reasons. One, I think student loan borrowers, federal student (ph) borrowers are refinancing for the two reasons we mentioned. One is savings specifically in cost relative to their current rate and getting a lower rate, and then others that are looking to lower their monthly payment, some of which are doing that at actually a higher rate than they are today. And so we think that will be a slow steady climb as people hit each month of having to pay their bill. The second factors are decisions. We're going to be very prudent in how we allocate capital to maximize returns. And now that we have four effective loan platforms to allocate that capital to – it'll really be driven by the opportunity each before being home loans, in school loans, in school student loans, student loan refinancing and then personal loans. The other thing I would just mention is that we did see an acceleration growth in the Technology Platform. The pipeline there is pretty visible and it's the most robust that I've seen. It will take quarters to answer RFPs not months and to integrate partners. But we made the transition of that business over a year ago, and we'll start to anniversary, the tougher comps in Q4, and we'll see an acceleration in that business as well. So really strong prospects and Tech Platform, great trends in Financial services. So think about SLR and PL being additive to growth, not the driver of growth as we go into '24. Sure. First, I'd like to caveat on my comments with the fact that we are relatively unique and that we're a secular grower, not a cyclical grower at this point. Yes, there are cycles in some of our businesses with the vast majority of our growth is us taking market share from existing incumbents as opposed to an indication of the economy or the economic cycle. So secular growth to driving force. That said, we continue to see really strong demand for our products and really strong consumer trends. In SoFi Money, we're seeing balances increase on a per account basis, not just new accounts adding to our deposits. We're also seeing increased spending on a per account basis, not just because we're adding new accounts. And so those two positive underlying trends. We've also seen the quality of our deposits remain strong. 90% of our deposits are from direct deposit customers and 98% are insured deposits, which means they're not just high quality, but they're diversified. In addition to that, our Invest business continues to benefit from the growth of our member base overall and cross buying, and we see nice trends there from an assets under management standpoint. As it relates to loans, we're seeing unprecedented demand for unsecured personal loans. And obviously, we saw an uptick in student loan refinancing. I think the student loan refinancing trend will -- that we report will be more driven by what we decide to underwrite than the actual demand. And I think you can see the same for our personal loans which has been the case for the last two years. We've continue to reduce the credits that we're willing to approve, and we're seeing continued strong demand even in higher credits and higher quality. And so Chris, would you add anything to that? Thank you, Dan. Thank you for your question. And I'll talk about the overall trends in terms of demand and account growth, and Chris will talk about the leverage that we're getting there and where we are in an investment cycle, which we've talked about in the last couple of years. The demand within the Technology Platform segment is as robust as we've seen. Strategically, we pivoted away about a year, 1.5 years ago from signing up a high number of accounts each quarter that would have a low volume to focusing on larger customers that were more durable and that could not just survive in the economic cycle, but that also could it be durable through the lack of financing in the private market. In addition to focusing on larger customers that are more durable, we started to build out other verticals such as the B2B channel with the products that we have, they serve both B2C companies and B2B companies. In addition to that, we focused on non-financial institutions that have large customer bases and financial institutions do have a large customer base as well to get to times of revenue much faster. We'll start to see the benefits of that slowly gradually hit the revenue number over the next 18 months to 24 months. It won't be a step functional. I don't want to mislead anybody there, but it will be a nice, steady climb on a nice steady slope. The results of our strategic switch are really paying dividends. And right now, we're in RFP status with a number of large financial institutions. We've actually won a regional bank deal, that's one component of a larger piece of their business that will come on over the next 18 months to 24 months. But the pipeline is very strong in both financial institutions, incumbent banks and non-financial institutions as well as B2B. And so, the growth prospects that we're expecting there really started to come through in a much bigger way as many institutions are under pressure to upgrade their technology and to go after new growth opportunities. I'll let Chris talk about the expenses. The only other thing I'd add, Kevin, is in the call, I mentioned the fact that some of our financial services business are still an aggressive mode of investing, and they have a rescale yet the way the money business has and some of our other businesses within the Financial Services segment. I mentioned that on an annualized basis, we're losing well over $100 million in a couple of those businesses, that's a discretionary expense that we could decide to be more conservative on and drive to profitability faster. The scale that we have in our member base now at over 7 million members really gives us a significant opportunity just to market to our own members in a bigger way to help them get their money right with additional products and services that meet their needs based on the data that we have. And I can't underscore that enough. So that more than $100 million in losses from just two businesses, annualized is also an opportunity if we need to go down that path as well. Yeah. We had a really strong quarter member growth as well as product growth. We exceed -- we set a record in member growth at over 700,000 and a record in product growth with more than $1 million for the first time. I mentioned on last quarter's call that we're starting to see and we're continuing to see this quarter the compounding effects of everything working together across marketing and product as well as the experience in satisfaction word-of-mouth. We've been focused on driving unaided brand awareness because it makes the rest of our marketing more efficient as that goes up, our performance marketing has better performance and it's much more efficient. The second thing is, as you scale your data and information, you're hopeful that you can increase marketing and maintain those levels of efficiency. And I'd say that's been the biggest shift this year as that our marketing efficiencies have maintained as we spent more money, but clearly, we're spending more dollars, but we're getting greater yield from what we're spending, and that's also a factor. But the team has just done a great job of allocating 25% of marketing to brand building, which drives on unaided brand awareness and efficiently spending the other 75% against performance marketing, and then cross-buying continues to be very positive, reinforcing our overall one-stop shop mentality. In terms of the outlook for member growth and product growth, what I'd say is, we have largely been averaging in the 400,000 range for members. I wouldn't start assuming we're going to average over 600,000 or 700,000 today. I think you could start to focus on 500,000 plus members in a quarter and keep it with a five-handle on it, and we'll see how the quarter goes and how we're doing overall. We've really been focused on driving to profitability. And as we go into 2024, we haven't set our plans yet. So I wouldn't set this at a new level. It was an extraordinary quarter. Can we repeat this quarter? Yes, but I wouldn't plan on it. So I keep the outlook for members in the 500,000 range for now. Thanks for the question. The first thing I'd say is, the opportunity we have to drive growth is significant. We can drive compounding growth for years, given how large these markets are and their low level of market share. What we choose to grow in 2024 will be a function of the environment as we get through the fourth quarter and where things shape (ph) in January. So we've taken an approach that we give full year guidance at the beginning of the year after we report Q4, so we'll do that again and then will update you each quarter. So I don't want to dig into the details of 2024 because there's a lot left to be decided in '23 as well as in January. Clearly, the Fed has some tough decisions to make, and that could impact the year, so I don't want to make any assumptions on where rates are, especially using a scenario where they're flat versus where they could be up 25 basis points or even 50 basis points as we start the new year. But suffice to say the growth opportunities are in front of us are quite significant, and we can use a lot of different levers that drive that growth. The one thing I will say as we look into 2024, to reiterate what I said earlier, 67% of the growth in absolute dollars in revenue year-over-year were from non-lending businesses. As you go into 2024, you should assume that personal loans and student loans will be additive to growth, not the drivers of growth. Our Technology Platform business and our Financial Services segment business will be the drivers of growth, and we'll supplement that on the lending side. In addition to that, we're committed to GAAP profitability in the fourth quarter of 2023 and for the full year 2024. So those are two guideposts to think about. And then the last I'd say is, we're really focused on tangible book value growth on the trailing 12-month basis in my remarks. And then Chris, we talked about driving over $107 million of tangible book value growth, we're just getting started there. So that's another pillar you could think about. On the sales and marketing side, there are many factors that are driving efficiency, but I'm going to just focus on the big macro factor. There are others that are much more detail. Over the long term, as we drive our native brand awareness higher, all rest of the money that we spend will be more efficient. If people know the brand, if they trust the brand and we're a household brand name, the promotions we do will have a higher click-through rate, the conversion that we have to new customers and new products will also have a greater efficiency. And so as we scale the business and scale the unaided brand awareness, those will be the two macro drivers. Many other factors in there, tied to (ph) data and channels and additional technologies like artificial intelligence and other algorithms that we have and for retargeting, et cetera. But the biggest factor is going to be unaided brand awareness and the scale that we have. Thanks. I can appreciate your enthusiasm. And if we wanted to accelerate revenue growth for next year, we absolutely could, given how low our market shares in all these different businesses. But under this scenario where you have higher for longer, I think we all need to be realistic of what that means for the industry. The demand for our products and higher for longer, as you mentioned will continue to be robust and the opportunity for us to capture that will also be strong. But we can't just think about SoFi, we also have to think about the other market participants. I do think hire for longer will absolutely put pressure on other financial companies that unlike SoFi are not benefiting from growing deposits and that faced notable interest rate risk because they either don't hedge. They lack the ability to pass on higher rates the way that we are able to, and those are two really important points. It allows us to manage our assets and liabilities in real time and to do it at a micro level down to the loan level. Higher for longer could put pressure on these other financial companies and in that environment, we would want to be a lot more conservative and actually see something like personal loans, not grow very much at all, and student loans grow marginally. And so as we think about higher for longer, what we think about being very balanced, not because of the opportunity in front of us, but because the tool that may happen around us. As I said earlier, think about personal loans and student loans being additive to growth and the Tech Platform and the Financial Services segment as being the driver of growth. Those are low capital businesses, in fact, nearly capital-free. I've also hit the point of profitability, which allows us to step on the gas to drive even more scale on them. We haven't talked about it yet on the call, but it was not an easy progress over the last six years in which we invested heavily in SoFi Money, SoFi Invest, SoFi Credit Card, SoFi Relay, our land turn product, our app work business, and a number of other businesses that are in that Financial Services segment for it to go from a loss of over $50 million a year ago to a positive profit on a contribution basis of $3 million this year, gives us license to grow that in a much bigger way because we don't absorb losses the way we were previously. We're still losing quite a bit of money and invest in credit card given their investment modes but we can really step on the gas on the other products to drive great scale and profitability there. So it's a great option for us to have. But higher for longer may not be the center for next year. But if you actually believe that's the scenario, we're going to be conservative. We're still going to have really strong growth, but we'll be very balanced, especially on the origination side. Yeah. Obviously, in the fourth quarter, we're expecting the profitability to increase since we go from not generating positive GAAP earnings to generate positive GAAP earnings for the first time. We're committed to generating GAAP -- positive GAAP earnings for all of 2024. We will -- we're still in investment mode, but we have to balance growth versus investment. I would think about the -- what we talked about earlier this year from an investment standpoint, that will focus on 30% incremental EBITDA margins and 20% incremental GAAP net income margins as a guiding factor and how much will adopt to the bottom line versus reinvest in the business. Obviously, this year, we've been well ahead of the 30% incremental EBITDA margin while still maintaining growth. In fact, what I'd say is, I can't find another company that's driven the level of consistent growth that we have in revenue as well as our member base and product base while driving such significant improvement in profitability and building a high quality deposit and funding base and diversifying it, in addition to growing tangible book value by the level that I mentioned. We'll continue to make sure that we balance growth versus profitability next year, and we're committed to GAAP profitability for the full year in that 30% incremental EBITDA margin and 20% GAAP net income margin at a minimum. Thank you for your questions. I want to end up with the following outlook. I remain confident that no company is better positioned than SoFi to be the winner that takes most in the digital transformation of financial services. Building the technology capabilities to offer our complete suite of financial products on your mobile phone and to support our scale of over 10 million products and over $2 billion in run rate annual revenue has proven to be a daunting challenge, a daunting challenge not just for the most well-equipped incumbent banks and from institutions, but also for the most innovative entrepreneurs. Add to that, the regulatory requirements and sizable financial capital and resources required and it's fair to conclude, SoFi is in a class of one. I could not be prouder of our SoFi team for getting us to this point and thankful to our more than 7 million members whose lives we impact every day. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to addressing you in the next quarter."

All lines will be muted during the presentation portion of the call with an opportunity for questions-and-answers at the end. [Operator Instruction] At this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Maura Cyr from SoFi Investor Relations. Maura, please proceed.\nMaura Cyr: Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to SoFi's second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me today to talk about our results and recent events are Anthony Noto, CEO, and Chris Lapointe, CFO. You can find the presentation accompanying our earnings release on the Investor Relations section of our website. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations and forecasts, and involve risks and uncertainties.

Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Anthony.\nAnthony Noto: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. The second quarter at SoFi marked our ninth consecutive quarter of record revenue and fourth consecutive quarter of record adjusted EBITDA. These results were bolstered by record revenue in both our Technology Platform business segment, and our Financial Services business segment, which is fueled by record member additions, coupled with strong monetization trends. These results which we achieved despite market volatility and industry disruption reflect the unique diversification of our businesses and the strong execution by our world-class team. I'm incredibly excited to discuss what we've accomplished. I'm even more excited about what is in store for us over the next several quarters as the key underlying trends in each of our segments are indicating continued momentum across the business. A few key financial achievements from the second quarter include, record adjusted net revenue of $489 million, up 37% year-over-year. Record adjusted EBITDA of nearly $77 million, representing a 43% incremental margin, and a 16% consolidated margin. At the company level, we saw an incremental GAAP net income margin of 36% which resulted in a loss of just $48 million. At SoFi Bank, we had over $63 million of GAAP net income at a margin of 17%. From a balance sheet perspective, our unique value proposition in SoFi continues to fuel high-quality deposits, that increased by $2.7 billion sequentially and we ended the quarter with nearly $12.7 billion in deposits. Importantly, more than 90% of our consumer deposits are from sticky direct deposit members, and nearly 98% of our deposits are insured. Our cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, increased by $528 million since March 31 to $3 billion, reinforcing our strong liquidity position. We grew our tangible book value by $14 million. We remain well on track for GAAP profitability by Q4. And a few trends stand out in support of this anticipated achievement. Lending net interest income of $232 million exceeded Lending directly attributable expenses of $139 million. Adjusted EBITDA of $77 million exceeded stock-based compensation expense of $76 million for the second consecutive quarter. And Financial Services contribution loss improved by $20 million versus Q1 2023 to a loss of $4 million, well on its way to reaching positive contribution profit. From a member and product perspective, I would highlight the following. We added a record number of 584,000 new members in Q2 2023, bringing total members to $6.2 million, up 44% year-over-year. Our second highest quarter ever of new products in Q2 of 847,000 brought total products to $9.4 million, up 43% year-over-year. Financial Services products of $7.9 million at quarter end grew by 47%, while Lending products of over $1.5 million were up 25% year-over-year. And lastly, strong growth due to the increasing word-of-mouth reality of SoFi's products as well as our efforts to drive greater unaided brand awareness. As an example, our recent Changing the Face of Finance campaign, which is challenging society's gender bias with respect to women and personal finances resulted in over 72 million impressions in the first five weeks. We have driven this growth with improving efficiency as our full suite of differentiated products and services has continued to resonate with both new and existing members. Now I'd like to spend time touching on segment level results and trends. Lending adjusted net revenue of $322 million grew 29% year-over-year. The Personal Loans business maintained its strength in the quarter, as we originated a record, $3.7 billion, up 51% from the $2.5 billion in Q2 2022. Our underwriting model and our focus on high-quality credit have resulted in dependable performance of these loans as our annualized net charge-off rate was lower quarter-over-quarter at 2.94%. Within Student Loans, we had another quarter of low origination levels. But for the first time in three years, we have clarity for the business as we look towards the latter half of this year. Within Home Loans, we nearly tripled our originations sequentially, aided by the increased capacity, and capabilities via our small acquisition at the beginning of the quarter. Increased capacity and functionality allowed us to launch VA loans, helping deserving veterans find homes with exclusive rates, no origination fees, no down payments, and dedicated loan officers. We continue to fully leverage the benefits of our bank license to drive great economics in both our Lending and Financial Services businesses. This has resulted in strong net interest income and sequential NIM expansion as lower-cost deposits on our balance sheet have grown. As of the end of Q2, 50% of our loans were funded by deposits and our $2.7 billion of new deposits raised in the quarter was essential in funding our $4.4 billion of total originations in the most cost-effective way. Our lending capacity remains robust with over $20 billion in total capacity to fund loans and meet our liquidity needs, with $13 billion of deposits that have grown by over $2 billion a quarter, $3 billion of equity capital, and over $8 billion of warehouse capacity. Lastly, the bank contributes to strong growth in SoFi Money members, high-quality deposits and increasing levels of spending. This has led to high average account balances, even as average spend has increased. SoFi Money members have increased nearly 47% year-over-year to 2.7 million accounts, given the quality of these members with a median FICO score of 747 for our direct deposit portfolio, we see ample opportunity for cross buy. More than 50% of newly funded SoFi Money accounts are setting up direct deposit by day 30. And this has had a significant impact on spending. Q2 annualized spend was over 2.7 times full-year 2022 spend. And Q2 spend per average funded account was up 13% quarter-over quarter. Within Financial Services, more broadly, net revenue more than tripled year-over-year to $98 million and grew 21% sequentially from Q1 2023. This significant revenue growth is driven by three vectors. The first is strong member growth across SoFi Money, Invest, Credit Card, and SoFi Protect. The second is cross buy, as the growing member base takes full advantage of our platform. And the third is monetization. Revenue per Financial Services product has doubled year-over-year to $50, driven by higher deposits and member spending levels in SoFi Money, greater AUM in SoFi Invest, and stability within SoFi Credit Card spend. We expect all three trends to continue their growth momentum. Despite the continued investment in customer acquisition, we have significantly improved the profitability of the Financial Services segment. Financial Services Q2 contribution loss was just $4.3 million, which is a $20 million improvement over the $24 million loss in Q1 2023 and a $44 million loss in Q4 2022. We are seeing significant improvement in unit economics, driving greater operating leverage. The improvement in variable profit per account is a result of higher monetization rates and lower customer acquisition costs due to marketing efficiency and cross buying. The improved unit economics and the scale of members is driving meaningfully greater variable profit dollars than our total acquisition costs. We expect the total Financial Services segment variable profit to exceed our segment fixed costs in Q4, at which point we expect all three of our business segments to post positive contribution profit. Our strong member and product growth reflects our culture of relentless iteration across our five key points of differentiation. For instance, in Q2, we raised the APY and our savings deposits to 4.3% and have since raised it again to 4.4%. We launched SoFi Travel in partnership with Expedia, which includes member discounts and 3% cashback rewards on bookings made with the SoFi Credit Card. SoFi Travel represents our first effort to help our members spend better, the next phase in SoFi's mission to help our members achieve financial independence. Selection is one of our key points of differentiation across our products. Earlier this month, we were the sole retail distributor of the ODDITY IPO, which should be the beginning of a robust pipeline of IPOs after a long drought due to the dampened capital markets IPO activity. Despite our demand being many times oversubscribed, we were able to make an allocation to every single member who confirmed an indication of interest. The differentiation and selection by offering IPOs for Main Street at IPO prices helps drive strong impressions and bring people onto the platform. And ODDITY was no exception. Marketing related to the deal drove a total of 8 million impressions, which not only bolsters the growth in new investment members and more AUM but also increases brand awareness and member growth for the entire platform. For our Technology Platform, record full segment revenue of $87.6 million saw a growth of 13% quarter-over quarter with a 20% margin at the segment level. Importantly, we expect a year-over-year growth rate in Technology Platform revenue to accelerate by Q4, with increased contribution from new partners to the platform along with greater product adoption among existing partners. Tech Platform's overall diversified growth strategy includes: growth in new verticals segments, most notably B2B partners; new products; and new geographies, as well as a focus on partners with large existing customer bases with more durable revenue streams and growth prospects. In Q2, Galileo signed five new clients and made significant strides against this strategy with 100% of new signed clients bring existing customer bases or portfolios, which drives much faster time to revenue generation compared to a start-up company. Along with the growing pipeline of joint opportunities, selling combined Galileo and Technisys offerings into expanded customer base. Technisys saw record revenue in this quarter and continued to make strides towards continued growth bringing four clients live within the quarter. We've also experienced great product uptake in new products such as our Payments Risk Platform product, which helps reduce transaction fraud by leveraging our unique data and algorithms, as well as Konecta, our natural language AI-driven chatbot, which provides faster resolution of customer contacts and reduce contacts per customer for our partners as well as SoFi brands. I'll finish here by saying how proud I am of our team's relentless ability, to not just persevere through the disruption and volatility of the Financial Services industry in the first half of the year, but to deliver record results driven by the [very] (ph) businesses that were vulnerable to that volatility and our Technology Platform and Financial Services segments. I could not feel more blessed by our great team's ability to execute and importantly our over six million members that have been so critical in making our vision of being a one stop shop for all of your financial needs to become such an amazing reality. With that let me turn it over to Chris for a review of the financials for the quarter and our outlook.\nChris Lapointe: Thanks, Anthony. Overall, we had a great quarter with growth trends across the entire business. We achieved record revenue and adjusted EBITDA despite operating in a rapidly evolving macro backdrop amidst notable Financial Services industry headwinds. I'm going to walk you through some key financial highlights for the quarter, and then share some color on our financial outlook. Unless otherwise stated, I'll be referring to adjusted results for the second quarter of 2023 versus second quarter of 2022. Our GAAP consolidated income statement and all reconciliations can be found in today's earnings release and the subsequent 10-Q filing, which will be made available next week. For the quarter, top line growth remains strong as we delivered record adjusted net revenue of $489 million, up 37% year-over-year and 6% sequentially from the first quarter's record of $460 million and above our Q2 guidance of $470 million to $480 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $77 million at a 16% margin, also above the high end of our most recent guidance of $50 million to $60 million, and ahead of the prior record quarter. This represented 10 points of year-over-year margin improvement demonstrating significant operating leverage across all functional expense lines. In fact, sales and marketing declined as a percentage of revenue for the sixth consecutive quarter with marketing intensity approximately 300 basis points lower relative to Q2, 2022. Overall, this resulted in a 43% incremental adjusted EBITDA margin year-over-year. Our GAAP net losses were $48 million this quarter, which is a $48 million improvement year-over-year. We saw a notable year-over-year leverage in stock based compensation with SBC dropping to 15.5% of adjusted net revenue versus 23% in the prior year period. Incremental GAAP net income margin was 36% for the quarter, which represents further progress toward our expectation of GAAP net income profitability in Q4 of 2023. Now on to the segment level performance, where we saw a strong year-over-year growth across all three segments. In Lending, second quarter adjusted net revenue grew 29% year-over-year to $322 million. Results were driven by a 103% year-over-year growth in our net interest income, while non-interest income was down 30%. Growth in net interest income was driven by a 17% year-over-year increase in average interest earning assets and a 289 basis point year-over-year increase in average yields, resulting in a net interest margin of 5.74% for the quarter, which is a 50 basis point expansion year-over-year and importantly a 26 basis point expansion versus Q1, 2023. I'd also highlight our $2.7 billion of deposit growth in the quarter compared to the $2.4 billion of net loan growth on the balance sheet period-over-period. With 216 basis-points of cost savings between our deposits on our warehouse facilities, this has resulted in a meaningful benefit to our net interest margin and has underscored the advantage of holding loans on the balance sheet and collecting net interest income. Looking forward, we expect to maintain a very healthy net interest margin as a result of two things. First, the mix of funding will continue to move towards deposits. And second, we expect to continue to pass on benchmark rate increases for new loan originations to our weighted average coupon. On the non-interest income side, Q2 originations grew 37% year-over-year to $4.4 billion and were driven by record volumes in our personal loans business, which grew 51% year-over-year to $3.7 billion. However, student loan originations were down 1% year-over-year and home loans by 27% year-over-year as macro factors continue to provide headwinds to these businesses. In the second quarter, we sold portions of our personal loan, student loan, and home loan portfolios. In terms of execution levels on these sales in the personal loans business, we executed a sale at 104.1% excluding hedges and 104.5% including hedges. For student loans, we executed at 101.5% excluding hedges, and north of 104% including hedges. For home loans, we executed at 101.2% excluding hedges and north of 102% including hedges. This quarter, we maintained our stringent credit standards and disciplined focus on quality, which has led to a continued strong credit performance. Our personal loan borrowers' weighted average income is $164,000 with a weighted average FICO score of 745. Our student loan borrowers' weighted average income is $163,000 with a weighted average FICO of 768. Our on-balance sheet delinquency rates and charge off rates remain healthy and are still below pre COVID levels. Our on-balance sheet 90 day personal loan delinquency rate was 40 basis points in Q2 2023, while our annualized personal loan charge off rate was down sequentially to 2.94%. Our on-balance sheet 90 day student loan delinquency rate was 13 basis points in Q2 2023, while our annualized student loan charge off rate was 42 basis points. We continue to expect very healthy performance relative to broader industry levels. The Lending business delivered $183 million of contribution profit at a 57% margin, up from $142 million a year-ago, also at 57% margin. Shifting to our Tech Platform, where we delivered record net revenue of $88 million in the quarter, up 4% year-over-year and 13% sequentially. Overall, annual revenue growth was driven primarily by Galileo account growth to a $129 million in total. We also signed nine new clients across the platform. The segment delivered a contribution profit of $17 million representing a 20% margin, which is up quarter-over-quarter. Notably, as we expect to see an acceleration in year-over-year Technology Platform segment revenue growth by Q4, we also anticipate continued margin expansion. Moving on to Financial Services, where net revenue of $98 million increased 223% year-over-year, with new all-time high revenue for SoFi Money and continued strong contributions from SoFi Credit Card, SoFi Invest, and lending-as-a-service. Overall monetization continues to improve with annualized revenue per product reaching $50, more than double the same prior year period and up over 9% sequentially. We reached $7.9 million financial services products in the quarter, which is up 47% year-over-year. And we continue to see strong quarterly product adds with 759,000 new products in the segment versus the prior quarter at 584,000 new adds. We hit nearly 2.7 million products in SoFi Money, 2.3 million in SoFi Invest and 2.6 million in Relay. Contribution losses were $4 million for the quarter, which improved by over $49 million year-over-year and nearly $20 million sequentially as we start to see operating leverage in the segment. We continue to expect positive contribution in the segment by Q4 of 2023. Switching to our balance sheet, where we remain very well-capitalized with ample cash and excess liquidity. Having SoFi Bank further reinforces our strong balance sheet and provides us with more flexibility and access to a lower cost of capital relative to alternative sources of funding. In Q2, assets grew by $3.1 billion as a result of a $528 million increase in cash and cash equivalents, highlighting our strong liquidity position and access to cash, as well as adding loans to the balance sheet, given the impressive growth we continue to see in the personal loan's originations. On the liability side of the balance sheet, we saw significant growth in deposits, as they grew to nearly $13 billion up $2.7 billion sequentially versus $2.7 billion in the prior quarter and $2.3 billion in Q4 of 2022. Because of this, we exited the quarter with $4 million drawn on our $8.5 billion of warehouse facilities. In addition, in the second quarter, we extended our corporate revolver for another five years and upsides it to $645 million. This further highlights our strong liquidity position, particularly in the current market environment. In terms of our regulatory capital ratios, our total capital ratio of 16% as of the end of the quarter remains comfortably above the regulatory minimum. Let me finish up with guidance. Throughout the last 12 months, we have demonstrated the benefit of having a diversified high growth set of revenue streams, multiple cost efficient sources of capital, a keen focus on underwriting high quality credit and a high degree of operating leverage as we scale the business. We expect those benefits to persist going forward even in light of the existing macro backdrop. In the second half of the year, we expect to deliver $1.025 billion to $1.085 billion of adjusted net revenue and $180 million to $190 million of adjusted EBITDA, with a more significant portion of the revenue and EBITDA expected to be generated in Q4. As we move toward expected GAAP net income profitability in the fourth quarter, we expect stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization expenses to be slightly higher than reported Q2 levels in both the third quarter and fourth quarter of the year. This guidance implies full-year 2023 revenues of $1.974 billion to $2.034 billion above our prior guidance of $1.955 billion to $2.02 billion. Our second half guidance implies full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA of $333 million to $343 million above our prior guidance of $268 million to $288 million. This represents a 40% to 44% incremental adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year. Overall, we couldn't be more proud of our Q2 results and continued progress. Having delivered $489 million of adjusted net revenue and $77 million of adjusted EBITDA, we continue to make great progress against our long-term growth objectives and remain very well-capitalized to continue pursuing our ultimate goal of making SoFi a top financial institution. With that, let's begin the Q&A.\nOperator: We'll now open the lines for Q&A [Operator Instruction]. Our first question comes from John Hecht from Jefferies. John, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nJohn Hecht: Thank you. Thanks, guys. Good morning and congratulations on a great quarter. Chris, you gave a few details about some sales of different categories of loans, maybe give us a little bit more on the execution, the details on the execution of those sales.\nChris Lapointe: Hey, John. So in aggregate, we ended up doing about $340 million of whole loan sales in the quarter. Our PL whole loan sale was a $50 million sale and execution level of 104.1%, excluding hedge gains in period and it was 104.5% including hedge against. As of the end of Q2, the PL book was marked at 104.1%. Our student loan sale was a $100 million sale and execution level at 101.5%, excluding hedges, and about 1.4% including hedges. At the end of Q2, the student loan book was marked at about 101.9%. But what I would say is the important thing to note here is that $100 million sale were in-school loans was significantly lower weighted-average lives than the overall portfolio. So they have lower value. However, these specific loans were sold at a higher execution than where they were marked. The remaining $190 million of sales were home loans at an execution of 101.3% excluding hedges, and north of 1.2% including hedges. And as of the end of Q2, the home loans book was marked at 89.2%. As discussed in the past, we remain very well-capitalized, we raised $3.6 billion in 2021, we had access to over $8.5 billion of warehouse lines, only $4 billion of which is currently drawn, and our bank deposit base of nearly $13 billion is really growing quite nicely. Given this flexibility, we'll always maximize returns on loans that we originate as well as the overall firm ROE, and that's going to take different forms given any -- given the market environment that we're operating in at the time. This quarter, we ended up doing a few small sales to keep channels open, but we remain very focused on maximizing returns, which means holding these loans for a longer period of time.\nJohn Hecht: Okay. That's great. Thank you for those details. Second, and maybe for Anthony, I mean, still a lot of momentum in new customer adds. Maybe talk about the channels, is there any mix shift in where you're finding these customers and how you're finding the customers and any change in characteristics of the new customers.\nAnthony Noto: Yes. Thank you, John. For the last 5.5 years, our number one objective in marketing has been to build our native brand awareness. Unaided brand awareness is measured, when you ask 100 people when you need to financial services product, who do you think of? And when we joined the company in 2018, two out of 100 would say SoFi. We've had our unaided brand awareness reach high single digits. It bounces around a little bit, but it's a pretty Herculean effort to go from 2% to high single digits. And the top banks in the country, top five banks in the country are anywhere between 20% and 30%. As we drive that unaided brand awareness, we're building trust, we're becoming a household brand name. Parallel to that, we're doing digital marketing, we're doing other forms of traditional marketing to try to optimize our customer acquisition cost and scale our customer -- our member growth as well as our product growth. And I think this quarter is the first quarter that I can say, I feel really confident the flywheel is really working. And what I mean by that is, we're seeing efficiencies in our customer acquisition cost. And those efficiencies are really more correlated with the unaided brand awareness being increased in addition to the fact that our marketing and product teams are iterating every day through technology and content information analytics to drive those efficiencies. One of the reasons that we're going to be able to achieve contribution profitability in the Financial Services segment, which we're still spending a vast amount of money on acquisition doesn't pay payback for 12 or 24 months is because we're ruling out the unit economics and the customer acquisition cost, therefore we're starting to fill the benefits of reality, we're starting to feel the benefits of efficiency by product, and then, of course, the cross buying at the same time that our monetization is improving. So I wouldn't point to one specific channel or one specific effort. It's the holistic approach that we've taken over the last 5.5 years that is really starting to pay off in the quarter and as we look into Q3 as well.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instruction] Our next question comes from Dan Dolev from Mizuho. Dan, your line is now open. Please go-ahead.\nDan Dolev: Hey, Chris, great results, really amazing. I do have one question only, which is, I noticed that the non-interest income in Lending declined this quarter. Can you give us some color on why that's going on? Thank you.\nChris Lapointe: Hey, Dan. So the non-interest income declined sequentially, and that was a function of fair market value write-downs, which was due to increases in interest rates. And we also had an increase in absolute dollar amount of PL write-offs. Now, while our dollar charge-offs were up sequentially, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our annualized charge-off rate in the quarter for our Personal Loans business was 2.94%, which was down from what it was in Q1. As we've discussed in this current market environment, we do expect net interest income to contribute more meaningfully to the Lending segment revenue. That's because we're seeing a much better return by holding loans for a longer period of time and generating net interest income versus selling or generating near-term monetization opportunities. Now specifically speaking about the fair market value write-down, the marks on our loans across all products ended up decreasing period-over-period. In the Personal Loans business specifically, the fair market value mark decreased from 104.3% to 104.1%, so it's down 20 basis points. This was a function of the discount rate increasing by 60 basis points to 6.1%. And that was a function of the two-year treasury swap rate, increasing by about 69 basis points and spreads tightening by 10 basis points as a result of secondary trade observations. This was partially offset by the portfolio weighted-average coupon increasing by 40 basis point to 13.6% and the conditional prepayment rate assumption decreasing by 10 basis points to 19%. The annual default rate in our assumptions in the mark remained at 4.6%, which was the same as Q1. The one thing that's important to note here is the actual realized Q2 annual default rate was 2.94%, down from the prior quarter. That means what we were actually observing in terms of losses in the quarter are 166 basis points per year or 250 basis points over the life of the loans below what is embedded in our current mark of 104.1%. In the Student Loan business, the fair market value mark decreased from on 101.6% to 101.9%, so it was down 70 basis points sequentially. This was a function of a few things, first, the discount rate ended up increasing by 30 basis points to 4.4%. That was a function of the benchmark rate increasing by 50 basis points and spreads tightening by about 20 basis points. Second, the CDR embedded in the mark increased by 10 basis points to 50 basis points. And then third, the CPR embedded in the mark increased by 20 basis points to 10.6%. Collectively, these were partially offset by the portfolio weighted-average coupon increasing by 10 basis points to 5%. Important thing to note here is that the actual realized Q2 annual default rate was 40 basis points. That means, what we're actually observing in terms of losses are 10 basis points per year or 50 basis points over the life of loan below what is embedded in the current mark of 101.9%.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Perito from KBW. Mike, your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Perito: Hey, Anthony, Chris, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to switch gears a little and ask a question about the balance sheet. I was just wondering when you think about the 2H guide and the full year guide, Chris, I mean, can you maybe give us a little bit of a sense of, what type of balance sheet growth you expect? I mean, there's -- the capital ratios are still fairly healthy today. But continue to move down, is it fair to think that with the elongated whole period on some loans there'll be some more amortization, and then the balance sheet rate of growth should slow from here? Even with strong origination, it's expected to continue? Or how are you guys thinking about that?\nChris Lapointe: Yeah. Sure. What I would say in terms of overall growth from an asset perspective, I would expect similar growth to what we've seen over the course of the last few quarters. But we are seeing an uptick obviously in the amortization down as a result of the pay downs. And then on the liability side, we are expecting continued healthy growth from deposits. We will be able to grow this quarter over $2 billion, but we're expecting to grow over $2 billion, again. So net-net, you could see similar growth in the balance sheet relative to what you saw this past quarter. In terms of capital ratios that you mentioned, those remain extremely healthy in the mid-teens across the board and we have sufficient capital to deploy.\nAnthony Noto: Operator, next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Barker from Piper Sandler. Kevin, your line is now open. Please proceed.\nKevin Barker: Good morning. Thank you. I'd like to follow up on the NIM. Obviously, is it really strong this quarter as you continue to grow, particularly with the personal loans, becoming a real driver of that and the yields that you've been seeing there. Now, as we look into the end of the year, we expect student loan refis to pick-up. Would you expect a little bit of pressure on the net interest margin as you transition more towards student lending versus personal lending? Or do you feel like the growth maybe could accelerate on the asset side just given a pickup in refis from student loans, coupled with momentum on the personal loan side?\nChris Lapointe: So what I would say in terms of Q3, we do expect NIM margins to remain very healthy. But we are taking a conservative view. And that's what's embedded in our overall guidance in the back half of the year, given the potential increases in cost of funds and various pricing strategies as well as the mix shift in our loan originations to student loan refinancings, particularly in Q4. As you know that there is a lag between how we price our loans relative to when the Fed moves rates, given that we price to the forward curve, which impacts our cost of funds once the Fed increases. But we do anticipate being able to maintain very healthy NIM margins, as you saw, they were up sequentially to 5.74% this quarter.\nKevin Barker: All right. Thank you, Chris.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey from Truist. Andrew, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Thanks. Good morning. Appreciate you taking the questions. The deposit growth is super impressive and remained strong and obviously, a real source of differentiation. I wonder, Chris and/or Anthony, if you could comment just on couple of aspects of that. One, sort of the sustainability or in fact, potential for acceleration I think, especially given the fragmentation of the banking industry and the introduction of Fed now. And just two, how do you view that very high or market high APY, I mean, sustainability thereof as you see more competition from similarly high yielding accounts out there from other providers?\nChris Lapointe: Yeah. We're super excited about the progress that we've made over the last year and a half of having the ability to set our own APY and SoFi Money and then to benefit for those high quality deposits to lower our cost of funds on the Lending side, which is really causing the whole P&L to the work well together and a clear competitive advantage. As it relates to deposits, 90% of our deposits or consumer deposits are from direct deposit customers, which is a heck of an achievement, given that we're adding $2 billion dollars plus a quarter. We want to make sure that we have a primary relationship with our members, given our strategy of building a relationship with them in their first product and building that trust and reliability, so if they needs a second product they come to SoFi. So we're going to continue to be very purposeful and focused on high quality deposits and high quality growth. We're comfortable that we continue to add $2 billion of deposits a quarter on the back of member acquisition on SoFi Money. We're also confident that we can continue to compete with anyone on APY. That's a rationale company. And what I mean by that is, we are very unique in that. When we bring in deposits at that 4.4% APY that you get without fees, those deposits have been funding businesses that have an even higher yield are against them in our origination platform. Many of the people that compete in the APY top tier that we compete in do not have that same origination platform and can't generate the same type of yield off of the deposits that we can. And so we have an advantage as it relates to being both an originator of loans and obviously a bank with the deposits that are insured, up to $2 million. In addition to that, we also have the benefit of those Money members coming in and buying another product that has great variable profitability and even better when we don't pay for that customer acquisition cost. So for example, illustratively, these aren't the exact numbers. Let's say, we make about $700 in variable profit on the loan, and the customer acquisition cost for that loan is also $700, which is taken out of that variable profit, if someone cross buys into that loan product for Money, we acquire the Money customer at less than $50, less than $25 often, they cross buy and the profitability of that loan goes from $700 to $1,400. So there's great leverage there. We haven't begun to leverage that type of benefit in terms of thinking about the APY. We're really excited that when rates start to decline and other banks can't maintain the level of APY that we can, how competitive we can be versus them. So, we're going to maintain high quality deposit acquisition, we are going to leverage our competitive advantage to stay at the top tier of that APY and just make sure we focus on quality over quantity.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mihir Bhatia from Bank of America. Mihir, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMihir Bhatia: All right. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. I wanted to really go back to the discussion about the Financial Services Productivity Loop for a second. I was just wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about that, specifically, when you look at Slide 7, is there a specific ratio where you expect that ratio of financial service products to lending products stabilized around? Obviously, products per member seems to have stabilized right now around this 1.5 mark, which -- very impressive given the growth in members. But just wondering about, just the other ratios. And relatedly, if you could also just talk about the major cross buy channels that you currently have and how you see that evolving? Thank you.\nChris Lapointe: While we're growing our member base at -- this quarter it was 44% with a record number of member adds. While we're growing the member base so quickly, that's in the denominator, it's unlikely that the 1.5 products per member that you're using for total products and total members is going to go up. In fact, I think it's a hurricane effort that it's actually stayed stable at 1.5. Typically, if your member base, the denominator is growing that fast, it would put pressure on the portion of 1.5. And then over-time as the member base slow the product growth would accelerate, and that number will start to go up. We're at 1.5 today. The numerator is growing very fast. The denominator is growing very fast. I'd say I expect it to stay in about that range. I wouldn't expect them to start to move-up until the member growth really slowly quite meaningfully, because there is a lag between when a member comes onto the platform and when they take out a second product. And so it's really significant that we're maintaining that 1.5. Over-time my hope would be that they have three, four or five products with us, hopefully they have every product they have with us. We want that lifetime relationship to be with them for all their needs. And so we're going to continue to not just build trust with them, but add product to watch them. So we can be there for all of the major decision that they make, and all the days in between. As it relates to the cross buy channels, we provide that slide in the investor deck that kind of gives you a sense for the products with the highest scale and the most data are the products that are the best that driving cross buy. So if we have a primary relationship with the SoFi Money member and we have their direct deposit, we see what bills they are paying, we see what loans they are paying, we see if they have excess cash that should be invested in [indiscernible] outside of just yielding on the savings account. We see if they're not able to generate discretionary spend that should be invested. If they're not investing in their 20s, it's really hard for them to get to the point that they're financially independent to catch up later on. And so, that primary relationship gives us really great data about their mortgage, about student loans, about budgeting so we can help them get their money right. The Relay product is something we don't talk about that frequently because it doesn't directly drive revenue. But it's also a big contributor to cross buy and a huge contributor on the data side. I have all my of accounts, all of my credit cards, savings accounts, checking accounts across my entire family connected. And I can see real-time in Relay every transaction that's happening with any of my money anywhere it not only gives me great insight on how to budget, but also gives me good insight and what are the areas of inefficiency that I can drive favorable budgetary decisions behind, not to mention, we also get mortgages through Relay, we also get still student loans through Relay, and then, of course, credit cards and refinancing of personal loans.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Eugene Simuni from MoffettNathanson. Eugene, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nEugene Simuni: Thank you. Good morning, guys. Congrats on the strong results. I wanted to ask about student loans. Obviously, we're coming close to the end of the moratorium. So would be great to hear your latest perspective on the level of demand we can expect for refis in Q4 as you're kind of staring at your specific demographic that you're targeting, so been more affluent customers and the level of interest rates that we are at today?\nAnthony Noto: So why don't we start-off by sort of giving one number and also our point of view on student loan refinancing. We're really happy for the American people in that our administration has made a decision on the outlook for student loans, so families can plan accordingly. It is going to be a huge burden for many of them. And the more they know, the better they can plan for the future and we're here to help them in any way that we can. There's over 40 million Americans that still have federal student loans. Think about that number, 40 million Americans. We haven't even refinanced 1 million student loans in our history. In SoFi's entire history, we have not refinanced more than 1 million student loan -- federal loans including private student loans. And so the opportunity in front of us starts with 40 million, and then you can break it down from there based on demographics, based on interest rate, based on term to kind of understand the addressable market. Chris will walk you through sort of our assumptions. One of the biggest points people really need to remember is that, market is very large and people have various different budgetary constraints. Some may refinance at a lower rate and therefore save based on interest rate and some may refinance just to lower their monthly payment. Because there's no penalty for prepaying, there's no penalty for refinancing multiple times. You have no closing costs, no origination fees, no fees tied to it. So if someone needs to create a little bit of cushion in their budget by going from a $500 payment a month to $250, they can do that with no consequences because as rates do come down, they can then refinance again. If rates don't come down, but they want to pay it off in the same term, they can prepay each month more than they're supposed to. So it will be interesting to see what happens over the next six months. And I'm sure that it'll be a battleground for many of you talking about what the outlook is. But over the next 10 years, I think it's an exciting opportunity. And we're glad to be back in the business.\nChris Lapointe: Yes. So specifically related to our H2 guidance, our outlook currently assumes that we're going to be operating at our current run-rate origination levels in the student loan refinancing business until September. After September, we do believe there will be a recovery to higher levels of student loan refinancing revenue than the current trend. But we do not expect to return to pre-COVID levels in 2023.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Wang from Goldman Sachs. Michael, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMichael Wang: Hey, good morning. Thank you very much for the question. I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on your expectation that a bigger portion of the revenue and EBITDA is going to be more 4Q weighted. What are some of the key assumptions around that? Is that just the student loan assumptions you just laid out? And then just as a quick follow-up, I was wondering if you could just let us know if the ODDITY IPO has any impact to Financial Services' revenue and profits. If I recall, I think when you guys did the retail distribution for Rivian and Nubank, there was a little bit of an uplift there. But any thoughts there would be helpful. Thank you.\nAnthony Noto: Sure. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, from a phasing perspective, we expect more robust revenue and EBITDA generation in Q4 versus Q3. We aren't providing detailed segment level guidance. But one thing I will say is that we expect relatively flattish Q3 revenue in our Tech Platform, ahead of an acceleration in growth in Q4, and additional strength in the latter part of the year from our student loan refinancing business. In terms of profit trends, we're going to be front-loading marketing investments with sequential EBITDA expected to be marginally above where consensus is today for Q3 at $58 million. And we expect to see more of a ramp in Q4 EBITDA and achieved GAAP profitability in Q4. And yes, ODDITY IPO.\nChris Lapointe: Yes, on the ODDITY IPO, that we do get fees in these IPOs, they're not that material. The ODDITY IPO is a very big differentiator for our members that have Invest accounts that are members that open Invest accounts in that we're the only place that you can buy that in retail at IPO prices and we really benefit from having that unique selection and acquisition and also AUM, which then leads to revenue. So there is some direct revenue from underwriting or it's being a selling agents. But the bigger benefit is the growth in members and growth in the AUM.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Reggie Smith from J.P. Morgan. Reggie to your line is now open. Please proceed.\nReggie Smith: Hey, good morning. And congrats on the quarter. Two quick questions. The first for Anthony. You talked about becoming a top 10 bank, and I was curious how you define and measure that. And the second question for Chris real quick. I appreciate the disclosure on the loan sales. I was curious, on those personal loans you definitely related the price back to you mark. I was curious what the APR was on those. Is it similar to the broader portfolio at 13.6% or is it higher or lower? Thank you.\nAnthony Noto: Sure. Top 10, its top 10 financial institution, and it's measured by market cap.\nChris Lapointe: Yes. And on the second, the portfolio that we ended up selling had a higher weighted-average coupon but a shorter duration. So net-net resulted in an execution level similar to where the book is marked today.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dominick Gabriele from Oppenheimer, Dominick, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nDominick Gabriele: Hey, thanks so much, and good results. I was just curious about the incremental EBITDA margin. I think the revenue is similar to what we were expecting for the year. But the EBITDA margin is significantly better and above the 70:30 split that you guys usually talk about, about reinvestment. And then when you couple that with the stock-based comp and depreciation perhaps staying elevated, it means that there is some real expense synergies coming through in the underlying business. And I was wondering what your feel is on investments moving forward and if the 70:30 rule has changed? And where in the expense lines, G&A, technology, and product development, any of those buckets you could talk about where you're seeing the most leverage to really raise this incremental EBITDA margin guidance? Thanks.\nAnthony Noto: Sure. Let me kick off. First thing I'd say is, our long-term view is 70:30. So as you think about 2024, definitely bring your mind around 30% incremental EBITDA margin. The world has been very uncertain this year. And that's probably one of the biggest understatements I can make. And because the world has been uncertain, we've held back some investment going into quarters to see where revenue comes out so that we're certain we can always deliver on EBITDA and on GAAP net income and EPS. As the quarter unfolds, we see opportunities to release some of that cushion and to spend it in acquisition. It so happens our business is doing very well. We obviously saw the first time in our history that 50% of our revenue growth year-over-year was actually driven by non-lending businesses. If you look at the change in the Financial Services segment and the change in the Technology segment year-over-year in dollars, it was even with the change in -- in the non-GAAP Lending revenue. So they will equal for the first time. Well, as that growth rate continues, we get a lot of operating leverage in those two segments, and it allows us to drive more to the bottom-line because they're high incremental margin businesses. And in fact, FIS, Financial Services Segment lost $24 million in Q1 and lost only $4 million this quarter. And that's down from $44 million in Q4. So we're seeing great unit economics. And we're seeing great operating leverage covering our fixed cost in those two businesses. And that's contributing to more profitability. We have a goal this year being GAAP profitable. Our number one goal is to make sure we're driving to our financial outcomes as it relates to the business. We want to serve our members well to do that. But based on where we've seen our margins throughout the year and based on the investment opportunities we have in front of us and the efficiency of those opportunities, we're going to drive more profitability in the back half of the year than we otherwise anticipated. Chris can talk to the line items that we're seeing there. But I'd say it's both better unit economics and the fact that we're finally exceeding our fixed cost. And then I want to revisit one question, someone said about accelerating the growth. We're going to focus on quality over quantity. But I will tell you once we achieve GAAP profitability and we cover our acquisition cost, we will have much more of a license to more aggressively spend in acquisition at that 30% level.\nChris Lapointe: Yeah. So Dominick, in terms of where we're seeing the real leverage, it's really across all functional expense lines. As I noted in my prepared remarks, sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue was down 300 basis points year-over-year. Our technology and product development expenses as a percentage of revenue were down 200 basis points. Operations down 300 basis points and G&A down about 800 basis points. So we're really doing a nice job of being able to achieve leverage across the entire system. And we expect that to persist going forward.\nOperator: Thanks you. Our next question comes from Timothy Chiodo from Credit Suisse. Timothy, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nTimothy Chiodo: Great. Thank you. I wanted to talk a little bit about some of the new client wins that you announced for Galileo. If you could just add some context around to the extent you can on sizing or if these are the sort of the majority of the programs coming over to you. You mentioned that they have existing accounts assuming that they're relatively established programs. And also if you could touch on where they were before, if they were with more of a one of your more modern competitors or one of the more traditional competitors?\nAnthony Noto: Thank you for the question on Tech Platform. I'm really proud of the team and the transition that we decided to make in 2022 and we've gone into in 2023. It wasn't easy decision to walk away from a lot of these easy startup types of deals that we can announce on the call in dozens of quantities and then they would tripling with hundreds of thousands of dollars, but a lot of distraction from our team and lot of focus of resources given their young nature. We understood long term that our technology is incredibly unique and the technology stack we have with [indiscernible] multi product core that's modern in the cloud. With processing that's in the cloud in addition to some other great products that sit on top of the platform like our Payment Risk Platform and connect that would you go to market and fight with all the competitive set against the biggest deals in the United States and LATAM. We're really encouraged by the number of requests for proposals that we're seeing from large institutions. These things take time. These are large institutions. Our sense is they're under pressure from regulators to upgrade their technology and they also want to modernize their technology, so they can be more innovative and they can be more reactive in real-time, two different regulatory pressures as well as any disruption in industry like we saw in the first half of this year. So there's definitely sort of a tidal wave of need for new technologies and we have that technology. So I'm really excited that we made that transition and we have that suite of products. We're not going to win every deal. I'm comfortable we will win our fair share. It will take time. In terms of the actual results, I would say we're seeing very small contributions from the new partners that we've added. It definitely was a benefit to the quarter and helped us on the upside. We're seeing still strong, steady growth from our existing partners that are doing quite well. Obviously anniversarying loosing a partner a year ago which we made a tough decision on bit it was the right long-term decision versus the easier near-term decision. But we're now anniversarying that. And as Chris mentioned, we expect the Tech revenue will be flattish in Q3 and then accelerate year-over-year in Q4, as we get more contribution from those new partners that are either already on-board or that will be on-boarded. And I'm really excited about 2024, when the investments that we made this year and onboarding new partners start to kick in even more. So, I think it will be a slow, steady melt up in revenue over-time with the acceleration on a year-over-year basis coming in the fourth-quarter. Nothing to announce in the big bank side or big funds or institution side. We're in conversations with every type of bank you could think of, large banks, regional banks, community banks and then companies that are not banks, but have large consumer basis that they would like to offer financial services products to that we uniquely can do that with.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Wildhack from Autonomous. Robert, your line is now open. Please proceed.\nRobert Wildhack: Good morning, guys. I wanted to follow up on where the current book is marked down sequentially a bit for all the reasons you discussed, Chris. Do you think that that will continue to drift lower in subsequent quarters? And if so, do you think that non-interest income in Lending can stay at the $100 million level that you hit in the second-quarter?\nAnthony Noto: Let me start on that question. One thing I want to make sure people are paying attention to is, what our weighted average coupon is? We're very fortunate and that we've built a sophisticated ability to test different price points against different credit backdrops. And we've been really successful in passing on higher rates in our loans as benchmark rates have gone. Obviously, there are a number of factors beyond weighted average coupon including spread and the benchmark grades and prepayments and defaults in our cost of funds. And I'll let Chris talk through that. But people really should pay attention to what do we do with that weighted average coupon and how is that providing us some leverage uniquely in the marketplace versus competitors as we still gained the significant amount of volume. I'll let Chris talk to the other components of it.\nChris Lapointe: So I already went through the details of where the marks are and how they changed quarter-over-quarter in terms of how we're thinking about or what we expect going into Q3 and the back half of the year. It's going to be dependent on what happens in the market. It's going to depend on what happens with rates. It's going to depend on what happens with charge offs, prepayments, et cetera. We mark-to-market the book every single month. And we take into consideration all of the inputs that I outlined in what drove the changes quarter-over-quarter. So it's highly market dependent. And what I would say is, in this type of environment, given where rates are and the returns that we're generating on our loans by holding them, we would expect net interest income to be a much larger portion of the overall revenue pie for the Lending segment. But that could change depending on market environment.\nAnthony Noto: And hopefully it's cleared by our reported numbers how the -- yield we're getting on the loans is greater than the price people would be willing to pay. That should be obvious from the financial services point.\nOperator: Thank you. I'll now turn it over to Anthony for any closing remarks.\nAnthony Noto: Thank you. People often ask me how. How did SoFi get to such an unprecedented point and being a digital one stop shop for financial services? How did SoFi get to the point that so many companies over the last five years have endeavored to reach, while others now save their aspiration today? How did SoFi do what so many other strive to do? Answer to what contributes to our success is simple. It's our team. It's our people. The people at SoFi that wake up everyday focused on achieving our mission and building our culture, so that we can change the lives of millions of people, and someday, hundreds of millions of people. Yes, that is hundreds of millions of people. Make no mistake about it. No company, no leader, no team has greater ambition or aspirations than we do at SoFi. No company is further along that journey than SoFi. And it's on me to ensure we win every second of every minute of every hour of every day. Thank you for your time today. And I look-forward to addressing you again next quarter.\nOperator: Goodbye. That concludes today's conference call, everybody. Thank you very much, joining. And you may now disconnect your lines. Have a lovely rest of your day.",

            "content": "Thanks, Anthony. Overall, we had a great quarter with growth trends across the entire business. We achieved record revenue and adjusted EBITDA despite operating in a rapidly evolving macro backdrop amidst notable Financial Services industry headwinds. I'm going to walk you through some key financial highlights for the quarter, and then share some color on our financial outlook. Unless otherwise stated, I'll be referring to adjusted results for the second quarter of 2023 versus second quarter of 2022. Our GAAP consolidated income statement and all reconciliations can be found in today's earnings release and the subsequent 10-Q filing, which will be made available next week. For the quarter, top line growth remains strong as we delivered record adjusted net revenue of $489 million, up 37% year-over-year and 6% sequentially from the first quarter's record of $460 million and above our Q2 guidance of $470 million to $480 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $77 million at a 16% margin, also above the high end of our most recent guidance of $50 million to $60 million, and ahead of the prior record quarter. This represented 10 points of year-over-year margin improvement demonstrating significant operating leverage across all functional expense lines. In fact, sales and marketing declined as a percentage of revenue for the sixth consecutive quarter with marketing intensity approximately 300 basis points lower relative to Q2, 2022. Overall, this resulted in a 43% incremental adjusted EBITDA margin year-over-year. Our GAAP net losses were $48 million this quarter, which is a $48 million improvement year-over-year. We saw a notable year-over-year leverage in stock based compensation with SBC dropping to 15.5% of adjusted net revenue versus 23% in the prior year period. Incremental GAAP net income margin was 36% for the quarter, which represents further progress toward our expectation of GAAP net income profitability in Q4 of 2023. Now on to the segment level performance, where we saw a strong year-over-year growth across all three segments. In Lending, second quarter adjusted net revenue grew 29% year-over-year to $322 million. Results were driven by a 103% year-over-year growth in our net interest income, while non-interest income was down 30%. Growth in net interest income was driven by a 17% year-over-year increase in average interest earning assets and a 289 basis point year-over-year increase in average yields, resulting in a net interest margin of 5.74% for the quarter, which is a 50 basis point expansion year-over-year and importantly a 26 basis point expansion versus Q1, 2023. I'd also highlight our $2.7 billion of deposit growth in the quarter compared to the $2.4 billion of net loan growth on the balance sheet period-over-period. With 216 basis-points of cost savings between our deposits on our warehouse facilities, this has resulted in a meaningful benefit to our net interest margin and has underscored the advantage of holding loans on the balance sheet and collecting net interest income. Looking forward, we expect to maintain a very healthy net interest margin as a result of two things. First, the mix of funding will continue to move towards deposits. And second, we expect to continue to pass on benchmark rate increases for new loan originations to our weighted average coupon. On the non-interest income side, Q2 originations grew 37% year-over-year to $4.4 billion and were driven by record volumes in our personal loans business, which grew 51% year-over-year to $3.7 billion. However, student loan originations were down 1% year-over-year and home loans by 27% year-over-year as macro factors continue to provide headwinds to these businesses. In the second quarter, we sold portions of our personal loan, student loan, and home loan portfolios. In terms of execution levels on these sales in the personal loans business, we executed a sale at 104.1% excluding hedges and 104.5% including hedges. For student loans, we executed at 101.5% excluding hedges, and north of 104% including hedges. For home loans, we executed at 101.2% excluding hedges and north of 102% including hedges. This quarter, we maintained our stringent credit standards and disciplined focus on quality, which has led to a continued strong credit performance. Our personal loan borrowers' weighted average income is $164,000 with a weighted average FICO score of 745. Our student loan borrowers' weighted average income is $163,000 with a weighted average FICO of 768. Our on-balance sheet delinquency rates and charge off rates remain healthy and are still below pre COVID levels. Our on-balance sheet 90 day personal loan delinquency rate was 40 basis points in Q2 2023, while our annualized personal loan charge off rate was down sequentially to 2.94%. Our on-balance sheet 90 day student loan delinquency rate was 13 basis points in Q2 2023, while our annualized student loan charge off rate was 42 basis points. We continue to expect very healthy performance relative to broader industry levels. The Lending business delivered $183 million of contribution profit at a 57% margin, up from $142 million a year-ago, also at 57% margin. Shifting to our Tech Platform, where we delivered record net revenue of $88 million in the quarter, up 4% year-over-year and 13% sequentially. Overall, annual revenue growth was driven primarily by Galileo account growth to a $129 million in total. We also signed nine new clients across the platform. The segment delivered a contribution profit of $17 million representing a 20% margin, which is up quarter-over-quarter. Notably, as we expect to see an acceleration in year-over-year Technology Platform segment revenue growth by Q4, we also anticipate continued margin expansion. Moving on to Financial Services, where net revenue of $98 million increased 223% year-over-year, with new all-time high revenue for SoFi Money and continued strong contributions from SoFi Credit Card, SoFi Invest, and lending-as-a-service. Overall monetization continues to improve with annualized revenue per product reaching $50, more than double the same prior year period and up over 9% sequentially. We reached $7.9 million financial services products in the quarter, which is up 47% year-over-year. And we continue to see strong quarterly product adds with 759,000 new products in the segment versus the prior quarter at 584,000 new adds. We hit nearly 2.7 million products in SoFi Money, 2.3 million in SoFi Invest and 2.6 million in Relay. Contribution losses were $4 million for the quarter, which improved by over $49 million year-over-year and nearly $20 million sequentially as we start to see operating leverage in the segment. We continue to expect positive contribution in the segment by Q4 of 2023. Switching to our balance sheet, where we remain very well-capitalized with ample cash and excess liquidity. Having SoFi Bank further reinforces our strong balance sheet and provides us with more flexibility and access to a lower cost of capital relative to alternative sources of funding. In Q2, assets grew by $3.1 billion as a result of a $528 million increase in cash and cash equivalents, highlighting our strong liquidity position and access to cash, as well as adding loans to the balance sheet, given the impressive growth we continue to see in the personal loan's originations. On the liability side of the balance sheet, we saw significant growth in deposits, as they grew to nearly $13 billion up $2.7 billion sequentially versus $2.7 billion in the prior quarter and $2.3 billion in Q4 of 2022. Because of this, we exited the quarter with $4 million drawn on our $8.5 billion of warehouse facilities. In addition, in the second quarter, we extended our corporate revolver for another five years and upsides it to $645 million. This further highlights our strong liquidity position, particularly in the current market environment. In terms of our regulatory capital ratios, our total capital ratio of 16% as of the end of the quarter remains comfortably above the regulatory minimum. Let me finish up with guidance. Throughout the last 12 months, we have demonstrated the benefit of having a diversified high growth set of revenue streams, multiple cost efficient sources of capital, a keen focus on underwriting high quality credit and a high degree of operating leverage as we scale the business. We expect those benefits to persist going forward even in light of the existing macro backdrop. In the second half of the year, we expect to deliver $1.025 billion to $1.085 billion of adjusted net revenue and $180 million to $190 million of adjusted EBITDA, with a more significant portion of the revenue and EBITDA expected to be generated in Q4. As we move toward expected GAAP net income profitability in the fourth quarter, we expect stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization expenses to be slightly higher than reported Q2 levels in both the third quarter and fourth quarter of the year. This guidance implies full-year 2023 revenues of $1.974 billion to $2.034 billion above our prior guidance of $1.955 billion to $2.02 billion. Our second half guidance implies full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA of $333 million to $343 million above our prior guidance of $268 million to $288 million. This represents a 40% to 44% incremental adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year. Overall, we couldn't be more proud of our Q2 results and continued progress. Having delivered $489 million of adjusted net revenue and $77 million of adjusted EBITDA, we continue to make great progress against our long-term growth objectives and remain very well-capitalized to continue pursuing our ultimate goal of making SoFi a top financial institution. With that, let's begin the Q&A. Hey, John. So in aggregate, we ended up doing about $340 million of whole loan sales in the quarter. Our PL whole loan sale was a $50 million sale and execution level of 104.1%, excluding hedge gains in period and it was 104.5% including hedge against. As of the end of Q2, the PL book was marked at 104.1%. Our student loan sale was a $100 million sale and execution level at 101.5%, excluding hedges, and about 1.4% including hedges. At the end of Q2, the student loan book was marked at about 101.9%. But what I would say is the important thing to note here is that $100 million sale were in-school loans was significantly lower weighted-average lives than the overall portfolio. So they have lower value. However, these specific loans were sold at a higher execution than where they were marked. The remaining $190 million of sales were home loans at an execution of 101.3% excluding hedges, and north of 1.2% including hedges. And as of the end of Q2, the home loans book was marked at 89.2%. As discussed in the past, we remain very well-capitalized, we raised $3.6 billion in 2021, we had access to over $8.5 billion of warehouse lines, only $4 billion of which is currently drawn, and our bank deposit base of nearly $13 billion is really growing quite nicely. Given this flexibility, we'll always maximize returns on loans that we originate as well as the overall firm ROE, and that's going to take different forms given any -- given the market environment that we're operating in at the time. This quarter, we ended up doing a few small sales to keep channels open, but we remain very focused on maximizing returns, which means holding these loans for a longer period of time. Hey, Dan. So the non-interest income declined sequentially, and that was a function of fair market value write-downs, which was due to increases in interest rates. And we also had an increase in absolute dollar amount of PL write-offs. Now, while our dollar charge-offs were up sequentially, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our annualized charge-off rate in the quarter for our Personal Loans business was 2.94%, which was down from what it was in Q1. As we've discussed in this current market environment, we do expect net interest income to contribute more meaningfully to the Lending segment revenue. That's because we're seeing a much better return by holding loans for a longer period of time and generating net interest income versus selling or generating near-term monetization opportunities. Now specifically speaking about the fair market value write-down, the marks on our loans across all products ended up decreasing period-over-period. In the Personal Loans business specifically, the fair market value mark decreased from 104.3% to 104.1%, so it's down 20 basis points. This was a function of the discount rate increasing by 60 basis points to 6.1%. And that was a function of the two-year treasury swap rate, increasing by about 69 basis points and spreads tightening by 10 basis points as a result of secondary trade observations. This was partially offset by the portfolio weighted-average coupon increasing by 40 basis point to 13.6% and the conditional prepayment rate assumption decreasing by 10 basis points to 19%. The annual default rate in our assumptions in the mark remained at 4.6%, which was the same as Q1. The one thing that's important to note here is the actual realized Q2 annual default rate was 2.94%, down from the prior quarter. That means what we were actually observing in terms of losses in the quarter are 166 basis points per year or 250 basis points over the life of the loans below what is embedded in our current mark of 104.1%. In the Student Loan business, the fair market value mark decreased from on 101.6% to 101.9%, so it was down 70 basis points sequentially. This was a function of a few things, first, the discount rate ended up increasing by 30 basis points to 4.4%. That was a function of the benchmark rate increasing by 50 basis points and spreads tightening by about 20 basis points. Second, the CDR embedded in the mark increased by 10 basis points to 50 basis points. And then third, the CPR embedded in the mark increased by 20 basis points to 10.6%. Collectively, these were partially offset by the portfolio weighted-average coupon increasing by 10 basis points to 5%. Important thing to note here is that the actual realized Q2 annual default rate was 40 basis points. That means, what we're actually observing in terms of losses are 10 basis points per year or 50 basis points over the life of loan below what is embedded in the current mark of 101.9%. Yeah. Sure. What I would say in terms of overall growth from an asset perspective, I would expect similar growth to what we've seen over the course of the last few quarters. But we are seeing an uptick obviously in the amortization down as a result of the pay downs. And then on the liability side, we are expecting continued healthy growth from deposits. We will be able to grow this quarter over $2 billion, but we're expecting to grow over $2 billion, again. So net-net, you could see similar growth in the balance sheet relative to what you saw this past quarter. In terms of capital ratios that you mentioned, those remain extremely healthy in the mid-teens across the board and we have sufficient capital to deploy. So what I would say in terms of Q3, we do expect NIM margins to remain very healthy. But we are taking a conservative view. And that's what's embedded in our overall guidance in the back half of the year, given the potential increases in cost of funds and various pricing strategies as well as the mix shift in our loan originations to student loan refinancings, particularly in Q4. As you know that there is a lag between how we price our loans relative to when the Fed moves rates, given that we price to the forward curve, which impacts our cost of funds once the Fed increases. But we do anticipate being able to maintain very healthy NIM margins, as you saw, they were up sequentially to 5.74% this quarter. Yeah. We're super excited about the progress that we've made over the last year and a half of having the ability to set our own APY and SoFi Money and then to benefit for those high quality deposits to lower our cost of funds on the Lending side, which is really causing the whole P&L to the work well together and a clear competitive advantage. As it relates to deposits, 90% of our deposits or consumer deposits are from direct deposit customers, which is a heck of an achievement, given that we're adding $2 billion dollars plus a quarter. We want to make sure that we have a primary relationship with our members, given our strategy of building a relationship with them in their first product and building that trust and reliability, so if they needs a second product they come to SoFi. So we're going to continue to be very purposeful and focused on high quality deposits and high quality growth. We're comfortable that we continue to add $2 billion of deposits a quarter on the back of member acquisition on SoFi Money. We're also confident that we can continue to compete with anyone on APY. That's a rationale company. And what I mean by that is, we are very unique in that. When we bring in deposits at that 4.4% APY that you get without fees, those deposits have been funding businesses that have an even higher yield are against them in our origination platform. Many of the people that compete in the APY top tier that we compete in do not have that same origination platform and can't generate the same type of yield off of the deposits that we can. And so we have an advantage as it relates to being both an originator of loans and obviously a bank with the deposits that are insured, up to $2 million. In addition to that, we also have the benefit of those Money members coming in and buying another product that has great variable profitability and even better when we don't pay for that customer acquisition cost. So for example, illustratively, these aren't the exact numbers. Let's say, we make about $700 in variable profit on the loan, and the customer acquisition cost for that loan is also $700, which is taken out of that variable profit, if someone cross buys into that loan product for Money, we acquire the Money customer at less than $50, less than $25 often, they cross buy and the profitability of that loan goes from $700 to $1,400. So there's great leverage there. We haven't begun to leverage that type of benefit in terms of thinking about the APY. We're really excited that when rates start to decline and other banks can't maintain the level of APY that we can, how competitive we can be versus them. So, we're going to maintain high quality deposit acquisition, we are going to leverage our competitive advantage to stay at the top tier of that APY and just make sure we focus on quality over quantity. While we're growing our member base at -- this quarter it was 44% with a record number of member adds. While we're growing the member base so quickly, that's in the denominator, it's unlikely that the 1.5 products per member that you're using for total products and total members is going to go up. In fact, I think it's a hurricane effort that it's actually stayed stable at 1.5. Typically, if your member base, the denominator is growing that fast, it would put pressure on the portion of 1.5. And then over-time as the member base slow the product growth would accelerate, and that number will start to go up. We're at 1.5 today. The numerator is growing very fast. The denominator is growing very fast. I'd say I expect it to stay in about that range. I wouldn't expect them to start to move-up until the member growth really slowly quite meaningfully, because there is a lag between when a member comes onto the platform and when they take out a second product. And so it's really significant that we're maintaining that 1.5. Over-time my hope would be that they have three, four or five products with us, hopefully they have every product they have with us. We want that lifetime relationship to be with them for all their needs. And so we're going to continue to not just build trust with them, but add product to watch them. So we can be there for all of the major decision that they make, and all the days in between. As it relates to the cross buy channels, we provide that slide in the investor deck that kind of gives you a sense for the products with the highest scale and the most data are the products that are the best that driving cross buy. So if we have a primary relationship with the SoFi Money member and we have their direct deposit, we see what bills they are paying, we see what loans they are paying, we see if they have excess cash that should be invested in [indiscernible] outside of just yielding on the savings account. We see if they're not able to generate discretionary spend that should be invested. If they're not investing in their 20s, it's really hard for them to get to the point that they're financially independent to catch up later on. And so, that primary relationship gives us really great data about their mortgage, about student loans, about budgeting so we can help them get their money right. The Relay product is something we don't talk about that frequently because it doesn't directly drive revenue. But it's also a big contributor to cross buy and a huge contributor on the data side. I have all my of accounts, all of my credit cards, savings accounts, checking accounts across my entire family connected. And I can see real-time in Relay every transaction that's happening with any of my money anywhere it not only gives me great insight on how to budget, but also gives me good insight and what are the areas of inefficiency that I can drive favorable budgetary decisions behind, not to mention, we also get mortgages through Relay, we also get still student loans through Relay, and then, of course, credit cards and refinancing of personal loans. Yes. So specifically related to our H2 guidance, our outlook currently assumes that we're going to be operating at our current run-rate origination levels in the student loan refinancing business until September. After September, we do believe there will be a recovery to higher levels of student loan refinancing revenue than the current trend. But we do not expect to return to pre-COVID levels in 2023. Yes, on the ODDITY IPO, that we do get fees in these IPOs, they're not that material. The ODDITY IPO is a very big differentiator for our members that have Invest accounts that are members that open Invest accounts in that we're the only place that you can buy that in retail at IPO prices and we really benefit from having that unique selection and acquisition and also AUM, which then leads to revenue. So there is some direct revenue from underwriting or it's being a selling agents. But the bigger benefit is the growth in members and growth in the AUM. Yes. And on the second, the portfolio that we ended up selling had a higher weighted-average coupon but a shorter duration. So net-net resulted in an execution level similar to where the book is marked today. Yeah. So Dominick, in terms of where we're seeing the real leverage, it's really across all functional expense lines. As I noted in my prepared remarks, sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue was down 300 basis points year-over-year. Our technology and product development expenses as a percentage of revenue were down 200 basis points. Operations down 300 basis points and G&A down about 800 basis points. So we're really doing a nice job of being able to achieve leverage across the entire system. And we expect that to persist going forward. So I already went through the details of where the marks are and how they changed quarter-over-quarter in terms of how we're thinking about or what we expect going into Q3 and the back half of the year. It's going to be dependent on what happens in the market. It's going to depend on what happens with rates. It's going to depend on what happens with charge offs, prepayments, et cetera. We mark-to-market the book every single month. And we take into consideration all of the inputs that I outlined in what drove the changes quarter-over-quarter. So it's highly market dependent. And what I would say is, in this type of environment, given where rates are and the returns that we're generating on our loans by holding them, we would expect net interest income to be a much larger portion of the overall revenue pie for the Lending segment. But that could change depending on market environment."

            "name": "Anthony Noto",
            "content": "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. The second quarter at SoFi marked our ninth consecutive quarter of record revenue and fourth consecutive quarter of record adjusted EBITDA. These results were bolstered by record revenue in both our Technology Platform business segment, and our Financial Services business segment, which is fueled by record member additions, coupled with strong monetization trends. These results which we achieved despite market volatility and industry disruption reflect the unique diversification of our businesses and the strong execution by our world-class team. I'm incredibly excited to discuss what we've accomplished. I'm even more excited about what is in store for us over the next several quarters as the key underlying trends in each of our segments are indicating continued momentum across the business. A few key financial achievements from the second quarter include, record adjusted net revenue of $489 million, up 37% year-over-year. Record adjusted EBITDA of nearly $77 million, representing a 43% incremental margin, and a 16% consolidated margin. At the company level, we saw an incremental GAAP net income margin of 36% which resulted in a loss of just $48 million. At SoFi Bank, we had over $63 million of GAAP net income at a margin of 17%. From a balance sheet perspective, our unique value proposition in SoFi continues to fuel high-quality deposits, that increased by $2.7 billion sequentially and we ended the quarter with nearly $12.7 billion in deposits. Importantly, more than 90% of our consumer deposits are from sticky direct deposit members, and nearly 98% of our deposits are insured. Our cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, increased by $528 million since March 31 to $3 billion, reinforcing our strong liquidity position. We grew our tangible book value by $14 million. We remain well on track for GAAP profitability by Q4. And a few trends stand out in support of this anticipated achievement. Lending net interest income of $232 million exceeded Lending directly attributable expenses of $139 million. Adjusted EBITDA of $77 million exceeded stock-based compensation expense of $76 million for the second consecutive quarter. And Financial Services contribution loss improved by $20 million versus Q1 2023 to a loss of $4 million, well on its way to reaching positive contribution profit. From a member and product perspective, I would highlight the following. We added a record number of 584,000 new members in Q2 2023, bringing total members to $6.2 million, up 44% year-over-year. Our second highest quarter ever of new products in Q2 of 847,000 brought total products to $9.4 million, up 43% year-over-year. Financial Services products of $7.9 million at quarter end grew by 47%, while Lending products of over $1.5 million were up 25% year-over-year. And lastly, strong growth due to the increasing word-of-mouth reality of SoFi's products as well as our efforts to drive greater unaided brand awareness. As an example, our recent Changing the Face of Finance campaign, which is challenging society's gender bias with respect to women and personal finances resulted in over 72 million impressions in the first five weeks. We have driven this growth with improving efficiency as our full suite of differentiated products and services has continued to resonate with both new and existing members. Now I'd like to spend time touching on segment level results and trends. Lending adjusted net revenue of $322 million grew 29% year-over-year. The Personal Loans business maintained its strength in the quarter, as we originated a record, $3.7 billion, up 51% from the $2.5 billion in Q2 2022. Our underwriting model and our focus on high-quality credit have resulted in dependable performance of these loans as our annualized net charge-off rate was lower quarter-over-quarter at 2.94%. Within Student Loans, we had another quarter of low origination levels. But for the first time in three years, we have clarity for the business as we look towards the latter half of this year. Within Home Loans, we nearly tripled our originations sequentially, aided by the increased capacity, and capabilities via our small acquisition at the beginning of the quarter. Increased capacity and functionality allowed us to launch VA loans, helping deserving veterans find homes with exclusive rates, no origination fees, no down payments, and dedicated loan officers. We continue to fully leverage the benefits of our bank license to drive great economics in both our Lending and Financial Services businesses. This has resulted in strong net interest income and sequential NIM expansion as lower-cost deposits on our balance sheet have grown. As of the end of Q2, 50% of our loans were funded by deposits and our $2.7 billion of new deposits raised in the quarter was essential in funding our $4.4 billion of total originations in the most cost-effective way. Our lending capacity remains robust with over $20 billion in total capacity to fund loans and meet our liquidity needs, with $13 billion of deposits that have grown by over $2 billion a quarter, $3 billion of equity capital, and over $8 billion of warehouse capacity. Lastly, the bank contributes to strong growth in SoFi Money members, high-quality deposits and increasing levels of spending. This has led to high average account balances, even as average spend has increased. SoFi Money members have increased nearly 47% year-over-year to 2.7 million accounts, given the quality of these members with a median FICO score of 747 for our direct deposit portfolio, we see ample opportunity for cross buy. More than 50% of newly funded SoFi Money accounts are setting up direct deposit by day 30. And this has had a significant impact on spending. Q2 annualized spend was over 2.7 times full-year 2022 spend. And Q2 spend per average funded account was up 13% quarter-over quarter. Within Financial Services, more broadly, net revenue more than tripled year-over-year to $98 million and grew 21% sequentially from Q1 2023. This significant revenue growth is driven by three vectors. The first is strong member growth across SoFi Money, Invest, Credit Card, and SoFi Protect. The second is cross buy, as the growing member base takes full advantage of our platform. And the third is monetization. Revenue per Financial Services product has doubled year-over-year to $50, driven by higher deposits and member spending levels in SoFi Money, greater AUM in SoFi Invest, and stability within SoFi Credit Card spend. We expect all three trends to continue their growth momentum. Despite the continued investment in customer acquisition, we have significantly improved the profitability of the Financial Services segment. Financial Services Q2 contribution loss was just $4.3 million, which is a $20 million improvement over the $24 million loss in Q1 2023 and a $44 million loss in Q4 2022. We are seeing significant improvement in unit economics, driving greater operating leverage. The improvement in variable profit per account is a result of higher monetization rates and lower customer acquisition costs due to marketing efficiency and cross buying. The improved unit economics and the scale of members is driving meaningfully greater variable profit dollars than our total acquisition costs. We expect the total Financial Services segment variable profit to exceed our segment fixed costs in Q4, at which point we expect all three of our business segments to post positive contribution profit. Our strong member and product growth reflects our culture of relentless iteration across our five key points of differentiation. For instance, in Q2, we raised the APY and our savings deposits to 4.3% and have since raised it again to 4.4%. We launched SoFi Travel in partnership with Expedia, which includes member discounts and 3% cashback rewards on bookings made with the SoFi Credit Card. SoFi Travel represents our first effort to help our members spend better, the next phase in SoFi's mission to help our members achieve financial independence. Selection is one of our key points of differentiation across our products. Earlier this month, we were the sole retail distributor of the ODDITY IPO, which should be the beginning of a robust pipeline of IPOs after a long drought due to the dampened capital markets IPO activity. Despite our demand being many times oversubscribed, we were able to make an allocation to every single member who confirmed an indication of interest. The differentiation and selection by offering IPOs for Main Street at IPO prices helps drive strong impressions and bring people onto the platform. And ODDITY was no exception. Marketing related to the deal drove a total of 8 million impressions, which not only bolsters the growth in new investment members and more AUM but also increases brand awareness and member growth for the entire platform. For our Technology Platform, record full segment revenue of $87.6 million saw a growth of 13% quarter-over quarter with a 20% margin at the segment level. Importantly, we expect a year-over-year growth rate in Technology Platform revenue to accelerate by Q4, with increased contribution from new partners to the platform along with greater product adoption among existing partners. Tech Platform's overall diversified growth strategy includes: growth in new verticals segments, most notably B2B partners; new products; and new geographies, as well as a focus on partners with large existing customer bases with more durable revenue streams and growth prospects. In Q2, Galileo signed five new clients and made significant strides against this strategy with 100% of new signed clients bring existing customer bases or portfolios, which drives much faster time to revenue generation compared to a start-up company. Along with the growing pipeline of joint opportunities, selling combined Galileo and Technisys offerings into expanded customer base. Technisys saw record revenue in this quarter and continued to make strides towards continued growth bringing four clients live within the quarter. We've also experienced great product uptake in new products such as our Payments Risk Platform product, which helps reduce transaction fraud by leveraging our unique data and algorithms, as well as Konecta, our natural language AI-driven chatbot, which provides faster resolution of customer contacts and reduce contacts per customer for our partners as well as SoFi brands. I'll finish here by saying how proud I am of our team's relentless ability, to not just persevere through the disruption and volatility of the Financial Services industry in the first half of the year, but to deliver record results driven by the [very] (ph) businesses that were vulnerable to that volatility and our Technology Platform and Financial Services segments. I could not feel more blessed by our great team's ability to execute and importantly our over six million members that have been so critical in making our vision of being a one stop shop for all of your financial needs to become such an amazing reality. With that let me turn it over to Chris for a review of the financials for the quarter and our outlook. Yes. Thank you, John. For the last 5.5 years, our number one objective in marketing has been to build our native brand awareness. Unaided brand awareness is measured, when you ask 100 people when you need to financial services product, who do you think of? And when we joined the company in 2018, two out of 100 would say SoFi. We've had our unaided brand awareness reach high single digits. It bounces around a little bit, but it's a pretty Herculean effort to go from 2% to high single digits. And the top banks in the country, top five banks in the country are anywhere between 20% and 30%. As we drive that unaided brand awareness, we're building trust, we're becoming a household brand name. Parallel to that, we're doing digital marketing, we're doing other forms of traditional marketing to try to optimize our customer acquisition cost and scale our customer -- our member growth as well as our product growth. And I think this quarter is the first quarter that I can say, I feel really confident the flywheel is really working. And what I mean by that is, we're seeing efficiencies in our customer acquisition cost. And those efficiencies are really more correlated with the unaided brand awareness being increased in addition to the fact that our marketing and product teams are iterating every day through technology and content information analytics to drive those efficiencies. One of the reasons that we're going to be able to achieve contribution profitability in the Financial Services segment, which we're still spending a vast amount of money on acquisition doesn't pay payback for 12 or 24 months is because we're ruling out the unit economics and the customer acquisition cost, therefore we're starting to fill the benefits of reality, we're starting to feel the benefits of efficiency by product, and then, of course, the cross buying at the same time that our monetization is improving. So I wouldn't point to one specific channel or one specific effort. It's the holistic approach that we've taken over the last 5.5 years that is really starting to pay off in the quarter and as we look into Q3 as well. Operator, next question? So why don't we start-off by sort of giving one number and also our point of view on student loan refinancing. We're really happy for the American people in that our administration has made a decision on the outlook for student loans, so families can plan accordingly. It is going to be a huge burden for many of them. And the more they know, the better they can plan for the future and we're here to help them in any way that we can. There's over 40 million Americans that still have federal student loans. Think about that number, 40 million Americans. We haven't even refinanced 1 million student loans in our history. In SoFi's entire history, we have not refinanced more than 1 million student loan -- federal loans including private student loans. And so the opportunity in front of us starts with 40 million, and then you can break it down from there based on demographics, based on interest rate, based on term to kind of understand the addressable market. Chris will walk you through sort of our assumptions. One of the biggest points people really need to remember is that, market is very large and people have various different budgetary constraints. Some may refinance at a lower rate and therefore save based on interest rate and some may refinance just to lower their monthly payment. Because there's no penalty for prepaying, there's no penalty for refinancing multiple times. You have no closing costs, no origination fees, no fees tied to it. So if someone needs to create a little bit of cushion in their budget by going from a $500 payment a month to $250, they can do that with no consequences because as rates do come down, they can then refinance again. If rates don't come down, but they want to pay it off in the same term, they can prepay each month more than they're supposed to. So it will be interesting to see what happens over the next six months. And I'm sure that it'll be a battleground for many of you talking about what the outlook is. But over the next 10 years, I think it's an exciting opportunity. And we're glad to be back in the business. Sure. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, from a phasing perspective, we expect more robust revenue and EBITDA generation in Q4 versus Q3. We aren't providing detailed segment level guidance. But one thing I will say is that we expect relatively flattish Q3 revenue in our Tech Platform, ahead of an acceleration in growth in Q4, and additional strength in the latter part of the year from our student loan refinancing business. In terms of profit trends, we're going to be front-loading marketing investments with sequential EBITDA expected to be marginally above where consensus is today for Q3 at $58 million. And we expect to see more of a ramp in Q4 EBITDA and achieved GAAP profitability in Q4. And yes, ODDITY IPO. Sure. Top 10, its top 10 financial institution, and it's measured by market cap. Sure. Let me kick off. First thing I'd say is, our long-term view is 70:30. So as you think about 2024, definitely bring your mind around 30% incremental EBITDA margin. The world has been very uncertain this year. And that's probably one of the biggest understatements I can make. And because the world has been uncertain, we've held back some investment going into quarters to see where revenue comes out so that we're certain we can always deliver on EBITDA and on GAAP net income and EPS. As the quarter unfolds, we see opportunities to release some of that cushion and to spend it in acquisition. It so happens our business is doing very well. We obviously saw the first time in our history that 50% of our revenue growth year-over-year was actually driven by non-lending businesses. If you look at the change in the Financial Services segment and the change in the Technology segment year-over-year in dollars, it was even with the change in -- in the non-GAAP Lending revenue. So they will equal for the first time. Well, as that growth rate continues, we get a lot of operating leverage in those two segments, and it allows us to drive more to the bottom-line because they're high incremental margin businesses. And in fact, FIS, Financial Services Segment lost $24 million in Q1 and lost only $4 million this quarter. And that's down from $44 million in Q4. So we're seeing great unit economics. And we're seeing great operating leverage covering our fixed cost in those two businesses. And that's contributing to more profitability. We have a goal this year being GAAP profitable. Our number one goal is to make sure we're driving to our financial outcomes as it relates to the business. We want to serve our members well to do that. But based on where we've seen our margins throughout the year and based on the investment opportunities we have in front of us and the efficiency of those opportunities, we're going to drive more profitability in the back half of the year than we otherwise anticipated. Chris can talk to the line items that we're seeing there. But I'd say it's both better unit economics and the fact that we're finally exceeding our fixed cost. And then I want to revisit one question, someone said about accelerating the growth. We're going to focus on quality over quantity. But I will tell you once we achieve GAAP profitability and we cover our acquisition cost, we will have much more of a license to more aggressively spend in acquisition at that 30% level. Thank you for the question on Tech Platform. I'm really proud of the team and the transition that we decided to make in 2022 and we've gone into in 2023. It wasn't easy decision to walk away from a lot of these easy startup types of deals that we can announce on the call in dozens of quantities and then they would tripling with hundreds of thousands of dollars, but a lot of distraction from our team and lot of focus of resources given their young nature. We understood long term that our technology is incredibly unique and the technology stack we have with [indiscernible] multi product core that's modern in the cloud. With processing that's in the cloud in addition to some other great products that sit on top of the platform like our Payment Risk Platform and connect that would you go to market and fight with all the competitive set against the biggest deals in the United States and LATAM. We're really encouraged by the number of requests for proposals that we're seeing from large institutions. These things take time. These are large institutions. Our sense is they're under pressure from regulators to upgrade their technology and they also want to modernize their technology, so they can be more innovative and they can be more reactive in real-time, two different regulatory pressures as well as any disruption in industry like we saw in the first half of this year. So there's definitely sort of a tidal wave of need for new technologies and we have that technology. So I'm really excited that we made that transition and we have that suite of products. We're not going to win every deal. I'm comfortable we will win our fair share. It will take time. In terms of the actual results, I would say we're seeing very small contributions from the new partners that we've added. It definitely was a benefit to the quarter and helped us on the upside. We're seeing still strong, steady growth from our existing partners that are doing quite well. Obviously anniversarying loosing a partner a year ago which we made a tough decision on bit it was the right long-term decision versus the easier near-term decision. But we're now anniversarying that. And as Chris mentioned, we expect the Tech revenue will be flattish in Q3 and then accelerate year-over-year in Q4, as we get more contribution from those new partners that are either already on-board or that will be on-boarded. And I'm really excited about 2024, when the investments that we made this year and onboarding new partners start to kick in even more. So, I think it will be a slow, steady melt up in revenue over-time with the acceleration on a year-over-year basis coming in the fourth-quarter. Nothing to announce in the big bank side or big funds or institution side. We're in conversations with every type of bank you could think of, large banks, regional banks, community banks and then companies that are not banks, but have large consumer basis that they would like to offer financial services products to that we uniquely can do that with. Let me start on that question. One thing I want to make sure people are paying attention to is, what our weighted average coupon is? We're very fortunate and that we've built a sophisticated ability to test different price points against different credit backdrops. And we've been really successful in passing on higher rates in our loans as benchmark rates have gone. Obviously, there are a number of factors beyond weighted average coupon including spread and the benchmark grades and prepayments and defaults in our cost of funds. And I'll let Chris talk through that. But people really should pay attention to what do we do with that weighted average coupon and how is that providing us some leverage uniquely in the marketplace versus competitors as we still gained the significant amount of volume. I'll let Chris talk to the other components of it. And hopefully it's cleared by our reported numbers how the -- yield we're getting on the loans is greater than the price people would be willing to pay. That should be obvious from the financial services point. Thank you. People often ask me how. How did SoFi get to such an unprecedented point and being a digital one stop shop for financial services? How did SoFi get to the point that so many companies over the last five years have endeavored to reach, while others now save their aspiration today? How did SoFi do what so many other strive to do? Answer to what contributes to our success is simple. It's our team. It's our people. The people at SoFi that wake up everyday focused on achieving our mission and building our culture, so that we can change the lives of millions of people, and someday, hundreds of millions of people. Yes, that is hundreds of millions of people. Make no mistake about it. No company, no leader, no team has greater ambition or aspirations than we do at SoFi. No company is further along that journey than SoFi. And it's on me to ensure we win every second of every minute of every hour of every day. Thank you for your time today. And I look-forward to addressing you again next quarter."

All lines will be muted during the presentation portion of the call with an opportunity for questions-and-answers at the end. At this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Maura Cyr SoFi Investor Relations. Maura, please proceed.\nMaura Cyr: Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to SoFi's first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me today to talk about our results and recent events are Anthony Noto, CEO; and Chris Lapointe, CFO. You can find the presentation accompanying our earnings release on the Investor Relations section of our website.

And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Anthony.\nAnthony Noto: Thank you, Maura, and good morning, everyone. The first quarter at SoFi was an incredible beginning to what is already turning out to be yet another eventful year in the macro environment. Amid all the volatility, we delivered another quarter of record revenue and adjusted EBITDA with strong overall operating results, reinforcing the strength of our strategy and our ability to execute with excellence. A few key achievements from the first quarter include: our eighth consecutive quarter of record adjusted net revenue of $460 million, up 43% year-over-year with record revenue in lending and financial services, as well as continued strength in tech platform; our third consecutive quarter of record adjusted EBITDA at nearly $76 million, representing a 48% incremental margin and a 16% margin overall; and incremental GAAP net income margin of 54%, resulting in a loss of just $34 million. Deposits increased by $2.7 billion sequentially, marking another record quarter and now exceed $10 billion in total deposits. Importantly, more than 90% of our consumer deposits are from sticky direct deposit members and 97% of our deposits are insured. Our cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet increased by $1.1 billion to $2.5 billion since year-end, reinforcing our strong liquidity position. Once again, we are achieving several financial inflection points. Adjusted EBITDA of $76 million is now greater than stock based compensation at $64 million, which actually declined. And this is another critical step towards GAAP net income profitability. We achieved positive variable profit in the Financial Services segment and remain on track for positive contribution profit by year end. Additionally, lending net interest income revenue or NIM revenue of $201 million exceeded lending non-interest income of $136 million for the second consecutive quarter. And importantly, our NIM revenue is meaningfully greater than our Lending segment directly attributable expenses of $115 million. These trends increased the visibility and reinforce our goal of achieving positive GAAP net income in Q4 2023. Along those lines, we had another quarter of positive GAAP net income for SoFi Bank at $73 million, reflecting a 20% margin and a 23% return on average tangible equity on our way to expected 30% returns within the bank over the long term. Lastly, the quality of our bank operating and liquidity metrics remain robust and have improved since year end. We saw new record levels of unaided brand awareness in the quarter and continued strong cross buy trends, which helped drive strong year-over-year growth in members and products with decreasing marketing spend intensity. The 433,000 new members in Q1, 2023 brings total members to nearly 5.7 million, up 46% year-over-year. We also added 660,000 new products in Q1 ending with nearly 8.6 million total products, also up 46% year-over-year. Of these new adds, Financial Services products totaled 7.1 million at quarter end and grew by 51% year-over-year, while lending products of 1.4 million were up 24% year-over-year. Sales and marketing expenses as a% of revenue declined nearly 100 basis points from last quarter and nearly 475 basis points from a year ago. The strength of our results once again underscores how our full suite of differentiated products and services provides the foundation for a uniquely diversified business that is able to endure through market cycles, as well as exogenous factors. We talk often about our ability to act nimbly in a rapidly changing environment. There were several examples once again this last quarter, but I'd like to take a moment to highlight one that really exemplifies nimble execution to truly help our members at the most critical time. As the recent bank crisis developed, our team was able to bring our deposits FDIC insurance capabilities from offering $250,000 to $2 million within a week, providing comfort and safety to our members and enabling 97% of our deposits to now be insured versus 92% before the increase. Now I'd like to spend time touching on segment level results, as well as the structural advantage of our product strategy and having a bank charter. In lending, we generated a record $325 million of adjusted net revenue, up 33% versus the prior year period. Our personal loan performance more than offset the continued headwinds in demand for student loan refinancing and the less robust performance of home loans. Student loan refi continues to be impacted as federal borrowers still await clarity on the end of the moratorium on federal student loan payments. Home Loans faces macro headwinds from rising rates, while we continue the process of integrating Wyndham Capital Mortgage, which we acquired at the beginning of Q2 2023. The Personal Loans business maintained its strength in Q1, hitting record originations of nearly $3 billion, up 46% from $2 billion in Q1 2022. This product continues to deliver even as we maintain our stringent credit standards and pass on rate increases to our borrowers. While these origination levels themselves are impressive, the strength of our balance sheet and diversification of our funding sources provide new options to fund origination growth, while driving efficiencies with cost savings. These advantages are a direct result of SoFi Bank. Having more balance sheet flexibility allows us to capture more net interest income and optimize returns, which provides more stable earnings in any macro environment. But it's especially important in times of excess volatility. As of the end of Q1 2023, 44% of our loans were funded by deposits and our $2.7 billion of new deposits raised in the quarter helped fund our $3.6 billion of total originations in the most cost effective way. Our lending capacity remains robust with over $20 billion in total capacity to fund loans and meet our liquidity needs with $10 billion of deposits which have grown by $2 billion a quarter, $3 billion of equity capital and $8.6 billion of warehouse capacity. Lastly, the bank contributes to strong growth in SoFi Money members, high quality deposits and great levels of engagement. This has led to a higher average account balances even as average spend has increased. More than 50% of newly funded SoFi Money accounts are setting up direct deposit by day 30, and this has had a significant impact on spending. Q1 annualized spend was 2 times 2022 spend and Q1 spend per average funded account was up 15% quarter-over-quarter. SoFi Money members have increased over 48% year-over-year to 2.4 million accounts. Given the quality of these members, with a median FICO score of 749 for our direct deposit portfolio, we see ample opportunity for cross buy. This is a great segue into financial services more broadly where net revenue more than tripled year-over-year to $81 million and grew 25% from $65 million in Q4 2022. Contribution loss of $24 million improved $19 million versus the previous quarter and we achieved variable profitability for the first time in the segment, even as we maintained elevated marketing expenses in the first quarter. We've continued to achieve strong member and product growth by iterating on products to ensure they are differentiated on four key factors. Fast, selection, content convenience and continue to invest to make them work better when used together. So far in Q2, we continue to iterate on these products. Last week, we raised our savings rate again to 4.2% and just this morning we announced SoFi Travel in partnership with Expedia, which will include member discounts and 3% cash back rewards on bookings made with the SoFi credit card. SoFi Travel is a digital destination that represents our first non-financial product effort to help our members spend better in the next phase in SoFi's mission to help our members achieve financial independence. We finished Q1 with 7.1 million financial services products, up 51% year-over-year and 5 times total lending products of 1.4 million. The increased scale in financial services helps drive cross-buy and marketing efficiencies. Financial Services sales and marketing spend as a percentage of net revenue was 51% versus 60% in Q1 of last year. We continue to scale our top of the funnel products given the attractive monetization opportunities by capitalizing on our improved brand awareness and network effects. We saw this increased efficiency even with the fact that these products have a 12 month to 18 month payback period. For Technology Platform, full segment revenue of nearly $78 million saw growth of 28% year-over-year with a 19% margin at the segment level or 28% if you exclude Technisys. Galileo's overall diversified growth strategy includes growth in new verticals, new products and new geographies. With a focus on larger customers that have large installed basins. In Q1, Galileo signed five new clients and made big strides in the strategy with 80% of newly signed clients having existing customers or portfolios, along with a growing pipeline of [drawing] (ph) opportunities selling Galileo and Technisys offerings to an expanded customer base. Technisys recently signed one new client in Mexico and has entered into a proof-of-concept stage with a large U.S. legacy financial institution. With that, let me turn it over to Chris for a review of the financials for the quarter.\nChris Lapointe: Thanks, Anthony. We started the year with a great quarter, which saw strong growth trends across the entire business. We achieved record revenue and adjusted EBITDA despite operating in a rapidly evolving macro backdrop. I'm going to walk you through some key financial highlights for the quarter, and then share some color on our financial outlook. Unless otherwise stated, I'll be referring to adjusted results for the first quarter of 2023 versus first quarter of 2022. Our GAAP consolidated income statement and all reconciliations can be found in today's earnings release and the subsequent 10-Q filing, which will be made available next week. For the quarter, top line growth remains strong as we delivered record adjusted net revenue of $460 million, up 43% year-over-year and 4% sequential from the fourth quarter's record of $443 million and above our Q1 guidance of $430 million to $440 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $76 million at a 16% margin, also above the high end of our most recent guidance of $40 million to $45 million and ahead of the prior quarter record. This represented 14 points of year-over-year margin improvement, demonstrating the strong operating leverage of the business as it scales. Year-over-year margin improvement has been driven by significant operating leverage across our sales and marketing, G&A and ops functional expense lines. Overall, this resulted in a 48% incremental adjusted EBITDA margin year-over-year. Our GAAP net losses were $34 million this quarter, which is a $76 million improvement year-over-year and a $6 million improvement sequentially. Our incremental GAAP net income margin was 54% for the quarter. In addition to our adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, we saw meaningful leverage against stock based compensation as a percentage of net revenue at 14% in Q1 2023, down from 16% in the fourth quarter and 24% in the prior year quarter. This represents further progress toward our expectation of GAAP net income profitability in Q4 2023. Now, on to the segment level performance where we saw strong year-over-year growth across all three segments. In Lending, first quarter adjusted net revenue grew 33% year-over-year to $325 million. Results were driven by 113% year-over-year growth in our net interest income, while non-interest income was down 17%. Growth in net interest income was driven by a 99% year-over-year increase in average interest earning assets and a 318 basis point year-over-year increase in average yields, resulting in an average net interest margin of 5.5% for the quarter. This represents roughly 110 basis points of year-over-year NIM expansion. Q1 originations grew 7% year-over-year to $3.6 billion and were driven by record volumes in our personal loans business, which grew 46% year-over-year to nearly $3 billion. However, student loan originations were down 47% year-over-year and home loans by 71% year-over-year, as the extension of the federal student loan moratorium and macro factors continue to provide headwinds to these businesses. We achieved this top line growth while maintaining our stringent credit standards and disciplined focus on quality. Our personal loan borrower’s weighted average income is $164,000 with a weighted average FICO score of 747. Our student loan barrower’s weighted average income is $173,000 with a weighted average FICO of 769. This continued focus on quality has led to strong credit performance. Our on balance sheet delinquency rates and charge off rates remain healthy and are still below pre-COVID levels. Our on balance sheet 90 day personal loan delinquency rate was 38 basis points in Q1 2023, while our annualized personal loan charge off rate was 2.97%. Considering the weighted average life of the personal loans on our balance sheet, our portfolio life of loan losses are forecasted to be 4.5%, which is below our risk tolerance. Our on balance sheet 90 day student loan delinquency rate was 12 basis points in Q1 2023, while our annualized student loan charge off rate was 0.34%. As we've expressed in the past, it is reasonable to expect credit metrics to revert over time to more normalized pre pandemic levels, but continue to expect very healthy performance relative to broader industry levels. The Lending business delivered $210 million of contribution profit at a 65% margin, up from $133 million a year ago and a 54% margin. This improvement was driven by a mix shift to higher margin personal loans revenue, as well as sales and marketing and ops efficiencies and fixed cost leverage across the entire segment. Shifting to tech platform, where we delivered net revenue of $78 million in the quarter, up 28% year-over-year, while Galileo revenue was up 3% year-over-year. Overall, annual revenue growth was driven primarily by Galileo account growth to $126 million in total. We also signed five new clients in Galileo and on in Technisys, and we finished the task of moving every client to the cloud with 100% of transactions now migrated. Sequentially, revenue and contribution profit declined in the segment due to seasonality in transaction volumes, along with timing implications from shifting focus to larger potential partners with larger existing businesses, B2B customers and a more durable customer base which has longer sales cycles. The segment delivered a contribution profit of $15 million, representing a 19% margin and 28% if you were to exclude Technisys. Moving on to financial services, where net revenue of $81 million increased 244% year-over-year with new all-time high revenue for SoFi Money and continued strong contributions from SoFi Credit Card, SoFi Invest and lending-as-a-service. Overall, monetization continues to improve with annualized revenue per product increasing for the fourth consecutive quarter to $45, 2 times the $20 in the prior year and up 15% sequentially from $40. We reached 7.1 million financial services products in the quarter, which is up 51% year-over-year and we continue to see strong product adds with 584,000 new products in the segment. We hit 2.4 million products in SoFi Money, 2.2 million in SoFi Invest, and 2.2 million in Relay. Contribution losses were $24 million for the quarter, which improved by over 50% year-over-year and 44% sequentially as we start to see operating leverage in the segment. Importantly, we achieved positive variable profit in the Financial Services segment for the first time, which reinforces our expectation of positive contribution profits by the end of 2023. Switching to our balance sheet where we remain very well capitalized with ample cash and excess liquidity. Last year's opening of SoFi Bank further reinforces our strong balance sheet and provides us with more flexibility and access to a lower cost of capital relative to alternative sources of funding. In Q1, assets grew by $3.4 billion as a result of a $1.1 billion increase in cash and cash equivalents, highlighting our strong liquidity position and access to cash, as well as adding loans to the balance sheet, given strong growth we continue to see in personal loan originations. On the liability side of the balance sheet, we saw tremendous growth in deposits as they grew to over $10 billion, up $2.7 billion sequentially versus $2.3 billion in each of the prior two quarters. Because of this, we exited the quarter with just $3.6 billion drawn on our $8.6 billion of warehouse facilities. In addition, last week we extended our corporate revolver for another five years and upsides it to $645 million. This further highlights our strong liquidity position, particularly in this market. Our available for sale securities portfolio remains quite modest at $175 million market value with $6 million in cumulative unrealized losses versus $195 million at year end 2022. This portfolio consists primarily of short duration government backed securities. Let me finish up with guidance. Throughout the last 12 months, we have demonstrated the benefit of having a diversified set of revenue streams, multiple cost efficient sources of capital, and a keen focus on underwriting high quality credit. We expect those benefits to persist going forward, even in light of existing macro backdrop. For Q2, we expect to deliver adjusted net revenue of $470 million to $480 million and adjusted EBITDA of $50 million to $60 million. For the full year of 2023, we are raising guidance and now expect to deliver adjusted net revenue of $1.955 billion to $2.02 billion, up from our prior guidance of $1.925 billion to $2 billion and we now expect full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA to be $268 million to $288 million, up from our prior guidance of $260 million to $280 million. This represents a 30% incremental EBITDA margin for the full year. Overall, we couldn't be more proud of our Q1 results and continued progress. Having delivered over $460 million of adjusted net revenue and $76 million of adjusted EBITDA, we continued to make great progress against our long term growth objectives in the quarter and remain very well capitalized to continue pursuing our ultimate goal of making SoFi a top financial institution. With that, let's begin the Q&A.\nOperator: We will now open the lines for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nMihir Bhatia: Good morning.\nAnthony Noto: Good morning.\nMihir Bhatia: Thank you for taking my question. Maybe to start, Chris, if you could just provide the loan sales and gain on sale margins this quarter, with and without hedging if possible, please? And just talk also about the larger strategy. Is there any change as you've grown deposits to hold loans for longer or is it still very much a buy and distribute model? Thank you.\nChris Lapointe: Yes. No problem. So I'll hit on each of the products starting with our home loans business. So in home loans, we ended up selling $78 million of principal at a 104.7% execution level, inclusive of hedges, it was about 100 basis points less than that. In our personal loans business, we did not do any whole loan sales in period, our last one was in Q4 at 104.4% execution. But we did execute a $440 million consumer loan ABS transaction with spreads that outperformed our expectations and we're able to price at 90 basis points over SOFR. The deal was 8 times oversubscribed with over 28 orders, which allowed us to tighten spreads meaningfully by 80 basis points relative to the deal that we did back in Q4 that had comparable collateral. The market obviously continues to search for shorter duration securities backed by higher credit collateral. And then in student loan refinancing, we did not do any whole loan sales in period. Our last one was in Q3 at a 104.4% execution. What I would say in terms of your second question, Mihir, as we've discussed in the past, we are extremely well capitalized at this point having raised $3.6 billion in 2021. We have access to $8.6 billion in warehouse lines, $3.5 billion of which is drawn currently. And our bank deposit base of $10 billion is growing really quickly with the vast majority of our deposits, more than 90% of them coming from direct deposit members. In addition to that, we've been able to successfully access the ABS markets each of the last two quarters, which have brought attractive fixed financing options for all of our loans. Given this flexibility, we're always going to maximize returns on the loans that we originate as well as the overall firm ROE. And that's going to take different forms given the environment that we're operating in at any given point in time. This quarter similar to last quarter, we had the flexibility to hold loans for a longer period of time, particularly given the growth that we saw in deposits of $2.7 billion, which resulted in really strong net interest income. But that could certainly change in future quarters, but we have a lot of options and flexibility to that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Adelson with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nJeff Adelson: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering if you could dig in a little bit more on the loan growth -- the loan growth expectation from here. You've been doubling the loans every quarter year-on-year. And I understand you have a lot of capital at this point, but is there a point at which you feel like you need to start selling your loans again? And then, I guess, on the actual loan sale side, what are your -- what gives you confidence that the loans you're marking on your balance sheet today, if you were to start going back to the market again, what gives you confidence that you can kind of hold on to those marks you have on the balance sheet? Thanks.\nAnthony Noto: Thanks, Jeff. First, what I'd say is that, our overall strategy as it relates to loans and when we sell them versus hold them is really driven by liquidity and our ability to optimize return on equity. It's the same strategy we've had since 2018. Our ability to execute it has only become more and more strong and robust so that we have maximum optionality. I would love to remind everyone that if you think about our liquidity stack and our funding stack, we have $3 billion of equity or own equity capital that we can fund with $8 billion of warehouse facility. And then as we reported today $10 billion of deposits. That source of funding allows us to be very nimble in what we decide to hold versus what we decide to sell. And also allows us to be very nimble as it relates to loan purchases of SoFi loans and other opportunities that we have as optionality on deals over time. So in essence, there's no one answer to your question. It's about maximizing ROE and making sure we have the right liquidity and making sure we have the right capital ratios as a bank. I'll let Chris talk about the way we think about the value of the loans in the marketplace.\nChris Lapointe: Yes. Absolutely. And in terms of why we get confident in the sense that we would be able to sell the loans at where they're currently marked, every single quarter we work with a third party valuation firm that marks to market each and every one of our loans on an individual basis to account for changes in every single factor that impacts loans. So that's things like the weighted average coupon, default rates, prepayment speeds, benchmark rates, spreads as well as where secondary bonds and residuals are trading. So you see that mark to market take place every single quarter and that flows through the revenue line of our P&L.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nKevin Barker: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow-up on the acquisition you announced a couple of months ago on Wyndham Capital. You mentioned that it's going to be accretive within the next six months. And I believe they did about $2 billion of originations last year according to some press reports. Could you just give us an idea of like how big do you expect the mortgage platform to be? And then what does the accretive within 6 months guidance imply? Did you have to do a significant amount of further integration within the SoFi platform or is a lot of that already existing within Wyndham? Thank you.\nAnthony Noto: Thank you. First, let me approach the question about home loans from a strategic standpoint. As many of you know, we want to be a one stop digital provider for all of your financial needs during all the major decision of your financial life and all the days in between. In order to do that, we have to be there when you make large decisions like how you pay for college, like how you may pay for grad school, medical school, or buying a home. We've taken approach over the last five years where we prefer to vertically integrate with our technology. It gives us lower cost, we can innovate at a much faster rate. We can make better real time decisions, more personalization. The mortgage industry, as you know, is very cyclical and it can really be challenging if you take actions at the height of the market from an acquisition standpoint or other investment standpoint. We worked hard over the last three years to find a technology and a platform that we could buy at a great price. A small dollar amount that could be integrated pretty quickly and allow us to accomplish the objectives that I mentioned from vertical integration. We couldn't have been happier to find Wyndham. We think it's a phenomenal team. It's longer and durable company, just the way that Galileo and Technisys was around for decades and it was founder led and Jeff will continue to stay with us at SoFi. The integration will be done throughout the year. It's not significant in size in terms of the bandwidth that we have to allocate for that integration. So we feel like we can make it accretive by the end of the year. In terms of the volume they were doing, as you can imagine, the environment has been very challenging for home sales and refinancing. And so the volume was quite low relative to historical levels. And you should really think about it as a technology integration and significantly increased capacity for us to step on the gas pedal to increase our market share gains. And we intend to do that on the back of the full integration. So expect it to have a much more meaningful impact in 2024 once we feel great about the ability to scale, not just the technology, but our processes and our people to ensure our members have a great experience. Time to fund is critically important in purchase mortgages, and we want to have the best time to fund possible for our members with high satisfaction. I will let Chris talk about the accretion.\nChris Lapointe: Yes. So overall what we assumed in the back half of the year is that, this was not going to have a material impact on the overall business either from a top line or bottom line perspective, but from an accretion perspective, we expect to deliver positive contribution.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Hecht with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nJohn Hecht: Thanks very much. Good morning, guys and congratulations on a great quarter. I wonder if you guys can just talk about, over the course of the year we've got certain things happening, like the potential moratorium ending for student loans and, obviously, the changes that are expected in the interest rate markets. Maybe just considering all that, can you give us your kind of expectations for the mix of originations over the course of the next few quarters?\nChris Lapointe: Yeah. Sure. John, I can take that one. So, what I would say is, we aren’t providing specific guidance at the product level, but we are expecting to continue to see modest growth in our personal loans business. This past quarter, we reached 8.2% market share, that was up from 5.8% last quarter and [5.5%] (ph) a year ago. So there is significant headroom to continue to grow that business. But as we've said in the past, we are going to continue to be prudent and thoughtful about how we approach that business and won't overextend ourselves. So expect to see continued modest growth in that business similar to what you seen over the course of the last several quarters. On student loan refinancing, our guide and outlook has not changed from our Q1 earnings call or our Q4 earnings call. What was contemplated in our full year guide is that, the moratorium would end on June 30. And then people would go back into repayment 60 days thereafter, which means that we would see elevated demand for student loan originations in Q4, albeit at a lower monetization level given where interest rates are. We do think that there is still a large TAM that we can go after, given where we can price the loans today. So we do expect to see an uptick in demand, but probably not to the levels that we saw back in Q4 of 2019. Then in home loan origination, Anthony just touched on it. We do expect to see an acceleration in originations given the acquisition of Wyndham Capital. Right now we have a very, very low market share. So there's a ton of headroom to continue.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eugene Simuni with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\nEugene Simuni: Thank you. Good morning, guys. Congratulations on great results. I wanted to go back to the trends in your deposits. Great to see very strong growth in Q1, but can you elaborate a little bit on the trend in March since the beginning of the bank crisis? And maybe if you can share anything on what are the trends in April? And just maybe as a broader question here, how is the behavior of your bank customers changed at all since the bank crisis? And how you're adjusting to that? I'd love to hear your thoughts on that. Thank you.\nAnthony Noto: It's another quarter since opening the bank about a year ago in February of continued strong performance of our SoFi Money account, which is checking and savings as you know. The strategy has really played out in space throughout the year offering high interest rate on checking and very high interest rate on savings up to 4.2% now. If you do direct deposit with us, getting all the other member benefits that we provide for you beyond that free certified financial planner discounts on loans, our broad based rewards program, all of which now bundle into SoFi Plus has really helped us drive not just strong adoption of SoFi Money, but a lot of engagement as it relates to both deposits and spending. We couldn't be more happy with the trends we're seeing in both of those. We expect them to continue into the second quarter that we've seen so far in April and throughout the managing time period. What I'd say about Q1 is that, it's really hard to sort of separate out what may have happened because of all the uncertainty and maybe a flock to safety as people trust SoFi and came to our product and used it more frequently. I would say the trends in April are off to a start that would indicate we should be at the similar level of $2 billion plus in deposits at the end of the quarter. In terms of spending, we continue to see really strong growth in spending as our direct deposit members increase, given that they're using as their primary account. And so that's also a contributing factor to our financial results that sort of gets overlooked because of just a strong performance on NIM that we continue to see and how much more scale that is. But the spending trend on [debit] (ph) and so forth has really mirrored the trend in deposits as well as NIM to reinforce our overall strategy, giving us an opportunity to have more touch points in helping people get their mind rate based on their spending and what's happening in their accounts.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Reggie Smith with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.\nReggie Smith: Hey. Good morning and congrats on the quarter. I only have one question, so it's going to be kind of long, I guess. I was curious, what are your loss expectations, life of loss expectations for your most recent cohort of personal loans? How does that compare to maybe your 2022 cohorts? And then follow-up to that is, how are the 2022 tracking relative to your initial expectations?\nAnthony Noto: Thank you for the question. I'll let Chris get into the particulars. But at a high level, since 2018, we've architected our personal loans in a way that will drive to at least a 40% to 50% variable profit margin. And that includes all the variable cost, including life of loan losses and funding costs. The reason why we target that level of profitability is so that our loans are durable through the cycle. If we're seeing trends that lead us to believe that we can't get to that level, we will make changes. Sometimes that's increasing our WAC. Sometimes that's being more efficient in our marketing costs. Sometimes that involves driving down lower cost of funding. As it relates to the macroeconomic conditions impacting life of loan losses, we will tighten credit. We've tightened credit in the past. We have very sophisticated real time ability to test pricing and credit and a number of early warning economic indicators that have caused us to be more conservative on what we under write and tighten credit throughout the year and we'll continue to do that. But we've been below our targets life of loan losses of 7% to 8%, which is part of that equation of 40% to 50% variable profit margin. I just don't want people to think it's just about that metric, it's about the overall unit economics of getting to 40% to 50% variable profit margin and that assumes 7% to 8% life of loan losses, which we've been below and our cohorts have really continued to trend relative to that metric in a positive way.\nChris Lapointe: Yes. And I would just add on. If you look at all of our cohorts on a month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter basis, they've all been relatively consistent with the framework that Anthony just laid out. At the overall portfolio level right now, our annualized charge off rate on the personal loans business is 2.97%. If you take the weighted average life into consideration for that portfolio, it gets you to an estimated life of loan losses of about 4.5%, which again is meaningfully below the 7% to 8% risk tolerance level that we have today.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks. And most of my questions have been asked and answered. But I thought -- and you talked about this a little bit in the prepared remarks, but I think it's actually quite interesting in terms of the ability to increase whether it's cross buy or reduce marketing spend because of the increase in the number of members across financial services and SoFi money. Could you talk a little bit -- in a little more tell like how you would expect to see that playing out over the course of the next year or two in kind of more specifically? Is it a function of less marketing for consumer loans? Is it lantern products? Like what are the biggest benefits to SoFi?\nAnthony Noto: Yes. So we talk about a concept called the FSPL, financial services productivity loop. And the concept is very simply, we want to leverage the broadest reach, most appealing high engagement products like Relay, like SoFi Money, like SoFi Invest and SoFi Credit Card to really build a significant amount of products in those categories. As we build that scale, we have information about our members that allows us to give them personalized offers that best meet their needs. So for example, if we bring in a SoFi Money customer member and that member does direct deposit with us and we see the mortgage that they're paying or we see the student loan that they're paying, we see them sitting on a ton of cash. We see them overrunning and having the significant amount of credit card debt. We can make it very specific recommendation to them on how to get their money right in that particular area. We play that strategy out every day. Sometimes it's driven by technology and data. And sometimes it's driven by the mechanical processes of our teams, as well as our certified financial planners. That cross buy allows us to bring in that second product with no customer acquisition cost and has a huge impact on unit economics. So let's take a personal loan, for example, and this is just illustrative. Let's just say over the course of time, our average variable profit on a personal loan, and so that would be the revenue of that personal loan less the life of loan losses, the funding cost, variable operating cost and the customer acquisition cost resulted in $800 of variable profit. That could have a customer acquisition cost of anywhere between $600 to $1000. If someone comes in through Relay and they do credit score monitoring where they connect accounts or they're in checking or savings and we see that they have a bunch of credit card debt and can benefit from consolidation, we would make a term loan offer to them or personal loan offer if that person adopts to have personal loan their variable profit goes from $800 up [indiscernible] savings on customer acquisition cost, so anywhere to $1,400 to $1,800. That significant variable profit dollar amount above and beyond what we need can then be reinvested in better technology, lower prices, better service, higher interest rate on checking and savings and it drives the flywheel. We're seeing that happen across the board. Having the bank license only makes it better for us because we can now actually have lower cost of deposits, which improves our unit economics both on SoFi money, as well as our loan products. So we're seeing that compounding benefits of that over and over. In terms of the outlook going forward, we average roughly about 1.5 products per member. I would expect that ratio to stay very similar over the next 12 to 18 months, because we're driving really strong member growth. And if you think about the denominator, if it's growing really strong, it's really hard to drive the overall portion of the products divided by the members. And that's not a bad thing. That's actually a good thing, because the bigger we make our member base, the bigger we'll make our products adopted by that member base over time. Over the long run, we hope to have every product for the members. There's not a specific perspective that I have on the exact number. Other than they should do everything with us. Why? We're trying to build the best of breed products by category and so that we can help them borrow better, save better, spend better and invest better. And ultimately if we do that, the number of products they have with us will be very large.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.\nDominick Gabriele: Great. Good morning and great results. So, we saw significantly better revenue and adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. And I've been getting to even wonder how much we need the student loan business to return if you guys have a really strong franchise prevail. But the incremental adjusted EBITDA margin was higher than expected in the quarter. And if you take this quarter and the next quarters guidance, you get -- still your roughly 30% expectation for incremental EBITDA margins. And so, could you just talk about any shift that may have happened between this quarter and next quarter or if there's any seasonality as far as kind of that 30% expectation that we should be thinking about? Thanks so much.\nAnthony Noto: Thank you for the question. As it relates to student loans, I want to bring into two categories. You have our private student loans, i.e. the loans that people are taking out to actually go to school. So we're in the school student loan business. We're also in the student loan refinancing business. That business is one that takes our members who have either private student loans or federal student loans and refinances them at a lower rate or longer term to lower their monthly payment, much like the home loan refinancing industry. As long as the college education in the United States is not free, there will be a student loan market. Simply said, as long as the college education in the United States is not free, there will be a need for student loans. Sometimes those student loans could be provided by the government and sometimes they could be provided by private institutions. Because of that dynamic, we will always be in the student loan business. The question is, are we just in the private student loan business or the private student loan business and the refinancing student loan business? I believe we will always be in both businesses regardless of what's decided by the Supreme Court on forgiveness and regardless of what happens with the moratorium. Why? The cost of education is significantly greater than the ability of people to pay. Therefore, they have to borrow money to do that. As long as they're borrowing money, we can find a way for them to not just get access to that loan, but to do it at a lower cost as they continue improving their financial lives. So it's never a question in our mind whether we're going to be in the business. It's just a question of what are the actual products and how we best meet the member’s needs. Because I'll just reiterate again, we want to be there for every one of the major financial decision of someone's life and all the days in between, which means we have to be in the student loan business to execute our strategy. In terms of the particulars as it relates to EBITDA margin, I'll let Chris answer that.\nChris Lapointe: Yes. So in terms of the outperformance that we saw in Q1, Dominick, we saw revenue outperformance across both our lending and our financial services businesses, primarily attributable to net interest income as I alluded to in my prepared remarks. From an expense perspective, we did see really good CAC efficiencies, given the strong member and product growth, particularly in lending where our customer acquisition costs on a per loan basis was down 20% sequentially. And then in addition to that, we were able to manage expenses effectively, again, throughout the quarter creating leverage across our entire fixed cost area. Collectively, the revenue outperformance along with the efficiency gains drove the excess earnings that we decided to drop to the bottom line and take more of a conservative approach given the uncertainty in the market. Overall, as we've discussed in the past, we strive to spend about 70% of our incremental revenue as we've said. Depending on a number of factors we may choose to drop more to the bottom line, period-to-period. And that's what happened certainly this quarter. And you'll see periods of over earning followed by deployment of those resources back into the drivers of the business.\nAnthony Noto: And the only other thing I'd add is, there's a lot of operating leverage in the business and you're seeing that come through in Q4 and again in Q1. We are trying to balance investing to drive growth with prudent responsibility of driving towards profitability to give investors clear transparency on where our long term margins and ROE can be. We couldn't be more confident about the long term margins of the company and return on equity, but we need to move judiciously through the process of balancing both. One of the things I would tell you is that, we've been driving the growth that we have and the improvement in profitability with their financial services segment being unprofitable. So the lending segment has a positive contribution margin, the tech platform has a positive contribution margin and then we have large losses in financial services. The reason why that's the case is because there's a 12 month to 24 month payback on customer acquisition cost. So we absorb that cost upfront and then we recoup it over time. We're finally to the point that we're actually a positive variable profit margin for the financial services segment. That means, we're actually covering all that customer acquisition cost. And the next step for us now that we're positive on a variable profit basis is getting the total variable profit dollars to be greater than the fixed directed -- fixed direct cost of financial services. And once we do that, all three segments will have positive contribution margin. So we're just getting started with the type of leverage we can drive over time. We will dampen your expectations on where the margins will be in the intermediate term, because we also want to keep investing. But we will hit the milestone that we've laid out as it relates to GAAP profitability and financial services, positive contribution margin unless there's a huge dislocation that we can't anticipate today.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Wildhack with Autonomous. Your line is now open.\nRobert Wildhack: Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask one more about deposits. Anthony, it sounds like you're talking about at least another quarter of really solid growth. So zooming out beyond that, what's the current strategy in line of thought with respect to keeping the pedal down on deposit growth versus maybe giving up some of that growth rate, but possibly taking a lot of pressure off your deposit costs and deposit betas?\nAnthony Noto: Well, the great thing about our company and our vertical integration is that, the cost that we're currently have on our checking and savings account are lower than the cost that we've ever had in the business historically from a spread standpoint. So, it's actually cheaper for us to fund via deposits than the way we've historically funded the warehouse lines. And so, that's a huge competitive advantage. The reason we can offer the interest rate that we offer is because we actually make more money than we would with warehouse lines and without being a bank. And so the cost is completely acceptable [indiscernible] and we continue to be aggressive with the interest rate. I think the bigger question is, what happens when rates start to get cut and go down. I think we'll be able to hold rate much longer and higher than our competitors and really gain even more market share. Our goal is to have as many direct deposit customers as we can. That's a leading indicator of primary account and we -- that's our strategy. Direct deposit is one indicator of that, there are others that we're using now and that will give people benefits from if they take those other actions outside of direct deposit. But the rate that we're providing is very competitive, but it's very attractive to us form a financial rewards -- return standpoint.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arren Cyganovich with Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nArren Cyganovich: Thanks. Just a quick question on the technology segment. It looks like the revenue is down a little bit sequentially if you remove the client you lost kind of flattish. Do you expect any pull forwards of contract renewals there? And what do you expect in terms of revenue growth for that segment going forward?\nAnthony Noto: Yes. One of the things we want to point out is that, the technology platform is in a transition from a lot of small accounts and earlier stage start up to fewer larger durable customers. We made the decision throughout 2022 to stop chasing a lot of smaller deals. So what you see in the quarter is less new customers coming on and contributing to revenue that would have been signed in 2022, in the earlier part of the year and that transition is ongoing. We expect the revenue to continue to stay at about this level throughout the year and we'll start to see more meaningful contribution from some of the larger more durable customers that we've signed up. A couple of which were actually on the platform now and contributing, but that will become more -- that will become bigger and more significant by the end of the year. We really like the strategy. It's longer lead times. It's longer sales cycles. But the economic opportunity from each one of these partners goes well, well beyond just using the processing platform or APIs at Galileo to a number of other products. One of the things that may not be obvious to everyone is that, we're starting to see really strong traction in some of the products that are on top of the platform. So for example, [Connecta] (ph) is a natural language AI chatbot that helps with customer service. SoFi actually just integrated itself in our business, but it's gotten great uptick from adoption from our partners. We also rolled out something called PRP, which is Pain Risk platform, we're leveraging all the data on the Galileo platform. We process about 6 billion transactions a year. That gives us great intelligence to be able to detect transactional fraud. We're now offering that product and capability to our partners that have seen really strong uptake there. And then we also launched in our platform for the first time fully integrated SoFi, Galileo and Technisys, [indiscernible] for product. The reality is, it's an installment based product that's like buy now pay later, but it's delivered in your app, you apply in your app, you get a virtual card instantly, you get a card number, and you can execute that at any retail location or any online capability, it acts just like a debit card or credit card, but as different economics in the back end. The great thing about the product is that, it's driven all by interchange. It's not driven by a retailer's discount. It's not driven by an interest rate or a fee. And so there's a lot that's in the pipeline for the technology platform. The demand is as strong as it's ever been. We're going to move through this transition of fewer smaller accounts to larger -- sorry, fewer smaller accounts than what we used to do to get these larger more durable customers. And we should start to see the benefit in the back half of the year in terms of an acceleration of revenue and then into 2024.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question goes to the line of Matthew O'Neil with ST Partners. Your line is now open.\nMatthew O'Neil: Yes. Hi, gentlemen. Thanks for squeezing me in at the end here. Just want to clarify and make sure that the prior question on technology segment and the commentary around fewer smaller accounts and more larger ones going forward. Is that directly connected to the small dip we saw this quarter in the Galileo accounts, just some smaller ones coming off before some bigger ones are being folded in. And then just as a separate follow-up, just curious on the macro front with what's going on in the rate environment. Is there a unemployment rate that you guys think about where things would start to become more concerning or there'd be some nonlinear impact on the credit quality side and are we anywhere kind of close to that? The assumption is not, but just kind of curious what you guys are thinking about on the potential horizon.\nAnthony Noto: Yes. On the technology platform side, I think you're asking a question about accounts and the growth of that being slower year-over-year and down sequentially. That just reflects a partner that moves off the platform and those accounts moving off. So it's both new account growth offset by that partner that moved off in 2022 off the platform. In terms of the unemployment rate, I'll give -- I'll hand over to Chris to talk about how we think about underwriting credit and the macroeconomic factors that we're looking at.\nChris Lapointe: Yes. So our overall outlook on the macro hasn't changed from our Q4 earnings call. What we have talked about during that is that, the rate was going to be consistent with where the forward curve was at the time and peaking around 5% to 5.25% and exiting the year at 4.5%. So that's still contemplated in our current outlook. We assume that the unemployment rate would be 5%. So we're holding with that as well. And we finally we assumed that there would be a 2.5% GDP contraction. And then finally, we did assume that credit spreads would remain elevated, but we have seen that over the course of the last several quarters and we expect that to persist heading into Q2, Q3 and Q4, but that's all contemplated in our guide.\nAnthony Noto: And let me finish here by saying that we've been in an all-out sprint over the last five years to build out our digital product suite to meet our member’s needs. For every major financial decision in their lives and all the days in between, thanks to the incredible grit and hard work of our team at SoFi. We've been able to do that consistently. That said, we've seen tectonic plate shift for the industry in each of the last five years and some years multiple times. But through that volatility and uncertainty, we continue to prevail and thrive hitting eight record quarters of revenue in a row and hitting strategic and financial inflection points all along the way. 2023 has proven to be as formidable in just three short months as any year and it's just getting started. We're likely to see another multi tectonic plate shifting year. That said, SoFi will be ready. We'll be ready because the benefits of our strategy to build a uniquely diversified business combined with the national banking license not only positions SoFi to be the winner takes most in the separate transition of financial services to digital, but also provide greater durability through a market cycle and the many other viable events that may occur. I'm excited about where we are today and even more excited about where we can go from here. With that, thank you for your interest in SoFi and we'll talk to you in three short months.\nOperator: Goodbye. This concludes SoFi's Q1 2023 earnings call. I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day.",

            "name": "Chris Lapointe",
            "content": "Thanks, Anthony. We started the year with a great quarter, which saw strong growth trends across the entire business. We achieved record revenue and adjusted EBITDA despite operating in a rapidly evolving macro backdrop. I'm going to walk you through some key financial highlights for the quarter, and then share some color on our financial outlook. Unless otherwise stated, I'll be referring to adjusted results for the first quarter of 2023 versus first quarter of 2022. Our GAAP consolidated income statement and all reconciliations can be found in today's earnings release and the subsequent 10-Q filing, which will be made available next week. For the quarter, top line growth remains strong as we delivered record adjusted net revenue of $460 million, up 43% year-over-year and 4% sequential from the fourth quarter's record of $443 million and above our Q1 guidance of $430 million to $440 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $76 million at a 16% margin, also above the high end of our most recent guidance of $40 million to $45 million and ahead of the prior quarter record. This represented 14 points of year-over-year margin improvement, demonstrating the strong operating leverage of the business as it scales. Year-over-year margin improvement has been driven by significant operating leverage across our sales and marketing, G&A and ops functional expense lines. Overall, this resulted in a 48% incremental adjusted EBITDA margin year-over-year. Our GAAP net losses were $34 million this quarter, which is a $76 million improvement year-over-year and a $6 million improvement sequentially. Our incremental GAAP net income margin was 54% for the quarter. In addition to our adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, we saw meaningful leverage against stock based compensation as a percentage of net revenue at 14% in Q1 2023, down from 16% in the fourth quarter and 24% in the prior year quarter. This represents further progress toward our expectation of GAAP net income profitability in Q4 2023. Now, on to the segment level performance where we saw strong year-over-year growth across all three segments. In Lending, first quarter adjusted net revenue grew 33% year-over-year to $325 million. Results were driven by 113% year-over-year growth in our net interest income, while non-interest income was down 17%. Growth in net interest income was driven by a 99% year-over-year increase in average interest earning assets and a 318 basis point year-over-year increase in average yields, resulting in an average net interest margin of 5.5% for the quarter. This represents roughly 110 basis points of year-over-year NIM expansion. Q1 originations grew 7% year-over-year to $3.6 billion and were driven by record volumes in our personal loans business, which grew 46% year-over-year to nearly $3 billion. However, student loan originations were down 47% year-over-year and home loans by 71% year-over-year, as the extension of the federal student loan moratorium and macro factors continue to provide headwinds to these businesses. We achieved this top line growth while maintaining our stringent credit standards and disciplined focus on quality. Our personal loan borrower's weighted average income is $164,000 with a weighted average FICO score of 747. Our student loan barrower's weighted average income is $173,000 with a weighted average FICO of 769. This continued focus on quality has led to strong credit performance. Our on balance sheet delinquency rates and charge off rates remain healthy and are still below pre-COVID levels. Our on balance sheet 90 day personal loan delinquency rate was 38 basis points in Q1 2023, while our annualized personal loan charge off rate was 2.97%. Considering the weighted average life of the personal loans on our balance sheet, our portfolio life of loan losses are forecasted to be 4.5%, which is below our risk tolerance. Our on balance sheet 90 day student loan delinquency rate was 12 basis points in Q1 2023, while our annualized student loan charge off rate was 0.34%. As we've expressed in the past, it is reasonable to expect credit metrics to revert over time to more normalized pre pandemic levels, but continue to expect very healthy performance relative to broader industry levels. The Lending business delivered $210 million of contribution profit at a 65% margin, up from $133 million a year ago and a 54% margin. This improvement was driven by a mix shift to higher margin personal loans revenue, as well as sales and marketing and ops efficiencies and fixed cost leverage across the entire segment. Shifting to tech platform, where we delivered net revenue of $78 million in the quarter, up 28% year-over-year, while Galileo revenue was up 3% year-over-year. Overall, annual revenue growth was driven primarily by Galileo account growth to $126 million in total. We also signed five new clients in Galileo and on in Technisys, and we finished the task of moving every client to the cloud with 100% of transactions now migrated. Sequentially, revenue and contribution profit declined in the segment due to seasonality in transaction volumes, along with timing implications from shifting focus to larger potential partners with larger existing businesses, B2B customers and a more durable customer base which has longer sales cycles. The segment delivered a contribution profit of $15 million, representing a 19% margin and 28% if you were to exclude Technisys. Moving on to financial services, where net revenue of $81 million increased 244% year-over-year with new all-time high revenue for SoFi Money and continued strong contributions from SoFi Credit Card, SoFi Invest and lending-as-a-service. Overall, monetization continues to improve with annualized revenue per product increasing for the fourth consecutive quarter to $45, 2 times the $20 in the prior year and up 15% sequentially from $40. We reached 7.1 million financial services products in the quarter, which is up 51% year-over-year and we continue to see strong product adds with 584,000 new products in the segment. We hit 2.4 million products in SoFi Money, 2.2 million in SoFi Invest, and 2.2 million in Relay. Contribution losses were $24 million for the quarter, which improved by over 50% year-over-year and 44% sequentially as we start to see operating leverage in the segment. Importantly, we achieved positive variable profit in the Financial Services segment for the first time, which reinforces our expectation of positive contribution profits by the end of 2023. Switching to our balance sheet where we remain very well capitalized with ample cash and excess liquidity. Last year's opening of SoFi Bank further reinforces our strong balance sheet and provides us with more flexibility and access to a lower cost of capital relative to alternative sources of funding. In Q1, assets grew by $3.4 billion as a result of a $1.1 billion increase in cash and cash equivalents, highlighting our strong liquidity position and access to cash, as well as adding loans to the balance sheet, given strong growth we continue to see in personal loan originations. On the liability side of the balance sheet, we saw tremendous growth in deposits as they grew to over $10 billion, up $2.7 billion sequentially versus $2.3 billion in each of the prior two quarters. Because of this, we exited the quarter with just $3.6 billion drawn on our $8.6 billion of warehouse facilities. In addition, last week we extended our corporate revolver for another five years and upsides it to $645 million. This further highlights our strong liquidity position, particularly in this market. Our available for sale securities portfolio remains quite modest at $175 million market value with $6 million in cumulative unrealized losses versus $195 million at year end 2022. This portfolio consists primarily of short duration government backed securities. Let me finish up with guidance. Throughout the last 12 months, we have demonstrated the benefit of having a diversified set of revenue streams, multiple cost efficient sources of capital, and a keen focus on underwriting high quality credit. We expect those benefits to persist going forward, even in light of existing macro backdrop. For Q2, we expect to deliver adjusted net revenue of $470 million to $480 million and adjusted EBITDA of $50 million to $60 million. For the full year of 2023, we are raising guidance and now expect to deliver adjusted net revenue of $1.955 billion to $2.02 billion, up from our prior guidance of $1.925 billion to $2 billion and we now expect full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA to be $268 million to $288 million, up from our prior guidance of $260 million to $280 million. This represents a 30% incremental EBITDA margin for the full year. Overall, we couldn't be more proud of our Q1 results and continued progress. Having delivered over $460 million of adjusted net revenue and $76 million of adjusted EBITDA, we continued to make great progress against our long term growth objectives in the quarter and remain very well capitalized to continue pursuing our ultimate goal of making SoFi a top financial institution. With that, let's begin the Q&A. Yes. No problem. So I'll hit on each of the products starting with our home loans business. So in home loans, we ended up selling $78 million of principal at a 104.7% execution level, inclusive of hedges, it was about 100 basis points less than that. In our personal loans business, we did not do any whole loan sales in period, our last one was in Q4 at 104.4% execution. But we did execute a $440 million consumer loan ABS transaction with spreads that outperformed our expectations and we're able to price at 90 basis points over SOFR. The deal was 8 times oversubscribed with over 28 orders, which allowed us to tighten spreads meaningfully by 80 basis points relative to the deal that we did back in Q4 that had comparable collateral. The market obviously continues to search for shorter duration securities backed by higher credit collateral. And then in student loan refinancing, we did not do any whole loan sales in period. Our last one was in Q3 at a 104.4% execution. What I would say in terms of your second question, Mihir, as we've discussed in the past, we are extremely well capitalized at this point having raised $3.6 billion in 2021. We have access to $8.6 billion in warehouse lines, $3.5 billion of which is drawn currently. And our bank deposit base of $10 billion is growing really quickly with the vast majority of our deposits, more than 90% of them coming from direct deposit members. In addition to that, we've been able to successfully access the ABS markets each of the last two quarters, which have brought attractive fixed financing options for all of our loans. Given this flexibility, we're always going to maximize returns on the loans that we originate as well as the overall firm ROE. And that's going to take different forms given the environment that we're operating in at any given point in time. This quarter similar to last quarter, we had the flexibility to hold loans for a longer period of time, particularly given the growth that we saw in deposits of $2.7 billion, which resulted in really strong net interest income. But that could certainly change in future quarters, but we have a lot of options and flexibility to that. Yes. Absolutely. And in terms of why we get confident in the sense that we would be able to sell the loans at where they're currently marked, every single quarter we work with a third party valuation firm that marks to market each and every one of our loans on an individual basis to account for changes in every single factor that impacts loans. So that's things like the weighted average coupon, default rates, prepayment speeds, benchmark rates, spreads as well as where secondary bonds and residuals are trading. So you see that mark to market take place every single quarter and that flows through the revenue line of our P&L. Yes. So overall what we assumed in the back half of the year is that, this was not going to have a material impact on the overall business either from a top line or bottom line perspective, but from an accretion perspective, we expect to deliver positive contribution. Yeah. Sure. John, I can take that one. So, what I would say is, we aren't providing specific guidance at the product level, but we are expecting to continue to see modest growth in our personal loans business. This past quarter, we reached 8.2% market share, that was up from 5.8% last quarter and [5.5%] (ph) a year ago. So there is significant headroom to continue to grow that business. But as we've said in the past, we are going to continue to be prudent and thoughtful about how we approach that business and won't overextend ourselves. So expect to see continued modest growth in that business similar to what you seen over the course of the last several quarters. On student loan refinancing, our guide and outlook has not changed from our Q1 earnings call or our Q4 earnings call. What was contemplated in our full year guide is that, the moratorium would end on June 30. And then people would go back into repayment 60 days thereafter, which means that we would see elevated demand for student loan originations in Q4, albeit at a lower monetization level given where interest rates are. We do think that there is still a large TAM that we can go after, given where we can price the loans today. So we do expect to see an uptick in demand, but probably not to the levels that we saw back in Q4 of 2019. Then in home loan origination, Anthony just touched on it. We do expect to see an acceleration in originations given the acquisition of Wyndham Capital. Right now we have a very, very low market share. So there's a ton of headroom to continue. Yes. And I would just add on. If you look at all of our cohorts on a month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter basis, they've all been relatively consistent with the framework that Anthony just laid out. At the overall portfolio level right now, our annualized charge off rate on the personal loans business is 2.97%. If you take the weighted average life into consideration for that portfolio, it gets you to an estimated life of loan losses of about 4.5%, which again is meaningfully below the 7% to 8% risk tolerance level that we have today. Yes. So in terms of the outperformance that we saw in Q1, Dominick, we saw revenue outperformance across both our lending and our financial services businesses, primarily attributable to net interest income as I alluded to in my prepared remarks. From an expense perspective, we did see really good CAC efficiencies, given the strong member and product growth, particularly in lending where our customer acquisition costs on a per loan basis was down 20% sequentially. And then in addition to that, we were able to manage expenses effectively, again, throughout the quarter creating leverage across our entire fixed cost area. Collectively, the revenue outperformance along with the efficiency gains drove the excess earnings that we decided to drop to the bottom line and take more of a conservative approach given the uncertainty in the market. Overall, as we've discussed in the past, we strive to spend about 70% of our incremental revenue as we've said. Depending on a number of factors we may choose to drop more to the bottom line, period-to-period. And that's what happened certainly this quarter. And you'll see periods of over earning followed by deployment of those resources back into the drivers of the business. Yes. So our overall outlook on the macro hasn't changed from our Q4 earnings call. What we have talked about during that is that, the rate was going to be consistent with where the forward curve was at the time and peaking around 5% to 5.25% and exiting the year at 4.5%. So that's still contemplated in our current outlook. We assume that the unemployment rate would be 5%. So we're holding with that as well. And we finally we assumed that there would be a 2.5% GDP contraction. And then finally, we did assume that credit spreads would remain elevated, but we have seen that over the course of the last several quarters and we expect that to persist heading into Q2, Q3 and Q4, but that's all contemplated in our guide."

            "name": "Anthony Noto",
            "content": "Thank you, Maura, and good morning, everyone. The first quarter at SoFi was an incredible beginning to what is already turning out to be yet another eventful year in the macro environment. Amid all the volatility, we delivered another quarter of record revenue and adjusted EBITDA with strong overall operating results, reinforcing the strength of our strategy and our ability to execute with excellence. A few key achievements from the first quarter include: our eighth consecutive quarter of record adjusted net revenue of $460 million, up 43% year-over-year with record revenue in lending and financial services, as well as continued strength in tech platform; our third consecutive quarter of record adjusted EBITDA at nearly $76 million, representing a 48% incremental margin and a 16% margin overall; and incremental GAAP net income margin of 54%, resulting in a loss of just $34 million. Deposits increased by $2.7 billion sequentially, marking another record quarter and now exceed $10 billion in total deposits. Importantly, more than 90% of our consumer deposits are from sticky direct deposit members and 97% of our deposits are insured. Our cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet increased by $1.1 billion to $2.5 billion since year-end, reinforcing our strong liquidity position. Once again, we are achieving several financial inflection points. Adjusted EBITDA of $76 million is now greater than stock based compensation at $64 million, which actually declined. And this is another critical step towards GAAP net income profitability. We achieved positive variable profit in the Financial Services segment and remain on track for positive contribution profit by year end. Additionally, lending net interest income revenue or NIM revenue of $201 million exceeded lending non-interest income of $136 million for the second consecutive quarter. And importantly, our NIM revenue is meaningfully greater than our Lending segment directly attributable expenses of $115 million. These trends increased the visibility and reinforce our goal of achieving positive GAAP net income in Q4 2023. Along those lines, we had another quarter of positive GAAP net income for SoFi Bank at $73 million, reflecting a 20% margin and a 23% return on average tangible equity on our way to expected 30% returns within the bank over the long term. Lastly, the quality of our bank operating and liquidity metrics remain robust and have improved since year end. We saw new record levels of unaided brand awareness in the quarter and continued strong cross buy trends, which helped drive strong year-over-year growth in members and products with decreasing marketing spend intensity. The 433,000 new members in Q1, 2023 brings total members to nearly 5.7 million, up 46% year-over-year. We also added 660,000 new products in Q1 ending with nearly 8.6 million total products, also up 46% year-over-year. Of these new adds, Financial Services products totaled 7.1 million at quarter end and grew by 51% year-over-year, while lending products of 1.4 million were up 24% year-over-year. Sales and marketing expenses as a% of revenue declined nearly 100 basis points from last quarter and nearly 475 basis points from a year ago. The strength of our results once again underscores how our full suite of differentiated products and services provides the foundation for a uniquely diversified business that is able to endure through market cycles, as well as exogenous factors. We talk often about our ability to act nimbly in a rapidly changing environment. There were several examples once again this last quarter, but I'd like to take a moment to highlight one that really exemplifies nimble execution to truly help our members at the most critical time. As the recent bank crisis developed, our team was able to bring our deposits FDIC insurance capabilities from offering $250,000 to $2 million within a week, providing comfort and safety to our members and enabling 97% of our deposits to now be insured versus 92% before the increase. Now I'd like to spend time touching on segment level results, as well as the structural advantage of our product strategy and having a bank charter. In lending, we generated a record $325 million of adjusted net revenue, up 33% versus the prior year period. Our personal loan performance more than offset the continued headwinds in demand for student loan refinancing and the less robust performance of home loans. Student loan refi continues to be impacted as federal borrowers still await clarity on the end of the moratorium on federal student loan payments. Home Loans faces macro headwinds from rising rates, while we continue the process of integrating Wyndham Capital Mortgage, which we acquired at the beginning of Q2 2023. The Personal Loans business maintained its strength in Q1, hitting record originations of nearly $3 billion, up 46% from $2 billion in Q1 2022. This product continues to deliver even as we maintain our stringent credit standards and pass on rate increases to our borrowers. While these origination levels themselves are impressive, the strength of our balance sheet and diversification of our funding sources provide new options to fund origination growth, while driving efficiencies with cost savings. These advantages are a direct result of SoFi Bank. Having more balance sheet flexibility allows us to capture more net interest income and optimize returns, which provides more stable earnings in any macro environment. But it's especially important in times of excess volatility. As of the end of Q1 2023, 44% of our loans were funded by deposits and our $2.7 billion of new deposits raised in the quarter helped fund our $3.6 billion of total originations in the most cost effective way. Our lending capacity remains robust with over $20 billion in total capacity to fund loans and meet our liquidity needs with $10 billion of deposits which have grown by $2 billion a quarter, $3 billion of equity capital and $8.6 billion of warehouse capacity. Lastly, the bank contributes to strong growth in SoFi Money members, high quality deposits and great levels of engagement. This has led to a higher average account balances even as average spend has increased. More than 50% of newly funded SoFi Money accounts are setting up direct deposit by day 30, and this has had a significant impact on spending. Q1 annualized spend was 2 times 2022 spend and Q1 spend per average funded account was up 15% quarter-over-quarter. SoFi Money members have increased over 48% year-over-year to 2.4 million accounts. Given the quality of these members, with a median FICO score of 749 for our direct deposit portfolio, we see ample opportunity for cross buy. This is a great segue into financial services more broadly where net revenue more than tripled year-over-year to $81 million and grew 25% from $65 million in Q4 2022. Contribution loss of $24 million improved $19 million versus the previous quarter and we achieved variable profitability for the first time in the segment, even as we maintained elevated marketing expenses in the first quarter. We've continued to achieve strong member and product growth by iterating on products to ensure they are differentiated on four key factors. Fast, selection, content convenience and continue to invest to make them work better when used together. So far in Q2, we continue to iterate on these products. Last week, we raised our savings rate again to 4.2% and just this morning we announced SoFi Travel in partnership with Expedia, which will include member discounts and 3% cash back rewards on bookings made with the SoFi credit card. SoFi Travel is a digital destination that represents our first non-financial product effort to help our members spend better in the next phase in SoFi's mission to help our members achieve financial independence. We finished Q1 with 7.1 million financial services products, up 51% year-over-year and 5 times total lending products of 1.4 million. The increased scale in financial services helps drive cross-buy and marketing efficiencies. Financial Services sales and marketing spend as a percentage of net revenue was 51% versus 60% in Q1 of last year. We continue to scale our top of the funnel products given the attractive monetization opportunities by capitalizing on our improved brand awareness and network effects. We saw this increased efficiency even with the fact that these products have a 12 month to 18 month payback period. For Technology Platform, full segment revenue of nearly $78 million saw growth of 28% year-over-year with a 19% margin at the segment level or 28% if you exclude Technisys. Galileo's overall diversified growth strategy includes growth in new verticals, new products and new geographies. With a focus on larger customers that have large installed basins. In Q1, Galileo signed five new clients and made big strides in the strategy with 80% of newly signed clients having existing customers or portfolios, along with a growing pipeline of [drawing] (ph) opportunities selling Galileo and Technisys offerings to an expanded customer base. Technisys recently signed one new client in Mexico and has entered into a proof-of-concept stage with a large U.S. legacy financial institution. With that, let me turn it over to Chris for a review of the financials for the quarter. Good morning. Thanks, Jeff. First, what I'd say is that, our overall strategy as it relates to loans and when we sell them versus hold them is really driven by liquidity and our ability to optimize return on equity. It's the same strategy we've had since 2018. Our ability to execute it has only become more and more strong and robust so that we have maximum optionality. I would love to remind everyone that if you think about our liquidity stack and our funding stack, we have $3 billion of equity or own equity capital that we can fund with $8 billion of warehouse facility. And then as we reported today $10 billion of deposits. That source of funding allows us to be very nimble in what we decide to hold versus what we decide to sell. And also allows us to be very nimble as it relates to loan purchases of SoFi loans and other opportunities that we have as optionality on deals over time. So in essence, there's no one answer to your question. It's about maximizing ROE and making sure we have the right liquidity and making sure we have the right capital ratios as a bank. I'll let Chris talk about the way we think about the value of the loans in the marketplace. Thank you. First, let me approach the question about home loans from a strategic standpoint. As many of you know, we want to be a one stop digital provider for all of your financial needs during all the major decision of your financial life and all the days in between. In order to do that, we have to be there when you make large decisions like how you pay for college, like how you may pay for grad school, medical school, or buying a home. We've taken approach over the last five years where we prefer to vertically integrate with our technology. It gives us lower cost, we can innovate at a much faster rate. We can make better real time decisions, more personalization. The mortgage industry, as you know, is very cyclical and it can really be challenging if you take actions at the height of the market from an acquisition standpoint or other investment standpoint. We worked hard over the last three years to find a technology and a platform that we could buy at a great price. A small dollar amount that could be integrated pretty quickly and allow us to accomplish the objectives that I mentioned from vertical integration. We couldn't have been happier to find Wyndham. We think it's a phenomenal team. It's longer and durable company, just the way that Galileo and Technisys was around for decades and it was founder led and Jeff will continue to stay with us at SoFi. The integration will be done throughout the year. It's not significant in size in terms of the bandwidth that we have to allocate for that integration. So we feel like we can make it accretive by the end of the year. In terms of the volume they were doing, as you can imagine, the environment has been very challenging for home sales and refinancing. And so the volume was quite low relative to historical levels. And you should really think about it as a technology integration and significantly increased capacity for us to step on the gas pedal to increase our market share gains. And we intend to do that on the back of the full integration. So expect it to have a much more meaningful impact in 2024 once we feel great about the ability to scale, not just the technology, but our processes and our people to ensure our members have a great experience. Time to fund is critically important in purchase mortgages, and we want to have the best time to fund possible for our members with high satisfaction. I will let Chris talk about the accretion. It's another quarter since opening the bank about a year ago in February of continued strong performance of our SoFi Money account, which is checking and savings as you know. The strategy has really played out in space throughout the year offering high interest rate on checking and very high interest rate on savings up to 4.2% now. If you do direct deposit with us, getting all the other member benefits that we provide for you beyond that free certified financial planner discounts on loans, our broad based rewards program, all of which now bundle into SoFi Plus has really helped us drive not just strong adoption of SoFi Money, but a lot of engagement as it relates to both deposits and spending. We couldn't be more happy with the trends we're seeing in both of those. We expect them to continue into the second quarter that we've seen so far in April and throughout the managing time period. What I'd say about Q1 is that, it's really hard to sort of separate out what may have happened because of all the uncertainty and maybe a flock to safety as people trust SoFi and came to our product and used it more frequently. I would say the trends in April are off to a start that would indicate we should be at the similar level of $2 billion plus in deposits at the end of the quarter. In terms of spending, we continue to see really strong growth in spending as our direct deposit members increase, given that they're using as their primary account. And so that's also a contributing factor to our financial results that sort of gets overlooked because of just a strong performance on NIM that we continue to see and how much more scale that is. But the spending trend on [debit] (ph) and so forth has really mirrored the trend in deposits as well as NIM to reinforce our overall strategy, giving us an opportunity to have more touch points in helping people get their mind rate based on their spending and what's happening in their accounts. Thank you for the question. I'll let Chris get into the particulars. But at a high level, since 2018, we've architected our personal loans in a way that will drive to at least a 40% to 50% variable profit margin. And that includes all the variable cost, including life of loan losses and funding costs. The reason why we target that level of profitability is so that our loans are durable through the cycle. If we're seeing trends that lead us to believe that we can't get to that level, we will make changes. Sometimes that's increasing our WAC. Sometimes that's being more efficient in our marketing costs. Sometimes that involves driving down lower cost of funding. As it relates to the macroeconomic conditions impacting life of loan losses, we will tighten credit. We've tightened credit in the past. We have very sophisticated real time ability to test pricing and credit and a number of early warning economic indicators that have caused us to be more conservative on what we under write and tighten credit throughout the year and we'll continue to do that. But we've been below our targets life of loan losses of 7% to 8%, which is part of that equation of 40% to 50% variable profit margin. I just don't want people to think it's just about that metric, it's about the overall unit economics of getting to 40% to 50% variable profit margin and that assumes 7% to 8% life of loan losses, which we've been below and our cohorts have really continued to trend relative to that metric in a positive way. Yes. So we talk about a concept called the FSPL, financial services productivity loop. And the concept is very simply, we want to leverage the broadest reach, most appealing high engagement products like Relay, like SoFi Money, like SoFi Invest and SoFi Credit Card to really build a significant amount of products in those categories. As we build that scale, we have information about our members that allows us to give them personalized offers that best meet their needs. So for example, if we bring in a SoFi Money customer member and that member does direct deposit with us and we see the mortgage that they're paying or we see the student loan that they're paying, we see them sitting on a ton of cash. We see them overrunning and having the significant amount of credit card debt. We can make it very specific recommendation to them on how to get their money right in that particular area. We play that strategy out every day. Sometimes it's driven by technology and data. And sometimes it's driven by the mechanical processes of our teams, as well as our certified financial planners. That cross buy allows us to bring in that second product with no customer acquisition cost and has a huge impact on unit economics. So let's take a personal loan, for example, and this is just illustrative. Let's just say over the course of time, our average variable profit on a personal loan, and so that would be the revenue of that personal loan less the life of loan losses, the funding cost, variable operating cost and the customer acquisition cost resulted in $800 of variable profit. That could have a customer acquisition cost of anywhere between $600 to $1000. If someone comes in through Relay and they do credit score monitoring where they connect accounts or they're in checking or savings and we see that they have a bunch of credit card debt and can benefit from consolidation, we would make a term loan offer to them or personal loan offer if that person adopts to have personal loan their variable profit goes from $800 up [indiscernible] savings on customer acquisition cost, so anywhere to $1,400 to $1,800. That significant variable profit dollar amount above and beyond what we need can then be reinvested in better technology, lower prices, better service, higher interest rate on checking and savings and it drives the flywheel. We're seeing that happen across the board. Having the bank license only makes it better for us because we can now actually have lower cost of deposits, which improves our unit economics both on SoFi money, as well as our loan products. So we're seeing that compounding benefits of that over and over. In terms of the outlook going forward, we average roughly about 1.5 products per member. I would expect that ratio to stay very similar over the next 12 to 18 months, because we're driving really strong member growth. And if you think about the denominator, if it's growing really strong, it's really hard to drive the overall portion of the products divided by the members. And that's not a bad thing. That's actually a good thing, because the bigger we make our member base, the bigger we'll make our products adopted by that member base over time. Over the long run, we hope to have every product for the members. There's not a specific perspective that I have on the exact number. Other than they should do everything with us. Why? We're trying to build the best of breed products by category and so that we can help them borrow better, save better, spend better and invest better. And ultimately if we do that, the number of products they have with us will be very large. Thank you for the question. As it relates to student loans, I want to bring into two categories. You have our private student loans, i.e. the loans that people are taking out to actually go to school. So we're in the school student loan business. We're also in the student loan refinancing business. That business is one that takes our members who have either private student loans or federal student loans and refinances them at a lower rate or longer term to lower their monthly payment, much like the home loan refinancing industry. As long as the college education in the United States is not free, there will be a student loan market. Simply said, as long as the college education in the United States is not free, there will be a need for student loans. Sometimes those student loans could be provided by the government and sometimes they could be provided by private institutions. Because of that dynamic, we will always be in the student loan business. The question is, are we just in the private student loan business or the private student loan business and the refinancing student loan business? I believe we will always be in both businesses regardless of what's decided by the Supreme Court on forgiveness and regardless of what happens with the moratorium. Why? The cost of education is significantly greater than the ability of people to pay. Therefore, they have to borrow money to do that. As long as they're borrowing money, we can find a way for them to not just get access to that loan, but to do it at a lower cost as they continue improving their financial lives. So it's never a question in our mind whether we're going to be in the business. It's just a question of what are the actual products and how we best meet the member's needs. Because I'll just reiterate again, we want to be there for every one of the major financial decision of someone's life and all the days in between, which means we have to be in the student loan business to execute our strategy. In terms of the particulars as it relates to EBITDA margin, I'll let Chris answer that. And the only other thing I'd add is, there's a lot of operating leverage in the business and you're seeing that come through in Q4 and again in Q1. We are trying to balance investing to drive growth with prudent responsibility of driving towards profitability to give investors clear transparency on where our long term margins and ROE can be. We couldn't be more confident about the long term margins of the company and return on equity, but we need to move judiciously through the process of balancing both. One of the things I would tell you is that, we've been driving the growth that we have and the improvement in profitability with their financial services segment being unprofitable. So the lending segment has a positive contribution margin, the tech platform has a positive contribution margin and then we have large losses in financial services. The reason why that's the case is because there's a 12 month to 24 month payback on customer acquisition cost. So we absorb that cost upfront and then we recoup it over time. We're finally to the point that we're actually a positive variable profit margin for the financial services segment. That means, we're actually covering all that customer acquisition cost. And the next step for us now that we're positive on a variable profit basis is getting the total variable profit dollars to be greater than the fixed directed -- fixed direct cost of financial services. And once we do that, all three segments will have positive contribution margin. So we're just getting started with the type of leverage we can drive over time. We will dampen your expectations on where the margins will be in the intermediate term, because we also want to keep investing. But we will hit the milestone that we've laid out as it relates to GAAP profitability and financial services, positive contribution margin unless there's a huge dislocation that we can't anticipate today. Well, the great thing about our company and our vertical integration is that, the cost that we're currently have on our checking and savings account are lower than the cost that we've ever had in the business historically from a spread standpoint. So, it's actually cheaper for us to fund via deposits than the way we've historically funded the warehouse lines. And so, that's a huge competitive advantage. The reason we can offer the interest rate that we offer is because we actually make more money than we would with warehouse lines and without being a bank. And so the cost is completely acceptable [indiscernible] and we continue to be aggressive with the interest rate. I think the bigger question is, what happens when rates start to get cut and go down. I think we'll be able to hold rate much longer and higher than our competitors and really gain even more market share. Our goal is to have as many direct deposit customers as we can. That's a leading indicator of primary account and we -- that's our strategy. Direct deposit is one indicator of that, there are others that we're using now and that will give people benefits from if they take those other actions outside of direct deposit. But the rate that we're providing is very competitive, but it's very attractive to us form a financial rewards -- return standpoint. Yes. One of the things we want to point out is that, the technology platform is in a transition from a lot of small accounts and earlier stage start up to fewer larger durable customers. We made the decision throughout 2022 to stop chasing a lot of smaller deals. So what you see in the quarter is less new customers coming on and contributing to revenue that would have been signed in 2022, in the earlier part of the year and that transition is ongoing. We expect the revenue to continue to stay at about this level throughout the year and we'll start to see more meaningful contribution from some of the larger more durable customers that we've signed up. A couple of which were actually on the platform now and contributing, but that will become more -- that will become bigger and more significant by the end of the year. We really like the strategy. It's longer lead times. It's longer sales cycles. But the economic opportunity from each one of these partners goes well, well beyond just using the processing platform or APIs at Galileo to a number of other products. One of the things that may not be obvious to everyone is that, we're starting to see really strong traction in some of the products that are on top of the platform. So for example, [Connecta] (ph) is a natural language AI chatbot that helps with customer service. SoFi actually just integrated itself in our business, but it's gotten great uptick from adoption from our partners. We also rolled out something called PRP, which is Pain Risk platform, we're leveraging all the data on the Galileo platform. We process about 6 billion transactions a year. That gives us great intelligence to be able to detect transactional fraud. We're now offering that product and capability to our partners that have seen really strong uptake there. And then we also launched in our platform for the first time fully integrated SoFi, Galileo and Technisys, [indiscernible] for product. The reality is, it's an installment based product that's like buy now pay later, but it's delivered in your app, you apply in your app, you get a virtual card instantly, you get a card number, and you can execute that at any retail location or any online capability, it acts just like a debit card or credit card, but as different economics in the back end. The great thing about the product is that, it's driven all by interchange. It's not driven by a retailer's discount. It's not driven by an interest rate or a fee. And so there's a lot that's in the pipeline for the technology platform. The demand is as strong as it's ever been. We're going to move through this transition of fewer smaller accounts to larger -- sorry, fewer smaller accounts than what we used to do to get these larger more durable customers. And we should start to see the benefit in the back half of the year in terms of an acceleration of revenue and then into 2024. Yes. On the technology platform side, I think you're asking a question about accounts and the growth of that being slower year-over-year and down sequentially. That just reflects a partner that moves off the platform and those accounts moving off. So it's both new account growth offset by that partner that moved off in 2022 off the platform. In terms of the unemployment rate, I'll give -- I'll hand over to Chris to talk about how we think about underwriting credit and the macroeconomic factors that we're looking at. And let me finish here by saying that we've been in an all-out sprint over the last five years to build out our digital product suite to meet our member's needs. For every major financial decision in their lives and all the days in between, thanks to the incredible grit and hard work of our team at SoFi. We've been able to do that consistently. That said, we've seen tectonic plate shift for the industry in each of the last five years and some years multiple times. But through that volatility and uncertainty, we continue to prevail and thrive hitting eight record quarters of revenue in a row and hitting strategic and financial inflection points all along the way. 2023 has proven to be as formidable in just three short months as any year and it's just getting started. We're likely to see another multi tectonic plate shifting year. That said, SoFi will be ready. We'll be ready because the benefits of our strategy to build a uniquely diversified business combined with the national banking license not only positions SoFi to be the winner takes most in the separate transition of financial services to digital, but also provide greater durability through a market cycle and the many other viable events that may occur. I'm excited about where we are today and even more excited about where we can go from here. With that, thank you for your interest in SoFi and we'll talk to you in three short months."

And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Anthony.\nAnthony Noto: Good morning. Thanks for joining us today. I'm thrilled to share our results for Q3, which was the strongest quarter in our history. I want to thank our members and clients for continuing to put their trust in SoFi, and to thank our team for their absolute grit delivering another great quarter. Our results reflect far more than just 90 days of work. They show how SoFi is consistently achieving durable growth, how our innovation and brand-building are attracting more members and clients to our platform than ever before, and how we are delivering strong and improving returns. I'll touch on these three topics before handing it over to Chris, who will share our financial and operating results. First, on SoFi's performance as a durable growth company, Q3 was another record quarter for SoFi. We built on the strong momentum from the first half of 2024, putting us on pace to significantly exceed our 2024 plan and firmly on track towards the three-year outlook we shared at the end of last year. Here are some highlights. Adjusted net revenue reached a record of $689 million in the quarter, a year-over-year acceleration in growth to 30% versus 22% in Q2. For the first time, financial services makes up more than a third of our total revenue. The segment recorded $238 million of revenue in Q3, up 102% from the prior year. I could not be prouder of how we've scaled this segment over the past five years since launching these products through a tumultuous and unpredictable environment to now be a $1 billion annualized revenue business, growing over 100% with strong and improving profitability. And frankly, it's still day one. Our tech platform grew to nearly $103 million in net revenue, up 14% from the prior year. We continue to see a strong pipeline of potential partners that are striving to modernize their platforms. Combined, our non-lending segments grew 64% year-over-year, and drove the company's overall growth of 30%. And now they make-up a record 49% of total revenue, up from 39% a year-ago, driving an important diversification of our business. We also recorded tremendous growth in key revenue drivers, members, products, as well as revenue per product in the quarter. We added 756,000 new members in Q3. That's up 35% year-over-year to a total of 9.4 million members. We grew products in the quarter by over 1 million to 13.7 million products. That's up 31% year-over-year or 37% when excluding digital asset accounts related to our transfer of crypto services in 2023. The Financial Services segment drove 964,000 of those new products. Importantly, revenue per product was $81, up 52% from $53 a year ago. We believe there remains substantial upside in both product growth and monetization. Our one-stop shop continues to attract great cross-buying behavior by our members. In fact, 32% of new products were opened by existing SoFi members, and 20% of our new members opened a second product in their first 30 days. This is the power of the flywheel we have developed. In our Tech Platform, we reached over 160 million total accounts. That's up 17% year-over-year. Overall, we're making incredible progress in our shift towards more fee-based, capital-light, and lower-risk revenue sources. Combined, fee-based revenue made up $174 million or a quarter of our adjusted net revenue in Q3. This revenue grew by 65% year-over-year. On an annualized basis, that's nearly $700 million in revenue. This progress was driven by a record quarter in our loan platform business, which totaled $56 million in fee-based revenue, and is up more than 5x year-over-year, as well as strong growth in interchange, which is up 2x year-over-year. Chris will share more details on these areas in a few moments. On top of all of this work to diversify our revenue base to capital-light, high return on equity, and fee-based revenue, we also grew our lending segment in Q3. We seized on the improving rate environment in the quarter, our improving credit trends, and strong performance across all lending products to achieve a record $6.3 billion in loan volume, and $392 million in adjusted net revenue, up 14% year-over-year. Looking back at the progress we've made over the past several years, it's fair to say that SoFi is battle tested, given the scale, profitability, and growth we have recorded for the total company in 2024 with our largest and most profitable business lending barely growing. It should now be crystal clear that SoFi can drive sustained growth across the cycle. We've achieved 17 of 19 quarters of record revenue through a recession, a pandemic, a 150 basis point rate drop, damage to our largest and most profitable business, student loan refinance, only to face a 500 basis point increase in rates and the collapse of venerable financial institutions in our neighborhood. The innovations we have driven to scale our non-lending revenue, which are capital-light and high ROE, have enabled us to grow our total revenue by more than 20% year-over-year for 17 consecutive quarters, as well as grow both our members and products by 35% or more year-over-year, excluding digital asset accounts transferred in 2023. Our performance in the hard times is what gives me strong confidence in our future. Today, we face fewer headwinds than any point in our history. We're heading into 2025 with the most favorable conditions of the last seven years with declining rates and a stable economy, with the most diverse business we've ever had, with more members in our ecosystem, and more products that serve their needs than ever before. This brings me to my second topic, the innovation and brand-building that drive our durable growth. The market for consumer financial services is massive and historically poorly served. A Mintel report found that just this year, one in five U.S. adults have been in the market for a new savings account. A similar number are looking for new credit cards. Those markets, not to mention those looking for new investment accounts, new checking accounts, new personal loans, new mortgages, and buy now, pay later, all grew year-over-year. Meeting all of a person's financial needs in one place with world-class products delivered seamlessly and digitally gives us a massive advantage. This is why you will often hear me say, it's a matter of when, not if we become a Top 10 financial institution. To do so, it's absolutely critical that we build the unaided brand awareness to become a trusted household brand name. The awareness we generate for SoFi is highly effective at getting people to try a product. After becoming a member, they cross-buy into another product, then another. They recommend SoFi to others. This flywheel that we've created drives acquisition costs down over time, and reliably generates profits that we can invest in new product innovations to serve even more of our members' needs. Our accomplishments in Q3 demonstrate the power of this virtuous cycle. First, we continue to establish SoFi as a trusted household name. We ended Q3 with our highest average unaided brand awareness of all time, up nearly 40% year-over-year to 7%. Our highly effective marketing engine continues to reach and engage new audiences. For example, Q3 saw the kickoff of the new NFL season at the award-winning SoFi Stadium. We unveiled a new brand campaign with LA Chargers' quarterback, Justin Herbert, inspiring people to reach their most important financial ambitions. We also launched new partnerships with Los Angeles Sparks' forward, Cameron Brink, and tennis champion, Venus Williams. And coming in January, the TGL presented by SoFi, a new tech-infused arena golf league with an exciting match-play format across teams of top PGA TOUR golfers like Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy, Wyndham Clark, Xander Schauffele, and Justin Thomas, just to name a few. Second, we continue to innovate so people find unique value when they use our products. Starting with our Financial Services segment, in SoFi Invest, we've seen strong engagement driven by new alternative assets, mutual funds, and money market funds we've rolled out over the past year. Overall, we're providing Main Street investors access to unique investment products historically reserved for the ultra-wealthy like interval funds, private credit, private real estate, and private venture. We also launched our new directed share program, which offers a modern and streamlined approach to equity programs for companies looking to raise capital through IPOs. And we are expanding our award-winning robo offering later this year. Importantly, we are building the Invest business cost-effectively by appealing to existing members. 70% of sign-ups are existing SoFi members. In SoFi Money, we reached record highs in accounts, total deposits, and direct deposit members. We grew member deposits by nearly $2.4 billion and annualized debit spending reached $10.3 billion in Q3. We will soon improve our self-serve wire transfers, which similar to introducing Zelle, will further expand members money movement options. In our member team, we're beta testing a new cash coach product that will analyze members' cash across all of their financial products at SoFi and beyond, and offer various ways to optimize their cash, whether it's paying down expensive debt, setting up an emergency savings fund, getting more yield on their savings, or making investments in a diversified portfolio that is appropriate for their goals. We're also on track to launch improvements to SoFi Plus, our premium membership tier, and our beta testing, a new fee-based subscription option in the coming months. Over time, SoFi Plus will increasingly show the magic of our strategy, deliver incremental and unmatched value across our portfolio of products. In Credit Card, we officially launched the Everyday Cash Rewards and the Essential credit cards, enabling SoFi to serve more people's spending and borrowing needs, whether it's helping them earn rewards or building their credit. In our loan platform business, what started as a decline monetization funnel, has now evolved into an integrated loan platform experience, which now offers just-in-time lending. In Q3, the loan platform business grew 5x year-over-year, mainly driven by record personal loan volume. We expect this business to continue to grow as we shift towards even more fee-based, capital-light, and lower-risk sources of revenue. We also signed our first two direct insurance carriers for SoFi Protect, complementing our comprehensive financial services offering we've built over the last five years. Turning to our Lending segment. In personal loans, our innovation has helped generate a record $4.9 billion in volume, up 26% year-over-year, including $1 billion originated on behalf of third parties for our loan platform business. In home loans, we grew total home loan volume 38% year-over-year to $490 million. Home equity loan volume was up 44% from the prior quarter as rates began to decline. Home purchase and refinancing volumes grew 23% from the prior year period. In fact, home refinancing volume was the highest we've seen since the second quarter of 2022. And finally, in our Tech Platform, we signed several new partnerships, including processing deals with two charter banks of Mexico and a deployment of Galileo's Cyberbank Core for SoFi's new commercial payment services sponsor bank program. We launched additional fraud prevention solutions, the Galilo Instant Verification Engine, which we call GIVE, as well as Transaction Risk GScore, both of which help clients enhance their security and operational efficiency. Our new Secured Credit with Dynamic Funding offering promotes greater financial inclusion and enables clients to help their customers build stronger credit. And lastly, we launched programs with clients signed in prior quarters spanning cross-border payments, global payouts, financial literacy and scalable payment solutions. On top of this relentless focus on innovation and brand-building, we built our business to deliver strong and reliable returns well into the future. We achieved record profitability in Q3. GAAP net income reached nearly $61 million, a $327 million improvement year-over-year or $80 million when excluding the goodwill impairment expense we incurred in the prior year. EBITDA grew 90% from the prior year to a record of $186 million. All three of our operating segments achieved record contribution profit in the quarter. We continue to improve credit performance in Q3 and are firmly within the life of loan guidance we've previously provided. As we've shared in our last call, delinquencies peaked in March of 2024. Since then, we've continued to see improvements quarter-over-quarter. Cumulative fair value adjustments along with delinquencies on an absolute and percentage basis all performed better in Q3. With all the innovations we've made across marketing, originations and servicing, buyers continue to see compelling opportunities in SoFi's loan portfolio. Loan sales reached almost $1.3 billion in total this quarter and nearly $5 billion in the last 12 months. And finally, with our strong balance sheet, we are well-capitalized heading into an improving rate environment. Our total capital ratio is 16.3%, well-above regulatory minimums. In Q3, tangible book value increased $236 million to a total of $4.4 billion. We look forward to building on this momentum and delivering continued returns heading into the new year. In closing, I couldn't be more proud of what we've accomplished, not just for Q3, but for delivering a steady and consistent record of durable growth, incredible brand building and product innovation that help our members and clients, and strong improving returns for our shareholders. Their future is bright and I am fired up for what's in store. With that, I'll hand it over to Chris.\nChris Lapointe: Thanks, Anthony. I'm going to walk through key financial highlights and our financial outlook. Unless otherwise stated, I'll be referring to adjusted results for the third quarter of 2024 versus the third quarter of 2023. Our GAAP consolidated income statement and all reconciliations can be found in today's earnings release and the subsequent 10-Q filing, which will be made available next month. The record results we achieved across all three segments this quarter are a testament of our continued execution, our durable growth in members, products and clients, and our diversification toward capital-light, fee-based revenue with increased returns. For the quarter, we delivered record adjusted net revenue of $689 million, with growth accelerating to 30% year-over-year, up from 22% last quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $186 million at a 27% margin. This represents nearly 9 points of year-over-year margin improvement, demonstrating significant operating leverage across all of our functions with expense margins decreasing year-over-year. Importantly, sales and marketing continues to decline as a percentage of adjusted net revenue, decreasing by 4 points year-over-year. We delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability with GAAP net income reaching nearly $61 million, a $327 million improvement year-over-year, or $80 million when excluding the goodwill impairment expense we incurred in the prior year period. We generated GAAP EPS at $0.05 per share in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, we delivered $214 million of GAAP net income. And when looking at the sum of our reported EPS over the past four quarters, we generated about $0.11 per share. Now, on to the segment-level performance, where we saw record revenue and contribution profit across all three operating segments. Starting with Financial Services, we achieved $238 million in net revenue, up more than 2x year-over-year. We reached nearly 11.8 million products in the quarter, up 33% year-over-year or 40% when excluding crypto accounts. We continue to improve monetization across all products with annualized revenue per product of $81, up 52% year-over-year versus $53 in the prior year quarter. This growth was driven by higher deposits and member spending in SoFi Money and significant expansion of our Loan Platform Business, which I'll describe in a moment. Both of these businesses achieved all-time records for revenue in Q3. We also benefited from new monetizable features in SoFi Invest and a saw robust growth in credit card spend. We see significant opportunity for growth in these businesses as well as SMB and Protect, which are all under-monetized today. Net interest income of $154 million increased 66% year-over-year, which was primarily driven by growth in consumer deposits. Non-interest income grew 235% to $84 million in the quarter, which represents nearly $340 million in annualized revenue. A key driver of non-interest income growth this quarter was our loan platform business, where we refer pre-qualified borrowers to origination partners and originate loans on behalf of third-parties. Here's how our loan platform business works. With our best-in-class product, highly effective marketing engine, and network of respected buyers like Fortress, with whom we announced a $2 billion Loan Platform Business agreement earlier this month, we can efficiently match the demand of members shopping for loans with the demand for high-quality loans in the capital markets. When a member takes out a loan, they gain all of the benefits of becoming a SoFi member along with easy access to other products in our one-stop shop, even though we originated the loan on someone else's behalf. This enables SoFi to serve more potential members, while also further diversifying toward less capital-intensive and more fee-based sources of revenue. In Q3, we generated $56 million in loan platform fees, driven by $1 billion of personal loans originated on behalf of third parties as well as referrals. We also generated $5.5 million in servicing cash flows, which is recorded in our lending segment. Our Loan Platform Business in total added $61 million to our adjusted net revenue. In addition to our Loan Platform revenue, we continue to see healthy growth in interchange, up 211% year-over-year as a result of $12 billion in total annualized spend in the quarter across Money and Credit Card. Overall, contribution profit for our Financial Services segment in the quarter was a record at nearly $100 million at a 42% margin, even as we continue to invest in innovation, acquisition costs that require a payback period, and new opportunities to rapidly grow this operating segment with attractive returns. Shifting to our Tech Platform segment, where we delivered record net revenue of nearly $103 million in the quarter, up 14% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Revenue growth was driven by strong contribution from new clients, as well as growth in Latin America, consumer brands in the U.S., and clients with innovative use cases like earned wage access and money movement. Galileo accounts grew 17% year-over-year to $160 million. The segment delivered a record contribution profit of $33 million, representing a 32% margin. We've discussed before how the pipeline spans banks, brands, and fintechs across consumer and B2B, which offer larger and more durable revenue. The pipeline is in a stronger spot than it's ever been, and the investments made in this segment have greatly expanded the market opportunity. Recent wins and pipeline strength are early, but telling signs that the strategy is working. Moving on to Lending. We achieved record adjusted net revenue of $392 million, with a record of $239 million of contribution profit at a 61% adjusted margin. These results were driven by 19% year-over-year growth in net interest income, while adjusted non-interest income decreased by 2% year-over-year. Growth in net interest income was driven by a 35% year-over-year increase in average interest-earning assets, slightly offset by a 44 basis point year-over-year decrease in average yields. This resulted in an average net interest margin of 5.6% for the quarter. In terms of non-interest income, Q3 originations grew 23% year-over-year to over $6.3 billion, and were driven by a record quarter in personal loan originations, which grew 26% year-over-year and 17% sequentially to $4.9 billion, with $1 billion originated on behalf of third parties for our loan platform business. Our student loans business saw origination volume grow 3% year-over-year and 28% sequentially to $944 million, our best quarter since Q1 2022. Home loans volume grew by 38% year-over-year and 17% sequentially to $490 million, our best quarter since 2021. In the third quarter, we sold portions of our personal loan, home loan, and senior secured loan portfolios totaling $1.3 billion. In terms of personal loan sales, we closed approximately $375 million of loans in whole loan form at an execution of 105.9%. These had similar structures to other recent personal loan sales with cash proceeds at or near par, and the majority of the premium consisting of contractual servicing fees that are capitalized. These sales included a small loss share provision that is above our base assumption of losses and immaterial relative to the exposure we would otherwise have if we held the loans. Our $504 million of home loan sales were sold at a blended execution of 102.6%. Additionally, we sold $81 million of late-stage delinquent personal loans in the quarter. As we've noted in the past, we typically have not sold delinquent loans until such a time that they are charged off. However, we have been able to generate positive incremental value over time in these sales relative to selling after they charge off both from our improved recovery capabilities and by maintaining servicing. Finally, we sold $312 million of senior secured loans at a par execution. In addition, one of our large senior secured loans with $594 million of principal outstanding was prepaid and refinanced by the borrower and is no longer on the balance sheet. Net-net, inclusive of new issuance in period, our secured loan balance decreased by more than $750 million sequentially. These transactions demonstrate clear market support for the marks on these loans with $312 million of our senior secured loans sold at our marked value, and another $594 million of senior secured loans prepaid so the borrower could refinance with another bank at more attractive rates. Turning to the profile of our borrower and the overall credit performance. Our personal loan borrowers' weighted average income is $164,000 with a weighted average FICO score of 746. Our student loan borrowers' weighted average income is $135,000 with a weighted average FICO score of 765. After seeing credit trends peak in Q1, we have seen continued improvement in personal loans. Our on-balance sheet 90-day personal loan delinquency rate was 57 basis points in the quarter, a decrease from 64 basis points in Q2, which is further evidence of surpassing a peak in Q1. Our personal loan annualized charge-off rate decreased to 3.52% from 3.84% in Q2, including the impact of asset sales, new originations, and the delinquency sale in the quarter. Had we not sold these late-stage delinquencies, we estimate that including recoveries between 90 days and 120 days delinquent, we would have had an all-in annualized net charge-off rate for personal loans of approximately 5.0% versus 5.4% last quarter. For our student loans, our on-balance sheet 90-day delinquency rate remained flat quarter-over-quarter at 12 basis points, while our annualized charge-off rate was 69 basis points. The data continues to support our 7% to 8% maximum life of loan loss assumptions for personal loans, in line with our underwriting tolerance. Similar to last quarter, we provided a loan vintage analysis on Page 10 of our investor presentation. Since this only provides a partial window into our loan portfolio, we're unlikely to provide the same analysis longer term. However, it's a helpful illustration of how recent vintages are collectively performing against our 2017 vintage as this is the last time that we approached 8% life of loan losses at 7.85%. You can see significant improvement in cumulative net losses at a given percentage of remaining unpaid principal for more recent 2022 and 2023 vintages. Specifically looking at the Q4 2022 to Q4 2023 vintages, soon after we made material cuts to credit, net cumulative losses of 3.3% are well below the 4.8% observed in the 2017 vintage at the same point of 49% remaining principal balance. The gap between the newer cohort curve and the 2017 cohort curve widened slightly quarter-over-quarter. Furthermore, looking at Page 11 in the investor presentation, you will notice that only 43% of unpaid principal balance remains from our Q1 2020 through Q2 2024 originations. Among the 57% of principal that has already been paid down, we've seen 6% in net cumulative losses. For life of loan losses on this entire cohort of loans to reach 8% net cumulative losses, the remaining unpaid principal would need to charge off at a rate of more than 10%. Past vintages have performed meaningfully better after this point in the seasoning curve, further improving our confidence in achieving loss rates below 8%. Now turning to our fair value marks and key assumptions. Our personal loans are marked at a 105.7%, 142 basis points higher quarter-over-quarter. This was driven by a 97 basis point decrease in the discount rate to 4.78%, which was directly driven by the drop in benchmark rates by 113 basis points and offset by 16 basis points of spread widening. The constant default rate, or CDR, also decreased by 28 basis points, which is consistent with the observed credit trends I just highlighted. For our student loan portfolio, the fair value mark increased by 183 basis points to 105.4%. This was driven by a 45 basis point decrease in the discount rate to 3.99% due to an 87 basis point decrease in rates, but offset by 42 basis points of spread widening. The weighted average coupon in the portfolio also increased by 17 basis points. The fair value gains in the quarter were significantly more than offset by our hedge losses and the negative impact from spreads widening. Net-net, we did not see a positive impact on the reported revenue from the change in marks, net of hedge losses and new originations. Switching to our balance sheet, where we remain very well-capitalized. Assets grew by $1.7 billion as a result of nearly $1.4 billion growth in loans and approximately $226 million of an increase in cash, cash equivalents and investment securities. On the liability side, member deposits grew by nearly $2.4 billion to nearly $23 billion, while overall deposits increased to $24 billion. We reduced our brokered deposits by $445 million as we continue to use our consumer deposits to replace higher-cost parts of the funding stack. Currently, there is a 220 basis points difference between interest we pay on deposits and the interest we pay on warehouse lines, which translates to more than $500 million in annualized interest expense savings, given the size of our deposit base. We exited the quarter with just $1.3 billion of warehouse debt drawn. This difference continues to support our net interest margin of 5.6%, underscoring the benefits of having the option of holding loans on balance sheet when advantageous in collecting net interest income. We continue to expect to maintain a healthy net interest margin above 5% for the foreseeable future and benefit from the continued mix shift towards deposit funding along with our ability to sustain healthy deposit versus lending betas. In terms of our regulatory capital ratios, our total capital ratio of 16.3% remains comfortably above the regulatory minimum of 10.5%. Lastly, we grew book value to $6.1 billion and tangible book value by $236 million sequentially to $4.4 billion with tangible book value per share at $4. Now on to guidance. For the full year 2024, we now expect to deliver adjusted net revenue of $2.535 billion to $2.550 billion, which is $85 million higher than our prior guidance range of $2.425 billion to $2.465 billion. This implies 22% to 23% annual growth versus 17% to 19% previously. This guidance assumes Lending revenue will be at least 100% of 2023 levels, Financial Services will grow more than 80% year-over-year, and Tech Platform will grow low- to upper-teens percent year-over-year. We now expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA of $640 million to $645 million, above our prior guidance of $605 million to $615 million. This represents a 25% adjusted EBITDA margin. We now expect full-year GAAP net income of $204 million to $206 million above prior guidance of $175 million to $185 million, and GAAP EPS of $0.11 to $0.12 per share above prior guidance of $0.09 to $0.10 per share. We now expect growth in tangible book value of approximately $1 billion to $1.05 billion and continue to expect to end the year with a total capital ratio at or above 16%. In terms of member growth, we expect to add at least 2.3 million new members in 2024, which represents 30% growth. Overall, we couldn't be more proud of our Q3 results. We continue to demonstrate our position as a durable growth story, which is reflected in this quarter's strong results. Despite operating in unpredictable macro conditions, we've maintained a clear focus on executing our strategy, driving returns, and helping our members get their money right. We could not be more excited about the opportunities ahead of us as we continue our journey towards becoming a top financial institution. With that, let's begin the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Dan Dolev from Mizuho. Dan, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDan Dolev: Hi guys. Great results as always. Can you give us some more color on the loan platform deals, like how do you make money here and how does this differ from the prior quarters? Thanks again great results.\nAnthony Noto: Sure. Thanks, Dan. And so overall, this is a great fee-based and capital-light revenue source for us. We're not taking balance sheet risk. We're generating meaningful cash fees upfront at time of transfer or referral and we're able to serve the needs of more members at a more rapid pace than we've been able to do so before. So, there are several ways that we make revenue within the business, which has certainly evolved since we started focusing on decline monetization in 2019. First is we send qualified borrowers to platform partners via our Lantern marketplace and we receive a referral fee if the borrower takes out a loan. The second way we make money is we can embed the specific credit box of our platform partners into our underwriting engine and originate on behalf of those partners with the transfer of those loans to the partner occurring shortly after origination. For that, we receive an upfront cash fee and we also retain servicing. The third way and what's new this quarter is that we're able to originate on behalf of other third-party investors based on a specific asset characteristic and return profile of that investor with loans transferred shortly after origination. This is within days or a week. We receive an upfront cash fee -- platform fee for that business and we also retain servicing. And then the fourth way that we can make money and we've been doing this for a few quarters now is we can service assets that we do not originate, but are held on the balance sheets of other third-parties. For that, we receive regular servicing fees that are not capitalized. What I would say is important is in all of these cases, these are assets that we wouldn't have otherwise underwritten unless contracted due to a number of reasons, including, first, the credit profile and other characteristics of the assets, which may not be directly consistent with our current portfolio. Second, our own risk appetite may not align with those originations. And then finally, our capital allocation strategy at any given point in time may not align. The last thing I would say here is that there are no financing commitments or lost share agreements associated with any of these deals or partnerships. And the only other thing I would add, Dan, and this may not be known by a lot of people, but we declined between 70% and 80% of the personal loan applicants to SoFi. And so there's a lot of potential -- latent potential there to service them better. And so that's a big number that exists before we even try to do anything else in this business in terms of generating incremental demand or other initiatives to make people aware of the products that we can offer.\nOperator: The next question comes from Terry Ma from Barclays. Terry, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nTerry Ma: Hi, thank you. Good morning. So your originations came in ahead of our expectations and it's increased each quarter of this year. Credit seems to be improving sequentially and the macro probably a little bit less clear than earlier this year. So I guess going-forward, how do you think about originations and lending growth for your own balance sheet versus maybe originating for some of your big partnerships.\nAnthony Noto: Yes. What I would say is our overall outlook for originations or at least growth on the balance sheet has not changed. We do expect to see modest growth in dollar terms on the balance sheet year-over-year and that will continue into Q4. We are happy with the size of the balance sheet that we have today and the amount of net interest income that we're generating. We are seeing excess demand both on the borrower side as well as the loan investor side for our unsecured personal loans, and we've been able to successfully navigate and fulfill that demand through the expansion of our loan platform business. So, we would expect not to grow the PL balance sheet meaningfully from where we are today. Where we will migrate into is in a lower rate environment, you would see an uptick in-demand for our student loan refinancing business where we had a really strong quarter this quarter as well as our home loans business where we had our best quarter since 2021.\nOperator: The next question comes from John Hecht from Jefferies. John, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJohn Hecht: Good morning, guys. Congratulations and thanks for taking my question. I appreciate all the information on the credit slide about the 17 vintage versus the more recent ones. It looks like the current vintages are performing better than the 2017 vintage. I'm wondering how do you guys think about that? The contribution of that performance trend to like return on capital? And how do prepayments, or your just payment assumptions impact this outcome as well?\nChris Lapointe: Yes, thanks John. So, we often talk about underwriting to an 8% life alone loss target, which obviously reflects the strength of our underwriting and the high quality of our borrower base. However, life alone losses represents just one of several variables, which in combination actually drive our pricing, and underwriting decisions designed to maximize return on equity, while adhering to our credit risk tolerance. In terms of how we think about the returns on recent, versus some of our past vintages, all in returns on our more recent vintages are projected, to produce meaningfully higher returns. I'm talking greater than 2x versus 2017, with newer vintages expected to produce ROEs above 30%. And I'm defining ROE here, as the weighted average coupon minus annual losses, funding costs and other operational costs plus origination fees. And then multiplied by the weighted average life and levered. What's really driving those increases in returns, is a function of a number of things. First, is lower expected life alone loss rates as we show in our Investor Presentation on Page 10. Second is the higher pricing beta throughout rate increase cycles. We've demonstrated time-and-time again that we've been able to maintain really good betas. We were successful in increasing the portfolio weighted average coupon, across both products in a rising rate environment over the course of the last few years. And we've also been able to maintain pricing in down rate environments, due to the quality of our product. The third way is we've had funding cost efficiencies, given our higher reliance on member deposits and success in growing direct deposits, and replacing higher cost warehouse funding. And then fourth, we've introduced origination fees over the course of the last year plus, and we're now generating close to $400 million in origination fees annually. So the combination of these drivers, is more than offsetting the increase in prepayment speeds, and the reduction in weighted average lives that we're observing in some of these newer cohorts. Going forward, what I would say, is we're going to be talking about return metrics more often, because these life alone losses don't provide the full view.\nAnthony Noto: Another thing I would just emphasize, John, and everyone - and the shareholders more broadly, is that we've been able to achieve these types of high ROE returns in more recent vintages despite the fact that rates have been, increased significantly in a very short period of time and the economy has been somewhat uncertain, during that time period. As we look into 2025, and declining rate environment in a stable economy, we think we can only improve on these returns. And it's one of the reasons why we're leveraging all the different businesses. We are across the opportunity set that we have from a return standpoint, relative to what we believe is a prudent level of balance sheet risk, in a particular asset class such as personal loans. So we think there's a lot of upside and it only gets better from here.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeff Adelson from Morgan Stanley. Jeff, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJeff Adelson: Hi, good morning. Could you just talk a little bit more about the expectations for the loan platform business, how you expect that can grow from here? I know you said expect that to continue growing, but how meaningful can this become? It seems like if we look at the numbers today, it's already at a $4 billion run rate. You've got the Fortress relationship, which, correct me if I'm wrong, its additive to that. So that's already $6 billion. And should we be thinking about the economics as close to a 5.5% take rate, based on the revenues you reported this quarter? And then, I'm just curious, are you going to maybe deemphasize the loan sales a little bit more from here? I mean, it came in a little bit lower at the $375 million versus the billing for the last three quarters, as you maybe prioritize the loan platform business from here? Thanks.\nChris Lapointe: Yes. So I'll start and Anthony can chime in wherever. But in terms of the overall growth expectations, what I would say is as part of that billion dollars of originations that we did, Jeff, in the period. A portion of that did come from the Fortress transaction that, we announced earlier in the quarter. So it's not additive to your $4 billion run rate. It's inclusive of that. But we do expect to see continued strong growth in the segment. We have that $2 billion agreement with Fortress, as well as commitments for Q4 and 2025, with several other partners. What I would say, is we're one of the very few partners who can deliver assets at scale, with the characteristics and return profile that investors are seeking. In terms of deemphasizing other sales, and ABS transactions in favor of this, what I would say is that, demand is as strong as it's ever been before. Like I had mentioned a few questions ago, we're happy with the size of the balance sheet and the modest growth that we're expecting, expecting over the course of the next three months. But what I would say is that, we are seeing excess demand both from borrowers and investors, and a way to fulfill that demand is through the LPB business. In terms of the take rate, what I would say is. We're looking at apples-and-oranges when you're trying to compare this take rate, to what you see in the general originate to sell business. These are loans that are originated on behalf of others, and they would not have been originated unless contracted to given the credit - and overall asset characteristics of the loans, as well as our own risk appetite and capital allocation strategy. What we're receiving is a platform fee for our underwriting capabilities, our marketing capabilities, and our overall operational capabilities. And that platform fee will vary depending on the partner.\nAnthony Noto: And I think, a couple points just to emphasize. One is, the partners in the loan platform business, many of which are new incremental partners on loans as opposed to the wholesale loan buyers, or ABS buyers that we typically had. They're not all incremental, but a large percentage of them are including in the most recent quarter. In addition to that, Chris has mentioned a couple times. These are loans that wouldn't have otherwise originated, and we only originate when we actually have a contract. So it's not a zero sum game, it's incremental. And the outlook for is pretty significant as we go into 2025, in excess of what you articulated.\nChris Lapointe: The only other thing I would say in terms of, you had mentioned $375 million of sales done in period. We did over $1 billion across all three products in the quarter and $6 billion over the course of the last 12 months in overall loan sales, quarter-to-date in Q4, we've already done close to $1 billion in sales, across our products as well. So the demand is certainly there. We will continue to fulfill on both ends. But as Anthony mentioned, being able to originate on behalf of others is purely incremental to us.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kyle Peterson from Needham and Co. Kyle, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nKyle Peterson: Great. Thanks guys and good morning. Nice results. Wanted to ask a question on deposits. Some of the trends you guys are seeing there, you guys had really nice growth there despite I believe you took down the rate paid on member deposits, a bit as rates have gone down. So just any color on whether you've seen any changes in average balances, or customer behavior, or if things have been pretty receptive to some of the changes you guys have made on, deposit rates kind of early on in the rate cut cycle?\nAnthony Noto: Yes, we're really proud of the way the SoFi Money product continues to resonate in the marketplace, despite rates coming down more broadly. We've maintained our market share position, we've maintained our ranking in an APY standpoint, of course we do not charge fees. We obviously give a number of other benefits including the high interest rate, not to mention all the functionality you need in one place. So we've seen continued strong trends in deposits, over $2 billion of member deposit growth in the quarter. In addition to that, the spending levels that we're seeing are on parents, to better to where they have been historically. And so, we're continually getting positive indicators, across the entire business as it relates to SoFi Money. The other thing I would just mention, this is one of the key points of where the flywheel starts. Our direct deposit customers are customers that are more engaged. They have meaningfully higher number of products per customer, compared to the overall average that we report. And when you look at it on a vintage basis, it's even better than the overall average number of products per direct deposit members. So it's been over a year in, which we've operated this business as a bank. And being able to control our own destiny, and having a competitive advantage in being both an origination platform on loans, as well as a national bank that can set its own interest rate, and its own value proposition. It's a competitive advantage and one that's continued in the quarter. And we're excited about next year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mihir Bhatia from Bank of America. Mihir, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nMihir Bhatia: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to stay with the Financial Services segment again, and I wanted to just talk about a couple of things there. One is just about monetization in the segment. I think it's up to $81 annually now. Any targets you can share on what you think that can look like maybe this time next year, or just you know, to achieve your three year targets that you laid out. Like how much more monetization can that be? And then just related to that, just I guess what is the next growth, you mentioned SMB PROTECT in your remarks. You also launched the credit card more broadly. So maybe talk to us about where that next growth vector is materializing from. I guess really what I'm asking is what's the next lending platform business in that sector, right. Like I think it was a pretty big surprise for a lot of people how much that business grew this quarter. So give us a…?\nAnthony Noto: You've hit the nail in the head. Yes, thank you. You've hit the nail on the head. It's an exciting part of our business. The fact that we're approaching $1 billion annualized business, very profitable while we're still in investment mode. It's pretty amazing to have a business of that size, $23 million of revenue, growing over 100% and profitable despite how fast we are growing the number of members, and products and revenue per product. And I think the best way to sort of conceptualize where this business could go, is to think about those three variables, member growth, product growth and revenue per product. The revenue per product that we generate today was up meaningfully in the quarter, as you mentioned, but it's nowhere near where it can be long-term. As it relates to our invest business, we're monetizing at about half the rate that we think we can monetize it over time. In 2025, we'll take a number of steps where we start to monetize that better, of course, by adding incremental value to the invest experience. Our invest product is unique in that we're trying to be a one-stop shop just within Invest. We pioneered fractional shares. We obviously don't pay - charge on trades. In addition to that, we created our own ETFs that would better meet the needs of our new and beginning investors. That are lower price point, but diversified, allowing our members to do dollar cost averaging in a diversified way. We have award-winning robo accounts, and we continue to evolve those and you'll see us do more in 2025, behind that to not just grow assets, but also to increase monetization. We do IPOs, which is a direct monetization vehicle. But again, a unique product remain Street investors get access to IPOs and IPO prices. And then our alternate asset classes and mutual funds that we launched have really been a tailwind for us, in terms of driving more engagement. That's something today that we don't monetize that we will monetize in the future. So just in the Invest business, we have over 100% opportunity, to increase the monetization per member not to mention the fact, how fast the products and invest are growing. And remember, when you do the calculation on Invest product growth, you have to normalize it for the lost crypto members, or products that we had a year ago that were transferred. SoFi Money business, we continue to see nice trends in deposits and spending, and the monetization there will continue to improve with more deposits, and more spending as opposed to a change in rate per se. In addition to that, our credit card business is another source of monetization opportunity. As balances continue to increase, we'll have more monetization there in addition to the more members that we add the more monetization that we drive, because that's a higher interchange revenue than our debit interchange. And so, as you see a mix shift, you'll see an improvement in monetization there, not to mention just the absolute increase in monetization. And then as it relates to small medium business, we're just scratching the surface. The biggest initiative we had so far in 2024, was to take the application process and embed it into the SoFi app. So when all the demand that we get for small and medium business comes to SoFi, they can within the native app, apply for a loan and then be referred to a partner as it relates to lending. We also do that as it relates to banking, you'll continue to see us do that in a much bigger and broader way. There is monetization there today, but we could do more products and more services to drive greater monetization not to mention doing it ourselves at some point, which we would like to do over time. It is an early-stage business, and we want to crawl before we walk and then ultimately run. So you'll see that in the SMB business. On the insurance side, the deals that we're doing in the marketplace, increase our monetization there, but also increases penetration. So over 100% revenue growth in the quarter, driven by the really strong product growth and revenue per product. And he has focused on those two measurements, you'll be able to forecast a pretty sizable business with great profitability. The last point I make on profitability, is we're still losing a large amount of money in the credit card business and Invest business, because the payback there is, is longer. And it's not a business that we get return on in one year. It takes anywhere from one and a half to two to three years, depending on the J curve of the credit business. So what's masking the profitability is that investment there. If we actually subtracted added back the losses that we're losing there, the number would be even bigger on the profitability side. And that's before we've improved any of the monetization.\nMaura Cyr: I found this on the web.\nOperator: The next question is from Peter Christiansen from Citigroup. Peter, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nPeter Christiansen: Nice trends here. I was just curious, bigger picture, can we talk about what you're seeing in the alt credit side, credit is certainly becoming a theme, some of your marketplace lending peers have also benefited here. In your discussions pipeline, just curious if you think this is emerging as a larger theme over the next 12, 18 months? And then finally, as it relates to tech platform performance pipeline, can you talk to the degree of decision delay you're seeing currently, versus last quarter? Thank you.\nAnthony Noto: Yes. In terms of demand for our loans from buyers or investors, similar to other people, the demand has increased quite meaningfully. We are better at being able to meet some of that demand, by continue to evolve our business from origination platform for our own loans, and now the evolution of the loan platform business. So similar to others, we're seeing an increase of it from existing buyers. But also a number of new partners that we've not been able to meet their needs with before, but we now can. So really excited about declining rate environment, putting a tailwind behind the loans, not to mention our new initiatives there. As it relates to the tech platform, no decisions have been made by any of the big deals that we've been in process with over the last 12 to 18 months. I do think we're coming to the end of some of those decisions being made. And I would just say that we haven't had anything announced. But I would just tell you I'm confident that we will have some wins there, but none of the decisions have been made on any of the large deals. And I would just give you more color on the types of deals. There are definitely big financial institutions that have to make some decisions on their technology. They continue to really struggle with how they budget for that transition. But without a doubt, there's a technical reason why they have to switch. There's a risk reason why they have to switch, and there's a regulatory reason. And so, it's going to be an inevitable change, and a tailwind to the demand for technology, like we have in our tech platform business, and specifically in core and processing. And it's just a question of when, and I think we'll win our fair share of deals there, but none have been decided yet. The second area that we haven't talked as much about in the past, is the opportunity to help large branded companies that have big installed bases, they're in the financial services business already today through a credit card, and a white label credit card. There's absolutely a significant amount of demand from those types of partners for us to do something very similar on the debit side of the business. And we continue to receive RFPs, for that type of product. And then, of course, outside of the direct-to-consumer businesses, there is demand from government agencies, there's demand for B2B companies that continue to surface and some of, which we've signed and executed against, some of which will be decided over the coming months.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jill Shea from UBS. Jill, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJill Shea: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. You launched the everyday Cash Rewards and the essential credit cards while early days. Can you just talk about the early indications there, and your view of future growth on the card products?\nAnthony Noto: Yes. We really like the card business long term. It obviously is an expensive endeavor near term. There's a J curve of about three years in that business. We have a world-class team that's done this before. That wasn't the case when we first launched. The two cards that you mentioned, are a direct result of all the work the team - our second team that came in and run this business has done. We did a test with the business. We saw the type of performance that we were hoping to see. Our marketing capabilities there have also helped us deliver the type of performance, we wanted to see in those cards. And that's why we went general availability for those cards, as opposed to just testing. I will say we will take a very methodical approach to the credit card business. While it is a great ROE business. It also does have the ability to lose a lot of money and lose money every day. And so, we'll continue to make sure that, that card is something that we market to individuals that we think have a high probability, of utilizing it in the right way, and we can get a great return on it. So, we'll start with our members, and we'll continue to use the data that we have on them to make decisions. We can use that data to model opportunities off of our platform, which we're starting to do as well. Inside of the Financial Services business, think about as a couple of different types of segments. We have businesses that are still growing very fast that, are profitable like SoFi Money, we have businesses that are growing very fast and losing money like invest in credit card. And then we have businesses that are early stage. And we're planting seeds that will continue to be harvested over time, and grown over time. And this is a business that's in the middle, one that we feel we're confident in terms of our go-to-market. And one that will grow, but we'll do it methodically over time, to make sure that we do not push too hard on the investment, we have to make and offset the profitability overall business, but it will be a good contributor.\nOperator: At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Anthony Noto for closing remarks.\nAnthony Noto: Thank you, operator, and thanks for everyone that's dialed into the call. I have some closing remarks, I want to share. As I mentioned at the end of Q2, I cannot feel better about what we've achieved and where we're headed right here, and right now. The list of achievements is far, too, great to capture every quarter, so let me be succinct and clear. Despite the tumultuous environment over the past seven years. We've delivered durable growth, world-class innovation and brand building, and improving returns with 17 quarters of record revenue, consistent 35%-plus growth in members and products, four quarters of GAAP profitability, and so many other milestones. There is only one reason available emerge stronger, from such a tumultuous environment. And that reason is that people of SoFi: our employees, our members and our clients. I could not be prouder, or more grateful to the people of SoFi. We now face hopefully, the most advantageous environment that we've seen since I joined the company, and we began the relentless march to be a one-stop shop. Today, we are no longer just a lending company. Today, we are a force to be reckoned with. It is truly our time as we have more products, more members, more capital and more diverse revenue streams than ever before. We are undeniably the absolute best vision company, to capture the massive opportunities still ahead of us, because of the same thing that got us here: our people. Our people are great at heart. Thank you, everyone, for your time today, and we hope you have a great end to 2024.\nMaura Cyr: Good bye.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Anthony. I'm going to walk through key financial highlights and our financial outlook. Unless otherwise stated, I'll be referring to adjusted results for the third quarter of 2024 versus the third quarter of 2023. Our GAAP consolidated income statement and all reconciliations can be found in today's earnings release and the subsequent 10-Q filing, which will be made available next month. The record results we achieved across all three segments this quarter are a testament of our continued execution, our durable growth in members, products and clients, and our diversification toward capital-light, fee-based revenue with increased returns. For the quarter, we delivered record adjusted net revenue of $689 million, with growth accelerating to 30% year-over-year, up from 22% last quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $186 million at a 27% margin. This represents nearly 9 points of year-over-year margin improvement, demonstrating significant operating leverage across all of our functions with expense margins decreasing year-over-year. Importantly, sales and marketing continues to decline as a percentage of adjusted net revenue, decreasing by 4 points year-over-year. We delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability with GAAP net income reaching nearly $61 million, a $327 million improvement year-over-year, or $80 million when excluding the goodwill impairment expense we incurred in the prior year period. We generated GAAP EPS at $0.05 per share in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, we delivered $214 million of GAAP net income. And when looking at the sum of our reported EPS over the past four quarters, we generated about $0.11 per share. Now, on to the segment-level performance, where we saw record revenue and contribution profit across all three operating segments. Starting with Financial Services, we achieved $238 million in net revenue, up more than 2x year-over-year. We reached nearly 11.8 million products in the quarter, up 33% year-over-year or 40% when excluding crypto accounts. We continue to improve monetization across all products with annualized revenue per product of $81, up 52% year-over-year versus $53 in the prior year quarter. This growth was driven by higher deposits and member spending in SoFi Money and significant expansion of our Loan Platform Business, which I'll describe in a moment. Both of these businesses achieved all-time records for revenue in Q3. We also benefited from new monetizable features in SoFi Invest and a saw robust growth in credit card spend. We see significant opportunity for growth in these businesses as well as SMB and Protect, which are all under-monetized today. Net interest income of $154 million increased 66% year-over-year, which was primarily driven by growth in consumer deposits. Non-interest income grew 235% to $84 million in the quarter, which represents nearly $340 million in annualized revenue. A key driver of non-interest income growth this quarter was our loan platform business, where we refer pre-qualified borrowers to origination partners and originate loans on behalf of third-parties. Here's how our loan platform business works. With our best-in-class product, highly effective marketing engine, and network of respected buyers like Fortress, with whom we announced a $2 billion Loan Platform Business agreement earlier this month, we can efficiently match the demand of members shopping for loans with the demand for high-quality loans in the capital markets. When a member takes out a loan, they gain all of the benefits of becoming a SoFi member along with easy access to other products in our one-stop shop, even though we originated the loan on someone else's behalf. This enables SoFi to serve more potential members, while also further diversifying toward less capital-intensive and more fee-based sources of revenue. In Q3, we generated $56 million in loan platform fees, driven by $1 billion of personal loans originated on behalf of third parties as well as referrals. We also generated $5.5 million in servicing cash flows, which is recorded in our lending segment. Our Loan Platform Business in total added $61 million to our adjusted net revenue. In addition to our Loan Platform revenue, we continue to see healthy growth in interchange, up 211% year-over-year as a result of $12 billion in total annualized spend in the quarter across Money and Credit Card. Overall, contribution profit for our Financial Services segment in the quarter was a record at nearly $100 million at a 42% margin, even as we continue to invest in innovation, acquisition costs that require a payback period, and new opportunities to rapidly grow this operating segment with attractive returns. Shifting to our Tech Platform segment, where we delivered record net revenue of nearly $103 million in the quarter, up 14% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Revenue growth was driven by strong contribution from new clients, as well as growth in Latin America, consumer brands in the U.S., and clients with innovative use cases like earned wage access and money movement. Galileo accounts grew 17% year-over-year to $160 million. The segment delivered a record contribution profit of $33 million, representing a 32% margin. We've discussed before how the pipeline spans banks, brands, and fintechs across consumer and B2B, which offer larger and more durable revenue. The pipeline is in a stronger spot than it's ever been, and the investments made in this segment have greatly expanded the market opportunity. Recent wins and pipeline strength are early, but telling signs that the strategy is working. Moving on to Lending. We achieved record adjusted net revenue of $392 million, with a record of $239 million of contribution profit at a 61% adjusted margin. These results were driven by 19% year-over-year growth in net interest income, while adjusted non-interest income decreased by 2% year-over-year. Growth in net interest income was driven by a 35% year-over-year increase in average interest-earning assets, slightly offset by a 44 basis point year-over-year decrease in average yields. This resulted in an average net interest margin of 5.6% for the quarter. In terms of non-interest income, Q3 originations grew 23% year-over-year to over $6.3 billion, and were driven by a record quarter in personal loan originations, which grew 26% year-over-year and 17% sequentially to $4.9 billion, with $1 billion originated on behalf of third parties for our loan platform business. Our student loans business saw origination volume grow 3% year-over-year and 28% sequentially to $944 million, our best quarter since Q1 2022. Home loans volume grew by 38% year-over-year and 17% sequentially to $490 million, our best quarter since 2021. In the third quarter, we sold portions of our personal loan, home loan, and senior secured loan portfolios totaling $1.3 billion. In terms of personal loan sales, we closed approximately $375 million of loans in whole loan form at an execution of 105.9%. These had similar structures to other recent personal loan sales with cash proceeds at or near par, and the majority of the premium consisting of contractual servicing fees that are capitalized. These sales included a small loss share provision that is above our base assumption of losses and immaterial relative to the exposure we would otherwise have if we held the loans. Our $504 million of home loan sales were sold at a blended execution of 102.6%. Additionally, we sold $81 million of late-stage delinquent personal loans in the quarter. As we've noted in the past, we typically have not sold delinquent loans until such a time that they are charged off. However, we have been able to generate positive incremental value over time in these sales relative to selling after they charge off both from our improved recovery capabilities and by maintaining servicing. Finally, we sold $312 million of senior secured loans at a par execution. In addition, one of our large senior secured loans with $594 million of principal outstanding was prepaid and refinanced by the borrower and is no longer on the balance sheet. Net-net, inclusive of new issuance in period, our secured loan balance decreased by more than $750 million sequentially. These transactions demonstrate clear market support for the marks on these loans with $312 million of our senior secured loans sold at our marked value, and another $594 million of senior secured loans prepaid so the borrower could refinance with another bank at more attractive rates. Turning to the profile of our borrower and the overall credit performance. Our personal loan borrowers' weighted average income is $164,000 with a weighted average FICO score of 746. Our student loan borrowers' weighted average income is $135,000 with a weighted average FICO score of 765. After seeing credit trends peak in Q1, we have seen continued improvement in personal loans. Our on-balance sheet 90-day personal loan delinquency rate was 57 basis points in the quarter, a decrease from 64 basis points in Q2, which is further evidence of surpassing a peak in Q1. Our personal loan annualized charge-off rate decreased to 3.52% from 3.84% in Q2, including the impact of asset sales, new originations, and the delinquency sale in the quarter. Had we not sold these late-stage delinquencies, we estimate that including recoveries between 90 days and 120 days delinquent, we would have had an all-in annualized net charge-off rate for personal loans of approximately 5.0% versus 5.4% last quarter. For our student loans, our on-balance sheet 90-day delinquency rate remained flat quarter-over-quarter at 12 basis points, while our annualized charge-off rate was 69 basis points. The data continues to support our 7% to 8% maximum life of loan loss assumptions for personal loans, in line with our underwriting tolerance. Similar to last quarter, we provided a loan vintage analysis on Page 10 of our investor presentation. Since this only provides a partial window into our loan portfolio, we're unlikely to provide the same analysis longer term. However, it's a helpful illustration of how recent vintages are collectively performing against our 2017 vintage as this is the last time that we approached 8% life of loan losses at 7.85%. You can see significant improvement in cumulative net losses at a given percentage of remaining unpaid principal for more recent 2022 and 2023 vintages. Specifically looking at the Q4 2022 to Q4 2023 vintages, soon after we made material cuts to credit, net cumulative losses of 3.3% are well below the 4.8% observed in the 2017 vintage at the same point of 49% remaining principal balance. The gap between the newer cohort curve and the 2017 cohort curve widened slightly quarter-over-quarter. Furthermore, looking at Page 11 in the investor presentation, you will notice that only 43% of unpaid principal balance remains from our Q1 2020 through Q2 2024 originations. Among the 57% of principal that has already been paid down, we've seen 6% in net cumulative losses. For life of loan losses on this entire cohort of loans to reach 8% net cumulative losses, the remaining unpaid principal would need to charge off at a rate of more than 10%. Past vintages have performed meaningfully better after this point in the seasoning curve, further improving our confidence in achieving loss rates below 8%. Now turning to our fair value marks and key assumptions. Our personal loans are marked at a 105.7%, 142 basis points higher quarter-over-quarter. This was driven by a 97 basis point decrease in the discount rate to 4.78%, which was directly driven by the drop in benchmark rates by 113 basis points and offset by 16 basis points of spread widening. The constant default rate, or CDR, also decreased by 28 basis points, which is consistent with the observed credit trends I just highlighted. For our student loan portfolio, the fair value mark increased by 183 basis points to 105.4%. This was driven by a 45 basis point decrease in the discount rate to 3.99% due to an 87 basis point decrease in rates, but offset by 42 basis points of spread widening. The weighted average coupon in the portfolio also increased by 17 basis points. The fair value gains in the quarter were significantly more than offset by our hedge losses and the negative impact from spreads widening. Net-net, we did not see a positive impact on the reported revenue from the change in marks, net of hedge losses and new originations. Switching to our balance sheet, where we remain very well-capitalized. Assets grew by $1.7 billion as a result of nearly $1.4 billion growth in loans and approximately $226 million of an increase in cash, cash equivalents and investment securities. On the liability side, member deposits grew by nearly $2.4 billion to nearly $23 billion, while overall deposits increased to $24 billion. We reduced our brokered deposits by $445 million as we continue to use our consumer deposits to replace higher-cost parts of the funding stack. Currently, there is a 220 basis points difference between interest we pay on deposits and the interest we pay on warehouse lines, which translates to more than $500 million in annualized interest expense savings, given the size of our deposit base. We exited the quarter with just $1.3 billion of warehouse debt drawn. This difference continues to support our net interest margin of 5.6%, underscoring the benefits of having the option of holding loans on balance sheet when advantageous in collecting net interest income. We continue to expect to maintain a healthy net interest margin above 5% for the foreseeable future and benefit from the continued mix shift towards deposit funding along with our ability to sustain healthy deposit versus lending betas. In terms of our regulatory capital ratios, our total capital ratio of 16.3% remains comfortably above the regulatory minimum of 10.5%. Lastly, we grew book value to $6.1 billion and tangible book value by $236 million sequentially to $4.4 billion with tangible book value per share at $4. Now on to guidance. For the full year 2024, we now expect to deliver adjusted net revenue of $2.535 billion to $2.550 billion, which is $85 million higher than our prior guidance range of $2.425 billion to $2.465 billion. This implies 22% to 23% annual growth versus 17% to 19% previously. This guidance assumes Lending revenue will be at least 100% of 2023 levels, Financial Services will grow more than 80% year-over-year, and Tech Platform will grow low- to upper-teens percent year-over-year. We now expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA of $640 million to $645 million, above our prior guidance of $605 million to $615 million. This represents a 25% adjusted EBITDA margin. We now expect full-year GAAP net income of $204 million to $206 million above prior guidance of $175 million to $185 million, and GAAP EPS of $0.11 to $0.12 per share above prior guidance of $0.09 to $0.10 per share. We now expect growth in tangible book value of approximately $1 billion to $1.05 billion and continue to expect to end the year with a total capital ratio at or above 16%. In terms of member growth, we expect to add at least 2.3 million new members in 2024, which represents 30% growth. Overall, we couldn't be more proud of our Q3 results. We continue to demonstrate our position as a durable growth story, which is reflected in this quarter's strong results. Despite operating in unpredictable macro conditions, we've maintained a clear focus on executing our strategy, driving returns, and helping our members get their money right. We could not be more excited about the opportunities ahead of us as we continue our journey towards becoming a top financial institution. With that, let's begin the Q&A. Yes, thanks John. So, we often talk about underwriting to an 8% life alone loss target, which obviously reflects the strength of our underwriting and the high quality of our borrower base. However, life alone losses represents just one of several variables, which in combination actually drive our pricing, and underwriting decisions designed to maximize return on equity, while adhering to our credit risk tolerance. In terms of how we think about the returns on recent, versus some of our past vintages, all in returns on our more recent vintages are projected, to produce meaningfully higher returns. I'm talking greater than 2x versus 2017, with newer vintages expected to produce ROEs above 30%. And I'm defining ROE here, as the weighted average coupon minus annual losses, funding costs and other operational costs plus origination fees. And then multiplied by the weighted average life and levered. What's really driving those increases in returns, is a function of a number of things. First, is lower expected life alone loss rates as we show in our Investor Presentation on Page 10. Second is the higher pricing beta throughout rate increase cycles. We've demonstrated time-and-time again that we've been able to maintain really good betas. We were successful in increasing the portfolio weighted average coupon, across both products in a rising rate environment over the course of the last few years. And we've also been able to maintain pricing in down rate environments, due to the quality of our product. The third way is we've had funding cost efficiencies, given our higher reliance on member deposits and success in growing direct deposits, and replacing higher cost warehouse funding. And then fourth, we've introduced origination fees over the course of the last year plus, and we're now generating close to $400 million in origination fees annually. So the combination of these drivers, is more than offsetting the increase in prepayment speeds, and the reduction in weighted average lives that we're observing in some of these newer cohorts. Going forward, what I would say, is we're going to be talking about return metrics more often, because these life alone losses don't provide the full view. Yes. So I'll start and Anthony can chime in wherever. But in terms of the overall growth expectations, what I would say is as part of that billion dollars of originations that we did, Jeff, in the period. A portion of that did come from the Fortress transaction that, we announced earlier in the quarter. So it's not additive to your $4 billion run rate. It's inclusive of that. But we do expect to see continued strong growth in the segment. We have that $2 billion agreement with Fortress, as well as commitments for Q4 and 2025, with several other partners. What I would say, is we're one of the very few partners who can deliver assets at scale, with the characteristics and return profile that investors are seeking. In terms of deemphasizing other sales, and ABS transactions in favor of this, what I would say is that, demand is as strong as it's ever been before. Like I had mentioned a few questions ago, we're happy with the size of the balance sheet and the modest growth that we're expecting, expecting over the course of the next three months. But what I would say is that, we are seeing excess demand both from borrowers and investors, and a way to fulfill that demand is through the LPB business. In terms of the take rate, what I would say is. We're looking at apples-and-oranges when you're trying to compare this take rate, to what you see in the general originate to sell business. These are loans that are originated on behalf of others, and they would not have been originated unless contracted to given the credit - and overall asset characteristics of the loans, as well as our own risk appetite and capital allocation strategy. What we're receiving is a platform fee for our underwriting capabilities, our marketing capabilities, and our overall operational capabilities. And that platform fee will vary depending on the partner. The only other thing I would say in terms of, you had mentioned $375 million of sales done in period. We did over $1 billion across all three products in the quarter and $6 billion over the course of the last 12 months in overall loan sales, quarter-to-date in Q4, we've already done close to $1 billion in sales, across our products as well. So the demand is certainly there. We will continue to fulfill on both ends. But as Anthony mentioned, being able to originate on behalf of others is purely incremental to us."

            "name": "Anthony Noto",
            "content": "Good morning. Thanks for joining us today. I'm thrilled to share our results for Q3, which was the strongest quarter in our history. I want to thank our members and clients for continuing to put their trust in SoFi, and to thank our team for their absolute grit delivering another great quarter. Our results reflect far more than just 90 days of work. They show how SoFi is consistently achieving durable growth, how our innovation and brand-building are attracting more members and clients to our platform than ever before, and how we are delivering strong and improving returns. I'll touch on these three topics before handing it over to Chris, who will share our financial and operating results. First, on SoFi's performance as a durable growth company, Q3 was another record quarter for SoFi. We built on the strong momentum from the first half of 2024, putting us on pace to significantly exceed our 2024 plan and firmly on track towards the three-year outlook we shared at the end of last year. Here are some highlights. Adjusted net revenue reached a record of $689 million in the quarter, a year-over-year acceleration in growth to 30% versus 22% in Q2. For the first time, financial services makes up more than a third of our total revenue. The segment recorded $238 million of revenue in Q3, up 102% from the prior year. I could not be prouder of how we've scaled this segment over the past five years since launching these products through a tumultuous and unpredictable environment to now be a $1 billion annualized revenue business, growing over 100% with strong and improving profitability. And frankly, it's still day one. Our tech platform grew to nearly $103 million in net revenue, up 14% from the prior year. We continue to see a strong pipeline of potential partners that are striving to modernize their platforms. Combined, our non-lending segments grew 64% year-over-year, and drove the company's overall growth of 30%. And now they make-up a record 49% of total revenue, up from 39% a year-ago, driving an important diversification of our business. We also recorded tremendous growth in key revenue drivers, members, products, as well as revenue per product in the quarter. We added 756,000 new members in Q3. That's up 35% year-over-year to a total of 9.4 million members. We grew products in the quarter by over 1 million to 13.7 million products. That's up 31% year-over-year or 37% when excluding digital asset accounts related to our transfer of crypto services in 2023. The Financial Services segment drove 964,000 of those new products. Importantly, revenue per product was $81, up 52% from $53 a year ago. We believe there remains substantial upside in both product growth and monetization. Our one-stop shop continues to attract great cross-buying behavior by our members. In fact, 32% of new products were opened by existing SoFi members, and 20% of our new members opened a second product in their first 30 days. This is the power of the flywheel we have developed. In our Tech Platform, we reached over 160 million total accounts. That's up 17% year-over-year. Overall, we're making incredible progress in our shift towards more fee-based, capital-light, and lower-risk revenue sources. Combined, fee-based revenue made up $174 million or a quarter of our adjusted net revenue in Q3. This revenue grew by 65% year-over-year. On an annualized basis, that's nearly $700 million in revenue. This progress was driven by a record quarter in our loan platform business, which totaled $56 million in fee-based revenue, and is up more than 5x year-over-year, as well as strong growth in interchange, which is up 2x year-over-year. Chris will share more details on these areas in a few moments. On top of all of this work to diversify our revenue base to capital-light, high return on equity, and fee-based revenue, we also grew our lending segment in Q3. We seized on the improving rate environment in the quarter, our improving credit trends, and strong performance across all lending products to achieve a record $6.3 billion in loan volume, and $392 million in adjusted net revenue, up 14% year-over-year. Looking back at the progress we've made over the past several years, it's fair to say that SoFi is battle tested, given the scale, profitability, and growth we have recorded for the total company in 2024 with our largest and most profitable business lending barely growing. It should now be crystal clear that SoFi can drive sustained growth across the cycle. We've achieved 17 of 19 quarters of record revenue through a recession, a pandemic, a 150 basis point rate drop, damage to our largest and most profitable business, student loan refinance, only to face a 500 basis point increase in rates and the collapse of venerable financial institutions in our neighborhood. The innovations we have driven to scale our non-lending revenue, which are capital-light and high ROE, have enabled us to grow our total revenue by more than 20% year-over-year for 17 consecutive quarters, as well as grow both our members and products by 35% or more year-over-year, excluding digital asset accounts transferred in 2023. Our performance in the hard times is what gives me strong confidence in our future. Today, we face fewer headwinds than any point in our history. We're heading into 2025 with the most favorable conditions of the last seven years with declining rates and a stable economy, with the most diverse business we've ever had, with more members in our ecosystem, and more products that serve their needs than ever before. This brings me to my second topic, the innovation and brand-building that drive our durable growth. The market for consumer financial services is massive and historically poorly served. A Mintel report found that just this year, one in five U.S. adults have been in the market for a new savings account. A similar number are looking for new credit cards. Those markets, not to mention those looking for new investment accounts, new checking accounts, new personal loans, new mortgages, and buy now, pay later, all grew year-over-year. Meeting all of a person's financial needs in one place with world-class products delivered seamlessly and digitally gives us a massive advantage. This is why you will often hear me say, it's a matter of when, not if we become a Top 10 financial institution. To do so, it's absolutely critical that we build the unaided brand awareness to become a trusted household brand name. The awareness we generate for SoFi is highly effective at getting people to try a product. After becoming a member, they cross-buy into another product, then another. They recommend SoFi to others. This flywheel that we've created drives acquisition costs down over time, and reliably generates profits that we can invest in new product innovations to serve even more of our members' needs. Our accomplishments in Q3 demonstrate the power of this virtuous cycle. First, we continue to establish SoFi as a trusted household name. We ended Q3 with our highest average unaided brand awareness of all time, up nearly 40% year-over-year to 7%. Our highly effective marketing engine continues to reach and engage new audiences. For example, Q3 saw the kickoff of the new NFL season at the award-winning SoFi Stadium. We unveiled a new brand campaign with LA Chargers' quarterback, Justin Herbert, inspiring people to reach their most important financial ambitions. We also launched new partnerships with Los Angeles Sparks' forward, Cameron Brink, and tennis champion, Venus Williams. And coming in January, the TGL presented by SoFi, a new tech-infused arena golf league with an exciting match-play format across teams of top PGA TOUR golfers like Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy, Wyndham Clark, Xander Schauffele, and Justin Thomas, just to name a few. Second, we continue to innovate so people find unique value when they use our products. Starting with our Financial Services segment, in SoFi Invest, we've seen strong engagement driven by new alternative assets, mutual funds, and money market funds we've rolled out over the past year. Overall, we're providing Main Street investors access to unique investment products historically reserved for the ultra-wealthy like interval funds, private credit, private real estate, and private venture. We also launched our new directed share program, which offers a modern and streamlined approach to equity programs for companies looking to raise capital through IPOs. And we are expanding our award-winning robo offering later this year. Importantly, we are building the Invest business cost-effectively by appealing to existing members. 70% of sign-ups are existing SoFi members. In SoFi Money, we reached record highs in accounts, total deposits, and direct deposit members. We grew member deposits by nearly $2.4 billion and annualized debit spending reached $10.3 billion in Q3. We will soon improve our self-serve wire transfers, which similar to introducing Zelle, will further expand members money movement options. In our member team, we're beta testing a new cash coach product that will analyze members' cash across all of their financial products at SoFi and beyond, and offer various ways to optimize their cash, whether it's paying down expensive debt, setting up an emergency savings fund, getting more yield on their savings, or making investments in a diversified portfolio that is appropriate for their goals. We're also on track to launch improvements to SoFi Plus, our premium membership tier, and our beta testing, a new fee-based subscription option in the coming months. Over time, SoFi Plus will increasingly show the magic of our strategy, deliver incremental and unmatched value across our portfolio of products. In Credit Card, we officially launched the Everyday Cash Rewards and the Essential credit cards, enabling SoFi to serve more people's spending and borrowing needs, whether it's helping them earn rewards or building their credit. In our loan platform business, what started as a decline monetization funnel, has now evolved into an integrated loan platform experience, which now offers just-in-time lending. In Q3, the loan platform business grew 5x year-over-year, mainly driven by record personal loan volume. We expect this business to continue to grow as we shift towards even more fee-based, capital-light, and lower-risk sources of revenue. We also signed our first two direct insurance carriers for SoFi Protect, complementing our comprehensive financial services offering we've built over the last five years. Turning to our Lending segment. In personal loans, our innovation has helped generate a record $4.9 billion in volume, up 26% year-over-year, including $1 billion originated on behalf of third parties for our loan platform business. In home loans, we grew total home loan volume 38% year-over-year to $490 million. Home equity loan volume was up 44% from the prior quarter as rates began to decline. Home purchase and refinancing volumes grew 23% from the prior year period. In fact, home refinancing volume was the highest we've seen since the second quarter of 2022. And finally, in our Tech Platform, we signed several new partnerships, including processing deals with two charter banks of Mexico and a deployment of Galileo's Cyberbank Core for SoFi's new commercial payment services sponsor bank program. We launched additional fraud prevention solutions, the Galilo Instant Verification Engine, which we call GIVE, as well as Transaction Risk GScore, both of which help clients enhance their security and operational efficiency. Our new Secured Credit with Dynamic Funding offering promotes greater financial inclusion and enables clients to help their customers build stronger credit. And lastly, we launched programs with clients signed in prior quarters spanning cross-border payments, global payouts, financial literacy and scalable payment solutions. On top of this relentless focus on innovation and brand-building, we built our business to deliver strong and reliable returns well into the future. We achieved record profitability in Q3. GAAP net income reached nearly $61 million, a $327 million improvement year-over-year or $80 million when excluding the goodwill impairment expense we incurred in the prior year. EBITDA grew 90% from the prior year to a record of $186 million. All three of our operating segments achieved record contribution profit in the quarter. We continue to improve credit performance in Q3 and are firmly within the life of loan guidance we've previously provided. As we've shared in our last call, delinquencies peaked in March of 2024. Since then, we've continued to see improvements quarter-over-quarter. Cumulative fair value adjustments along with delinquencies on an absolute and percentage basis all performed better in Q3. With all the innovations we've made across marketing, originations and servicing, buyers continue to see compelling opportunities in SoFi's loan portfolio. Loan sales reached almost $1.3 billion in total this quarter and nearly $5 billion in the last 12 months. And finally, with our strong balance sheet, we are well-capitalized heading into an improving rate environment. Our total capital ratio is 16.3%, well-above regulatory minimums. In Q3, tangible book value increased $236 million to a total of $4.4 billion. We look forward to building on this momentum and delivering continued returns heading into the new year. In closing, I couldn't be more proud of what we've accomplished, not just for Q3, but for delivering a steady and consistent record of durable growth, incredible brand building and product innovation that help our members and clients, and strong improving returns for our shareholders. Their future is bright and I am fired up for what's in store. With that, I'll hand it over to Chris. Sure. Thanks, Dan. And so overall, this is a great fee-based and capital-light revenue source for us. We're not taking balance sheet risk. We're generating meaningful cash fees upfront at time of transfer or referral and we're able to serve the needs of more members at a more rapid pace than we've been able to do so before. So, there are several ways that we make revenue within the business, which has certainly evolved since we started focusing on decline monetization in 2019. First is we send qualified borrowers to platform partners via our Lantern marketplace and we receive a referral fee if the borrower takes out a loan. The second way we make money is we can embed the specific credit box of our platform partners into our underwriting engine and originate on behalf of those partners with the transfer of those loans to the partner occurring shortly after origination. For that, we receive an upfront cash fee and we also retain servicing. The third way and what's new this quarter is that we're able to originate on behalf of other third-party investors based on a specific asset characteristic and return profile of that investor with loans transferred shortly after origination. This is within days or a week. We receive an upfront cash fee -- platform fee for that business and we also retain servicing. And then the fourth way that we can make money and we've been doing this for a few quarters now is we can service assets that we do not originate, but are held on the balance sheets of other third-parties. For that, we receive regular servicing fees that are not capitalized. What I would say is important is in all of these cases, these are assets that we wouldn't have otherwise underwritten unless contracted due to a number of reasons, including, first, the credit profile and other characteristics of the assets, which may not be directly consistent with our current portfolio. Second, our own risk appetite may not align with those originations. And then finally, our capital allocation strategy at any given point in time may not align. The last thing I would say here is that there are no financing commitments or lost share agreements associated with any of these deals or partnerships. And the only other thing I would add, Dan, and this may not be known by a lot of people, but we declined between 70% and 80% of the personal loan applicants to SoFi. And so there's a lot of potential -- latent potential there to service them better. And so that's a big number that exists before we even try to do anything else in this business in terms of generating incremental demand or other initiatives to make people aware of the products that we can offer. Yes. What I would say is our overall outlook for originations or at least growth on the balance sheet has not changed. We do expect to see modest growth in dollar terms on the balance sheet year-over-year and that will continue into Q4. We are happy with the size of the balance sheet that we have today and the amount of net interest income that we're generating. We are seeing excess demand both on the borrower side as well as the loan investor side for our unsecured personal loans, and we've been able to successfully navigate and fulfill that demand through the expansion of our loan platform business. So, we would expect not to grow the PL balance sheet meaningfully from where we are today. Where we will migrate into is in a lower rate environment, you would see an uptick in-demand for our student loan refinancing business where we had a really strong quarter this quarter as well as our home loans business where we had our best quarter since 2021. Another thing I would just emphasize, John, and everyone - and the shareholders more broadly, is that we've been able to achieve these types of high ROE returns in more recent vintages despite the fact that rates have been, increased significantly in a very short period of time and the economy has been somewhat uncertain, during that time period. As we look into 2025, and declining rate environment in a stable economy, we think we can only improve on these returns. And it's one of the reasons why we're leveraging all the different businesses. We are across the opportunity set that we have from a return standpoint, relative to what we believe is a prudent level of balance sheet risk, in a particular asset class such as personal loans. So we think there's a lot of upside and it only gets better from here. And I think, a couple points just to emphasize. One is, the partners in the loan platform business, many of which are new incremental partners on loans as opposed to the wholesale loan buyers, or ABS buyers that we typically had. They're not all incremental, but a large percentage of them are including in the most recent quarter. In addition to that, Chris has mentioned a couple times. These are loans that wouldn't have otherwise originated, and we only originate when we actually have a contract. So it's not a zero sum game, it's incremental. And the outlook for is pretty significant as we go into 2025, in excess of what you articulated. Yes, we're really proud of the way the SoFi Money product continues to resonate in the marketplace, despite rates coming down more broadly. We've maintained our market share position, we've maintained our ranking in an APY standpoint, of course we do not charge fees. We obviously give a number of other benefits including the high interest rate, not to mention all the functionality you need in one place. So we've seen continued strong trends in deposits, over $2 billion of member deposit growth in the quarter. In addition to that, the spending levels that we're seeing are on parents, to better to where they have been historically. And so, we're continually getting positive indicators, across the entire business as it relates to SoFi Money. The other thing I would just mention, this is one of the key points of where the flywheel starts. Our direct deposit customers are customers that are more engaged. They have meaningfully higher number of products per customer, compared to the overall average that we report. And when you look at it on a vintage basis, it's even better than the overall average number of products per direct deposit members. So it's been over a year in, which we've operated this business as a bank. And being able to control our own destiny, and having a competitive advantage in being both an origination platform on loans, as well as a national bank that can set its own interest rate, and its own value proposition. It's a competitive advantage and one that's continued in the quarter. And we're excited about next year. You've hit the nail in the head. Yes, thank you. You've hit the nail on the head. It's an exciting part of our business. The fact that we're approaching $1 billion annualized business, very profitable while we're still in investment mode. It's pretty amazing to have a business of that size, $23 million of revenue, growing over 100% and profitable despite how fast we are growing the number of members, and products and revenue per product. And I think the best way to sort of conceptualize where this business could go, is to think about those three variables, member growth, product growth and revenue per product. The revenue per product that we generate today was up meaningfully in the quarter, as you mentioned, but it's nowhere near where it can be long-term. As it relates to our invest business, we're monetizing at about half the rate that we think we can monetize it over time. In 2025, we'll take a number of steps where we start to monetize that better, of course, by adding incremental value to the invest experience. Our invest product is unique in that we're trying to be a one-stop shop just within Invest. We pioneered fractional shares. We obviously don't pay - charge on trades. In addition to that, we created our own ETFs that would better meet the needs of our new and beginning investors. That are lower price point, but diversified, allowing our members to do dollar cost averaging in a diversified way. We have award-winning robo accounts, and we continue to evolve those and you'll see us do more in 2025, behind that to not just grow assets, but also to increase monetization. We do IPOs, which is a direct monetization vehicle. But again, a unique product remain Street investors get access to IPOs and IPO prices. And then our alternate asset classes and mutual funds that we launched have really been a tailwind for us, in terms of driving more engagement. That's something today that we don't monetize that we will monetize in the future. So just in the Invest business, we have over 100% opportunity, to increase the monetization per member not to mention the fact, how fast the products and invest are growing. And remember, when you do the calculation on Invest product growth, you have to normalize it for the lost crypto members, or products that we had a year ago that were transferred. SoFi Money business, we continue to see nice trends in deposits and spending, and the monetization there will continue to improve with more deposits, and more spending as opposed to a change in rate per se. In addition to that, our credit card business is another source of monetization opportunity. As balances continue to increase, we'll have more monetization there in addition to the more members that we add the more monetization that we drive, because that's a higher interchange revenue than our debit interchange. And so, as you see a mix shift, you'll see an improvement in monetization there, not to mention just the absolute increase in monetization. And then as it relates to small medium business, we're just scratching the surface. The biggest initiative we had so far in 2024, was to take the application process and embed it into the SoFi app. So when all the demand that we get for small and medium business comes to SoFi, they can within the native app, apply for a loan and then be referred to a partner as it relates to lending. We also do that as it relates to banking, you'll continue to see us do that in a much bigger and broader way. There is monetization there today, but we could do more products and more services to drive greater monetization not to mention doing it ourselves at some point, which we would like to do over time. It is an early-stage business, and we want to crawl before we walk and then ultimately run. So you'll see that in the SMB business. On the insurance side, the deals that we're doing in the marketplace, increase our monetization there, but also increases penetration. So over 100% revenue growth in the quarter, driven by the really strong product growth and revenue per product. And he has focused on those two measurements, you'll be able to forecast a pretty sizable business with great profitability. The last point I make on profitability, is we're still losing a large amount of money in the credit card business and Invest business, because the payback there is, is longer. And it's not a business that we get return on in one year. It takes anywhere from one and a half to two to three years, depending on the J curve of the credit business. So what's masking the profitability is that investment there. If we actually subtracted added back the losses that we're losing there, the number would be even bigger on the profitability side. And that's before we've improved any of the monetization. Yes. In terms of demand for our loans from buyers or investors, similar to other people, the demand has increased quite meaningfully. We are better at being able to meet some of that demand, by continue to evolve our business from origination platform for our own loans, and now the evolution of the loan platform business. So similar to others, we're seeing an increase of it from existing buyers. But also a number of new partners that we've not been able to meet their needs with before, but we now can. So really excited about declining rate environment, putting a tailwind behind the loans, not to mention our new initiatives there. As it relates to the tech platform, no decisions have been made by any of the big deals that we've been in process with over the last 12 to 18 months. I do think we're coming to the end of some of those decisions being made. And I would just say that we haven't had anything announced. But I would just tell you I'm confident that we will have some wins there, but none of the decisions have been made on any of the large deals. And I would just give you more color on the types of deals. There are definitely big financial institutions that have to make some decisions on their technology. They continue to really struggle with how they budget for that transition. But without a doubt, there's a technical reason why they have to switch. There's a risk reason why they have to switch, and there's a regulatory reason. And so, it's going to be an inevitable change, and a tailwind to the demand for technology, like we have in our tech platform business, and specifically in core and processing. And it's just a question of when, and I think we'll win our fair share of deals there, but none have been decided yet. The second area that we haven't talked as much about in the past, is the opportunity to help large branded companies that have big installed bases, they're in the financial services business already today through a credit card, and a white label credit card. There's absolutely a significant amount of demand from those types of partners for us to do something very similar on the debit side of the business. And we continue to receive RFPs, for that type of product. And then, of course, outside of the direct-to-consumer businesses, there is demand from government agencies, there's demand for B2B companies that continue to surface and some of, which we've signed and executed against, some of which will be decided over the coming months. Yes. We really like the card business long term. It obviously is an expensive endeavor near term. There's a J curve of about three years in that business. We have a world-class team that's done this before. That wasn't the case when we first launched. The two cards that you mentioned, are a direct result of all the work the team - our second team that came in and run this business has done. We did a test with the business. We saw the type of performance that we were hoping to see. Our marketing capabilities there have also helped us deliver the type of performance, we wanted to see in those cards. And that's why we went general availability for those cards, as opposed to just testing. I will say we will take a very methodical approach to the credit card business. While it is a great ROE business. It also does have the ability to lose a lot of money and lose money every day. And so, we'll continue to make sure that, that card is something that we market to individuals that we think have a high probability, of utilizing it in the right way, and we can get a great return on it. So, we'll start with our members, and we'll continue to use the data that we have on them to make decisions. We can use that data to model opportunities off of our platform, which we're starting to do as well. Inside of the Financial Services business, think about as a couple of different types of segments. We have businesses that are still growing very fast that, are profitable like SoFi Money, we have businesses that are growing very fast and losing money like invest in credit card. And then we have businesses that are early stage. And we're planting seeds that will continue to be harvested over time, and grown over time. And this is a business that's in the middle, one that we feel we're confident in terms of our go-to-market. And one that will grow, but we'll do it methodically over time, to make sure that we do not push too hard on the investment, we have to make and offset the profitability overall business, but it will be a good contributor. Thank you, operator, and thanks for everyone that's dialed into the call. I have some closing remarks, I want to share. As I mentioned at the end of Q2, I cannot feel better about what we've achieved and where we're headed right here, and right now. The list of achievements is far, too, great to capture every quarter, so let me be succinct and clear. Despite the tumultuous environment over the past seven years. We've delivered durable growth, world-class innovation and brand building, and improving returns with 17 quarters of record revenue, consistent 35%-plus growth in members and products, four quarters of GAAP profitability, and so many other milestones. There is only one reason available emerge stronger, from such a tumultuous environment. And that reason is that people of SoFi: our employees, our members and our clients. I could not be prouder, or more grateful to the people of SoFi. We now face hopefully, the most advantageous environment that we've seen since I joined the company, and we began the relentless march to be a one-stop shop. Today, we are no longer just a lending company. Today, we are a force to be reckoned with. It is truly our time as we have more products, more members, more capital and more diverse revenue streams than ever before. We are undeniably the absolute best vision company, to capture the massive opportunities still ahead of us, because of the same thing that got us here: our people. Our people are great at heart. Thank you, everyone, for your time today, and we hope you have a great end to 2024."

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the SoFi Technologies Q2 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. With that, you may begin your conference.\nMaura Cyr: Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to SoFi's second quarter of 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me today to talk about our results and recent events are Anthony Noto, CEO, and Chris Lapointe, CFO. You can find the presentation accompanying our earnings release on the Investor Relations section of our website. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations and forecasts and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include, but are not limited to, our competitive advantage and strategy, macroeconomic conditions and outlook, future products and services, and future business and financial performance. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements.

Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Anthony.\nAnthony Noto: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results were exceptional and continue to demonstrate SoFi's leadership as a one-stop shop for digital financial services and the amazing grit of our team. I'll cover five topics before turning to Chris for a deeper look at our financial and operating performance. First, our strategy continues to drive strong diversified growth, profitability and returns. Second, our continuous product innovation and brand-building are fueling significant member and product growth, which are key to our long-term revenue and profit growth outlooks. Third, turning to our segment results, our Financial Services segment demonstrates our clear structural advantages in delivering value to members. Fourth, our leadership and agility in lending has generated sustained returns despite rising rates and positions us to move quickly once rates come down. And finally, our tech platform is making good progress on its journey toward becoming an AWS of not only to fintech but of financial services broadly. Turning to the first topic, the success of our one-stop shop strategy. For Q2, adjusted net revenue reached a new record of $597 million, a 22% year-over-year increase. Our rapid diversification made a record revenue quarter possible even with just 5% growth in adjusted net revenue in lending. Combined, Financial Services and Tech Platform revenue grew 46% year-over-year and now makes up 45% of total adjusted net revenue, up from 38% one year ago. To put that accomplishment in context, lending now stands at just 57% of adjusted net revenue compared to 99% of our revenue when I joined nearly seven years ago and more than 70% of revenue just two years ago. We also delivered even greater growth and profitability in the quarter. EBITDA grew 80% year-over-year to $138 million. We recorded our third consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability with $17 million in GAAP net income versus a loss of $40 million in Q2 of 2023. Credit performance was better-than-expected as cumulative fair-value adjustments from delinquent loans peaked in March along with delinquencies on an absolute and percentage basis. We are really encouraged by our team's ability to bend the curves through stringent underwriting, limiting credit exposure when prudent and improving collections and servicing. Chris will share details on the performance of our recent personal loan vintages, which show clear improvements versus older vintages, underscoring our confidence in our prior guidance around left-alone losses peaking in the 7% to 8% range. Our loan sales continue to scale at attractive execution levels with an increasingly diversified set of buyers with $1.6 billion in total sales this quarter and $4.7 billion in the three trailing quarters. This brings me to my second topic. Our rapid pace of innovation and brand-building are fueling significant member and product growth. The growing size of our member base and the number of products they use impact the results we're reporting today. But more importantly, they are the leading indicators of our potential revenue growth and profitability in the future. In Q2, we added 643,000 members and now have 8.8 million in total. That's up 41% year-over-year. We grew products in the quarter by 946,000 to 12.8 million in total. That's up 43% year-over-year, adjusting for our exit from crypto last year. Nearly 40% of all new products in Q2 were opened by existing SoFi members. We also see that nearly 30% of new members opened a second product in the first 30 days, demonstrating the immediate value of our one-stop shop strategy. We've doubled our member base and number of products in the past two years and Q2 was the 20th consecutive quarter of greater than 30% growth. Our growth in members and products will drive our financial growth for years to come and is the basis for our three-year financial outlook shared at the end of 2023. All this growth is a direct result of our relentless focus on innovation because we offer products across eight categories compared to many fintechs that only offer one or two, the magnitude of our innovation is not always obvious. As much as I'd love to share the full breadth of what we shipped in the quarter, I'll just cover a few of the highlights. I'll start with our Financial Services business, which drove 91% of our new product adds in the quarter. Our Invest offering is getting better every day. In fact, I don't know of any other self-directed product that offers alternative assets like private credit, private real estate and private venture investing side-by-side with fractional shares, robo finds, ETFs and IPOs. Our innovations over the last year are starting to accelerate results, driving a 58% year-over-year increase in assets under management in our Invest business in Q2, and this was driven largely by net flows. We fully rolled out alternative assets and mutual funds, including interval funds from well-known financial leaders in KKR, Carlisle, Franklin Templeton and ARK Venture Fund, which includes several leading private technology companies. Alternative assets generated 12% of all net flows during the second quarter. We brought the concept of one-click checkout to individual asset transfers, enabling our members to consolidate their assets the way they would like and now we're seeing benefits from that innovation as well. We are now finalizing a turnkey way for companies going public to extend participation in their IPOs at scale to their customers, employees and partners. With this new directed share program, people can open an account, enter an order and fund it in minutes without fees, minimum balances or speaking to anyone in order to participate in an IPO. Turning to SoFi Money. In the quarter, we launched Zelle, one of our most requested features and one element of our much larger money movement product pipeline. The innovations in our member business unit, which focused on ensuring our products work better when used together are reaching critical mass. For example, 3 million members have signed up for SoFi's broad-based rewards program. We're creating a rewards economy across our products, including rewards for using our app and other services and we're expanding redemption options including into stocks, cash for savings and travel. For SoFi Plus, we achieved 1 million members. For people that are not familiar with SoFi Plus, it is our premium membership tier available to those who enable direct deposit. SoFi Plus includes our highest APY on banking balances which today is up to 4.6%. It also includes up to 2x reward points, up to 3.3% cashback rewards on SoFi Credit spending, discounts on personal loan rates and much more. And I'm very excited to share that we've laid the foundation to provide more value in SoFi Plus not only to direct deposit members but also a monthly paid subscription product for those who prefer that option over direct deposit. We intend to test this new subscription-based option for SoFi Plus later this year. We're also driving iteration and learning to drive innovation in credit cards. We've improved our acquisition capabilities and introduced a 10% cashback boost for SoFi Plus members that has shown positive results. And I'm excited to share that this week we'll also begin testing two new credit cards to better serve our members' needs, one card for cashback rewards on everyday high-spending categories and one for members who need a no-frills card with no surprise fees. Turning to Lending. We've launched new capabilities that position us for future growth, especially as the rate environment improves. In small and medium business, members can now apply for a loan at SoFi and get approved offers from lending partners. In Home Loans, we can now close our home equity products instead of brokering them out. This dramatically increases our potential for revenue per loan. Notably, we're now a principal in home equity loans and can offer members a lower cost of borrowing in these secured loans compared to higher rates in unsecured lending. And of course, our Tech Platform is a center of innovation as we add capabilities to our already comprehensive offering. We expanded our Buy Now Pay Later product for post-purchase use. We added new wire capabilities and extended the AI-driven transactional fraud capabilities in our payment risk platform to non-processing partners. We also advanced the quality of our managed service in the cloud and introduced 3DS, which adds another layer of security to digital card transactions. These improvements ensure our modern cloud-based platform will continue to serve the needs of brands, fintechs and global financial institutions alike. Having world-class products is a necessary factor in becoming a Top 10 financial institution, but it's not enough. We must also become a trusted household brand name. We measure this by our unaided brand awareness. Our world-class marketing team stands in a category of one. Their amazing work has increased unaided brand awareness to the 7% to 9% range which is up about 40% year-over-year and 4x since 2021. Our brand punches way above its weight as our team continues to make its footprint bigger than its foot. Now diving into our segment results. In Financial Services segment, we are seeing the continued benefits of structural advantages that drive our leading value proposition. We reported record segment revenue of $176 million, up 80% from $98 million in the year ago quarter. Importantly, this drove contribution profit of $55 million compared to a loss of $4 million one year earlier. Financial Services products grew $865,000 in the quarter, up 48% year-over-year, adjusting for our exit from crypto last year. Revenue per product grew 8% quarter-over-quarter and 29% year-over-year. We believe there is substantial upside to the monetization of our financial services products. SoFi Money achieved new records this quarter as ending deposits totaled $23 billion with consumer deposits up $2.2 billion from the previous quarter. Account openings grew by $419,000 and 90% of our deposits remain tied to sticky direct deposit relationships. Debit spend also continues to increase at a rapid pace, up 129% year-over-year and now annualizing at about $9 billion. Our Credit Card and Invest businesses remain in investment mode with nearly $100 million in annualized losses, but we expect them to follow a similar path to Money in achieving variable profit and contribution profit. In our Credit Card business, delinquency entry rates and roll rates improved by roughly 20% apiece from 2023 averages. Turning now to my fourth topic, our strong leadership across lending. We reported strong results despite our conservative posture given a 500 basis point increase in benchmark rates over the past two years and continued macro uncertainty. Importantly, net interest income reached an all-time high of $279 million or 82% of lending revenue versus 72% one year ago and 45% two years ago. Net interest income is cash revenue. Let me say that again, net interest income is cash revenue, so 82% of our lending revenue is cash. Notably, discount rates and spreads were largely unchanged and in aggregate had a slight negative impact on lending revenue. Our personal loan originations reached a record of $4.2 billion while sticking to stringent underwriting standards as our team demonstrated its grip by consistently iterating on pricing and marketing throughout the quarter. Our home loan originations were their highest since Q1 of 2022, growing 24% quarter-over-quarter and 71% year-over-year despite interest rates at their highest level in 10 quarters. On top of that, purchase home loan volume was our highest ever, growing 25% from Q1 2024 and nearly 100% year-over-year. Once rates come down, we expect to benefit from our expansion into three products in home lending, purchase loans, home equity loans and the volume already generated by our financing business. Student loan originations grew 86% year-over-year. The team drove our strongest Q2 of origination volume in three years by iterating to drive continuous improvement throughout the quarter and into Q3 with private loan refinancing, which exemplifies our ability to respond to environmental factors to drive results. And my fifth topic, the Tech Platforms segment is making good progress on its journey to become not only the AWS of fintech but of financial services more broadly. We recorded segment revenue of $95 million, up 9% year-over-year and contribution profit of $31 million, up 82% year-over-year at a 33% margin. This represents our fourth consecutive quarter of over 30% margin. Our customer wins have been more diverse, including but not limited to, secure card and B2B partners. Our pipeline of interest remains robust and includes US and international financial institutions along with major consumer and commercial brands. As we have noted, we are pursuing enterprise partnerships with larger existing customer bases for more durable revenue opportunities. These partnerships take multiple quarters, not months to win and have even longer integration cycles due to their size and complexity. In closing, the quarter was exceptional. We continue to demonstrate a record of strong diversified growth even in uncertain times. The performance of our leaders and the grittiness of our team was the best I've seen in my seven years here. Suffice it to say, I cannot wait to see what we achieve in a better climate. Combining our high member growth and product innovation with lower benchmark rates, unemployment at 4% to 5%, stable inflation and a stable economy, I could not be more confident in our ability to achieve our ambitions. With that, I'll turn it over to Chris for a deeper look at the results.\nChris Lapointe: Thanks, Anthony. The second quarter was underscored by continued execution, profitability and increased diversification, strong evidence of how our differentiated business model drives SoFi's durability and long-term growth potential. I'm going to walk through key financial highlights and our financial outlook. Unless otherwise stated, I'll be referring to adjusted results for the second quarter of 2024 versus second quarter of 2023. Our GAAP consolidated income statement and all reconciliations can be found in today's earnings release and the subsequent 10-Q filing, which will be made available next month. For the quarter, we delivered record adjusted net revenue of $597 million, which grew 22% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $138 million at a 23% margin. This represented over 7 points of year-over-year margin improvement, demonstrating significant operating leverage. In fact, sales and marketing declined as a percentage of adjusted net revenue by 6 points relative to the year-ago quarter. We delivered our third quarter GAAP profitability with GAAP net income reaching $17.4 million, a $65 million improvement year-over-year and GAAP EPS of $0.01 per share. Now, on to the segment-level performance. In Lending, we achieved adjusted net revenue of $339 million with $198 million of contribution profit at a 58% margin. These results were driven by 20% year-over-year growth in net interest income, while non-interest income was down 38% as planned. Growth in net interest income was driven by a 40% year-over-year increase in average interest earning assets and a 27 basis point year-over-year increase in average yields. This resulted in an average net interest margin of 5.83% for the quarter, up 9 basis points year-over-year. In terms of non-interest income, Q2 originations grew 22% year-over-year to $5.3 billion and were driven by a record quarter in personal loan originations, which grew 12% year-over-year and 28% sequentially to $4.2 billion. Our student loans business saw origination volume grow 86% year-over-year with a slight 2% decline sequentially to $737 million. Home loans grew by 71% year-over-year and 24% sequentially to $417 million. Our personal loan borrowers' weighted average income is $168,000 with a weighted average FICO score of 747. Our student loan borrowers' weighted average income is $137,000 with a weighted average FICO score of 764. In the second quarter, we sold portions of our personal loan and home loan portfolios totaling nearly $1.6 billion. In terms of the personal loan sales, we closed $1.1 billion of principal at a blended execution of 106.2%. These sales had similar structures to other recent personal loan sales with cash proceeds in line with par or at a small premium to par with the majority of the execution premium consisting of a contractual servicing fee that is capitalized. These deals included a small loss share provision that is above our base assumption of losses and immaterial relative to the exposure we would otherwise have if we held the loans. Our $381 million of home loan sales were sold at a blended execution of 101.9%. Additionally, we sold $69 million of late-stage delinquent personal loans in the quarter. We noted last quarter that we typically have not sold delinquent loans until such time that they are charged off. However, we've been able to generate positive incremental value in these sales relative to selling after they charge off, both from our improved recovery capabilities and by maintaining servicing. Finally, we executed $989 million of senior secured financing, which will show up on our detailed balance sheet as senior secured loans held for investment at amortized costs. These loans have a fixed-term structure and are secured against the underlying assets, therefore equivalent to investment-grade bonds if you were to do a securitization for the same pool of collateral. In addition, these loans are priced at market rates which not only helps to diversify our balance sheet but also provides an additional return above our cost of funding and a yield similar to the net interest margin of our loans which are unsecured. Turning to credit performance. Our on balance sheet 90-day personal loan delinquency rate was 64 basis points in the quarter, a decrease from 72 basis points in Q1 which is evidence of surpassing a peak. Our personal loan annualized charge-off rate increased to 3.84% from 3.45% in Q1 2024, including the impact of asset sales, new originations and the delinquency sale in the quarter. Had we not sold these late-stage delinquencies, we estimate that including recoveries between 90 days and 120 days delinquent, we would have had an all-in annualized net charge-off for personal loans of approximately 5.4%. For our student loans, our on balance sheet 90-day delinquency rate was 12 basis points versus 13 basis points last quarter, while our annualized loan charge-off rate was 64 basis points. That brings me to an important point, an in-depth look at cumulative net losses on several of our personal loan vintages and how this underscores comfort in our 7% to 8% maximum life of loan loss assumptions in line with our underwriting tolerance. As you can see on Page 8 of our investor presentation, a loan vintage analysis indicates the following. Using our 2017 vintage as a starting point as this is the last that approached 8% life of loan losses at 7.85%, you can see significant improvement in cumulative net losses at a given percentage of remaining unpaid principal for more recent 2022 and 2023 vintages. Specifically looking at the Q4 2022 vintage, soon after we made material cuts to credit, at roughly 40% of remaining unpaid principal, net cumulative losses of 5.02% are well below the 6.07% observed in the 2017 vintage at that same point of 40% remaining principal balance. In addition, you can see that more recent vintages are performing as well or better than the Q4 2022 loans at similar levels of remaining unpaid principal. This is critically important as this analysis and comparison gives us confidence that our loans will continue to perform in line to better than our tolerance. Furthermore, looking at Page 9 in the investor presentation, you will notice that only 44% of unpaid principal remains from our Q1 2020 through Q1 2024 originations. Among the 56% of principal that has already been paid down, we've seen only 3% in net cumulative losses. For life of loan losses on this entire cohort of loans to reach 8% net cumulative losses, the remaining unpaid principal would need to charge off at a rate of 11%. Past vintages have performed meaningfully better after this point in the seasoning curve, further improving our confidence in achieving loss rates below 8%. Now turning to our fair value marks and key assumptions. Our personal loans are marked at 104.3%, 5 basis points higher quarter-over-quarter with a negligible change in the discount rate. For our student loan portfolio, the fair value mark decreased by 17 basis points to 103.6%, while the discount rate rose by 10 basis points to 4.44% due to rising rates and a wider spread. Overall, sequential changes in spreads and discount rates had a negative impact on reported revenue. Moving on to Financial Services where net revenue of $176 million increased 80% year-over-year with new all-time high revenue for SoFi Money in our loan platform business as well as continued contributions from SoFi Invest and Credit Card. Overall monetization continues to improve with annualized revenue per product of $64, up nearly 29% year-over-year versus $50 in Q2 2023. This is driven by higher deposits and member spending levels in SoFi Money, greater assets under management and monetizable features in SoFi Invest and robust growth within SoFi Credit Card spend. Net interest income of $139 million increased 87% year-over-year which was primarily driven by growth in consumer deposits. Importantly, non-interest income grew 58% to $37 million in the quarter which represents approximately $150 million in annualized revenue. This was driven by interchange growth of 67% year-over-year as a result of over $10 billion in total annualized spend, as well as our referrals from our loan platform business, which grew 66% versus the prior year period. Contribution profit reached $55 million at a 31% margin for the quarter, even as we continue to invest in innovation and new opportunities to rapidly grow this operating segment with attractive returns. Lastly, we reached 11 million financial services products in the quarter, which is up 39% year-over-year with 865,000 new products in the quarter. We reached nearly 4.3 million products in SoFi Money, 2.3 million in SoFi Invest and 3.9 million in Relay. Shifting to our Tech Platform segment where we delivered net revenue of $95 million in the quarter, up 9% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Revenue growth was driven by strong performance from new clients onboarded over the last four quarters along with strong monetization of existing clients on our platform. Galileo accounts grew 23% year-over-year to 158 million. The segment delivered a contribution profit of $31 million, representing a 33% margin. We continue to leverage investments made in the segment as we continue to position Tech Platform for higher rates of diversified durable growth going forward. As mentioned earlier, a strong pipeline of interest spans financial institutions along with major consumer and commercial brands representing larger and more durable revenue opportunities and with longer sales and integration cycles due to the size and complexity. Shifting to our balance sheet where we remain very well-capitalized. Assets grew by $1.3 billion as a result of $2.1 billion of growth in loans and approximately $800 million decrease in cash, cash equivalents and investment securities. On the liability side, member deposits grew by $2.2 billion to $21 billion, while overall deposits increased to $23 billion. We also reduced our brokered deposits by $800 million as we continue to use our consumer deposits to replace higher cost parts of the funding stack and we exited the quarter with $1.1 billion of warehouse debt drawn. Currently, there is a 213 basis point difference between the interest we pay on deposits and the interest we pay on warehouse lines, which translates to about $500 million in annualized interest expense savings given the size of our deposit base. This difference also continues to support our net interest margin, underscoring the benefits of having the option of holding loans on balance sheet when advantageous and collecting net interest income. Overall, we expect to maintain a healthy net interest margin above 5% for the foreseeable future and benefit from the continued mix toward deposit funding along with our ability to sustain healthy deposit versus lending betas. In terms of our regulatory capital ratios, our total capital ratio of 16.8% decreased by approximately 50 basis points from 17.3% last quarter and remains comfortably above the regulatory minimum of 10.5%. Lastly, we grew book value to $5.9 billion and tangible book value by $92 million sequentially to $4.2 billion with tangible book value per share at $3.92. Now on to guidance. Throughout the last 12 months, we have demonstrated the benefit of having a diversified high-growth set of revenue streams, multiple cost-efficient sources of capital, a keen focus on underwriting high quality credit and a high degree of operating leverage as we scale the business. We expect those benefits to persist even in light of the macro backdrop. For Q3, we expect to deliver adjusted net revenue of $625 million to $645 million, adjusted EBITDA of $160 million to $165 million, GAAP net income of $40 million to $45 million and EPS of $0.04 per share. For the full year 2024, we now expect to deliver adjusted net revenue of $2.425 billion to $2.465 billion, which is $35 million higher than our prior guidance range of $2.39 billion to $2.43 billion. This implies 17% to 19% annual growth versus 15% to 17% previously. This guidance now assumes lending revenue will be at least 95% of 2023 levels, Financial Services will grow more than 80% year-over-year and Tech Platform will grow mid to upper teens percent year-over-year. While this is lower than our original 20% guidance for Tech Platform, we view this as transitory and still feel confident in our multi-year growth guidance for this business. We now expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA of $605 million to $615 million, above our prior guidance of $590 million to $600 million. This represents a 25% adjusted EBITDA margin. We now expect full-year GAAP net income of $175 million to $185 million, above prior guidance of $165 million to $175 million and GAAP EPS of $0.9 to $0.10 per share, above prior guidance of $0.8 to $0.09 per share. We continue to expect growth in tangible book value of approximately $800 million to $1 billion and continue to expect to end the year with a total capital ratio north of 16%. We continue to expect to add at least 2.3 million new members in 2024, which represents 30% growth. Overall, we couldn't be more proud of our Q2 results. Having delivered $597 million of adjusted net revenue and $138 million of adjusted EBITDA, we continue to make great progress against our long-term growth objectives and remain very well-capitalized to continue to pursue our ultimate goal of making SoFi a top financial institution. With that, let's begin the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from John Hecht from Jefferies. John, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJohn Hecht: Morning, guys, and thanks for taking my questions and appreciate all the incremental disclosure in the deck. The question is, I think you said that cumulative losses would have to go above 10%, I think, to 11% for you to kind of breach your 8% assumptions in your underwriting. What kind of scenario would that entail in terms of like payment rates or delinquency rates and just to kind of connect the dots there?\nChris Lapointe: Yeah, sure, John. Thanks for the question. So, like we said, credit is performing in line with expectations and we remain extremely confident in our 7% to 8% life of loan loss assumption. Just to reiterate what I had mentioned in my prepared remarks, when looking at all originations from 2020 through Q1 of 2024, only 44% of those remain. Of the 56% that got paid down, we've experienced only 3% net cumulative losses. So in order to reach 8% cumulative losses on the entire pool, the remaining 44% would need to charge off at 11%. So from where I sit, something would have to materially change in order to hit 8% as prior vintages with similar levels of remaining UPB have never experienced losses even close to 11%. In addition to that, we ended up showing you vintage analyses that highlight how recent vintages since making our credit cuts back in the second half of 2022 are performing materially better than the 2017 cohort which was the last one to come even close to 8%. Furthermore, what gives us even more confidence is that the leading indicator for losses, which is our delinquencies, has started to turn the corner and we're really bending the curve. So in our personal loans business, we ended up surpassing a peak in Q1 on not only dollar principal, but also cumulative fair value adjustments and percentage UPB. So from a dollar principal perspective, we ended up having $96 million of 90-day to 120-day delinquencies in the quarter versus $103 million back in Q1. From a percentage UPB basis, those were at 64 basis points in the quarter versus 72 basis points in Q1. And then from a cumulative fair-value adjustment basis, that was $79 million in Q2 versus $88 million in Q1. And what's even more important than that, these trends are continuing throughout the first several weeks of Q3.\nOperator: The next question comes from Terry Ma from Barclays. Terry, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nTerry Ma: Hi, thank you. Good morning. So you show some pretty encouraging vintage charge-off metrics on slides 8 and 9. It sounds like from your commentary, everything is kind of in line. But maybe just kind of reconcile your more conservative stance and maybe talk about what you need to see in the environment to maybe just grow a little bit again in the portfolio.\nAnthony Noto: Thank you for the question. We're really encouraged by the trends we're seeing in credit. As Chris mentioned, we're really proud of the fact that we're able to achieve record revenue with 22% year-over-year growth with lending barely growing. I would say the areas of incremental opportunity as we go into the back half of the year, home loans, really proud to see the growth rate year-over-year in home loans, student loan refinancing, also a product that shouldn't be doing really well in this interest rate environment also had strong growth. On the personal loan side, we're going to stay relatively conservative compared to our balance sheet ending assets there, primarily because we want to see how the year trends in terms of unemployment. There's a big number coming out on Friday. We're at 4.1% and move to 4.2% could signal a recession. And so while there have been improvements, we're not changing our stance. We're able to achieve pretty strong growth year-over-year without getting too aggressive on the personal loan side. There are factors that could cause us to originate a lot more in personal loans. I will tell you, I see more near-term opportunity in home loans and student loan refinancing. But in personal loan, the thing that would cause us to be more aggressive in terms of the growth rate is if we have greater-than-expected sales. In addition to that, changes in benchmark rates. In addition to that continued improvement in our credit trends, if they start to accelerate better than we've already seen, which is quite positive. But all in all, we have a lot more growth. We could grow much faster if we wanted to, but we want to drive durable diversified growth and that was the reason why we took a stance on limiting our personal loan balances specifically. The other thing that could drive growth which would be further diversification of the balance sheet is home equity loans. We're now doing home equity loans as a principal as opposed to an agent. They're obviously secured lending and attractive rates, more attractive than personal loan rates. So there'll be a greater emphasis on that. That could also drive better performance there. So a lot of opportunities as it relates to the lending business. We're taking a pretty conservative view purposely. I quite frankly, don't feel like we're getting paid for the results we're delivering. So I'm not sure why would be overly aggressive at this point.\nOperator: The next question is from Dan Dolev at Mizuho. Dan, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDan Dolev: Hey guys, great results here. Really appreciate letting us asking a question. So how are you -- Anthony, Chris, like how do you expect to keep growing Financial Services? I mean, obviously, you've grown deposits so much. What -- how do you expect to grow it given that you've grown interest income now? Like if you can talk a little bit about the near-term future? Thank you.\nAnthony Noto: Thanks, Dan. Well, first, we did a really incredible job driving the diversification. The only way we're able to achieve record revenue is because our Financial Services segment had a record at $176 million, up 80% year-over-year. It was driven by product growth, as you know, up 47%. It was also driven by deposits up 80%. That drives the net interest income. I think more interestingly is the growth opportunity we have in non-net interest income. We reported $37 million in that line item. It grew very nicely, 58% year-over-year. If you annualize the number, it’s about $150 million. And there's a couple of drivers of that. First, continue to drive increased product growth. We had 47% growth in Financial Services products. That will be one driver of strong growth. The second is increased monetization or revenue per product. We saw strong growth in revenue per product in the mid-20s as well. What drives it going forward from here? Interchange was up 67% year-over-year. AUM was up 58% year-over-year. We'll see benefits in brokerage, not just from AUM growth, but also increased monetization per dollar of AUM, which is about half what we think the benchmark rate is, continue driving home, auto and life insurance, which we call SoFi Protect and then our loan platform business. So it's a combination of those different monetization vehicles that will drive continued revenue per product, which we think has a significant upside after growing 29% already in this quarter. And then our product growth is something that's probably a lot more visible to everyone, which is up 47%. So dual-pronged growth of -- dual-pronged dimensions of growth should continue to drive increased diversification there.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kyle Peterson from Needham & Company. Kyle, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nKyle Peterson: Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Wanted to touch on deposits. Obviously, you continue to see nice growth in the core base here with members. But how should we think about the growth outlook for deposits and kind of how that counterbalances with any ongoing runoff of some of the brokered funding?\nAnthony Noto: Yeah, I'll let Chris talk about the sort of specific trends in the quarter, but as it relates to the broader macro picture, we're obviously entering an environment where rates are likely to go down in the future. And many people ask us, will you maintain a high rate? And the answer is, we will maintain a high rate relative to our competition. We think we have a competitive advantage given that we have such a big origination platform. That origination platform allows us to fund a higher APY than a lot of other competitors that don't have an origination platform. So the tool businesses work in tandem. As rates go down, the value of our loans generally go up, all else equal. And so we can maintain a superior APY. That doesn't mean we may not change it. It just means it will be superior to drive our differentiated value proposition and leverage our competitive advantage. As it relates to deposits, more specifically, rate is one element of our differentiation. The other elements of differentiation start with no fees. We do not charge. We don't require minimum balances to get our services. You do get a higher APY if you do direct deposit or you do a average monthly deposit of a certain amount. As we mentioned in the call, we'll actually launch SoFi Plus, which will give you that higher rate for a fee per month, which will be quite attractive relative to the amount of interest you could gain when you pay that fee. In addition to that, we have the ability to do person-to-person payments to an email address or a phone number. We recently launched Zelle which is very unique among the fintechs, which is a highly requested product. In addition to that, we provide seamless capabilities into our brokerage business and money movement more broadly. So the APY is one important element of driving deposits, but it's the broader value proposition that we offer that we think will continue to allow us to drive strong deposit growth on the back of strong member growth in Money.\nChris Lapointe: Yeah, and what I would add to that is we've consistently said that we were going to add over $2 billion of member deposits each quarter. We certainly did that in Q1. We did it again in Q2 with $2.2 billion of net new deposits from a member perspective. We did pay down about $800 million of brokered CDs as they had higher costs relative to our member deposits. Right now, we are about just north of 80% deposit funded. Going forward, we believe the optimal mix is consistent with our prior guidance at about 80% to 90%. We still have about $1.1 billion of warehouse debt that's outstanding and nearly $2 billion of brokered deposits. So we're going to continue to optimize funding sources and lower our overall costs.\nOperator: The next question comes from Reggie Smith from JPMorgan. Reggie, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nReggie Smith: Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. I appreciate the disclosure on the loss curves and I hope you guys continue to publish that. Kind of similar thing, I was curious, and I think I asked about this last quarter about the Credit Card program or business, and I look at the fact that you've got 4 million Money users and almost 4 million Relay users and only less than 300,000 credit card accounts. And it would seem that there's an opportunity to kind of really be very targeted to slice and find really prime credits within your customer base. Can you talk a little bit about that? Maybe am I oversimplifying that? It just seems like that business could be a lot bigger than it is, but maybe I just don't understand how that ramps up. So maybe a little color on how that business grows and some of the things that keep it from growing faster than it would appear you have the opportunity to grow.\nAnthony Noto: Reggie, thank you for the question on Credit Card. I would start by saying we have a pretty diversified portfolio of products. Our goal is to drive a series of S curves of growth across the products so that we drive strong, durable, diversified compounding growth for years, which means we'll invest in some businesses faster and quicker than others. I often say internally we have some startup businesses. We have some Series A businesses, some late stage growth businesses and some mature growth businesses. Credit Card is one of those early-stage businesses where we want to make sure that we get the marketing, the product market fit correct, the credit correct, and really the overall unit economics of our Credit Card on a per account basis correct. We spent the last 18 months working our butt on that and we feel like we have the right formula. I know we have the right team. We did change the team about a year and a half ago, bringing in someone that's actually built this business from scratch before, in addition to running businesses. So we have a very positive long term outlook for Credit Card and want to contribute to our business. I often say businesses like Credit Card and brokerage by themselves someday could be bigger than SoFi is in total today. There are companies that are very big that are just in the Credit Card business and just in the brokerage business, and to today those are small for us and we're investing aggressively. We pointed out the fact that the brokerage business and the credit card business combined are annualizing a loss of $100 million. So what are the changes we're making in Credit Card specifically. We'll launch two new cards. We'll be testing them slowly. One is an everyday card where people get a much higher percentage reward on categories like food or things that are used every day. The second card is more of a no frills, no surprises card for people that are in our ecosystem that are members, but they have thin credit files, not because they have low credit, they just have very little credit because they may be a new professional in addition to our existing card. Not only we'll launch two more cards, but we'll make those cards work better with our other products. So if you're a SoFi Plus member, your rewards will be boosted because of that relationship between SoFi Plus and Credit Card. So we can start to benefit from not just targeting our members, but giving our members more value for using more than one product and you'll see us continue to do that over time. But in Credit Card today, we're going to continue to move relatively slowly and not step on the gas too hard. Because this is a business you can lose a lot of money and you can lose it every day. It's unlike a loan where you give somebody a fixed amount. In credit card, you have lines that are quite big and they can be utilized in nefarious ways and drive really high losses. So we'll continue to make sure we approach this prudently, but we are stepping on the gas a little bit more than we have in the past.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeff Adelson from Morgan Stanley. Jeff, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJeff Adelson: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions this morning. I just want to circle back on the lending growth. I know you're still sort of maintaining a more cautious stance on origination there. You did a little bit better than we thought on originations this quarter. And your lending revenue growth looks like it's still up 5% year-over-year. So I guess just, are you seeing better opportunities coming in the door? And does it have anything maybe to do with more certainty around the forward look with rate cuts? I know you're talking about potential increase in unemployment rate from here as well, so just trying to square all that. And then, Chris, also just in terms of the bending of the curb comments on credit, just wondering when you think that might translate into the all-in 5.4% charge off rates starting to come in lower each quarter as well? Thanks, guys.\nAnthony Noto: So in the lending business overall, our first objective is to make sure we continue to diversify the lending business relative to the total company. Less capital, less risky businesses get valued much higher, and we don't want to have over dependence on a high capital, high risk business. And this year, the macroeconomic environment accelerated our diversification and it's worked out quite well. We also want to diversify within lending. As I mentioned, home equity loans is diversification into secured lending, which will be our second secured product. In addition to that, student loan refinancing is our oldest and used to be biggest product we think is starting to come into a period where it can do quite well. And that's also diversification relative to unsecured personal loans and then across home loan refinancing is also a vehicle. As we go through the year, I think it's important just to understand we're trying to manage to the overall growth of the company. We have so much resources we want to allocate, and we're allocating it to drive that outcome of diversified, less risky, less capital-intensive businesses. If we wanted to grow personal loans more, we would have to allocate more capital to it. Why? We have to drive marketing that drives the top of the funnel, that then drives conversion. Those loans don't just happen because we decide to actually underwrite more, we actually have to spend money to underwrite more. Right now, we're choosing to spend that money in different areas that don't drive as much revenue. But despite that trade-off, we're still driving 22% year-over-year revenue growth, and a record despite barely growing personal loans. So it's a very conscious effort to diversify in a number of different ways. Diversification means you reallocate resources to other places. If we reallocated to personal loans, we would not achieve our diversification. Now, what happened in the quarter? Our marketing costs were more efficient. The money we were spending was driving more demand than otherwise would have demanded or otherwise would have driven. And we took advantage of the higher unit economics to drive more volume against a set amount of resources in that area. We could be more aggressive if we choose to allocate more resources than lending, that could happen because we have upside in other businesses, that could happen because the marketing efficiency is greater than we anticipated, or the credit is performing better, or we sell more loans. And so it's not because the growth isn't there, it's how we're choosing to allocate the capital in this environment relative to our broader goals. And I'll let Chris talk about the specific question you had on the losses.\nChris Lapointe: Yeah. And in terms of when some of these early DQ trends will start to show up in the NCOs, we're sticking with our overall guidance of being confident in the 7% to 8% life of loan losses. And we aren't guiding to NCO rates specifically. Reason for that is quite simple. The NCO rate is very lumpy. It's a function of a number of different factors, such as originations in the period, sales in the period, and most importantly, the average age or how much UPB remains on the portfolio, which can be driven by a number of things. So overall, we feel really confident in our life of loan loss expectation of 7% to 8%. But we're not guiding to NCOs because they're so lumpy.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Peter Christiansen from Citigroup. Peter, your line is open. Please go ahead\nPeter Christiansen: Thank you. Thanks for the question here. Good morning. Nice trends. I was wondering if you could talk about the appetite for future asset sales, either demand for it, but also your risk transfer strategy kind of going forward from here, given that you are seeing improvements -- credit improvements in your portfolio, particularly in the personal loan portfolio. Just how are you thinking about risk transfer from here and if there's further opportunities to derisk the portfolio? Thank you.\nChris Lapointe: Yeah, absolutely. So overall, we're seeing continued strong demand from credit buyers. We've done $3.3 billion in sales over the course of the last three quarters in our personal loan business and $4.7 billion in aggregate. That's predominantly driven by the shape of the interest rate curve with lower expectations in the second half of this year as well as the next several years. So we have very attractive yielding assets with very strong credit profiles and low risk for buyers. Essentially, buyers are looking into locking purchases and programs ahead of any interest rate cuts. In addition to that, we have a really strong balance sheet. We are able to offer flexible deal structures to meet buyers where they need to be. We are one of the few participants that can sell in size. It allows investors to book money to work. It allows buyers to have one buyer versus many, and it allows them to have a long term partner versus doing bespoke one-off transactions that require a ton of work. Buyers want stability of asset generation. So looking forward, we expect to see continued strong demand from credit buyers. In a declining rate environment, we would expect that demand only to increase as those buyers would have lower cost of leverage. And again, we're one of the few folks that have a sizable balance sheet who can do that.\nAnthony Noto: We'll take one more question, operator, and then I'll close with comments.\nOperator: The final question comes from Tim Switzer from Stifel. Tim, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nTim Switzer: Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. How would a return to lower rate environment kind of change the ROE math you guys have talked about on choosing to retain loans versus selling? Do you believe it could strengthen demand at all in the secondary market and kind of change your balance sheet management at all?\nAnthony Noto: I would say generally lower rates are going to make the loans more attractive to those without origination platforms that have assets they need to deploy. Our weighted average coupon is quite high and that ROE becomes more attractive as rate environment declines and there's less places for them to find that type of yield. We've seen that in the past be the case. So we would anticipate more demand. We'd have to manage it relative to our production and our own financial goals. But I do believe the demand would increase and the terms would be more favorable and the values also would be attractive. We have to wait and see that happen, but that's what we've seen in the past.\nAnthony Noto: Great. In closing, I want to express my gratitude to our team. Q2 was the most rewarding quarter and dare I say, the most fun that I've had in some time at SoFi. What made it special and fun was that we challenged ourselves to be better in areas that are the most difficult in the current environment that aren't supposed to do well in this environment, such as Home Loans and Student Loan refinancing that had volume increases of 71% and 87% year-over-year. The team found a way to be better continuously throughout the entire quarter, not just each month or each week, but literally each day, finishing strong all the way through the tape when quite frankly, the only reason was because we pushed ourselves to keep iterating. It was also fun because we made hard resource allocation decisions in 2023, that meant doing less than we wanted to in areas with great growth potential, such as Invest and Credit Card, where we are now seeing promising results. Our Invest business is accelerating with AUM up 58% on the back of a lot of hard work and only a couple of important areas and a testament that less can be more. In our Credit Card business, the immediate gains from all of our iterations aren't so large today, but with time and scale, they will be massive and well worth the patience. If you can't tell by now, I feel great. To put it bluntly, I do not know of any financial services company or fintech that has transformed their business to be less risky, less capital intensive while still driving strong revenue growth, 40% plus user growth, all while massively increasing profitability and still funding a rapid pace of innovation. When you take a step back, it's inspiring to see. We hit record revenue of nearly $600 million with 22% year-over-year growth despite lending barely growing. We did that because we achieved record revenue in our Financial Services segment at $176 million, up 80% year-over-year on the back of 47% year-over-year growth in products, 80% year-over-year growth in deposits, 58% year-over-year growth in AUM, and 67% year-over-year growth in interchange. In Lending, we grew home loan volume 71% year-over-year, student loan refinancing volume 87% year-over-year and personal loan volume 12% year-over-year while delinquencies declined on an absolute and percentage basis for PL and we provided vintage analysis that clearly shows why we are comfortable with personal loan life of loan loss forecast. And finally, we grew EBITDA 80% year-over-year. I love what we have built. But more than ever, I love the people we are building it with and the gritty culture we have created. Hard is not for everyone, but for me and those who stay at SoFi, it fits just fine. Thank you for your interest in SoFi and talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you very much for your attendance. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Chris Lapointe",
            "content": "Thanks, Anthony. The second quarter was underscored by continued execution, profitability and increased diversification, strong evidence of how our differentiated business model drives SoFi's durability and long-term growth potential. I'm going to walk through key financial highlights and our financial outlook. Unless otherwise stated, I'll be referring to adjusted results for the second quarter of 2024 versus second quarter of 2023. Our GAAP consolidated income statement and all reconciliations can be found in today's earnings release and the subsequent 10-Q filing, which will be made available next month. For the quarter, we delivered record adjusted net revenue of $597 million, which grew 22% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $138 million at a 23% margin. This represented over 7 points of year-over-year margin improvement, demonstrating significant operating leverage. In fact, sales and marketing declined as a percentage of adjusted net revenue by 6 points relative to the year-ago quarter. We delivered our third quarter GAAP profitability with GAAP net income reaching $17.4 million, a $65 million improvement year-over-year and GAAP EPS of $0.01 per share. Now, on to the segment-level performance. In Lending, we achieved adjusted net revenue of $339 million with $198 million of contribution profit at a 58% margin. These results were driven by 20% year-over-year growth in net interest income, while non-interest income was down 38% as planned. Growth in net interest income was driven by a 40% year-over-year increase in average interest earning assets and a 27 basis point year-over-year increase in average yields. This resulted in an average net interest margin of 5.83% for the quarter, up 9 basis points year-over-year. In terms of non-interest income, Q2 originations grew 22% year-over-year to $5.3 billion and were driven by a record quarter in personal loan originations, which grew 12% year-over-year and 28% sequentially to $4.2 billion. Our student loans business saw origination volume grow 86% year-over-year with a slight 2% decline sequentially to $737 million. Home loans grew by 71% year-over-year and 24% sequentially to $417 million. Our personal loan borrowers' weighted average income is $168,000 with a weighted average FICO score of 747. Our student loan borrowers' weighted average income is $137,000 with a weighted average FICO score of 764. In the second quarter, we sold portions of our personal loan and home loan portfolios totaling nearly $1.6 billion. In terms of the personal loan sales, we closed $1.1 billion of principal at a blended execution of 106.2%. These sales had similar structures to other recent personal loan sales with cash proceeds in line with par or at a small premium to par with the majority of the execution premium consisting of a contractual servicing fee that is capitalized. These deals included a small loss share provision that is above our base assumption of losses and immaterial relative to the exposure we would otherwise have if we held the loans. Our $381 million of home loan sales were sold at a blended execution of 101.9%. Additionally, we sold $69 million of late-stage delinquent personal loans in the quarter. We noted last quarter that we typically have not sold delinquent loans until such time that they are charged off. However, we've been able to generate positive incremental value in these sales relative to selling after they charge off, both from our improved recovery capabilities and by maintaining servicing. Finally, we executed $989 million of senior secured financing, which will show up on our detailed balance sheet as senior secured loans held for investment at amortized costs. These loans have a fixed-term structure and are secured against the underlying assets, therefore equivalent to investment-grade bonds if you were to do a securitization for the same pool of collateral. In addition, these loans are priced at market rates which not only helps to diversify our balance sheet but also provides an additional return above our cost of funding and a yield similar to the net interest margin of our loans which are unsecured. Turning to credit performance. Our on balance sheet 90-day personal loan delinquency rate was 64 basis points in the quarter, a decrease from 72 basis points in Q1 which is evidence of surpassing a peak. Our personal loan annualized charge-off rate increased to 3.84% from 3.45% in Q1 2024, including the impact of asset sales, new originations and the delinquency sale in the quarter. Had we not sold these late-stage delinquencies, we estimate that including recoveries between 90 days and 120 days delinquent, we would have had an all-in annualized net charge-off for personal loans of approximately 5.4%. For our student loans, our on balance sheet 90-day delinquency rate was 12 basis points versus 13 basis points last quarter, while our annualized loan charge-off rate was 64 basis points. That brings me to an important point, an in-depth look at cumulative net losses on several of our personal loan vintages and how this underscores comfort in our 7% to 8% maximum life of loan loss assumptions in line with our underwriting tolerance. As you can see on Page 8 of our investor presentation, a loan vintage analysis indicates the following. Using our 2017 vintage as a starting point as this is the last that approached 8% life of loan losses at 7.85%, you can see significant improvement in cumulative net losses at a given percentage of remaining unpaid principal for more recent 2022 and 2023 vintages. Specifically looking at the Q4 2022 vintage, soon after we made material cuts to credit, at roughly 40% of remaining unpaid principal, net cumulative losses of 5.02% are well below the 6.07% observed in the 2017 vintage at that same point of 40% remaining principal balance. In addition, you can see that more recent vintages are performing as well or better than the Q4 2022 loans at similar levels of remaining unpaid principal. This is critically important as this analysis and comparison gives us confidence that our loans will continue to perform in line to better than our tolerance. Furthermore, looking at Page 9 in the investor presentation, you will notice that only 44% of unpaid principal remains from our Q1 2020 through Q1 2024 originations. Among the 56% of principal that has already been paid down, we've seen only 3% in net cumulative losses. For life of loan losses on this entire cohort of loans to reach 8% net cumulative losses, the remaining unpaid principal would need to charge off at a rate of 11%. Past vintages have performed meaningfully better after this point in the seasoning curve, further improving our confidence in achieving loss rates below 8%. Now turning to our fair value marks and key assumptions. Our personal loans are marked at 104.3%, 5 basis points higher quarter-over-quarter with a negligible change in the discount rate. For our student loan portfolio, the fair value mark decreased by 17 basis points to 103.6%, while the discount rate rose by 10 basis points to 4.44% due to rising rates and a wider spread. Overall, sequential changes in spreads and discount rates had a negative impact on reported revenue. Moving on to Financial Services where net revenue of $176 million increased 80% year-over-year with new all-time high revenue for SoFi Money in our loan platform business as well as continued contributions from SoFi Invest and Credit Card. Overall monetization continues to improve with annualized revenue per product of $64, up nearly 29% year-over-year versus $50 in Q2 2023. This is driven by higher deposits and member spending levels in SoFi Money, greater assets under management and monetizable features in SoFi Invest and robust growth within SoFi Credit Card spend. Net interest income of $139 million increased 87% year-over-year which was primarily driven by growth in consumer deposits. Importantly, non-interest income grew 58% to $37 million in the quarter which represents approximately $150 million in annualized revenue. This was driven by interchange growth of 67% year-over-year as a result of over $10 billion in total annualized spend, as well as our referrals from our loan platform business, which grew 66% versus the prior year period. Contribution profit reached $55 million at a 31% margin for the quarter, even as we continue to invest in innovation and new opportunities to rapidly grow this operating segment with attractive returns. Lastly, we reached 11 million financial services products in the quarter, which is up 39% year-over-year with 865,000 new products in the quarter. We reached nearly 4.3 million products in SoFi Money, 2.3 million in SoFi Invest and 3.9 million in Relay. Shifting to our Tech Platform segment where we delivered net revenue of $95 million in the quarter, up 9% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Revenue growth was driven by strong performance from new clients onboarded over the last four quarters along with strong monetization of existing clients on our platform. Galileo accounts grew 23% year-over-year to 158 million. The segment delivered a contribution profit of $31 million, representing a 33% margin. We continue to leverage investments made in the segment as we continue to position Tech Platform for higher rates of diversified durable growth going forward. As mentioned earlier, a strong pipeline of interest spans financial institutions along with major consumer and commercial brands representing larger and more durable revenue opportunities and with longer sales and integration cycles due to the size and complexity. Shifting to our balance sheet where we remain very well-capitalized. Assets grew by $1.3 billion as a result of $2.1 billion of growth in loans and approximately $800 million decrease in cash, cash equivalents and investment securities. On the liability side, member deposits grew by $2.2 billion to $21 billion, while overall deposits increased to $23 billion. We also reduced our brokered deposits by $800 million as we continue to use our consumer deposits to replace higher cost parts of the funding stack and we exited the quarter with $1.1 billion of warehouse debt drawn. Currently, there is a 213 basis point difference between the interest we pay on deposits and the interest we pay on warehouse lines, which translates to about $500 million in annualized interest expense savings given the size of our deposit base. This difference also continues to support our net interest margin, underscoring the benefits of having the option of holding loans on balance sheet when advantageous and collecting net interest income. Overall, we expect to maintain a healthy net interest margin above 5% for the foreseeable future and benefit from the continued mix toward deposit funding along with our ability to sustain healthy deposit versus lending betas. In terms of our regulatory capital ratios, our total capital ratio of 16.8% decreased by approximately 50 basis points from 17.3% last quarter and remains comfortably above the regulatory minimum of 10.5%. Lastly, we grew book value to $5.9 billion and tangible book value by $92 million sequentially to $4.2 billion with tangible book value per share at $3.92. Now on to guidance. Throughout the last 12 months, we have demonstrated the benefit of having a diversified high-growth set of revenue streams, multiple cost-efficient sources of capital, a keen focus on underwriting high quality credit and a high degree of operating leverage as we scale the business. We expect those benefits to persist even in light of the macro backdrop. For Q3, we expect to deliver adjusted net revenue of $625 million to $645 million, adjusted EBITDA of $160 million to $165 million, GAAP net income of $40 million to $45 million and EPS of $0.04 per share. For the full year 2024, we now expect to deliver adjusted net revenue of $2.425 billion to $2.465 billion, which is $35 million higher than our prior guidance range of $2.39 billion to $2.43 billion. This implies 17% to 19% annual growth versus 15% to 17% previously. This guidance now assumes lending revenue will be at least 95% of 2023 levels, Financial Services will grow more than 80% year-over-year and Tech Platform will grow mid to upper teens percent year-over-year. While this is lower than our original 20% guidance for Tech Platform, we view this as transitory and still feel confident in our multi-year growth guidance for this business. We now expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA of $605 million to $615 million, above our prior guidance of $590 million to $600 million. This represents a 25% adjusted EBITDA margin. We now expect full-year GAAP net income of $175 million to $185 million, above prior guidance of $165 million to $175 million and GAAP EPS of $0.9 to $0.10 per share, above prior guidance of $0.8 to $0.09 per share. We continue to expect growth in tangible book value of approximately $800 million to $1 billion and continue to expect to end the year with a total capital ratio north of 16%. We continue to expect to add at least 2.3 million new members in 2024, which represents 30% growth. Overall, we couldn't be more proud of our Q2 results. Having delivered $597 million of adjusted net revenue and $138 million of adjusted EBITDA, we continue to make great progress against our long-term growth objectives and remain very well-capitalized to continue to pursue our ultimate goal of making SoFi a top financial institution. With that, let's begin the Q&A. Yeah, sure, John. Thanks for the question. So, like we said, credit is performing in line with expectations and we remain extremely confident in our 7% to 8% life of loan loss assumption. Just to reiterate what I had mentioned in my prepared remarks, when looking at all originations from 2020 through Q1 of 2024, only 44% of those remain. Of the 56% that got paid down, we've experienced only 3% net cumulative losses. So in order to reach 8% cumulative losses on the entire pool, the remaining 44% would need to charge off at 11%. So from where I sit, something would have to materially change in order to hit 8% as prior vintages with similar levels of remaining UPB have never experienced losses even close to 11%. In addition to that, we ended up showing you vintage analyses that highlight how recent vintages since making our credit cuts back in the second half of 2022 are performing materially better than the 2017 cohort which was the last one to come even close to 8%. Furthermore, what gives us even more confidence is that the leading indicator for losses, which is our delinquencies, has started to turn the corner and we're really bending the curve. So in our personal loans business, we ended up surpassing a peak in Q1 on not only dollar principal, but also cumulative fair value adjustments and percentage UPB. So from a dollar principal perspective, we ended up having $96 million of 90-day to 120-day delinquencies in the quarter versus $103 million back in Q1. From a percentage UPB basis, those were at 64 basis points in the quarter versus 72 basis points in Q1. And then from a cumulative fair-value adjustment basis, that was $79 million in Q2 versus $88 million in Q1. And what's even more important than that, these trends are continuing throughout the first several weeks of Q3. Yeah, and what I would add to that is we've consistently said that we were going to add over $2 billion of member deposits each quarter. We certainly did that in Q1. We did it again in Q2 with $2.2 billion of net new deposits from a member perspective. We did pay down about $800 million of brokered CDs as they had higher costs relative to our member deposits. Right now, we are about just north of 80% deposit funded. Going forward, we believe the optimal mix is consistent with our prior guidance at about 80% to 90%. We still have about $1.1 billion of warehouse debt that's outstanding and nearly $2 billion of brokered deposits. So we're going to continue to optimize funding sources and lower our overall costs. Yeah. And in terms of when some of these early DQ trends will start to show up in the NCOs, we're sticking with our overall guidance of being confident in the 7% to 8% life of loan losses. And we aren't guiding to NCO rates specifically. Reason for that is quite simple. The NCO rate is very lumpy. It's a function of a number of different factors, such as originations in the period, sales in the period, and most importantly, the average age or how much UPB remains on the portfolio, which can be driven by a number of things. So overall, we feel really confident in our life of loan loss expectation of 7% to 8%. But we're not guiding to NCOs because they're so lumpy. Yeah, absolutely. So overall, we're seeing continued strong demand from credit buyers. We've done $3.3 billion in sales over the course of the last three quarters in our personal loan business and $4.7 billion in aggregate. That's predominantly driven by the shape of the interest rate curve with lower expectations in the second half of this year as well as the next several years. So we have very attractive yielding assets with very strong credit profiles and low risk for buyers. Essentially, buyers are looking into locking purchases and programs ahead of any interest rate cuts. In addition to that, we have a really strong balance sheet. We are able to offer flexible deal structures to meet buyers where they need to be. We are one of the few participants that can sell in size. It allows investors to book money to work. It allows buyers to have one buyer versus many, and it allows them to have a long term partner versus doing bespoke one-off transactions that require a ton of work. Buyers want stability of asset generation. So looking forward, we expect to see continued strong demand from credit buyers. In a declining rate environment, we would expect that demand only to increase as those buyers would have lower cost of leverage. And again, we're one of the few folks that have a sizable balance sheet who can do that."

            "name": "Anthony Noto",
            "content": "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results were exceptional and continue to demonstrate SoFi's leadership as a one-stop shop for digital financial services and the amazing grit of our team. I'll cover five topics before turning to Chris for a deeper look at our financial and operating performance. First, our strategy continues to drive strong diversified growth, profitability and returns. Second, our continuous product innovation and brand-building are fueling significant member and product growth, which are key to our long-term revenue and profit growth outlooks. Third, turning to our segment results, our Financial Services segment demonstrates our clear structural advantages in delivering value to members. Fourth, our leadership and agility in lending has generated sustained returns despite rising rates and positions us to move quickly once rates come down. And finally, our tech platform is making good progress on its journey toward becoming an AWS of not only to fintech but of financial services broadly. Turning to the first topic, the success of our one-stop shop strategy. For Q2, adjusted net revenue reached a new record of $597 million, a 22% year-over-year increase. Our rapid diversification made a record revenue quarter possible even with just 5% growth in adjusted net revenue in lending. Combined, Financial Services and Tech Platform revenue grew 46% year-over-year and now makes up 45% of total adjusted net revenue, up from 38% one year ago. To put that accomplishment in context, lending now stands at just 57% of adjusted net revenue compared to 99% of our revenue when I joined nearly seven years ago and more than 70% of revenue just two years ago. We also delivered even greater growth and profitability in the quarter. EBITDA grew 80% year-over-year to $138 million. We recorded our third consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability with $17 million in GAAP net income versus a loss of $40 million in Q2 of 2023. Credit performance was better-than-expected as cumulative fair-value adjustments from delinquent loans peaked in March along with delinquencies on an absolute and percentage basis. We are really encouraged by our team's ability to bend the curves through stringent underwriting, limiting credit exposure when prudent and improving collections and servicing. Chris will share details on the performance of our recent personal loan vintages, which show clear improvements versus older vintages, underscoring our confidence in our prior guidance around left-alone losses peaking in the 7% to 8% range. Our loan sales continue to scale at attractive execution levels with an increasingly diversified set of buyers with $1.6 billion in total sales this quarter and $4.7 billion in the three trailing quarters. This brings me to my second topic. Our rapid pace of innovation and brand-building are fueling significant member and product growth. The growing size of our member base and the number of products they use impact the results we're reporting today. But more importantly, they are the leading indicators of our potential revenue growth and profitability in the future. In Q2, we added 643,000 members and now have 8.8 million in total. That's up 41% year-over-year. We grew products in the quarter by 946,000 to 12.8 million in total. That's up 43% year-over-year, adjusting for our exit from crypto last year. Nearly 40% of all new products in Q2 were opened by existing SoFi members. We also see that nearly 30% of new members opened a second product in the first 30 days, demonstrating the immediate value of our one-stop shop strategy. We've doubled our member base and number of products in the past two years and Q2 was the 20th consecutive quarter of greater than 30% growth. Our growth in members and products will drive our financial growth for years to come and is the basis for our three-year financial outlook shared at the end of 2023. All this growth is a direct result of our relentless focus on innovation because we offer products across eight categories compared to many fintechs that only offer one or two, the magnitude of our innovation is not always obvious. As much as I'd love to share the full breadth of what we shipped in the quarter, I'll just cover a few of the highlights. I'll start with our Financial Services business, which drove 91% of our new product adds in the quarter. Our Invest offering is getting better every day. In fact, I don't know of any other self-directed product that offers alternative assets like private credit, private real estate and private venture investing side-by-side with fractional shares, robo finds, ETFs and IPOs. Our innovations over the last year are starting to accelerate results, driving a 58% year-over-year increase in assets under management in our Invest business in Q2, and this was driven largely by net flows. We fully rolled out alternative assets and mutual funds, including interval funds from well-known financial leaders in KKR, Carlisle, Franklin Templeton and ARK Venture Fund, which includes several leading private technology companies. Alternative assets generated 12% of all net flows during the second quarter. We brought the concept of one-click checkout to individual asset transfers, enabling our members to consolidate their assets the way they would like and now we're seeing benefits from that innovation as well. We are now finalizing a turnkey way for companies going public to extend participation in their IPOs at scale to their customers, employees and partners. With this new directed share program, people can open an account, enter an order and fund it in minutes without fees, minimum balances or speaking to anyone in order to participate in an IPO. Turning to SoFi Money. In the quarter, we launched Zelle, one of our most requested features and one element of our much larger money movement product pipeline. The innovations in our member business unit, which focused on ensuring our products work better when used together are reaching critical mass. For example, 3 million members have signed up for SoFi's broad-based rewards program. We're creating a rewards economy across our products, including rewards for using our app and other services and we're expanding redemption options including into stocks, cash for savings and travel. For SoFi Plus, we achieved 1 million members. For people that are not familiar with SoFi Plus, it is our premium membership tier available to those who enable direct deposit. SoFi Plus includes our highest APY on banking balances which today is up to 4.6%. It also includes up to 2x reward points, up to 3.3% cashback rewards on SoFi Credit spending, discounts on personal loan rates and much more. And I'm very excited to share that we've laid the foundation to provide more value in SoFi Plus not only to direct deposit members but also a monthly paid subscription product for those who prefer that option over direct deposit. We intend to test this new subscription-based option for SoFi Plus later this year. We're also driving iteration and learning to drive innovation in credit cards. We've improved our acquisition capabilities and introduced a 10% cashback boost for SoFi Plus members that has shown positive results. And I'm excited to share that this week we'll also begin testing two new credit cards to better serve our members' needs, one card for cashback rewards on everyday high-spending categories and one for members who need a no-frills card with no surprise fees. Turning to Lending. We've launched new capabilities that position us for future growth, especially as the rate environment improves. In small and medium business, members can now apply for a loan at SoFi and get approved offers from lending partners. In Home Loans, we can now close our home equity products instead of brokering them out. This dramatically increases our potential for revenue per loan. Notably, we're now a principal in home equity loans and can offer members a lower cost of borrowing in these secured loans compared to higher rates in unsecured lending. And of course, our Tech Platform is a center of innovation as we add capabilities to our already comprehensive offering. We expanded our Buy Now Pay Later product for post-purchase use. We added new wire capabilities and extended the AI-driven transactional fraud capabilities in our payment risk platform to non-processing partners. We also advanced the quality of our managed service in the cloud and introduced 3DS, which adds another layer of security to digital card transactions. These improvements ensure our modern cloud-based platform will continue to serve the needs of brands, fintechs and global financial institutions alike. Having world-class products is a necessary factor in becoming a Top 10 financial institution, but it's not enough. We must also become a trusted household brand name. We measure this by our unaided brand awareness. Our world-class marketing team stands in a category of one. Their amazing work has increased unaided brand awareness to the 7% to 9% range which is up about 40% year-over-year and 4x since 2021. Our brand punches way above its weight as our team continues to make its footprint bigger than its foot. Now diving into our segment results. In Financial Services segment, we are seeing the continued benefits of structural advantages that drive our leading value proposition. We reported record segment revenue of $176 million, up 80% from $98 million in the year ago quarter. Importantly, this drove contribution profit of $55 million compared to a loss of $4 million one year earlier. Financial Services products grew $865,000 in the quarter, up 48% year-over-year, adjusting for our exit from crypto last year. Revenue per product grew 8% quarter-over-quarter and 29% year-over-year. We believe there is substantial upside to the monetization of our financial services products. SoFi Money achieved new records this quarter as ending deposits totaled $23 billion with consumer deposits up $2.2 billion from the previous quarter. Account openings grew by $419,000 and 90% of our deposits remain tied to sticky direct deposit relationships. Debit spend also continues to increase at a rapid pace, up 129% year-over-year and now annualizing at about $9 billion. Our Credit Card and Invest businesses remain in investment mode with nearly $100 million in annualized losses, but we expect them to follow a similar path to Money in achieving variable profit and contribution profit. In our Credit Card business, delinquency entry rates and roll rates improved by roughly 20% apiece from 2023 averages. Turning now to my fourth topic, our strong leadership across lending. We reported strong results despite our conservative posture given a 500 basis point increase in benchmark rates over the past two years and continued macro uncertainty. Importantly, net interest income reached an all-time high of $279 million or 82% of lending revenue versus 72% one year ago and 45% two years ago. Net interest income is cash revenue. Let me say that again, net interest income is cash revenue, so 82% of our lending revenue is cash. Notably, discount rates and spreads were largely unchanged and in aggregate had a slight negative impact on lending revenue. Our personal loan originations reached a record of $4.2 billion while sticking to stringent underwriting standards as our team demonstrated its grip by consistently iterating on pricing and marketing throughout the quarter. Our home loan originations were their highest since Q1 of 2022, growing 24% quarter-over-quarter and 71% year-over-year despite interest rates at their highest level in 10 quarters. On top of that, purchase home loan volume was our highest ever, growing 25% from Q1 2024 and nearly 100% year-over-year. Once rates come down, we expect to benefit from our expansion into three products in home lending, purchase loans, home equity loans and the volume already generated by our financing business. Student loan originations grew 86% year-over-year. The team drove our strongest Q2 of origination volume in three years by iterating to drive continuous improvement throughout the quarter and into Q3 with private loan refinancing, which exemplifies our ability to respond to environmental factors to drive results. And my fifth topic, the Tech Platforms segment is making good progress on its journey to become not only the AWS of fintech but of financial services more broadly. We recorded segment revenue of $95 million, up 9% year-over-year and contribution profit of $31 million, up 82% year-over-year at a 33% margin. This represents our fourth consecutive quarter of over 30% margin. Our customer wins have been more diverse, including but not limited to, secure card and B2B partners. Our pipeline of interest remains robust and includes US and international financial institutions along with major consumer and commercial brands. As we have noted, we are pursuing enterprise partnerships with larger existing customer bases for more durable revenue opportunities. These partnerships take multiple quarters, not months to win and have even longer integration cycles due to their size and complexity. In closing, the quarter was exceptional. We continue to demonstrate a record of strong diversified growth even in uncertain times. The performance of our leaders and the grittiness of our team was the best I've seen in my seven years here. Suffice it to say, I cannot wait to see what we achieve in a better climate. Combining our high member growth and product innovation with lower benchmark rates, unemployment at 4% to 5%, stable inflation and a stable economy, I could not be more confident in our ability to achieve our ambitions. With that, I'll turn it over to Chris for a deeper look at the results. Thank you for the question. We're really encouraged by the trends we're seeing in credit. As Chris mentioned, we're really proud of the fact that we're able to achieve record revenue with 22% year-over-year growth with lending barely growing. I would say the areas of incremental opportunity as we go into the back half of the year, home loans, really proud to see the growth rate year-over-year in home loans, student loan refinancing, also a product that shouldn't be doing really well in this interest rate environment also had strong growth. On the personal loan side, we're going to stay relatively conservative compared to our balance sheet ending assets there, primarily because we want to see how the year trends in terms of unemployment. There's a big number coming out on Friday. We're at 4.1% and move to 4.2% could signal a recession. And so while there have been improvements, we're not changing our stance. We're able to achieve pretty strong growth year-over-year without getting too aggressive on the personal loan side. There are factors that could cause us to originate a lot more in personal loans. I will tell you, I see more near-term opportunity in home loans and student loan refinancing. But in personal loan, the thing that would cause us to be more aggressive in terms of the growth rate is if we have greater-than-expected sales. In addition to that, changes in benchmark rates. In addition to that continued improvement in our credit trends, if they start to accelerate better than we've already seen, which is quite positive. But all in all, we have a lot more growth. We could grow much faster if we wanted to, but we want to drive durable diversified growth and that was the reason why we took a stance on limiting our personal loan balances specifically. The other thing that could drive growth which would be further diversification of the balance sheet is home equity loans. We're now doing home equity loans as a principal as opposed to an agent. They're obviously secured lending and attractive rates, more attractive than personal loan rates. So there'll be a greater emphasis on that. That could also drive better performance there. So a lot of opportunities as it relates to the lending business. We're taking a pretty conservative view purposely. I quite frankly, don't feel like we're getting paid for the results we're delivering. So I'm not sure why would be overly aggressive at this point. Thanks, Dan. Well, first, we did a really incredible job driving the diversification. The only way we're able to achieve record revenue is because our Financial Services segment had a record at $176 million, up 80% year-over-year. It was driven by product growth, as you know, up 47%. It was also driven by deposits up 80%. That drives the net interest income. I think more interestingly is the growth opportunity we have in non-net interest income. We reported $37 million in that line item. It grew very nicely, 58% year-over-year. If you annualize the number, it's about $150 million. And there's a couple of drivers of that. First, continue to drive increased product growth. We had 47% growth in Financial Services products. That will be one driver of strong growth. The second is increased monetization or revenue per product. We saw strong growth in revenue per product in the mid-20s as well. What drives it going forward from here? Interchange was up 67% year-over-year. AUM was up 58% year-over-year. We'll see benefits in brokerage, not just from AUM growth, but also increased monetization per dollar of AUM, which is about half what we think the benchmark rate is, continue driving home, auto and life insurance, which we call SoFi Protect and then our loan platform business. So it's a combination of those different monetization vehicles that will drive continued revenue per product, which we think has a significant upside after growing 29% already in this quarter. And then our product growth is something that's probably a lot more visible to everyone, which is up 47%. So dual-pronged growth of -- dual-pronged dimensions of growth should continue to drive increased diversification there. Yeah, I'll let Chris talk about the sort of specific trends in the quarter, but as it relates to the broader macro picture, we're obviously entering an environment where rates are likely to go down in the future. And many people ask us, will you maintain a high rate? And the answer is, we will maintain a high rate relative to our competition. We think we have a competitive advantage given that we have such a big origination platform. That origination platform allows us to fund a higher APY than a lot of other competitors that don't have an origination platform. So the tool businesses work in tandem. As rates go down, the value of our loans generally go up, all else equal. And so we can maintain a superior APY. That doesn't mean we may not change it. It just means it will be superior to drive our differentiated value proposition and leverage our competitive advantage. As it relates to deposits, more specifically, rate is one element of our differentiation. The other elements of differentiation start with no fees. We do not charge. We don't require minimum balances to get our services. You do get a higher APY if you do direct deposit or you do a average monthly deposit of a certain amount. As we mentioned in the call, we'll actually launch SoFi Plus, which will give you that higher rate for a fee per month, which will be quite attractive relative to the amount of interest you could gain when you pay that fee. In addition to that, we have the ability to do person-to-person payments to an email address or a phone number. We recently launched Zelle which is very unique among the fintechs, which is a highly requested product. In addition to that, we provide seamless capabilities into our brokerage business and money movement more broadly. So the APY is one important element of driving deposits, but it's the broader value proposition that we offer that we think will continue to allow us to drive strong deposit growth on the back of strong member growth in Money. Reggie, thank you for the question on Credit Card. I would start by saying we have a pretty diversified portfolio of products. Our goal is to drive a series of S curves of growth across the products so that we drive strong, durable, diversified compounding growth for years, which means we'll invest in some businesses faster and quicker than others. I often say internally we have some startup businesses. We have some Series A businesses, some late stage growth businesses and some mature growth businesses. Credit Card is one of those early-stage businesses where we want to make sure that we get the marketing, the product market fit correct, the credit correct, and really the overall unit economics of our Credit Card on a per account basis correct. We spent the last 18 months working our butt on that and we feel like we have the right formula. I know we have the right team. We did change the team about a year and a half ago, bringing in someone that's actually built this business from scratch before, in addition to running businesses. So we have a very positive long term outlook for Credit Card and want to contribute to our business. I often say businesses like Credit Card and brokerage by themselves someday could be bigger than SoFi is in total today. There are companies that are very big that are just in the Credit Card business and just in the brokerage business, and to today those are small for us and we're investing aggressively. We pointed out the fact that the brokerage business and the credit card business combined are annualizing a loss of $100 million. So what are the changes we're making in Credit Card specifically. We'll launch two new cards. We'll be testing them slowly. One is an everyday card where people get a much higher percentage reward on categories like food or things that are used every day. The second card is more of a no frills, no surprises card for people that are in our ecosystem that are members, but they have thin credit files, not because they have low credit, they just have very little credit because they may be a new professional in addition to our existing card. Not only we'll launch two more cards, but we'll make those cards work better with our other products. So if you're a SoFi Plus member, your rewards will be boosted because of that relationship between SoFi Plus and Credit Card. So we can start to benefit from not just targeting our members, but giving our members more value for using more than one product and you'll see us continue to do that over time. But in Credit Card today, we're going to continue to move relatively slowly and not step on the gas too hard. Because this is a business you can lose a lot of money and you can lose it every day. It's unlike a loan where you give somebody a fixed amount. In credit card, you have lines that are quite big and they can be utilized in nefarious ways and drive really high losses. So we'll continue to make sure we approach this prudently, but we are stepping on the gas a little bit more than we have in the past. So in the lending business overall, our first objective is to make sure we continue to diversify the lending business relative to the total company. Less capital, less risky businesses get valued much higher, and we don't want to have over dependence on a high capital, high risk business. And this year, the macroeconomic environment accelerated our diversification and it's worked out quite well. We also want to diversify within lending. As I mentioned, home equity loans is diversification into secured lending, which will be our second secured product. In addition to that, student loan refinancing is our oldest and used to be biggest product we think is starting to come into a period where it can do quite well. And that's also diversification relative to unsecured personal loans and then across home loan refinancing is also a vehicle. As we go through the year, I think it's important just to understand we're trying to manage to the overall growth of the company. We have so much resources we want to allocate, and we're allocating it to drive that outcome of diversified, less risky, less capital-intensive businesses. If we wanted to grow personal loans more, we would have to allocate more capital to it. Why? We have to drive marketing that drives the top of the funnel, that then drives conversion. Those loans don't just happen because we decide to actually underwrite more, we actually have to spend money to underwrite more. Right now, we're choosing to spend that money in different areas that don't drive as much revenue. But despite that trade-off, we're still driving 22% year-over-year revenue growth, and a record despite barely growing personal loans. So it's a very conscious effort to diversify in a number of different ways. Diversification means you reallocate resources to other places. If we reallocated to personal loans, we would not achieve our diversification. Now, what happened in the quarter? Our marketing costs were more efficient. The money we were spending was driving more demand than otherwise would have demanded or otherwise would have driven. And we took advantage of the higher unit economics to drive more volume against a set amount of resources in that area. We could be more aggressive if we choose to allocate more resources than lending, that could happen because we have upside in other businesses, that could happen because the marketing efficiency is greater than we anticipated, or the credit is performing better, or we sell more loans. And so it's not because the growth isn't there, it's how we're choosing to allocate the capital in this environment relative to our broader goals. And I'll let Chris talk about the specific question you had on the losses. We'll take one more question, operator, and then I'll close with comments. I would say generally lower rates are going to make the loans more attractive to those without origination platforms that have assets they need to deploy. Our weighted average coupon is quite high and that ROE becomes more attractive as rate environment declines and there's less places for them to find that type of yield. We've seen that in the past be the case. So we would anticipate more demand. We'd have to manage it relative to our production and our own financial goals. But I do believe the demand would increase and the terms would be more favorable and the values also would be attractive. We have to wait and see that happen, but that's what we've seen in the past. Great. In closing, I want to express my gratitude to our team. Q2 was the most rewarding quarter and dare I say, the most fun that I've had in some time at SoFi. What made it special and fun was that we challenged ourselves to be better in areas that are the most difficult in the current environment that aren't supposed to do well in this environment, such as Home Loans and Student Loan refinancing that had volume increases of 71% and 87% year-over-year. The team found a way to be better continuously throughout the entire quarter, not just each month or each week, but literally each day, finishing strong all the way through the tape when quite frankly, the only reason was because we pushed ourselves to keep iterating. It was also fun because we made hard resource allocation decisions in 2023, that meant doing less than we wanted to in areas with great growth potential, such as Invest and Credit Card, where we are now seeing promising results. Our Invest business is accelerating with AUM up 58% on the back of a lot of hard work and only a couple of important areas and a testament that less can be more. In our Credit Card business, the immediate gains from all of our iterations aren't so large today, but with time and scale, they will be massive and well worth the patience. If you can't tell by now, I feel great. To put it bluntly, I do not know of any financial services company or fintech that has transformed their business to be less risky, less capital intensive while still driving strong revenue growth, 40% plus user growth, all while massively increasing profitability and still funding a rapid pace of innovation. When you take a step back, it's inspiring to see. We hit record revenue of nearly $600 million with 22% year-over-year growth despite lending barely growing. We did that because we achieved record revenue in our Financial Services segment at $176 million, up 80% year-over-year on the back of 47% year-over-year growth in products, 80% year-over-year growth in deposits, 58% year-over-year growth in AUM, and 67% year-over-year growth in interchange. In Lending, we grew home loan volume 71% year-over-year, student loan refinancing volume 87% year-over-year and personal loan volume 12% year-over-year while delinquencies declined on an absolute and percentage basis for PL and we provided vintage analysis that clearly shows why we are comfortable with personal loan life of loan loss forecast. And finally, we grew EBITDA 80% year-over-year. I love what we have built. But more than ever, I love the people we are building it with and the gritty culture we have created. Hard is not for everyone, but for me and those who stay at SoFi, it fits just fine. Thank you for your interest in SoFi and talk to you next quarter."

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the SoFi Technologies Q1 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\n With that, you may begin your conference. \nPaulina Gutierrez: Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to SoFi's First Quarter of 2024 earnings conference call.\n Joining me today to talk about our results and recent events are Anthony Noto, CEO; and Christopher Lapointe, CFO. You can find the presentation accompanying our earnings release on the Investor Relations section of our website.\n Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations and forecasts and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include, but are not limited to, our competitive advantage and strategy, macroeconomic conditions and outlook, future products and services and future business and financial performance.\n Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements.

Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\n And now I'd like to turn the call over to Anthony. \nAnthony Noto: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Q1 was another exceptionally strong quarter for SoFi. We continue to successfully execute on our strategy of making SoFi the one-stop shop for digital financial services. We expected that 2024 would be an important year of transition. Heading into this year, we had a conservative outlook given interest rate volatility, industry liquidity, inflation and macroeconomic environment concerns.\n We planned for continued strong growth from our financial services and technology platform segments up 50% year-over-year, offsetting our plan for lending to be 92% to 95% of 2023 revenue. And we set out to strengthen our balance sheet and capital ratios by continuing to grow our tangible book value. I'm proud to report that our team delivered across each of these fronts and more in the first quarter of 2024.\n First, we responsibly grew revenue, while further diversifying our business. We grew adjusted net revenue in Q1 to $581 million, up 26% year-over-year. This marks the 12th consecutive quarter of greater than 25% growth. We grew adjusted EBITDA to $144 million, up 91% year-over-year. This represents a 25% margin compared to 16% a year ago.\n I'm pleased to report that our Financial Services and Technology Platform segments make up a growing portion of our revenue quarter-over-quarter, contributing 42% of adjusted net revenue in Q1. This is up from 40% last quarter and 33% a year ago, and we remain on track to finish 2024 with our revenue mix near 50-50.\n Second, we posted GAAP net income of $88 million. This includes a $59 million onetime benefit from the recent exchange of convertible notes, which Chris will talk about more in a moment. After achieving our first quarter of GAAP profitability in Q4 2023, we committed to sustaining profitability for the full year of 2024, and we did so in Q1. We posted GAAP EPS of $0.02 per share, which excludes the benefit from the convertible note exchange.\n Third, we further reinforced our balance sheet for long-term growth. We grew tangible book value for the seventh consecutive quarter to $4.1 billion, an increase of $608 million from the prior quarter. Equally as important, our tangible book value per share now stands at $3.92, up 16% sequentially. We grew consumer deposits by a record of $3 billion and saw continued strong buying demands for our loans, selling over $1.9 billion of loans in Q1.\n SoFi Bank reported net income of $100 million with a 21% margin, and a return on tangible equity of 11.7%. Our total capital ratio for SoFi Technologies is now 17.3%, a 200 basis point improvement from last quarter and well above our 10.5% regulatory minimum.\n Finally, our broad product offering, enabling people to borrow, save, spend, invest and protect their money continues to attract more and more members to SoFi. In Q1, we grew our member base to 8.1 million, up 44% from the prior year, adding 622,000 new members in the quarter. Just as important, we continue to see members adopt more products and deepen the relationship with SoFi.\n We recorded 989,000 new product additions in the quarter, with 93% of those product adds coming in our Financial Services segment, a remarkable milestone considering it's been only 5 years since we launched our first non-lending products and 2 years since we launched SoFi Bank.\n This increasingly diverse product relationship with our members is what maximizes the power of the Financial Services productivity loop and allows us to leverage our unique structural economic advantage. Despite external unpredictability in the year ahead, I remain as confident as ever in SoFi's future. Our plan to sustain responsible growth and our ability to deliver meaningful value to our shareholders.\n Before handing it over to Chris to cover our financial highlights and share updated guidance, I wanted to give a quick peek under the hood on our segment level results. Starting with Financial Services. We continue to drive acquisition and monetization and importantly, rapidly expanding margins. We achieved record net revenue of $151 million in Q1, up 86% year-over-year and 8% from the prior quarter. Demonstrating the strong operating leverage in this segment, we generated this 86% growth with only an 8% increase in directly attributable expenses year-over-year.\n The overall Financial Services segment achieved $37 million in contribution profit at a 25% margin compared to a $24 million loss in the year ago quarter. That margin is up 7 points from last quarter and a full 22 points from our first quarter of segment profitability achieved in the third quarter of 2023.\n This progress is notable given our significant investment across our Money, Credit Card and Invest products. SoFi Money delivered strong growth, high-quality deposits and engagement, and higher average account balances even as spending increased. We grew to 3.9 million SoFi Money accounts, up 61% year-over-year with over 90% of our consumer deposits coming from direct deposit members.\n Our direct deposit members have a median FICO of 744 and over 50% of our newly funded SoFi Money account setup direct deposit by day 30, presenting ample opportunities for cross-buy into other SoFi products. As these members make SoFi Money their account of choice, spending follows with overall debit transaction volume, exceeding $1.9 billion in the quarter, up 20% from the prior quarter and over 150% year-over-year.\n Looking at our Credit Card and Invest products, we previously shared that these are our heaviest areas of investment in the Financial Services segment, with current losses of nearly $100 million annually on a run rate basis. However, through improved unit economics and scale, we expect that these products will eventually contribute profit similar to our progress with SoFi Money.\n Next, turning to our Technology Platform segment. Our consistent product development and successful shift in sales strategy has enabled us to diversify growth and pursue larger, more durable revenue opportunities. In Q1, we exceeded $94 million in revenue, representing 21% year-over-year growth versus 13% last quarter, in line with our guidance for accelerating growth. Our Tech Platform segment contribution margin was 33% compared to 32% last quarter and 19% a year ago.\n Demand from traditional financial institutions and clients in nonfinancial categories remain strong. While lead times for winning RFPs and integrations and time to revenue are measured in multiple quarters and years, not months, we're seeing the transition to modern processing and modern cores playing out as envisioned.\n We also made significant strides in product development in Q1. We enhanced our partnership with the Bancorp to offer real-time payments, improving the money movement hub, enabling multiple new use cases for B2C and B2B clients. We launched post-purchase buy now, pay later for banks and fintechs to deliver flexible financing solutions for debit and credit purchases.\n Galileo and SoFi Bank partnered to launch a small business financing card program with Rapid Finance. And importantly, we continue to make progress with our growing pipeline of new partners in the quarter.\n And finally, turning to lending. As we shared last quarter, we've taken a more conservative approach toward originations given our concerns around rate uncertainty and the broader macro climate. For Q1, adjusted net revenue of $325 million was flat year-over-year. Personal loan origination growth slowed to 11% year-over-year to $3.3 billion, in line with our more conservative approach. In fact, the balance of personal loans on our balance sheet declined 2% quarter-over-quarter.\n Student loan originations grew 43% year-over-year to $752 million and home loan originations increased 274% year-over-year to $336 million. A record 82% of the segment's adjusted net revenue was derived from net interest income compared to 76% last quarter and 62% in the year ago quarter. This is a direct benefit of our bank charter and our ability to hold loans longer when advantageous.\n The percent of adjusted lending revenue from net interest income has more than doubled since we launched the bank 2 years ago. Together, these efforts contributed to great results for SoFi in the first quarter of 2024. I am incredibly proud of our team's perseverance to serve our members and clients' financial needs in face of continued volatility and uncertainty around the world, while delivering good consistent growth, profitability and shareholder value creation.\n With that, I'll hand it over to Chris. \nChris Lapointe: Thanks, Anthony. The first quarter demonstrates strong evidence of how our increasingly diversified and differentiated business model drive SoFi's durability and long-term growth potential. I'm going to walk through key financial highlights and our financial outlook. Unless otherwise stated, I'll be referring to adjusted results for the first quarter of 2024 versus first quarter of 2023. Our GAAP consolidated income statement and all reconciliations can be found in today's earnings release, and the subsequent 10-Q filing, which will be made available next month.\n For the quarter, we delivered adjusted net revenue of $581 million, with growth of 26% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $144 million at a 25% margin. This represented over 8 points of year-over-year margin improvement, demonstrating significant operating leverage across all functional expense lines.\n In fact, sales and marketing declined as a percentage of adjusted net revenue by 9 points relative to the year ago quarter, while total noninterest operating expenses declined 16 points year-over-year.\n We delivered our second quarter of GAAP profitability with GAAP net income reaching $88 million, a $122 million improvement year-over-year. Net income included the benefit of a $59 million net gain associated with the exchange of a portion of our 2026 convertible notes at a discount for equity during the quarter. We reported GAAP diluted EPS of $0.02, which was not impacted by the gain from the convertible note exchange.\n Now on to the segment level performance. Starting with Financial Services, where net revenue of $151 million increased 86% year-over-year with new all-time high revenue for SoFi Money and Lending as a Service, as well as continued contributions from SoFi Invest and Credit Card.\n Overall monetization continues to improve with annualized revenue per product of $59, up 31% year-over-year versus $45 in Q1 2023. This is driven by higher deposits and member spending levels in SoFi Money, greater AUM and monetizable features in SoFi Invest and robust growth within SoFi Credit Card spend.\n Net interest income increased 106% year-over-year, primarily driven by $11.5 billion growth in deposits year-over-year. Our noninterest income increased 34% year-over-year, primarily driven by 2 factors: interchange, which grew 65% year-over-year based on over $7.5 billion in annualized spend and referrals from our Lending as a Service product, which grew 32% versus the prior year period.\n Contribution profit reached $37 million at a 25% margin for the quarter, even as we continue to invest to rapidly grow this segment. Despite our invest in credit card businesses collectively losing nearly $100 million on an annualized basis, we still achieved strong margins.\n Lastly, we reached 10.1 million Financial Services products in the quarter, which is up 42% year-over-year, with 919,000 new products in the quarter. We reached nearly 3.9 million products in SoFi Money, 2.2 million in SoFi Invest and 3.6 million in Relay.\n Shifting to our Tech Platform, where we delivered net revenue of $94 million in the quarter, up 21% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. Annual revenue growth was driven by strong performance from new clients onboarded over the last 9 months, large bank deals signed in Latin America and strong monetization of existing clients launching new products on our platform.\n Galileo accounts grew 20% year-over-year to $151 million. The segment delivered a contribution profit of $31 million, representing a 33% margin. We continue to leverage investments made in the segment as we continue to position Tech Platform for higher rates of diversified, durable growth going forward. We expect Tech Platform revenue to accelerate in 2024 with strong margins.\n Turning to lending. First quarter adjusted net revenue remained flat year-over-year at $325 million, with $208 million of contribution profit at a 64% margin versus $210 million a year ago. These results were driven by a 33% year-over-year growth in our net interest income, while noninterest income was down by 53%.\n Growth in net interest income was driven by a 59% year-over-year increase in average interest-earning assets and a 114 basis point year-over-year increase in average yields. This resulted in an average net interest margin of 5.91% for the quarter, up 43 basis points year-over-year.\n I'd also highlight our $3 billion of deposit growth in the quarter compared to the $242 million of net loan growth on the balance sheet. This has allowed us to continue to reduce our reliance on outside warehouse funding, which is 226 basis points more expensive than our deposits.\n As a result, we've reduced our warehouse utilization this quarter by $2.4 billion. The 226 basis points of cost savings between our deposits and our warehouse facilities continues to support our net interest margin and translates to nearly $500 million of annualized interest expense savings at our current deposit base.\n It also underscores the benefits of having the option of holding loans on balance sheet when advantageous and collecting net interest income. We expect to maintain a healthy net interest margin above 5% for the foreseeable future and benefit from the continued mix towards deposit funding, along with our ability to sustain healthy deposit versus lending betas.\n On the noninterest income side, Q1 originations grew 22% year-over-year to $4.4 billion and were driven by growth across our personal, student and home loan products. Personal loan originations growth slowed to 11% year-over-year and 2% sequentially to $3.3 billion, which was anticipated and in line with our more conservative approach given macro uncertainty.\n Our student loans business saw origination volume grow 43% year-over-year, with a slight 5% decline sequentially to $752 million. Home loans grew by over 270% year-over-year and 9% sequentially to $336 million. Our personal loan borrowers weighted average income is $169,000, with a weighted average FICO score of 746. Our student loan borrowers weighted average income is $146,000, with a weighted average FICO of 768.\n In the first quarter, we sold portions of our personal loan, student loan and home loan portfolios totaling over $1.9 billion. That comprises approximately $1.26 billion in personal loan principal, $300 million in student loan principal and nearly $350 million in home loan principal.\n In terms of personal loan sales, we closed $500 million of loans in whole loan form and $700 million in ABS at a blended execution of 105.7%. These had similar structures to other recent personal loan sales, with cash proceeds at par or at a small premium to par, and the majority of the premium consisted of contractual servicing fees that are capitalized.\n These deals included a small loss share provision that is above our base assumption of losses and immaterial relative to the exposure we would otherwise have if we held the loans. As a result of the personal loan sales in the quarter, the quantity of personal loans on our balance sheet declined sequentially despite growth in originations.\n Additionally, we sold $62.5 million of late-stage delinquent personal loans principal in the quarter. Typically, we do not sell delinquent loans until they are charged off, but we were able to generate positive value generated from both recovery and servicing value relative to letting the loans charge off and sell after the fact.\n As discussed during Q4 results, roughly 15% of our losses came from credit tiers that we ceased originating several quarters earlier, which represented 3% of unpaid principal balance. We were, therefore, able to reduce exposure to those credit tiers, as the loans run off and become a much smaller portion of overall unpaid principal balance.\n In addition, we continue to make adjustments to our credit underwriting model in line with the internal and external indicators underlying are our report card.\n Moving to our student loan sales. we closed $294 million of loans in whole loan form and execution of 104.9%. This sale had no accompanying loss share provision nor a senior secured financing option.\n Finally, our $344 million of home loan sales were sold at a blended execution of 100.9%. Also in the quarter, we executed $399 million of senior secured financing, which will show up on our detailed balance sheet as senior secured loans held for investment at amortized costs. These loans have a fixed term structure and are secured against the underlying assets, therefore, equivalent to the investment-grade bonds, if we were to do a securitization for the same pool of collateral.\n In addition, these loans are priced at market rates, which not only helps to diversify our balance sheet, but also provides an additional return above our cost of funding and a yield similar to the net interest margin of our loans, which are unsecured.\n Turning to credit performance. Our on-balance sheet 90-day student loan delinquency rate was 13 basis points, while our annualized student loan charge-off rate was 60 basis points. Our Q1 on-balance sheet 90-day personal loan delinquency rate was 72 basis points.\n Our annualized personal loan charge-off rate decreased to 3.45% from 4.02% in Q4, including the impact of asset sales, new originations and the delinquency sale in the quarter. We anticipate ongoing normalization in credit performance toward pre-pandemic levels of 7% to 8% life of loan losses.\n Now turning to our fair value marks and key assumptions. Our personal loans are marked at 104.2% as of quarter end, down from 104.9% at the end of Q4 and well below the 105.7% blended execution achieved on the $1.2 billion in personal loan sales.\n The lower personal loan mark was primarily a function of the discount rate increasing by approximately 30 basis points to 5.8%. This was driven by the underlying benchmark rate increasing by approximately 50 basis points and spreads tightening by 20 basis points, in line with industry trends. Importantly, the benchmark rate change and the spread change are empirical as they are actual market observed inputs, not assumptions.\n In addition, the mark was negatively impacted by the annual default rate increasing by 9 basis points to 4.85%, and the annual prepayment fees increasing by 150 basis points to 24.7%, which has an immaterial impact on the overall change in the mark.\n When a borrower prepays, we are still capturing the principal and the impact to the value of the asset is only based on the premium above par at a given point in time, which is very small relative to the principal outstanding.\n The weighted average coupon on the personal loan portfolio remained unchanged at 13.8%. For our student loan portfolio, the fair value mark remained unchanged at 103.8% at quarter end. In terms of the inputs, our weighted average coupon remained flat at 5.6%, annual losses remained flat at 60 basis points, prepayments increased by 8 basis points to 10.5%, and the discount rate remained unchanged at 4.3%.\n As mentioned previously, we sold $294 million of student loan collateral in the quarter. Had we not sold those assets, the student loan discount rate would have increased by a similar magnitude as our personal loans business.\n Switching to our balance sheet, where we remain very well capitalized with ample cash and liquidity. Assets grew by $1.2 billion, largely as a result of $242 million growth in loans and approximately $803 million growth in cash, cash equivalents and investment securities.\n On the liability side, deposits grew by $3 billion sequentially to nearly $22 billion. As mentioned earlier, we reduced our reliance on warehouse facilities through our robust deposit growth and exited the quarter with approximately $800 million of warehouse debt drawn.\n In Q1, we opportunistically executed 2 transactions in order to optimize our financing structure and bolster our capital capacity. First, we issued $862.5 million in convertible notes due in 2029 at a 1.25% coupon. The net proceeds are being used to replace higher cost financing, including the redemption of the $320 million of outstanding Series 1 preferred stock that carries an annual dividend of 12.5%, which was set to increase to over 15% in late May.\n In total, this new convertible issuance should reduce our financing expense by $40 million to $60 million per year, including cost-saving opportunities with the remaining proceeds.\n Second, we agreed to an exchange of $600 million principal of our convertible notes due in 2026 for shares of SoFi common stock. This was a notable discount compared to what we would have had to pay in 2 years. This transaction generated a gain of $59 million for us in the quarter, while notably reducing our 2026 maturities and bolstering our funding capacity.\n When viewed in total, these transactions are accretive to book value and net income, and have minimal impact on a fully diluted EPS basis. In terms of our regulatory capital ratios, our total capital ratio of 17.3%, improved by 200 basis points from 15.3% last quarter due in large part to these transactions and remains comfortably above the regulatory minimum of 10.5%.\n While we don't intend to utilize the excess capital capacity in the year, given our view of the macro uncertainty, these transactions put us in an even stronger position for years to come.\n Lastly, we grew book value to $6.1 billion and tangible book value to $4.1 billion. We recorded tangible book value per share at $3.92, up 16% quarter-over-quarter.\n Now moving on to our updated guidance. Throughout the last 12 months, we have demonstrated the benefit of having a diversified high growth set of revenue streams, multiple cost-efficient sources of capital, our continued key focus on underwriting high-quality credit and a high degree of operating leverage as we scale the business. We expect those benefits to persist going forward even in light of the existing macro backdrop. \n 2024 remains a transitional year for SoFi, as the Tech Platform and Financial Services segments together will drive our growth and increase from 38% of total adjusted net revenue in 2023 to approximately 50% for all of 2024.\n For the full year 2024, we now expect to deliver adjusted net revenue of $2.39 billion to $2.43 billion, which is $25 million higher than our implied prior guidance range of $2.365 billion to $2.405 billion. This guidance assumes lending revenue will be 92% to 95% of 2023 levels, which is unchanged from prior guidance and Tech Platform will grow approximately 20% year-over-year, which is also unchanged.\n We expect the Financial Services segment revenue to grow more than 75% year-over-year. We now expect adjusted EBITDA of $590 million to $600 million, above our prior guidance of $580 million to $590 million, and that incorporates increased investment into more product innovation, new businesses, services and member benefits. This represents 15% to 17% adjusted net revenue growth and a 25% adjusted EBITDA margin.\n We now expect full year GAAP net income of $165 million to $175 million, above prior guidance of $95 million to $105 million, which includes a $59 million gain associated with the convertible note exchange. We expect fully diluted GAAP EPS of $0.08 to $0.09 per share above prior guidance of $0.07 to $0.08 per share.\n We now expect growth in tangible book value of approximately $800 million to $1 billion for the year versus our previous guidance of $300 million to $500 million, given the benefits of the recent convertible debt exchange, along with the effects of new convertible issuance. We now expect to end the year, with a total capital ratio of north of 16% due to those transactions versus our previous guidance of 14%.\n We continue to expect to add at least 2.3 million new members in 2024, which represents 30% growth. For Q2, we expect to deliver adjusted net revenue of $555 million to $565 million, adjusted EBITDA of $115 million to $125 million, and net income of $5 million to $10 million.\n In terms of phasing, you can see for the past 2 years that the second quarter is seasonally flattish for lending, which coupled with our more conservative approach toward originations this year should drive a sequential decline in lending revenue, which largely offsets tailwinds in the 2 other segments.\n In terms of operating expenses, you can expect low single-digit sequential growth as we continue to invest in future growth. Overall, we couldn't be more proud of our Q1 results and continued progress.\n Having delivered over $581 million of adjusted net revenue and $144 million of adjusted EBITDA, we continue to make great progress against our long-term objectives in the quarter and remain very well capitalized to achieve our vision of making SoFi the one-stop shop for digital financial services.\n With that, let's begin the Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Hecht of Jefferies. \nJohn Hecht: Chris, you gave some of the metrics in the personal lending book on charge-offs and so forth. I'm wondering, what you're looking at, at this point in terms of payment trends and kind of the underwriting factors that informs your credit outlook? And maybe if you could give us your thoughts on that as well. \nChris Lapointe: Sure. I'll start and then Anthony can chime in. So we feel really good about our credit and the underlying performance of our loans, and everything is performing in line with expectations, while we continue to see the underlying signs of improvement.\n In Q1, our net charge-off rate was 3.45%, which was down from 4.0% in Q4, which included the impact of asset sales, new originations as well as the delinquency sale that we did in the quarter.\n In terms of our outlook, we anticipate ongoing normalization in credit performance towards pre-pandemic levels of 7% to 8% life of loan losses, which is in line with what we said last quarter.\n Historically, life of loan losses could reasonably be approximated by the weighted average life of the portfolio, multiplied by a given quarter's annualized net charge-offs. However, while our life of loan loss trends and our outlook are unchanged, the relationship to any given quarter's NCOs has changed.\n In fact, what we're now seeing, particularly with how recent vintages are playing out, is a more rapid factoring down of loan principal, as a result of increasing prepayment rates and demand for shorter-term loans.\n What that means is that we're starting to see a greater proportion of losses happening sooner. And as a result, we're seeing an outsized impact on NCO rates that are not directly correlated to the life of loan losses when applying the normal 1.5x weighted average life to them.\n In other words, for any specific recent vintage, you can expect to see losses lower in the latter stages than before and higher in the earlier stages. However, our life of loan losses will remain in line with our 7% to 8% outlook.\n What gives us confidence in that 7% to 8% outlook is that we have a decade of experience of underwriting high-quality credit, and as we've been talking about for quite some time, optimizing the credit profile of those we underwrite to is part of our DNA.\n We underwrite to cash flow. We have very robust analytics, detailed vintage-based models and forecasts, which are managed by our second line of defense. And all of our outlooks are data-driven, resulting in the strong performance and outcomes that we've been able to achieve.\n Now when looking at some of the specific numbers and trends that we're observing today, we've seen a material improvement in performance since we started tightening credit in mid-2022.\n When looking at recent vintages and their loss rates at comparable points in time to our Q3 2022 vintage, we've observed the following: in Q1 -- our Q1 2023 cumulative vintage losses through 12 months of being on the books was approximately 20% better than the Q3 2022 vintage over that same period of time, 12 months of being on the books.\n If you look at our Q2 2023 cumulative vintage losses through 9 months of being on the books, that was also 20% better than the Q3 (sic) [ Q2 ] 2022 vintage over the same period of time. And then finally, our Q3 2023 cumulative vintage losses through 6 months of being on the books was nearly 40% better than the Q3 2022 vintage over the same period of time.\n So putting it all together, the performance improvement that we've observed in recent vintages, coupled with the short duration nature of the assets and the remaining principal on older and newer vintages prior to making credit cuts gives us a very high degree of confidence in our 7% to 8% life of loan loss outlook. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark DeVries of Deutsche Bank. \nMark DeVries: Yes. I was curious whether just kind of given where you are now with the equity capital levels whether you feel you have enough sources to support future growth? Or do you potentially see yourself having to raise additional outside equity? \nAnthony Noto: Thanks for the question. We had significant excess capital prior to the transactions that occurred in the quarter. Our risk-based capital level was -- over 15%. It's now over 17%, well, well, well above our regulatory department. And given our outlook on lending, there's no reason for us to change our stance in that business.\n We have -- we went into 2024 with a view that our growth would be driven by the combined impact of Tech Platform and Financial Services business. Those businesses are now big enough in terms of total scale and profitable enough. I would put our resources behind them, still grow as we did this quarter over 26% year-over-year, while the lending business was essentially flat year-over-year.\n So our decision to make that transition in 2024, wasn't driven by capital. We had excess capital and could grow it much faster. We have even more excess capital now, but our stance hasn't changed because that wasn't the reason for keeping it relatively conservative. We feel great about the trends in Tech Platform and Financial Services. I think it's quite remarkable, the growth rate that we're achieving there and the level of profitability.\n If you had asked me 6 years ago, could we deliver in the first quarter of 2024, a 25% revenue growth, 25% EBITDA margin, growth in tangible book about 16% sequentially in addition to record deposits and strong member growth of 44%, with lending being flat, I would have said not a chance.\n So it's a real testament to the diversification of our business and the optionality we have to drive growth in different environments. But we started in October, talking about higher for longer. And while the market and different government officials let people to believe there'd be 6 rate cuts at one point. Now we're down to 1 to 2 rate cuts. We think we took the appropriate stance, and we're well positioned to play where the economy goes in 2024. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Dolev of Mizuho. \nDan Dolev: Really strong results, congrats. I have a question about the NIM. Really stable NIM trends. Can you, Chris comment on the future NIM trends, how you're seeing them? I would appreciate it. \nChris Lapointe: Sure. Thanks, Dan. So yes, we've been very successful in maintaining healthy net interest margins and continuing to expand them over time. In Q1, our net interest margin was 5.9%, which was up 43 basis points year-over-year. And more importantly, what we've seen is year-over-year net interest margin expansion in every single quarter throughout 2022 and 2023.\n Our ability to constantly expand NIM was a function of maintaining loan pricing betas that are above 100% in a rising rate environment, scaling our high-quality deposits and maintaining betas below 100% in a rising rate environment for our loans business, as well as capital structure optimization moves that provide us with a lower cost of funding.\n We do expect to maintain healthy margins for the foreseeable future, breaking it down between the asset side and the liability side. On the asset side of the equation, in a higher for longer rate environment, we do expect to maintain strong yields north of 9%, which is consistent with what we've observed over the course of the last several quarters, even in light of seeing a mix shift away from personal loans on the balance sheet.\n And then on the liability side, we expect to be able to maintain a healthy cost of funding even while maintaining a highly competitive APY on our SoFi Money product. That's a function of a few things. First, we recently issued $862.5 million of convertible notes at a rate of 1.25%, which was used to displace much higher cost of funding.\n Second, we still have room to fund more of our balance sheet with lower cost deposits. We have $2.6 billion of higher cost brokered CDs, $800 million of warehouse lines that are outstanding and about $500 million of a corporate revolver outstanding.\n So net-net, we're really confident in being able to maintain net interest margins above 5% for the foreseeable future. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Kyle Peterson of Needham & Company. \nKyle Peterson: Great. Just wanted to dive a bit more into deposit growth and pricing, obviously been really strong growth on that front. But if you could give a little more detail, specially on deposit betas and what the biggest drivers of growth will be -- particularly if we are in a higher for longer environment, that would be great? \nAnthony Noto: Yes. Chris can comment on the betas. What I'd say is we raised our '24 revenue outlook in terms of the range by more than we'd be in Q1. That's because of the positive tailwinds we're seeing in both Tech Platform as well as Financial Services. We had record growth in deposits in Q1 of $3 billion. We've seen really strong debit spending trends. We're annualizing more than $8 billion now.\n So that will definitely continue to have a tailwind. We're uniquely positioned to be able to provide an attractive APY on the deposit business. Given the fact that we're an originator, and we can match up what we're lending at versus what we're paying out from a depository standpoint.\n In addition to that, we've really seen strong trends from the existing customers for the Tech Platform business. In addition to uptake of new products such as payment risk platform as well as the Konecta chatbot product. So we feel good about the largest components of our revenue going to the back half of the year.\n And then we have the additional contributions from businesses like SoFi Invest as well as our Credit Card business and efforts that we had with Lantern and small, medium business lead generation. Those are all contributing smaller dollar amounts, but moving quite strongly in a direction of continuing tailwind as well. \nChris Lapointe: And then from a beta perspective, we ended up exiting the quarter with $21.6 billion of deposits. That was up $3 billion quarter-over-quarter with more than 90% of the deposits coming from direct deposit members.\n We ended up launching the Checking and Savings product back in February of 2022 with an APY of 1%. And then at the end of Q1, our APY is 4.6%. So our overall beta over the course of time that has been in the 65% to 70% range. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Reggie Smith of JPMorgan. \nReginald Smith: I wanted to kind of dig into the Financial Services segment a little bit. One of the disclosures you guys given in the press release is the FICO score of some of your new depositors. I guess my question is, what's your appetite for really growing the Credit Card business. And maybe talk about like what that looks like ultimately growing that?\n And then my second question, which is related to Financial Services is at what point would, I guess, interest from Credit Card outweigh maybe some of the transfer pricing that you get it from the lending segment. Is that an ultimate goal where that business is driven more by the actual lending of the Credit Card business? If that makes sense. \nAnthony Noto: We're really excited about where we are with Credit Card. We've had a great journey in launching a credit card, learning quite a bit about our go-to-market strategy, how we're marketing and targeting potential new members with credit card in addition to understanding the underlying credit trends and what the right credit model is, in addition to other factors like fraud and risk overall.\n We've brought in significant subject matter expertise in the Credit Card business that have actually built new prime cards in the past. Our product remains a prime product that will continue to be a prime product. But we felt like coming out of 2023, that we had the learnings that allow us to be more aggressive in 2024 in that business as things unfold. So expect us to invest more in the business and see some good innovation in the back half of the year, based on the learnings that we've had for the last 3 years.\n It's a great product. It has a high ROE product, but there is a J curve that you have to go through. I think one of the things that may often be missed by the broader investment community is that now we have 8.1 million members, we can market our credit card to known members with known credit profiles, known spending capabilities, cash flow, capacity, et cetera.\n And so we're at that point now where we would really like to put more resources behind the strides that we think is really working in our benefit as it relates to the interest rate and the relationship to the rest of our funding costs and what presents to that. \nChris Lapointe: Yes. So right now, this is a super high ROE business. And in terms of the mix shift towards the lending product. We still have significant low cost of funding, but through our deposit base, and as Anthony mentioned, we're going to start scaling this business more rapidly. We had started to see some good green shoots in terms of early-stage delinquencies and losses that are performing materially better than historical vintages, so we can start investing more heavily in this business. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Christiansen of Citigroup. \nPeter Christiansen: Great to be on the call. I'm curious about network fees in the Financial Services segment, which were down quarter over quarter. I'm just -- I think the expectation there was that they would rise sequentially. Just if you can give a little bit of color there. \nChris Lapointe: Yes, absolutely. So we are seeing really good spend behavior. We had about $1.9 billion of overall spend in the quarter. That was up from $1.5 billion in Q4 and $1.2 billion in Q3 of last year. We did benefit from a small onetime benefit from a partner on the network fee side. But what you can expect going forward is relatively linear growth with spend behavior over the course of 2024. So there was a one-timer in Q4 that made for a tough comp, but going forward, you can think of linear growth or relative to spend. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Adelson of Morgan Stanley. \nJeffrey Adelson: Chris, maybe just to circle back on the improvement in the charge-off rate for personal loans. Seems like we saw a 15% sequential decline there, sort of in line with the comments you've made about the 15% of credits coming out of the system over the last quarter and in this quarter.\n How long should we maybe expect that to persist? I know you're still talking about the charge-off rates normalizing towards your life of loan targets. Just kind of curious how that short-term dynamic might play out?\n And then I guess the comments on keeping your excess capital this year in light of the macro uncertainty. Are you hearing anything from your regulators on there about any sort of buffer you might need to keep? Have you tried to run an excess capital drawdown scenario from an internal stress test? Or have you ever tried to size that. Just kind of curious because it seems like the macro uncertainty is a bit at odds with what we're hearing from other lenders, which are pointing to a little bit more of a stable to improving macro. Just trying to understand why maybe you wouldn't lean in a little bit more on the personal loan side here. \nChris Lapointe: Yes, sure. I'll take some of the losses. Anthony can hit on some of the excess capital. On the losses front, we did see a decline in net charge-offs, but what's important is the net charge-off rate is a function of a number of factors. It's originations in the period, it's pay downs. It's a term of the loans that we're underwriting to.\n We did benefit in this period from the late-stage delinquency sale that we did, which helped drive the overall losses down sequentially. What I would guide you to is that 7% to 8% life of loan loss outlook, which we feel extremely confident in given some of the loss trends and delinquency trends that we're seeing in our more recent 2023 vintages on the excess capital point. \nAnthony Noto: Yes. So what I'd say is we 100% have the option to drive the lending business faster if we'd like. We do stress tests, as you would imagine internally and externally for others across the entire ecosystem, which we operate. And starting the year at the risk-based capital that we had at 15% -- with stress test gave us ample opportunity to invest in that business at a rate that we wanted to.\n I would say our outlook for the lending business is more reflective of the uncertainty as opposed to whether or not there are great trends. As you see in our lending business is actually performing quite well. We're driving great returns there, good steady credit performance as expected.\n It's not that we're expecting a huge drop off the cliff or huge deterioration. It's that we've gone from in the last 6 months, the market anticipating 6 rate cuts as you got into the sort of October time period to then now, we're down to 1 to 2 rate cuts. And prior to the 6 rate cuts, people were talking about higher for longer in October. And so there's been a complete swing of the interest rate environment.\n As you just saw in the banking industry, that creates liquidity issues for different banks. We're concerned about others not being able to manage the liquidity issues. Last year, at this time, we were experiencing First Republic going under that was not anticipated.\n I don't know what's around the next quarter. I do know that we have a great member base. We have excess capital well above we started the year with at 17%. So we have the option to grow the business much faster we choose to.\n And one of the things we haven't talked about is we're now selling a significant amount of loans. We sold 1.9 billion of loans in the quarter. That demand remains strong. And so to the extent that, that demand continues to increase and remain strong, and the environment remains sort of stable and more predictable.\n Could we be more aggressive in the lending business? 100%. We have the capital. We have the go-to-market strategy. We have the flexibility on the balance sheet, and we have the opportunity to be able to do it. We're just taking a very conservative view to make sure; we don't go into an environment that we're completely unprepared for. Taking a conservative stance gives us the most optionality to do work, but not necessarily have to do less. \nChris Lapointe: Yes. And the only other thing I would add to quantify some of those numbers in terms of our overall capacity is that we have more than $20 billion in capacity to originate loans. And even though we're -- even if we were to originate at that level, we would remain well above all regulatory minimums.\n In terms of what's driving the overall $20 billion; first, we expect to generate $800 million to $1 billion of tangible book value in 2024, which translates to about $6.5 billion to $8 billion of incremental capacity; second, loans are amortizing or paying down at the annual rate of $9.5 billion; third, we have our previously announced $2 billion forward flow agreement in addition to a number of on-the-run transactions that we're doing in the capital markets front. Demand is extremely strong. We did $1.9 billion of sales this past quarter.\n And then lastly, we have incremental headroom in our overall capital ratio. So having said that, we have sufficient capacity, but we are taking a conservative approach. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Mihir Bhatia of Bank of America. \nMihir Bhatia: I wanted to switch to the Tech Segment for a second. You had 20% account growth this quarter. I was wondering if you could comment on a couple of things there. One is, can you just comment on what's driving that? Maybe talk about some of the key customers you may be added in the quarter.\n Also just curious if you could provide some examples of the larger clients you have won since transitioning the sales strategy to focus on these large clients? And then just relatively on the segment, margins improved nicely. Just -- and I think you've talked about this being a margin expansion year. But can you just comment on the margin trajectory from here? \nAnthony Noto: Yes. In terms of the Tech Platform, we saw good consistent trends there. The Tech Platform grew 21%, which was an acceleration and year-over-year growth compared to Q4 and Q3 and Q4 also accelerated. We expect the trends there to continue. We have a really sizable client base with growing of underlying users in that client base in addition to driving additional product attachments to our existing clients. We're also seeing a greater contribution from new clients over the last 9 months.\n As it relates to the broader macro environment for Technology Platform segment, the demand interest in using our technology platform, our modern Gen 3 core as well as our API-based payment platform, issuing platform is as high as it's ever been. And we continue to sign up new partners. I'd say those new partners fall into a couple of buckets. We are converting people from other competitive processing sites to Galileo. In addition to that, there's a lot of demand still from partners that haven't historically used an issuing platform or processing platform like Galileo that are transitioning to that platform from a sector standpoint.\n 1and then in the large fund institutions, the demand for modern cores and processing continues to be really robust. The timing on those deals is really driven by those end customers. We haven't lost any of the RFPs. We've continued to be down selected as big [ process ] institutions go from a large RFP to a few select partners. So we feel good about our chances there.\n We're not expecting to win 100% of those deals, but we feel like we can win our fair share. Those deals will take longer to not only sign up, but to also implement. And so the contribution for that is quarters, not months, after they're announced, but we feel great about the current trends there, and that's why the acceleration happened in the quarter.\n Q2 is a seasonally weaker quarter for the Technology Platform business, but the year-over-year growth rates what people should focus on because that eliminates the impact of seasonality and that accelerated. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Terry Ma of Barclays. \nTerry Ma: I just wanted to dig a little bit more on the late-stage personal loan -- delinquency personal loan sales. Can you maybe just talk about the structure and execution around that and whether or not you plan on selling more? \nChris Lapointe: Yes, absolutely. So in Q1, we ended up selling $62.5 million of late-stage delinquent personal loans in the quarter. Typically, we do not sell delinquent loans until they are charged off, but we were able to generate an opportunity where we're able to generate positive value relative to letting the loans charge off and sell after the fact.\n So typically, how it works at a high level is we would normally let a loan charge-off, and then sell and release servicing to a debt settlement company or another investor for low double-digit pennies on the dollar. In this late-stage delinquency sales structure, we were able to retain servicing and portions of the recovery, which will result in nearly double the returns, we would have otherwise been able to achieve. \nOperator: Our final question comes from Jill Shea of UBS. \nJill Glaser Shea: So I just wanted to touch on operating expenses. And just wondering if you could highlight any opportunities there, and the largest efficiency gain areas? And then also, how does continued brand awareness improvement impact your sales and marketing spend? \nChris Lapointe: Yes. So I'll hit on some of the operating expense lines. I'll let Anthony hit on the brand awareness.\n But overall, we saw a meaningful improvements across all functional expense line items. Sales and marketing, specifically, was down about 900 basis points year-over-year as a result of obviously improvements in overall brand awareness, continued and elevated cross buy. We're close to 40% of all new products that were taken out in the period, but were coming from existing members on the platform. And then we're just getting much more efficient at being able to market.\n In terms of other efficiencies, we continue to see efficiencies in R&D as a result of the migration from being on-prem to the cloud in our Tech Platform business, as well as other investments that we've made over the course of the years that are starting to play out.\n On the operations side, we're seeing meaningful leverage as a result of some of the automation efforts that we've invested in over the course of the last 24 months, which, again, are starting to play out as we're seeing better funnel conversion and improvement.\n And then in G&A, as you would expect, there's meaningful operating leverage in the system as we continue to scale. We made significant investments as we became a public company and got our bank charter, and also invested heavily in risk in second and third lines of defense, and as those investments were made over the course of the last 12 to 24 months at scale.\n I'll turn it over to Anthony to hit on the brand piece. \nAnthony Noto: Yes. On the brand awareness side, we're really pleased with just the continued improvement we have in unaided brand awareness. Our marketing team and our businesses have done a great job of putting together a very integrated multimedia strategy that leverages partnerships with big well-known brands that help us achieve brand unaided awareness to become a household brand name.\n That helps improve our overall performance marketing as well. The more people that know us, the more people that trust us, the better reaction we get from every offer we have in the marketplace or other ways that we connect with potential new members in addition to building their awareness of new products beyond their initial product.\n Our cross-buying continues to remain really strong. We're seeing good financial service productivity leverage in our customer acquisition costs. So it's been a great year and 2024 is off to a great start as it relates to the impact on our unaided brand awareness from things like our recent partnership with the NBA as the official bank of the National Basketball Association. \nChris Lapointe: With that, let me add some concluding remarks. I want to thank everyone for joining us today. We're proud to kick off 2024 with an exceptionally strong first quarter. Our 26% revenue growth driven by 54% growth in revenue from the combined Tech Platform and Financial Services, which now constitutes 42% of revenue, while no growth in lending gives us a very strong outlook for the year, with 25% EBITDA margins in the quarter and for the full year, record $3 billion of deposit growth and 16% growth in tangible book value and 44% growth in members, now totaling 8.1 million in total are a great testament to the success of our bold strategy and ability to execute across an unprecedented set of financial conditions over the last 6 years.\n Although we live in an unpredictable world, our team at SoFi is resolved to serve the needs of more than 8 million members and clients, while sustaining the growth, profitability and increase in the shareholder value that we've done so far. We thank you for your interest and look forward to talking to you next quarter. \nPaulina Gutierrez: Goodbye. \nOperator: This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Chris Lapointe",
            "content": "Thanks, Anthony. The first quarter demonstrates strong evidence of how our increasingly diversified and differentiated business model drive SoFi's durability and long-term growth potential. I'm going to walk through key financial highlights and our financial outlook. Unless otherwise stated, I'll be referring to adjusted results for the first quarter of 2024 versus first quarter of 2023. Our GAAP consolidated income statement and all reconciliations can be found in today's earnings release, and the subsequent 10-Q filing, which will be made available next month.\n For the quarter, we delivered adjusted net revenue of $581 million, with growth of 26% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $144 million at a 25% margin. This represented over 8 points of year-over-year margin improvement, demonstrating significant operating leverage across all functional expense lines.\n In fact, sales and marketing declined as a percentage of adjusted net revenue by 9 points relative to the year ago quarter, while total noninterest operating expenses declined 16 points year-over-year.\n We delivered our second quarter of GAAP profitability with GAAP net income reaching $88 million, a $122 million improvement year-over-year. Net income included the benefit of a $59 million net gain associated with the exchange of a portion of our 2026 convertible notes at a discount for equity during the quarter. We reported GAAP diluted EPS of $0.02, which was not impacted by the gain from the convertible note exchange.\n Now on to the segment level performance. Starting with Financial Services, where net revenue of $151 million increased 86% year-over-year with new all-time high revenue for SoFi Money and Lending as a Service, as well as continued contributions from SoFi Invest and Credit Card.\n Overall monetization continues to improve with annualized revenue per product of $59, up 31% year-over-year versus $45 in Q1 2023. This is driven by higher deposits and member spending levels in SoFi Money, greater AUM and monetizable features in SoFi Invest and robust growth within SoFi Credit Card spend.\n Net interest income increased 106% year-over-year, primarily driven by $11.5 billion growth in deposits year-over-year. Our noninterest income increased 34% year-over-year, primarily driven by 2 factors: interchange, which grew 65% year-over-year based on over $7.5 billion in annualized spend and referrals from our Lending as a Service product, which grew 32% versus the prior year period.\n Contribution profit reached $37 million at a 25% margin for the quarter, even as we continue to invest to rapidly grow this segment. Despite our invest in credit card businesses collectively losing nearly $100 million on an annualized basis, we still achieved strong margins.\n Lastly, we reached 10.1 million Financial Services products in the quarter, which is up 42% year-over-year, with 919,000 new products in the quarter. We reached nearly 3.9 million products in SoFi Money, 2.2 million in SoFi Invest and 3.6 million in Relay.\n Shifting to our Tech Platform, where we delivered net revenue of $94 million in the quarter, up 21% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. Annual revenue growth was driven by strong performance from new clients onboarded over the last 9 months, large bank deals signed in Latin America and strong monetization of existing clients launching new products on our platform.\n Galileo accounts grew 20% year-over-year to $151 million. The segment delivered a contribution profit of $31 million, representing a 33% margin. We continue to leverage investments made in the segment as we continue to position Tech Platform for higher rates of diversified, durable growth going forward. We expect Tech Platform revenue to accelerate in 2024 with strong margins.\n Turning to lending. First quarter adjusted net revenue remained flat year-over-year at $325 million, with $208 million of contribution profit at a 64% margin versus $210 million a year ago. These results were driven by a 33% year-over-year growth in our net interest income, while noninterest income was down by 53%.\n Growth in net interest income was driven by a 59% year-over-year increase in average interest-earning assets and a 114 basis point year-over-year increase in average yields. This resulted in an average net interest margin of 5.91% for the quarter, up 43 basis points year-over-year.\n I'd also highlight our $3 billion of deposit growth in the quarter compared to the $242 million of net loan growth on the balance sheet. This has allowed us to continue to reduce our reliance on outside warehouse funding, which is 226 basis points more expensive than our deposits.\n As a result, we've reduced our warehouse utilization this quarter by $2.4 billion. The 226 basis points of cost savings between our deposits and our warehouse facilities continues to support our net interest margin and translates to nearly $500 million of annualized interest expense savings at our current deposit base.\n It also underscores the benefits of having the option of holding loans on balance sheet when advantageous and collecting net interest income. We expect to maintain a healthy net interest margin above 5% for the foreseeable future and benefit from the continued mix towards deposit funding, along with our ability to sustain healthy deposit versus lending betas.\n On the noninterest income side, Q1 originations grew 22% year-over-year to $4.4 billion and were driven by growth across our personal, student and home loan products. Personal loan originations growth slowed to 11% year-over-year and 2% sequentially to $3.3 billion, which was anticipated and in line with our more conservative approach given macro uncertainty.\n Our student loans business saw origination volume grow 43% year-over-year, with a slight 5% decline sequentially to $752 million. Home loans grew by over 270% year-over-year and 9% sequentially to $336 million. Our personal loan borrowers weighted average income is $169,000, with a weighted average FICO score of 746. Our student loan borrowers weighted average income is $146,000, with a weighted average FICO of 768.\n In the first quarter, we sold portions of our personal loan, student loan and home loan portfolios totaling over $1.9 billion. That comprises approximately $1.26 billion in personal loan principal, $300 million in student loan principal and nearly $350 million in home loan principal.\n In terms of personal loan sales, we closed $500 million of loans in whole loan form and $700 million in ABS at a blended execution of 105.7%. These had similar structures to other recent personal loan sales, with cash proceeds at par or at a small premium to par, and the majority of the premium consisted of contractual servicing fees that are capitalized.\n These deals included a small loss share provision that is above our base assumption of losses and immaterial relative to the exposure we would otherwise have if we held the loans. As a result of the personal loan sales in the quarter, the quantity of personal loans on our balance sheet declined sequentially despite growth in originations.\n Additionally, we sold $62.5 million of late-stage delinquent personal loans principal in the quarter. Typically, we do not sell delinquent loans until they are charged off, but we were able to generate positive value generated from both recovery and servicing value relative to letting the loans charge off and sell after the fact.\n As discussed during Q4 results, roughly 15% of our losses came from credit tiers that we ceased originating several quarters earlier, which represented 3% of unpaid principal balance. We were, therefore, able to reduce exposure to those credit tiers, as the loans run off and become a much smaller portion of overall unpaid principal balance.\n In addition, we continue to make adjustments to our credit underwriting model in line with the internal and external indicators underlying are our report card.\n Moving to our student loan sales. we closed $294 million of loans in whole loan form and execution of 104.9%. This sale had no accompanying loss share provision nor a senior secured financing option.\n Finally, our $344 million of home loan sales were sold at a blended execution of 100.9%. Also in the quarter, we executed $399 million of senior secured financing, which will show up on our detailed balance sheet as senior secured loans held for investment at amortized costs. These loans have a fixed term structure and are secured against the underlying assets, therefore, equivalent to the investment-grade bonds, if we were to do a securitization for the same pool of collateral.\n In addition, these loans are priced at market rates, which not only helps to diversify our balance sheet, but also provides an additional return above our cost of funding and a yield similar to the net interest margin of our loans, which are unsecured.\n Turning to credit performance. Our on-balance sheet 90-day student loan delinquency rate was 13 basis points, while our annualized student loan charge-off rate was 60 basis points. Our Q1 on-balance sheet 90-day personal loan delinquency rate was 72 basis points.\n Our annualized personal loan charge-off rate decreased to 3.45% from 4.02% in Q4, including the impact of asset sales, new originations and the delinquency sale in the quarter. We anticipate ongoing normalization in credit performance toward pre-pandemic levels of 7% to 8% life of loan losses.\n Now turning to our fair value marks and key assumptions. Our personal loans are marked at 104.2% as of quarter end, down from 104.9% at the end of Q4 and well below the 105.7% blended execution achieved on the $1.2 billion in personal loan sales.\n The lower personal loan mark was primarily a function of the discount rate increasing by approximately 30 basis points to 5.8%. This was driven by the underlying benchmark rate increasing by approximately 50 basis points and spreads tightening by 20 basis points, in line with industry trends. Importantly, the benchmark rate change and the spread change are empirical as they are actual market observed inputs, not assumptions.\n In addition, the mark was negatively impacted by the annual default rate increasing by 9 basis points to 4.85%, and the annual prepayment fees increasing by 150 basis points to 24.7%, which has an immaterial impact on the overall change in the mark.\n When a borrower prepays, we are still capturing the principal and the impact to the value of the asset is only based on the premium above par at a given point in time, which is very small relative to the principal outstanding.\n The weighted average coupon on the personal loan portfolio remained unchanged at 13.8%. For our student loan portfolio, the fair value mark remained unchanged at 103.8% at quarter end. In terms of the inputs, our weighted average coupon remained flat at 5.6%, annual losses remained flat at 60 basis points, prepayments increased by 8 basis points to 10.5%, and the discount rate remained unchanged at 4.3%.\n As mentioned previously, we sold $294 million of student loan collateral in the quarter. Had we not sold those assets, the student loan discount rate would have increased by a similar magnitude as our personal loans business.\n Switching to our balance sheet, where we remain very well capitalized with ample cash and liquidity. Assets grew by $1.2 billion, largely as a result of $242 million growth in loans and approximately $803 million growth in cash, cash equivalents and investment securities.\n On the liability side, deposits grew by $3 billion sequentially to nearly $22 billion. As mentioned earlier, we reduced our reliance on warehouse facilities through our robust deposit growth and exited the quarter with approximately $800 million of warehouse debt drawn.\n In Q1, we opportunistically executed 2 transactions in order to optimize our financing structure and bolster our capital capacity. First, we issued $862.5 million in convertible notes due in 2029 at a 1.25% coupon. The net proceeds are being used to replace higher cost financing, including the redemption of the $320 million of outstanding Series 1 preferred stock that carries an annual dividend of 12.5%, which was set to increase to over 15% in late May.\n In total, this new convertible issuance should reduce our financing expense by $40 million to $60 million per year, including cost-saving opportunities with the remaining proceeds.\n Second, we agreed to an exchange of $600 million principal of our convertible notes due in 2026 for shares of SoFi common stock. This was a notable discount compared to what we would have had to pay in 2 years. This transaction generated a gain of $59 million for us in the quarter, while notably reducing our 2026 maturities and bolstering our funding capacity.\n When viewed in total, these transactions are accretive to book value and net income, and have minimal impact on a fully diluted EPS basis. In terms of our regulatory capital ratios, our total capital ratio of 17.3%, improved by 200 basis points from 15.3% last quarter due in large part to these transactions and remains comfortably above the regulatory minimum of 10.5%.\n While we don't intend to utilize the excess capital capacity in the year, given our view of the macro uncertainty, these transactions put us in an even stronger position for years to come.\n Lastly, we grew book value to $6.1 billion and tangible book value to $4.1 billion. We recorded tangible book value per share at $3.92, up 16% quarter-over-quarter.\n Now moving on to our updated guidance. Throughout the last 12 months, we have demonstrated the benefit of having a diversified high growth set of revenue streams, multiple cost-efficient sources of capital, our continued key focus on underwriting high-quality credit and a high degree of operating leverage as we scale the business. We expect those benefits to persist going forward even in light of the existing macro backdrop. \n 2024 remains a transitional year for SoFi, as the Tech Platform and Financial Services segments together will drive our growth and increase from 38% of total adjusted net revenue in 2023 to approximately 50% for all of 2024.\n For the full year 2024, we now expect to deliver adjusted net revenue of $2.39 billion to $2.43 billion, which is $25 million higher than our implied prior guidance range of $2.365 billion to $2.405 billion. This guidance assumes lending revenue will be 92% to 95% of 2023 levels, which is unchanged from prior guidance and Tech Platform will grow approximately 20% year-over-year, which is also unchanged.\n We expect the Financial Services segment revenue to grow more than 75% year-over-year. We now expect adjusted EBITDA of $590 million to $600 million, above our prior guidance of $580 million to $590 million, and that incorporates increased investment into more product innovation, new businesses, services and member benefits. This represents 15% to 17% adjusted net revenue growth and a 25% adjusted EBITDA margin.\n We now expect full year GAAP net income of $165 million to $175 million, above prior guidance of $95 million to $105 million, which includes a $59 million gain associated with the convertible note exchange. We expect fully diluted GAAP EPS of $0.08 to $0.09 per share above prior guidance of $0.07 to $0.08 per share.\n We now expect growth in tangible book value of approximately $800 million to $1 billion for the year versus our previous guidance of $300 million to $500 million, given the benefits of the recent convertible debt exchange, along with the effects of new convertible issuance. We now expect to end the year, with a total capital ratio of north of 16% due to those transactions versus our previous guidance of 14%.\n We continue to expect to add at least 2.3 million new members in 2024, which represents 30% growth. For Q2, we expect to deliver adjusted net revenue of $555 million to $565 million, adjusted EBITDA of $115 million to $125 million, and net income of $5 million to $10 million.\n In terms of phasing, you can see for the past 2 years that the second quarter is seasonally flattish for lending, which coupled with our more conservative approach toward originations this year should drive a sequential decline in lending revenue, which largely offsets tailwinds in the 2 other segments.\n In terms of operating expenses, you can expect low single-digit sequential growth as we continue to invest in future growth. Overall, we couldn't be more proud of our Q1 results and continued progress.\n Having delivered over $581 million of adjusted net revenue and $144 million of adjusted EBITDA, we continue to make great progress against our long-term objectives in the quarter and remain very well capitalized to achieve our vision of making SoFi the one-stop shop for digital financial services.\n With that, let's begin the Q&A. Sure. I'll start and then Anthony can chime in. So we feel really good about our credit and the underlying performance of our loans, and everything is performing in line with expectations, while we continue to see the underlying signs of improvement.\n In Q1, our net charge-off rate was 3.45%, which was down from 4.0% in Q4, which included the impact of asset sales, new originations as well as the delinquency sale that we did in the quarter.\n In terms of our outlook, we anticipate ongoing normalization in credit performance towards pre-pandemic levels of 7% to 8% life of loan losses, which is in line with what we said last quarter.\n Historically, life of loan losses could reasonably be approximated by the weighted average life of the portfolio, multiplied by a given quarter's annualized net charge-offs. However, while our life of loan loss trends and our outlook are unchanged, the relationship to any given quarter's NCOs has changed.\n In fact, what we're now seeing, particularly with how recent vintages are playing out, is a more rapid factoring down of loan principal, as a result of increasing prepayment rates and demand for shorter-term loans.\n What that means is that we're starting to see a greater proportion of losses happening sooner. And as a result, we're seeing an outsized impact on NCO rates that are not directly correlated to the life of loan losses when applying the normal 1.5x weighted average life to them.\n In other words, for any specific recent vintage, you can expect to see losses lower in the latter stages than before and higher in the earlier stages. However, our life of loan losses will remain in line with our 7% to 8% outlook.\n What gives us confidence in that 7% to 8% outlook is that we have a decade of experience of underwriting high-quality credit, and as we've been talking about for quite some time, optimizing the credit profile of those we underwrite to is part of our DNA.\n We underwrite to cash flow. We have very robust analytics, detailed vintage-based models and forecasts, which are managed by our second line of defense. And all of our outlooks are data-driven, resulting in the strong performance and outcomes that we've been able to achieve.\n Now when looking at some of the specific numbers and trends that we're observing today, we've seen a material improvement in performance since we started tightening credit in mid-2022.\n When looking at recent vintages and their loss rates at comparable points in time to our Q3 2022 vintage, we've observed the following: in Q1 -- our Q1 2023 cumulative vintage losses through 12 months of being on the books was approximately 20% better than the Q3 2022 vintage over that same period of time, 12 months of being on the books.\n If you look at our Q2 2023 cumulative vintage losses through 9 months of being on the books, that was also 20% better than the Q3 (sic) [ Q2 ] 2022 vintage over the same period of time. And then finally, our Q3 2023 cumulative vintage losses through 6 months of being on the books was nearly 40% better than the Q3 2022 vintage over the same period of time.\n So putting it all together, the performance improvement that we've observed in recent vintages, coupled with the short duration nature of the assets and the remaining principal on older and newer vintages prior to making credit cuts gives us a very high degree of confidence in our 7% to 8% life of loan loss outlook. Sure. Thanks, Dan. So yes, we've been very successful in maintaining healthy net interest margins and continuing to expand them over time. In Q1, our net interest margin was 5.9%, which was up 43 basis points year-over-year. And more importantly, what we've seen is year-over-year net interest margin expansion in every single quarter throughout 2022 and 2023.\n Our ability to constantly expand NIM was a function of maintaining loan pricing betas that are above 100% in a rising rate environment, scaling our high-quality deposits and maintaining betas below 100% in a rising rate environment for our loans business, as well as capital structure optimization moves that provide us with a lower cost of funding.\n We do expect to maintain healthy margins for the foreseeable future, breaking it down between the asset side and the liability side. On the asset side of the equation, in a higher for longer rate environment, we do expect to maintain strong yields north of 9%, which is consistent with what we've observed over the course of the last several quarters, even in light of seeing a mix shift away from personal loans on the balance sheet.\n And then on the liability side, we expect to be able to maintain a healthy cost of funding even while maintaining a highly competitive APY on our SoFi Money product. That's a function of a few things. First, we recently issued $862.5 million of convertible notes at a rate of 1.25%, which was used to displace much higher cost of funding.\n Second, we still have room to fund more of our balance sheet with lower cost deposits. We have $2.6 billion of higher cost brokered CDs, $800 million of warehouse lines that are outstanding and about $500 million of a corporate revolver outstanding.\n So net-net, we're really confident in being able to maintain net interest margins above 5% for the foreseeable future. And then from a beta perspective, we ended up exiting the quarter with $21.6 billion of deposits. That was up $3 billion quarter-over-quarter with more than 90% of the deposits coming from direct deposit members.\n We ended up launching the Checking and Savings product back in February of 2022 with an APY of 1%. And then at the end of Q1, our APY is 4.6%. So our overall beta over the course of time that has been in the 65% to 70% range. Yes. So right now, this is a super high ROE business. And in terms of the mix shift towards the lending product. We still have significant low cost of funding, but through our deposit base, and as Anthony mentioned, we're going to start scaling this business more rapidly. We had started to see some good green shoots in terms of early-stage delinquencies and losses that are performing materially better than historical vintages, so we can start investing more heavily in this business. Yes, absolutely. So we are seeing really good spend behavior. We had about $1.9 billion of overall spend in the quarter. That was up from $1.5 billion in Q4 and $1.2 billion in Q3 of last year. We did benefit from a small onetime benefit from a partner on the network fee side. But what you can expect going forward is relatively linear growth with spend behavior over the course of 2024. So there was a one-timer in Q4 that made for a tough comp, but going forward, you can think of linear growth or relative to spend. Yes, sure. I'll take some of the losses. Anthony can hit on some of the excess capital. On the losses front, we did see a decline in net charge-offs, but what's important is the net charge-off rate is a function of a number of factors. It's originations in the period, it's pay downs. It's a term of the loans that we're underwriting to.\n We did benefit in this period from the late-stage delinquency sale that we did, which helped drive the overall losses down sequentially. What I would guide you to is that 7% to 8% life of loan loss outlook, which we feel extremely confident in given some of the loss trends and delinquency trends that we're seeing in our more recent 2023 vintages on the excess capital point. Yes. And the only other thing I would add to quantify some of those numbers in terms of our overall capacity is that we have more than $20 billion in capacity to originate loans. And even though we're -- even if we were to originate at that level, we would remain well above all regulatory minimums.\n In terms of what's driving the overall $20 billion; first, we expect to generate $800 million to $1 billion of tangible book value in 2024, which translates to about $6.5 billion to $8 billion of incremental capacity; second, loans are amortizing or paying down at the annual rate of $9.5 billion; third, we have our previously announced $2 billion forward flow agreement in addition to a number of on-the-run transactions that we're doing in the capital markets front. Demand is extremely strong. We did $1.9 billion of sales this past quarter.\n And then lastly, we have incremental headroom in our overall capital ratio. So having said that, we have sufficient capacity, but we are taking a conservative approach. Yes, absolutely. So in Q1, we ended up selling $62.5 million of late-stage delinquent personal loans in the quarter. Typically, we do not sell delinquent loans until they are charged off, but we were able to generate an opportunity where we're able to generate positive value relative to letting the loans charge off and sell after the fact.\n So typically, how it works at a high level is we would normally let a loan charge-off, and then sell and release servicing to a debt settlement company or another investor for low double-digit pennies on the dollar. In this late-stage delinquency sales structure, we were able to retain servicing and portions of the recovery, which will result in nearly double the returns, we would have otherwise been able to achieve. Yes. So I'll hit on some of the operating expense lines. I'll let Anthony hit on the brand awareness.\n But overall, we saw a meaningful improvements across all functional expense line items. Sales and marketing, specifically, was down about 900 basis points year-over-year as a result of obviously improvements in overall brand awareness, continued and elevated cross buy. We're close to 40% of all new products that were taken out in the period, but were coming from existing members on the platform. And then we're just getting much more efficient at being able to market.\n In terms of other efficiencies, we continue to see efficiencies in R&D as a result of the migration from being on-prem to the cloud in our Tech Platform business, as well as other investments that we've made over the course of the years that are starting to play out.\n On the operations side, we're seeing meaningful leverage as a result of some of the automation efforts that we've invested in over the course of the last 24 months, which, again, are starting to play out as we're seeing better funnel conversion and improvement.\n And then in G&A, as you would expect, there's meaningful operating leverage in the system as we continue to scale. We made significant investments as we became a public company and got our bank charter, and also invested heavily in risk in second and third lines of defense, and as those investments were made over the course of the last 12 to 24 months at scale.\n I'll turn it over to Anthony to hit on the brand piece. With that, let me add some concluding remarks. I want to thank everyone for joining us today. We're proud to kick off 2024 with an exceptionally strong first quarter. Our 26% revenue growth driven by 54% growth in revenue from the combined Tech Platform and Financial Services, which now constitutes 42% of revenue, while no growth in lending gives us a very strong outlook for the year, with 25% EBITDA margins in the quarter and for the full year, record $3 billion of deposit growth and 16% growth in tangible book value and 44% growth in members, now totaling 8.1 million in total are a great testament to the success of our bold strategy and ability to execute across an unprecedented set of financial conditions over the last 6 years.\n Although we live in an unpredictable world, our team at SoFi is resolved to serve the needs of more than 8 million members and clients, while sustaining the growth, profitability and increase in the shareholder value that we've done so far. We thank you for your interest and look forward to talking to you next quarter."

            "content": "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Q1 was another exceptionally strong quarter for SoFi. We continue to successfully execute on our strategy of making SoFi the one-stop shop for digital financial services. We expected that 2024 would be an important year of transition. Heading into this year, we had a conservative outlook given interest rate volatility, industry liquidity, inflation and macroeconomic environment concerns.\n We planned for continued strong growth from our financial services and technology platform segments up 50% year-over-year, offsetting our plan for lending to be 92% to 95% of 2023 revenue. And we set out to strengthen our balance sheet and capital ratios by continuing to grow our tangible book value. I'm proud to report that our team delivered across each of these fronts and more in the first quarter of 2024.\n First, we responsibly grew revenue, while further diversifying our business. We grew adjusted net revenue in Q1 to $581 million, up 26% year-over-year. This marks the 12th consecutive quarter of greater than 25% growth. We grew adjusted EBITDA to $144 million, up 91% year-over-year. This represents a 25% margin compared to 16% a year ago.\n I'm pleased to report that our Financial Services and Technology Platform segments make up a growing portion of our revenue quarter-over-quarter, contributing 42% of adjusted net revenue in Q1. This is up from 40% last quarter and 33% a year ago, and we remain on track to finish 2024 with our revenue mix near 50-50.\n Second, we posted GAAP net income of $88 million. This includes a $59 million onetime benefit from the recent exchange of convertible notes, which Chris will talk about more in a moment. After achieving our first quarter of GAAP profitability in Q4 2023, we committed to sustaining profitability for the full year of 2024, and we did so in Q1. We posted GAAP EPS of $0.02 per share, which excludes the benefit from the convertible note exchange.\n Third, we further reinforced our balance sheet for long-term growth. We grew tangible book value for the seventh consecutive quarter to $4.1 billion, an increase of $608 million from the prior quarter. Equally as important, our tangible book value per share now stands at $3.92, up 16% sequentially. We grew consumer deposits by a record of $3 billion and saw continued strong buying demands for our loans, selling over $1.9 billion of loans in Q1.\n SoFi Bank reported net income of $100 million with a 21% margin, and a return on tangible equity of 11.7%. Our total capital ratio for SoFi Technologies is now 17.3%, a 200 basis point improvement from last quarter and well above our 10.5% regulatory minimum.\n Finally, our broad product offering, enabling people to borrow, save, spend, invest and protect their money continues to attract more and more members to SoFi. In Q1, we grew our member base to 8.1 million, up 44% from the prior year, adding 622,000 new members in the quarter. Just as important, we continue to see members adopt more products and deepen the relationship with SoFi.\n We recorded 989,000 new product additions in the quarter, with 93% of those product adds coming in our Financial Services segment, a remarkable milestone considering it's been only 5 years since we launched our first non-lending products and 2 years since we launched SoFi Bank.\n This increasingly diverse product relationship with our members is what maximizes the power of the Financial Services productivity loop and allows us to leverage our unique structural economic advantage. Despite external unpredictability in the year ahead, I remain as confident as ever in SoFi's future. Our plan to sustain responsible growth and our ability to deliver meaningful value to our shareholders.\n Before handing it over to Chris to cover our financial highlights and share updated guidance, I wanted to give a quick peek under the hood on our segment level results. Starting with Financial Services. We continue to drive acquisition and monetization and importantly, rapidly expanding margins. We achieved record net revenue of $151 million in Q1, up 86% year-over-year and 8% from the prior quarter. Demonstrating the strong operating leverage in this segment, we generated this 86% growth with only an 8% increase in directly attributable expenses year-over-year.\n The overall Financial Services segment achieved $37 million in contribution profit at a 25% margin compared to a $24 million loss in the year ago quarter. That margin is up 7 points from last quarter and a full 22 points from our first quarter of segment profitability achieved in the third quarter of 2023.\n This progress is notable given our significant investment across our Money, Credit Card and Invest products. SoFi Money delivered strong growth, high-quality deposits and engagement, and higher average account balances even as spending increased. We grew to 3.9 million SoFi Money accounts, up 61% year-over-year with over 90% of our consumer deposits coming from direct deposit members.\n Our direct deposit members have a median FICO of 744 and over 50% of our newly funded SoFi Money account setup direct deposit by day 30, presenting ample opportunities for cross-buy into other SoFi products. As these members make SoFi Money their account of choice, spending follows with overall debit transaction volume, exceeding $1.9 billion in the quarter, up 20% from the prior quarter and over 150% year-over-year.\n Looking at our Credit Card and Invest products, we previously shared that these are our heaviest areas of investment in the Financial Services segment, with current losses of nearly $100 million annually on a run rate basis. However, through improved unit economics and scale, we expect that these products will eventually contribute profit similar to our progress with SoFi Money.\n Next, turning to our Technology Platform segment. Our consistent product development and successful shift in sales strategy has enabled us to diversify growth and pursue larger, more durable revenue opportunities. In Q1, we exceeded $94 million in revenue, representing 21% year-over-year growth versus 13% last quarter, in line with our guidance for accelerating growth. Our Tech Platform segment contribution margin was 33% compared to 32% last quarter and 19% a year ago.\n Demand from traditional financial institutions and clients in nonfinancial categories remain strong. While lead times for winning RFPs and integrations and time to revenue are measured in multiple quarters and years, not months, we're seeing the transition to modern processing and modern cores playing out as envisioned.\n We also made significant strides in product development in Q1. We enhanced our partnership with the Bancorp to offer real-time payments, improving the money movement hub, enabling multiple new use cases for B2C and B2B clients. We launched post-purchase buy now, pay later for banks and fintechs to deliver flexible financing solutions for debit and credit purchases.\n Galileo and SoFi Bank partnered to launch a small business financing card program with Rapid Finance. And importantly, we continue to make progress with our growing pipeline of new partners in the quarter.\n And finally, turning to lending. As we shared last quarter, we've taken a more conservative approach toward originations given our concerns around rate uncertainty and the broader macro climate. For Q1, adjusted net revenue of $325 million was flat year-over-year. Personal loan origination growth slowed to 11% year-over-year to $3.3 billion, in line with our more conservative approach. In fact, the balance of personal loans on our balance sheet declined 2% quarter-over-quarter.\n Student loan originations grew 43% year-over-year to $752 million and home loan originations increased 274% year-over-year to $336 million. A record 82% of the segment's adjusted net revenue was derived from net interest income compared to 76% last quarter and 62% in the year ago quarter. This is a direct benefit of our bank charter and our ability to hold loans longer when advantageous.\n The percent of adjusted lending revenue from net interest income has more than doubled since we launched the bank 2 years ago. Together, these efforts contributed to great results for SoFi in the first quarter of 2024. I am incredibly proud of our team's perseverance to serve our members and clients' financial needs in face of continued volatility and uncertainty around the world, while delivering good consistent growth, profitability and shareholder value creation.\n With that, I'll hand it over to Chris. Thanks for the question. We had significant excess capital prior to the transactions that occurred in the quarter. Our risk-based capital level was -- over 15%. It's now over 17%, well, well, well above our regulatory department. And given our outlook on lending, there's no reason for us to change our stance in that business.\n We have -- we went into 2024 with a view that our growth would be driven by the combined impact of Tech Platform and Financial Services business. Those businesses are now big enough in terms of total scale and profitable enough. I would put our resources behind them, still grow as we did this quarter over 26% year-over-year, while the lending business was essentially flat year-over-year.\n So our decision to make that transition in 2024, wasn't driven by capital. We had excess capital and could grow it much faster. We have even more excess capital now, but our stance hasn't changed because that wasn't the reason for keeping it relatively conservative. We feel great about the trends in Tech Platform and Financial Services. I think it's quite remarkable, the growth rate that we're achieving there and the level of profitability.\n If you had asked me 6 years ago, could we deliver in the first quarter of 2024, a 25% revenue growth, 25% EBITDA margin, growth in tangible book about 16% sequentially in addition to record deposits and strong member growth of 44%, with lending being flat, I would have said not a chance.\n So it's a real testament to the diversification of our business and the optionality we have to drive growth in different environments. But we started in October, talking about higher for longer. And while the market and different government officials let people to believe there'd be 6 rate cuts at one point. Now we're down to 1 to 2 rate cuts. We think we took the appropriate stance, and we're well positioned to play where the economy goes in 2024. Yes. Chris can comment on the betas. What I'd say is we raised our '24 revenue outlook in terms of the range by more than we'd be in Q1. That's because of the positive tailwinds we're seeing in both Tech Platform as well as Financial Services. We had record growth in deposits in Q1 of $3 billion. We've seen really strong debit spending trends. We're annualizing more than $8 billion now.\n So that will definitely continue to have a tailwind. We're uniquely positioned to be able to provide an attractive APY on the deposit business. Given the fact that we're an originator, and we can match up what we're lending at versus what we're paying out from a depository standpoint.\n In addition to that, we've really seen strong trends from the existing customers for the Tech Platform business. In addition to uptake of new products such as payment risk platform as well as the Konecta chatbot product. So we feel good about the largest components of our revenue going to the back half of the year.\n And then we have the additional contributions from businesses like SoFi Invest as well as our Credit Card business and efforts that we had with Lantern and small, medium business lead generation. Those are all contributing smaller dollar amounts, but moving quite strongly in a direction of continuing tailwind as well. We're really excited about where we are with Credit Card. We've had a great journey in launching a credit card, learning quite a bit about our go-to-market strategy, how we're marketing and targeting potential new members with credit card in addition to understanding the underlying credit trends and what the right credit model is, in addition to other factors like fraud and risk overall.\n We've brought in significant subject matter expertise in the Credit Card business that have actually built new prime cards in the past. Our product remains a prime product that will continue to be a prime product. But we felt like coming out of 2023, that we had the learnings that allow us to be more aggressive in 2024 in that business as things unfold. So expect us to invest more in the business and see some good innovation in the back half of the year, based on the learnings that we've had for the last 3 years.\n It's a great product. It has a high ROE product, but there is a J curve that you have to go through. I think one of the things that may often be missed by the broader investment community is that now we have 8.1 million members, we can market our credit card to known members with known credit profiles, known spending capabilities, cash flow, capacity, et cetera.\n And so we're at that point now where we would really like to put more resources behind the strides that we think is really working in our benefit as it relates to the interest rate and the relationship to the rest of our funding costs and what presents to that. Yes. So what I'd say is we 100% have the option to drive the lending business faster if we'd like. We do stress tests, as you would imagine internally and externally for others across the entire ecosystem, which we operate. And starting the year at the risk-based capital that we had at 15% -- with stress test gave us ample opportunity to invest in that business at a rate that we wanted to.\n I would say our outlook for the lending business is more reflective of the uncertainty as opposed to whether or not there are great trends. As you see in our lending business is actually performing quite well. We're driving great returns there, good steady credit performance as expected.\n It's not that we're expecting a huge drop off the cliff or huge deterioration. It's that we've gone from in the last 6 months, the market anticipating 6 rate cuts as you got into the sort of October time period to then now, we're down to 1 to 2 rate cuts. And prior to the 6 rate cuts, people were talking about higher for longer in October. And so there's been a complete swing of the interest rate environment.\n As you just saw in the banking industry, that creates liquidity issues for different banks. We're concerned about others not being able to manage the liquidity issues. Last year, at this time, we were experiencing First Republic going under that was not anticipated.\n I don't know what's around the next quarter. I do know that we have a great member base. We have excess capital well above we started the year with at 17%. So we have the option to grow the business much faster we choose to.\n And one of the things we haven't talked about is we're now selling a significant amount of loans. We sold 1.9 billion of loans in the quarter. That demand remains strong. And so to the extent that, that demand continues to increase and remain strong, and the environment remains sort of stable and more predictable.\n Could we be more aggressive in the lending business? 100%. We have the capital. We have the go-to-market strategy. We have the flexibility on the balance sheet, and we have the opportunity to be able to do it. We're just taking a very conservative view to make sure; we don't go into an environment that we're completely unprepared for. Taking a conservative stance gives us the most optionality to do work, but not necessarily have to do less. Yes. In terms of the Tech Platform, we saw good consistent trends there. The Tech Platform grew 21%, which was an acceleration and year-over-year growth compared to Q4 and Q3 and Q4 also accelerated. We expect the trends there to continue. We have a really sizable client base with growing of underlying users in that client base in addition to driving additional product attachments to our existing clients. We're also seeing a greater contribution from new clients over the last 9 months.\n As it relates to the broader macro environment for Technology Platform segment, the demand interest in using our technology platform, our modern Gen 3 core as well as our API-based payment platform, issuing platform is as high as it's ever been. And we continue to sign up new partners. I'd say those new partners fall into a couple of buckets. We are converting people from other competitive processing sites to Galileo. In addition to that, there's a lot of demand still from partners that haven't historically used an issuing platform or processing platform like Galileo that are transitioning to that platform from a sector standpoint.\n 1and then in the large fund institutions, the demand for modern cores and processing continues to be really robust. The timing on those deals is really driven by those end customers. We haven't lost any of the RFPs. We've continued to be down selected as big [ process ] institutions go from a large RFP to a few select partners. So we feel good about our chances there.\n We're not expecting to win 100% of those deals, but we feel like we can win our fair share. Those deals will take longer to not only sign up, but to also implement. And so the contribution for that is quarters, not months, after they're announced, but we feel great about the current trends there, and that's why the acceleration happened in the quarter.\n Q2 is a seasonally weaker quarter for the Technology Platform business, but the year-over-year growth rates what people should focus on because that eliminates the impact of seasonality and that accelerated. Yes. On the brand awareness side, we're really pleased with just the continued improvement we have in unaided brand awareness. Our marketing team and our businesses have done a great job of putting together a very integrated multimedia strategy that leverages partnerships with big well-known brands that help us achieve brand unaided awareness to become a household brand name.\n That helps improve our overall performance marketing as well. The more people that know us, the more people that trust us, the better reaction we get from every offer we have in the marketplace or other ways that we connect with potential new members in addition to building their awareness of new products beyond their initial product.\n Our cross-buying continues to remain really strong. We're seeing good financial service productivity leverage in our customer acquisition costs. So it's been a great year and 2024 is off to a great start as it relates to the impact on our unaided brand awareness from things like our recent partnership with the NBA as the official bank of the National Basketball Association."
