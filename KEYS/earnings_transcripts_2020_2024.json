Keysight delivered an outstanding quarter to finish our fiscal year driven by strong execution and broad-based demand for our differentiated solutions. Despite COVID-related macro challenges, it was a record year for orders, gross margin, operating margin, earnings per share, and free cash flow. Today, I'll focus my comments on three key headlines. First, we delivered exceptional fourth quarter results driven by strong execution as demand for Keysight's next-generation technology solutions continued, and end-market demand began to recover. Second, record profitability and cash flow again demonstrated the durability and strength of our financial operating model despite a challenging macroeconomic environment. And third, our long-term outlook for revenue and earnings growth is strong, and we haven't wavered from our pre-COVID long-term financial commitments and growth expectations announced in March of this year. The power of Keysight's leadership model and our execution this year underscore our ability to deliver on these commitments which includes 46% long-term core revenue growth and achieving 26% to 27% sustainable annual operating margin by no later than fiscal year 2023. Now, let's take a deeper look at the strength of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 financial performance. In the fourth quarter, broad-based demand for Keysight's solutions drove strong results across the business as the economic recovery in certain sectors gained momentum. Record orders of $1.2 billion exceeded revenue and grew 3% year-over-year and 15% sequentially. We achieved fourth quarter revenue growth of 9% year-over-year with growth across all regions. Both, the Communications and Electronic Industrial Solutions Groups achieved record revenue in the quarter. The resilience of our financial operating model resulted in an all-time high profitability and cash flow. In Q4, we delivered gross margin of 66% and operating margin of 29%, and earnings of $1.62 per share, and free cash flow of $308 million. For the year and despite COVID-related macro challenges and supply chain disruption, orders grew to $4.5 billion, an all-time high for Keysight. As you recall, in Q2, we responded to government directors to limit the spread of coronavirus and closed the majority of our offices worldwide, including our order fulfillment and manufacturing operations. We then ramped back up our production capacity in Q3. Despite this significant disruption, full year revenue of $4.2 billion declined only 2% year-over-year. Even in a difficult operating environment, we continue to deliver on our margin expansion commitments. Both, gross margin and operating margin improved by over 100 basis points generating a record $4.85 per share in earnings in fiscal year 2020. Turning to our markets; the Communications Solutions Group record quarterly revenue was driven by growth across the aerospace, defense and government, and commercial communications. Aerospace, defense and government revenue increased 13% year-over-year in Q4, driven by strength in the Americas and Asia, as defense modernizations continues to drive investments in technology with the focus on electromagnetic spectrum operations, space, and new commercial technologies like 5G. In Commercial Communications, 5G technology is scaling and drove strong demand across the design lifecycle from development to deployment. Keysight has the industry's most comprehensive range of 5G design and test solutions enabling the global buildout of networks and devices. 5G has been a strong growth driver for us for over the past three years, and we continue to see new use cases and ongoing innovation as the ecosystem scales and adapts to a new technology. A recent example of our 5G solutions approach includes collaboration on O-RAN with many industry leaders. Investment continues across the Commercial Communications market spanning wireless and wired technologies in data centers, and also in the cloud. This quarter, we announced a new high performance PXIe modular 5G base station solution. It is enabling network equipment manufacturers and small cell vendors to accelerate their time to market. This solution also incorporates enhancements from our PathWave software platform that help automate some of the current workflow limitations. Within Electronic Industrial Solutions Group, orders and revenue for our broad portfolio of general electronics solutions, both grew double-digit driven by gradual economic recovery across most regions and improvement in the education market. Demand for our semiconductor measurement solutions was again strong this quarter as investment in next-generation process technologies continued. In automotive, while macro-driven weakness continues to weigh on the sector, strategic investment in the advanced automotive technology is a market priority; we saw improvement from last quarter as orders grew double-digit sequentially across all regions. Our Scienlab electric vehicle test solutions are expanding in Asia and Europe where government mandates are driving the electrification of vehicles. We continue to add to our solutions portfolio and [pressing] [ph] challenges in the development of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems or ADAS, and ensuring compliance to important standards. In Q4, we introduced a new radar target simulator for ADAS being developed to enable autonomous driving, as well as a new solution for testing automotive Ethernet standards compliance for in-vehicle networks. We also recently announced collaborations with SGS and Qualcomm to advanced testing of cellular vehicle-to-everything or C-V2X technology. Turning to software and services, combined they were one-third of total Keysight revenue for this year after another quarter of solid growth. In addition, recurring revenue increased from 18% of total in FY '19 to 21% in FY '20. On an annualized basis, recurring revenue grew high-teens over last year. Software and services are important elements of our solution-centric strategy and differentiation, and further strengthened the durability of our business model. In Q4, we launched new and enhanced solutions to tap the power of cloud-based processing and advanced analytics to speed design simulation, validation and manufacturing test. These include several new PathWave software solutions targeting advanced design, compliance test, automation, and measurement and manufacturing analytics. Increasingly complex designs and the volume of data associated with their validation are driving demand for Keysight solutions. Keysight's execution and financial performance this year is a testament to Keysight's leadership model, our values, and our commitment to corporate social responsibility. A year ago, I shared with our teams my top priorities for the company. One of these priorities was a specific focus on increasing our inclusion and diversity efforts. In support of this priority, I appointed a new Senior Director of Inclusion and Diversity, who has been working with Keysight leaders and external organizations to increase representation of diverse groups within our workforce. We place a high value on inclusion and diversity at all levels of our organization, including the Board of Directors. We continue to make progress, and I'm pleased to share that as of today, over 30% of our U.S. executives are diverse in gender, race, and/or ethnicity. Before I turn the call over to Neil, I'd like to sincerely thank all of our Keysight employees for their relentless commitment, engagement, and dedication to our success over the past year. Our people and culture are truly a competitive differentiator. Thanks to their efforts, and in the face of unprecedented challenges, Keysight exits this year stronger than ever and is very well positioned to capitalize on our growth opportunities ahead. Now, I will turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail.\nNeil Dougherty: Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. Before I begin, please note, that all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless specifically noted otherwise. As Ron mentioned, we delivered an outstanding quarter and despite a challenging macro environment, we continued to make great progress towards our long-term annual financial targets. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we delivered record revenue of $1.220 billion, which was above the high-end of our guidance range, and grew 9% or 7% on a core basis. Q4 revenue growth was driven by continued demand in areas such as 5G, semiconductor measurement, and aerospace defense where we have leading positions and differentiated solutions. Demand for general electronics improved significantly in the quarter driven by regional economic recovery, particularly in Asia. Total Keysight orders exceeded revenue in Q4 with the book-to-bill just over 1 [ph]. We delivered a record $1.231 billion in orders, up 3% or 1% on a core basis. Looking at our operational results for Q4; we reported gross margin of 66% and operating expenses of $446 million resulting in operating margin of 29%, an all-time quarterly high. Net income was a record $305 million, and we achieved $1.62 in earnings per share which was well above the high-end of our guidance, and an increase of 22% year-over-year. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 188 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments; our Communication Solutions Group generated record revenue of $901 million, up 8% while delivering record gross margin of 66% and record operating margin of 29%. In Q4, commercial communications generated revenue of $605 million, up 5% driven by strength across the 5G ecosystem from development to early manufacturing, Gen5 high-speed digital applications and data center related 400 gigabit and 800 gigabit technology. Aerospace, defense and government achieved record revenue of $296 million, an increase of 13% versus a prior all-time high in Q4 last year. Growth was driven by strength in the Americas and Asia with improvement in Europe. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated fourth quarter revenue of $319 million, up 12% or 7% on a core basis, driven by strength in general electronics and semiconductor. EISG reported gross margin of 65%, an increase of 230 basis points year-over-year and record operating margin of 30%. Given the challenges that we faced this year, we are very pleased with our full year results. FY '20 revenue totaled $4.2 billion, down 2% year-over-year or 3% on a core basis impacted by supply chain disruptions and macro challenges caused by the pandemic. Despite this small revenue decline, gross margin improved 140 basis points year-over-year to 65%. While continuing to invest in R&D at 16% of revenue or nearly $700 million for the year, operating margin improved 130 basis points to 25%. This year-over-year improvement demonstrates strong progress towards our annual operating margin target of 26% to 27% which we expect to achieve by fiscal 2023. FY '20 non-GAAP net income was $919 million or $4.85 per share for the full year. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended our fourth quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and reported cash flow from operations of $338 million and record free cash flow of $308 million. Free cash flow is net of a $100 million funding contribution to our U.S. pension plan in the quarter, which provides a tax benefit in the current year and a pension expense benefit in FY '21. Total free cash flow for the year was $899 million, representing 21% of revenue and 98% of non-GAAP net income. Under our prior share repurchase authorization, we were opportunistic in deploying capital during the quarter. We acquired approximately 2.2 million shares on the open market at an average price of $96.55 for a total consideration of $215 million and exhausting our $500 million share repurchase authorization from May of 2019. This brings our total share repurchases for the year to approximately 4.3 million shares at an average share price of $95.90 for a total consideration of $410 million or 46% of free cash flow. As announced earlier today, the Keysight Board of Directors has approved a new share repurchase authorization of $750 million, effective immediately. Before moving to FY '21 modeling and our Q1 guidance, I'd like to provide a brief update on global trade concerns. We admittedly have a tough order comp in Q1 due to China trade restrictions and the pending U.S. administration change, which has historically dampened government business during the transition. Despite these headwinds, we have started to see gradual improvements in many of our markets and are entering the year in a strong backlog position giving us confidence in our ability to navigate these near-term perturbations. Looking to FY '21, we expect quarterly revenue seasonality to be more muted than in the past due to ongoing COVID-19 and macro-related uncertainty. Just as we flexed expenses down this year, flexible spending and variable compensation is expected to increase in FY '21 to more normal levels, with Q2 expenses seasonally higher than all other quarters. In addition, FY '21 pension expenses reflected in the other expense line are expected to increase by $5 million per quarter. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $78 million and capital spending is expected to be in the range of $170 million to $180 million as we begin a two-year project to increase the resiliency of our supply chain. Regarding our tax rate, we are modeling a 12% non-GAAP effective tax rate for FY '21. Now turning to our outlook and guidance; we expect first quarter 2021 revenue to be in the range of $1.140 billion to $1.160 billion, and Q1 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.32 to $1.38 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 188 million shares. In closing, our solid outlook for revenue and earnings growth coupled with the durability of our business model give us confidence in our ability to deliver on the long-term financial commitments that we outlined in March prior to COVID. Despite the challenges of this past year, we continue to make good progress towards our long-term targets of 4% to 6% core revenue growth and annual operating margin of 26% to 27%. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.\nJason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Chris, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna. Your line is open.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes, thanks for taking my question. I want to go back to your booking and better understand specific to Commercial Communication, how should I think about orders for 5G, specifically millimeter wave, and how does the networking, like fiber for 800-gig, compare to millimeter wave related orders? And I have a follow-up.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes, thanks, Mehdi. This is Satish, I'll take it. Our Commercial Communications group had a record revenue this quarter and second consecutive quarter of sequential improvement and a large part of these results were driven by strength in both the wireless and wireline ecosystems, specifically from a trend perspective, 5G and 400-gig were big drivers of growth for us. I would say, in 5G while -- we observed three things, the commercialization is ramping, a large part of that is low frequency or mid-band frequency networks; the standardization of the technology continues to progress; and the big theme is the ecosystem is expanding. So these are three big trends that are enabling both wireless and wireline technologies to be strong for us. As far as the millimeter wave is concerned, we view the -- we have long viewed and we continue to view the millimeter wave opportunity as very favorable for us because of the upgrade potential it represents and our traditional strengths in millimeter wave technologies play out. Even this quarter, specifically, we continue to see a steady ramp in customer interest as they re-tool their engineering flow to adapt to the millimeter wave technology. On the wireline side, we captured pretty strong ramps that occurred for 400-gig in Asia throughout the year and we are starting to see increased activity in R&D for 400-gig and 800-gig Ethernet this quarter.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay, just a quick follow-up, as we look into FY 2021, 5G goes into production, how should I think about the software content? This question actually ties into the last question, as we go into production, should we expect continued strength in R&D, specifically R&D that is software-heavy and, in that context, would the gross margin hold up as we go into production 5G, should we expect some gross margin headwind? Thank you.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Mehdi, as far as R&D, we continue to see a robust pipeline for demand for R&D with release 16 features coming out next year. So I would continue to see strength there. With regard to our production test opportunities, we're starting to see the deployments are actually driving ramps in the supply chain and we're benefiting from them and in fact, this quarter we referenced a pretty sizable win for our PXIe, a release of our PXIe modular solution, which also has software content associated with it. So, we'll continue to see a steady improvement there, as well.\nRon Nersesian: Yes, I'd certainly expect any margin impact from a migration towards manufacturing to be more or less undetectable at the Keysight level when you think about $4.5 billion of revenue and the progress we're making generally, as a company around software and services and other areas. So, not something that we're concerned about.\nMehdi Hosseini: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. If I can just start off with Commercial Communications as well, and just following up on Satish's commentary here on 5G momentum being strong. I just wanted to see if you can outline how to think about maybe acceleration in terms of 5G, the revenue momentum and how does that play into what declines to expect on the 4G revenue side, any thoughts as we look into the next couple of years on that front? I think one of your competitors has also talked about some of the 5G release delays driving order weakness, have you seen anything on that front?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes, there is no doubt there has been some implementation delays in some quarters of the ecosystem. If it were not for this -- given the momentum that the industry is sustaining, we would be further along. Having said that, we saw strong orders for our business, the quarter and for the full year in 5G and we see a robust pipeline for release 16 in R&D and for production-related expansions that customers are planning for. So we continue to believe that 5G represents a long-term opportunity for us, especially as we have talked about our portfolio being broad starting with the physical layer where we have millimeter wave -- bulk of the millimeter wave opportunity in front of us and then, we have the protocol layer where release 16 and release 17 to follow where there has been some delays in release 17 that you referenced, but release 16 is very high impact in terms of its expansion into new use cases that we're very excited about. And lastly, I would say that we saw strong growth in the application layer opportunity where we've expanded our 5G strength even beyond commercial comps into aerospace and defense, with security applications, into our general electronics business through multiple industries, and into automotive with C-V2X. So you piece that altogether, we continue to believe that this is still very early innings in 5G as we stated at Investor Day.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. Satish, if I can just follow-up, what are you seeing in terms of activity on the 4G side, are we at a point where some of these revenue declines moderate on the 4G side?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes, I think we've -- obviously the year-over-year, if you looked at last year, we saw some expansions in traditional smartphone driving up the legacy of 4G business and so, comparatively things declined sharper this year given that customers prioritized 5G, but again, I would go back to saying we have a very broad breadth of tools for the labs that we offer and in many cases, customers delayed that spend and we expect that to stabilize and ramp back up, as customers return and recover from COVID.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay, thank you. Thank you for taking my questions.\nOperator: Our next question is from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is open.\nTim Long: Thank you. If I could just follow-up with one on the 5G side, then ask on optical. Just talk a little bit about the pricing and competitive environment as some of the competitors try to play a little catch up there. Any changes of note? And then secondly, you mentioned some strength in the data center 400-gig, 800-gig. Could you expand on that a little bit? Where do you think we are in that cycle and if you could also talk into the service provider opportunities as they transition to 600 and 800-gig, as well? Thank you.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes, thanks. I think our differentiations front, I would say, continues to be strong. You look at the standards-based test cases that we offer and you can see that we're leading and that we are staying on the cutting edge and that's what our customers appreciate. So on the edges, we don't see any material change to our competitive position with regard to these advanced technologies and we have continued to invest this year in R&D to keep our differentiation strong. So that's the point I'll make. With regard to how this is all playing out, you might say, if you just think of the smartphone use case, there is about 7,200 band combinations in 5G that have been defined and to-date only 1,500 of them are being tested. So the latest devices that we have account for 1,500. So you start to see that there is considerable runway just in the smartphone use case and with release 16 that is in front of us, there are new expansion opportunities for industrial applications and automotive applications that creates a healthy pipeline for us. With regard to the wireline, the first phase of the 400-gig deployments have largely been in, what I would consider, East-West traffic that flows in a data center and with more to come, as operators start to deploy this technology when the price on the transceivers start to become more affordable. So that's the second wave we expect, but there is continued evolutions of 400-gig and 800-gig that have started, which feeds into our R&D strength.\nTim Long: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nJohn Pitzer: Yes, good afternoon. Congratulations on the solid results. A couple of questions. Just when we think about the year-over-year compares on both revenue and orders to the fiscal first quarter guidance, can you just remind us how much of a headwind Huawei should represent fiscal first quarter to fiscal first quarter? And sticking on the China topic, I'm just curious, when you think about the 5G strength, how important has China been over the last several quarters? More importantly, as you look into the first half of the year, what are you expecting from China? I guess the underlying question is, do you feel as though China will continue to deploy 5G at a relatively healthy clip despite the Huawei ban, or do you think there is some potential for digestion there before re-acceleration?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes, this is Neil, why don't I take the first part of that and then maybe we will have Mark comment on China and some of our expectations there. I think the most important comment with regard to Huawei is, the situation with Huawei is not going to change our expectations as it relates to our long-term growth outlooks for our business or for our markets. We're entering the year in a very strong backlog position and I think that strong backlog position is going to enable us to essentially mitigate the impact of any short-term perturbations that may happen on the order line because of the year-over-year Huawei compares. We have an extraordinarily diverse base of customers around the world driving demand in our end markets and we're looking at that and the strengthening we've seen over the past couple of quarters relative to where we were in Q2 and we're going to keep our foot on the gas relative to those long-term targets.\nMark Wallace: Yes, John, this is Mark. I'll follow-up with that. So the business -- our orders in China in Q4 were strong and steady throughout the quarter despite some decline, obviously, impact from Huawei, that came from strengths in 5G and it is extending across the ecosystem as we scale those solutions. As Satish talked about 400-gig is hot, high-speed digital and optical manufacturing. So it's a very broad industry for us. We've also seen the economic recovery in China. They recovered first and more quickly and we've seen that show up in our automotive order growth and general electronics. And the bottom line is, as Neil mentioned, our business in China is -- we have a very broad footprint, the business is strong. We've been successful and we'll continue to be successful to deploy and redeploy our resources to continue to capture growth in 5G and across the other segments.\nJohn Pitzer: Thanks. Very helpful.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMatt Niknam: Thank you for taking the questions. One on margins, you're exiting the year a lot closer -- I think actually exceeding your longer-term target and so maybe, Neil, if you can help us think through why with a seemingly improving -- you've got a big backlog revenue trajectory should improve, the anticipation of margins maybe reverting back lower, how we should think about the different puts and takes? And then just one follow-up on orders. I know normalized order growth was about 1% and you're reaffirming the longer-term top line growth targets of 4% to 6%. Just wondering if you can call out the bigger areas that are still lagging and the path to get back to that longer-term mid-singles growth rate? Thanks.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes, so let me start with the margin side of that first. So first of all, we're very pleased with the margin performance of the business in the year and we look at this year and some of the challenges of this year as a great test of the operating model that we've been talking about really since the launch of the company. That being said, our operating margin targets, our margin targets in general, they are annual targets, not quarterly targets. We hit 25% this year and we've talked about getting to 26% or 27% operating margin is the target that we outlined at our Analyst Day and we are still working towards that objective. I think we're highly confident in our ability to achieve that and as we look forward to this year, I think you can look to -- obviously, in the second and third quarters, with revenue down and the corresponding expenses down, but you saw in Q4 the margin performance that we can put up with expenses returning to a more normalized level. With regard to how we get back to mid-single digits, I think we are seeing some relative strengthening across the broader markets and of economies, in general. I think a great indicator of that is what we're seeing in general electronics. We saw a strong return in our education business, which is, as I think, indicative of some recovery from the COVID situation. Even looking at businesses like auto, while auto orders were still down on a year-over-year basis, we saw very strong sequential improvement in auto. So things are getting better and I think we're going to look really across the entire portfolio for strength and just broad macro strengthening to help drive us to those levels.\nMatt Niknam: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Snyder with UBS. Your line is open.\nChris Snyder: Thank you. You talked about the tough Q1 comp. Can you just maybe tell us what percent of Q1 [ph] orders and revenue came from Huawei just to give us a feel for what the underlying demand is?\nNeil Dougherty: We expect it to be about a 5 point headwind in the first half. That's roughly how we're thinking about it, but again, I think, given the backlog situation that we have coming into the year, I think that's going to be the dominant driver of our business and so I think that's going to give us the ability and give us some time to overcome what might be some short-term perturbations on the order line. We're highly confident going into the year.\nChris Snyder: Okay. Appreciate that. And I mean, is it fair to assume that 5% for the first half it's more weighted into fiscal Q1, just given that the China COVID impact hit in the fiscal Q2?\nNeil Dougherty: No, that's correct and I said as much in my prepared remarks, we clearly have a tough order comp in Q1, but I'd point you back to the backlog situation. We're guiding strong revenue growth in the first quarter and we're going to be in a good position as we migrate through the year. Certainly our revenue comps in Q2 and Q3 get significantly softer, obviously, but the backlog that we built over the last several quarters is going to provide a buffering for us.\nChris Snyder: Appreciate that. And then just following up on that. Some peers have talked about the ability to sell non-U.S. IP to Huawei. Can you maybe talk about any opportunity here for Keysight and have these restrictions that we've seen led to any upstream share shifts that would maybe allow you to partially offset this headwind as we move into 2021?\nNeil Dougherty: Let me take the first part of that and I'll let Satish maybe comment on the second part. We do have some ability to sell some small portions of our portfolio into Huawei going forward that don't include any material U.S. technology, but it is a very small portion of the portfolio. We do not expect Huawei to be a material customer for us going forward.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: And just to add to what Neil said, it's too soon to call any share shifts, but we start to see the smartphone -- Tier 2 smartphone makers in China continue to invest in R&D because they see an opportunity. So that's probably one positive offset, if you will. The second one that is evolving is the resurgent interest in Open RAN technology to provide a different alternative to 5G base stations. I think if you look at -- those two things have the potential for us as we look into 2021 and beyond.\nChris Snyder: Thank you for the time. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question is from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Your line is open.\nAdam Thalhimer: Yes, hey, good afternoon. Great quarter. I have like 15 questions and I can only ask one.\nRon Nersesian: Make it a good one.\nAdam Thalhimer: Let's go with the seasonality for fiscal year 2021, Neil. I think you said less seasonality in 2021. I'm just curious what you meant by that and how you want us to model it?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes, we just think -- again, I'm going to bring you back to the backlog situation as we slowly work off the backlog that we built up over the last couple of quarters, we think that is going to essentially mute the impact of what would typically be more demand-driven quarterly seasonality that we've seen in prior years. We expect a much more muted revenue seasonality over the coming quarters, maybe with a slight uptick in Q4, but much more muted revenue seasonality than what is typical.\nAdam Thalhimer: Got it. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: The next question is from David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Thank you for taking my question. I'm just wondering what the all-in temporary cost reductions were in fiscal year 2020 that come back in fiscal year 2021? Just trying to get a sense of -- as you referenced in your prepared remarks, some of those variable cost flexing back up?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes, I think that the big driver is, obviously, we've talked at length in prior quarters about our variable pay programs and the flexibility of our cost model. That's probably the single biggest driver. Then there are the obvious things that impact many companies, just dramatic reductions in travel, as an example. I would point you to our Q4 expenses. I think we've largely saw our spending return to more normalized levels here in the fourth quarter of the year. Obviously, we'll continue to do administration [ph] and other things, but I think as we look forward, you could look to Q4 as a baseline and then, as we said in the prepared remarks, we do expect Q2 to be higher than the other quarters from an OpEx standpoint in FY 2021.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question is from Richard Eastman with Baird. Your line is open.\nRichard Eastman: Yes, thanks for the question. Neil, could you just give us the backlog number at the end of the year? I mean, at face value, it looks like it's up 22%, but I'm curious maybe was there any de-booking of orders around Huawei or anything on the defense side, or did we enter with that a step-up?\nNeil Dougherty: We have not seen any material and any change in de-booking. There is always some noise level of the de-bookings, but that hasn't changed at all. Obviously, we built a significant amount of backlog just looking at the difference between orders and revenue for the year, it's on the order of $300 million, a portion of which you would consider to be abnormal backlog build given the revenue disruptions or the shipment disruptions in the second and third quarter. So it's that abnormal portion of backlog build that we'll be looking to work off over the course of the next several quarters.\nRichard Eastman: Okay, and then just a question around Ixia. Can you give us a sense of -- are you seeing any uptick in demand there? Just given the timing and the pacing of demand relative to the new network roll outs and infrastructure roll outs, how does Ixia look here at the end of the year and for the year, and what does the outlook look like from a demand standpoint for 2021?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes, Rick. So it's been a little over a year since we integrated the Ixia business into the Commercial Communications segment and we've made some excellent progress in realizing synergies with respect to solutions. I would say in the networking space, we see a 400-gig Ethernet. Our portfolio has been significantly strengthened, not only the physical layer, but also in the protocol layer with the addition of the Ixia's Layer 2, Layer 3 business. We're securing some good wins in the industry as the R&D investment flows and with the security piece of the business that we acquired, now we're able to integrate that with our 5G platform and realize greater synergies there as we position solutions for the aerospace and defence industry. So that\u2019s another area where, not only are we addressing traditional opportunities, but also some expansion areas. With 5G now getting deployed, we\u2019re starting to see a pick-up in demand for the visibility part of the business where just this quarter, we had a couple of big opportunities that we closed on with operators looking for enhanced application layer visibility there. So overall I would say, you look at the big trends of virtualization, cloud, and the progression that's going into the application layer, we view the portfolio to be strong and we think the outlook is favorable. Obviously, right now, everybody is recovering from COVID, so that gates that recovery.\nRichard Eastman: Okay, thank you. And congrats on a very solid quarter, nice quarter. Thank you.\nRon Nersesian: Rick, this is Ron. Just one other comment, this is Ron. Just one other comment, we talked about the backlog build in FY 2020. You may want to also go back and look at the backlog build in FY 2019, because it's been a very steady build that we've had for many quarters beyond FY 2020.\nRichard Eastman: Okay, I will do that. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from Jim Suva with Citigroup Investment Research. Your line is open.\nJim Suva: Thank you very much. A question on the backlog, I heard you mentioned several times that it's strong and then you just had a clarification that it built in fiscal 2019 as well as fiscal 2020. So the question is, are you at a point where the backlog is now this most recent quarter that you just reported starting to work down or was it still growing and the duration of work down, is it two or three quarters, but you just said in fiscal 2019, it was building also. So I'm just trying to figure out the dynamics of the variable of the backlog?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes, so obviously, Jim, we've been a growing business here for a number of years and we would expect that our backlog would be growing in absolute terms just given the overall growth of the business. I think if you look at -- what you saw in Q4 was pretty much a reduction in the rate of growth of that backlog. We built very significant backlog in Q2 and Q3, as I previously referenced, abnormal levels of backlog because shipments were depressed because of the factory shutdown and re-ramp in Q3, while our book-to-bill was over 1, it was just a tick over 1, right? So we were more or less in a neutral position in the fourth quarter and so, as I think about going into next year, we have this backlog that is particularly focused on the abnormal amount of backlog build where we've got to get product delivered to customers. And I think on a positive note, really when we were in the process of building that backlog in Q2 and Q3, while orders remained strong because our customers' businesses were disrupted, we weren't in a situation where they were really pounding on the door saying in most cases -- we need immediate delivery of this product, and we really saw that tick up in the fourth quarter, which is what drove the revenues north of $1.2 billion and I think it's that dynamic of our customers now looking to take delivery of that backlog that was built in the Q2, Q3 time frame, that is going to be the predominant driver of revenue for the next couple of quarters.\nJim Suva: And just housekeeping for the stock buyback, is it meant to just keep share count relatively flat and offset dilution, or is it actually meant to bring the share count down?\nNeil Dougherty: I'd say a couple of things about that. So first of all, obviously, we've made a commitment to at least at a minimum be anti-dilutive with our buyback programs and we will continue to do that. But just as you saw with us in Q4, and frankly, over the course of FY 2020, we will be opportunistic when those approach. And so, we were very pleased to take 4.3 million shares off the market at an average price somewhere around $96 this year bringing the share count down. And so, when we see those windows, we'll certainly do that, but at a bare minimum, you can count on us to keep the share count constant. We did say in our prepared remarks that we expect in FY 2021 our share count to be 188 million shares, which is flat. So that's our base case we're modeling. When I think about capital -- priorities for capital beyond share repurchase, we continue to have an active M&A funnel development process. We continue to look for ways to put money to work through M&A and assets that are accretive to growth, accretive to gross margin, much like the acquisition that we did of Eggplant at the end of last quarter. So, no real change for our capital allocation priorities at this point in time.\nJim Suva: Thank you so much for the details and clarifications and good results. Thank you.\nNeil Dougherty: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from John Marchetti with Stifel. Your line is open.\nJohn Marchetti: Thanks very much. I wanted to ask a quick question on the semiconductor business. That's been strong now for a few quarters. So just curious to get your view of where we are in that process no transition cycle? And as we're looking out into 2021, how we should think about that that semi-business performing for years as we\u2019re going into next year?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes, I'll make some comments, and maybe Mark can also chime in on the on the forward-looking demand. I would say that we had a very strong year for the semi-business. And it's been driven by the growth in the 5G devices, and the high performance computing needs that have proliferated, especially due to folks working remotely and working from home environment. And we've also captured and capitalized on the China IC spend; our position in that -- in the semi business is highly differentiated, and we continue to track the node sizes from 7 to 5, and now a new activity is starting for 3 nanometers; so we're highly differentiated there. And I'll hand it off to Mark to make some comments on forward-looking demand.\nMark Wallace: Yes. What I would add is that the leading demand that Satish talked about is continuing and the length of the process of retooling the fabs is a very long one; so we're involved in relatively long sales cycles that involve both, the process nodes and new technologies like, with extreme ultraviolet lithography and we see those opportunities continuing to drive into next year. We see continued investments in China, as well as other parts around the world, including the United States with the chips program that was announced several months ago. So the bottom line is, we could see some market constraints coming in in the next couple of quarters, but we see continuing demand for our process solutions to support these next-generation technologies.\nJohn Marchetti: Great. And then maybe, Neil, just a quick follow-up on the gross margin strength here. How much of that I guess is mix-related? Is it a function of that continuing growth in the recurring software piece of the business? As we look out into next year, I guess, what's the right sort of level setting for that, given some of the strengths we seen; even with some of the challenges that you had through, through this fiscal year?\nNeil Dougherty: Sorry, let me repeat that, because I realized my mic was off. We continue to be very pleased with the progress we're making on gross margin. And really, there is a lot that goes into that. First of all, I'd start with software content, right. During this year, our software business continued to grow -- outgrow the broader company, until we continue to see nice growth in software and we continue to make great progress in the conversion of the way our customers buy software from us towards more time-based purchasing; so we've actually saw our annualized recurring revenue grow in the high-teens during FY '20, so that's helpful. We're making great progress; I talked about this last quarter in our services margin portfolio, that's a below average gross margin business for us. But on the operating mind, we have our services business now north of 20%, which has been a long-term goal, and a lot of that improvement has come on the gross margin line. And then, I would talk about our migration towards selling complete solutions across the entire portfolio, right. As we migrate to those complete solutions, they tend to be more highly differentiated, and we can monetize that differentiation. And so you couple that with the strength that we're seeing -- the strengthening we're seeing in the markets over the last couple of quarters. I mean, I think we're very pleased with the way orders -- the strength of orders really through the entire cycle of this year. But the strengthening in Q4, the broad indications of macro recovery across large portions of our portfolio, and large geographies around the world is -- as I think very favorable as we look into FY '20 -- excuse me, FY '21.\nJohn Marchetti: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nBrandon Couillard: Good afternoon. Neil, just a quick one; you alluded to your CapEx program, I think to monetize some plants. First part, is that growth oriented or cost oriented? And should we expect a similar kind of $1.70 to $1.80 in fiscal '22?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes, it's a two-year program. So I'm envisioning, obviously, we're still a year away, but the FY '22 I think will be similar from a CapEx perspective. And we've essentially got some facility up; I would call it just -- kind of resiliency of our supply chain with some facility upgrades we need to do. In other cases, we're looking to get some alternative sourcing sites for some specialized productions for diversification purposes, those types of activities to just make sure that our supply chain is secure.\nBrandon Couillard: All right, thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nMark Delaney: Good afternoon, thanks for taking the question. Your company mentioned COVID-19 as one of the factors behind the muted seasonality this coming year. Can you elaborate a bit more on that? Now that we've unfortunately seen some increasing cases in many countries, are you seeing any customers around [ph] geographies where there is actually some push out and schedules that have been occurring? Are you more reading this as a potential risk we should be mindful about?\nRon Nersesian: No, I think it's just broad uncertainty, right. Nobody knows exactly what's going to happen, and it's -- the question about seasonality; typically, we see plus or minus a couple of points as we move from quarter to quarter, you can go look at the history and see what that is. And all, I'm -- we're saying two things; one, you've got this -- you know, kind of broad overarching uncertainty around COVID, and then we've got this backlog burn that's going to be happening, and we think those are going to kind of more or less drown out the typical seasonality that we would see in a current year; so we're expecting a much more steady revenue flow over the course of the next several quarters.\nMark Delaney: Okay, that's helpful. And as a follow-up question on the geopolitical issues that Keysight has been dealing with in the China market. And we discussed Huawei are already on this call, but can you talk about any other customers where perhaps you've been doing business with and there has been some increase in sanctions, even beyond Huawei. I know that it created some potential risk for tech companies, and is there any business you may be doing separate from Huawei that you think could potentially come under additional restriction that we need to be thinking about or maybe already has? Thanks.\nRon Nersesian: Yes. So I'll let Mark comment on that as well. I mean, I think we were a couple of years now into this -- kind of ongoing, back and forth around trade restrictions. And I will tell you that we've weathered it very well, our business in China continues to do very well. And so whether you're talking about the initial tariffs or companies added to the restricted party list or the situations with ZTE and Huawei; we've been through a lot of these things, and our China business continues to grow. We have a very broad portfolio, we have a very broad customer set, the types of things that Keysight does as a company is very well aligned with what's happening in China. And so, I just think that -- and Mark mentioned it, we've been very good at redirecting our own internal sales and other resources to where the market opportunities are. Mark, I don't know if you have anything that you want to add to that.\nMark Wallace: Yes. So Mark, I would just reiterate that we've already pivoted with the most recent regulations. And as a matter of fact, there were earlier ones back in June that was tied to the military and used customers in China and Russia and Venezuela that we also endured, and we made some changes associated with that. So, we're closely monitoring this thing, we'll continue to be 100% compliant as we always are, and we have built a core capability to pivot quickly and go after the additional business that's available to us. And as Neil just pointed out, for many, many quarters, we've been very successful in doing so.\nMark Delaney: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd now like to turn the conference back over to you, Jason Kary, for any closing remarks.\nJason Kary: Hi Chris, thanks for that. And I'd like to just turn it to Ron, for some closing comments.\nRon Nersesian: Thank you, everyone for joining us. I -- we are very, very pleased with the results we delivered despite COVID and despite the trade environments; delivering record orders, record revenue record gross margin, record operating margin and record free cash flow. We really believe and see that we have a very strong market position with very differentiated solutions across the ecosystem. And our solutions incorporate world class hardware, very good and strong software analysis capability, as well as services. Our software content continues to increase, our services business is growing, and both of them together are giving us an even stronger business model with more recurring revenue. But our business model is strong, it was tested during the COVID period of time, and you could see the type of results that we can deliver. And last but not least, I really believe we have the best employees in the world that work very hard to bring our customers the best solutions in the world and support them as they try to innovate across their end-markets. And we are committed to create value as we've done in our first six years for our shareholders, and I really believe the best is yet to come. Thank you very much, and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes our conference call. And you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Mark Wallace",
            "content": "Yes, John, this is Mark. I'll follow-up with that. So the business -- our orders in China in Q4 were strong and steady throughout the quarter despite some decline, obviously, impact from Huawei, that came from strengths in 5G and it is extending across the ecosystem as we scale those solutions. As Satish talked about 400-gig is hot, high-speed digital and optical manufacturing. So it's a very broad industry for us. We've also seen the economic recovery in China. They recovered first and more quickly and we've seen that show up in our automotive order growth and general electronics. And the bottom line is, as Neil mentioned, our business in China is -- we have a very broad footprint, the business is strong. We've been successful and we'll continue to be successful to deploy and redeploy our resources to continue to capture growth in 5G and across the other segments. Yes. What I would add is that the leading demand that Satish talked about is continuing and the length of the process of retooling the fabs is a very long one; so we're involved in relatively long sales cycles that involve both, the process nodes and new technologies like, with extreme ultraviolet lithography and we see those opportunities continuing to drive into next year. We see continued investments in China, as well as other parts around the world, including the United States with the chips program that was announced several months ago.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Satish Dhanasekaran",
            "content": "Yes, thanks, Mehdi. This is Satish, I'll take it. Our Commercial Communications group had a record revenue this quarter and second consecutive quarter of sequential improvement and a large part of these results were driven by strength in both the wireless and wireline ecosystems, specifically from a trend perspective, 5G and 400-gig were big drivers of growth for us. I would say, in 5G while -- we observed three things, the commercialization is ramping, a large part of that is low frequency or mid-band frequency networks; the standardization of the technology continues to progress; and the big theme is the ecosystem is expanding. So these are three big trends that are enabling both wireless and wireline technologies to be strong for us. As far as the millimeter wave is concerned, we view the -- we have long viewed and we continue to view the millimeter wave opportunity as very favorable for us because of the upgrade potential it represents and our traditional strengths in millimeter wave technologies play out. Even this quarter, specifically, we continue to see a steady ramp in customer interest as they re-tool their engineering flow to adapt to the millimeter wave technology. On the wireline side, we captured pretty strong ramps that occurred for 400-gig in Asia throughout the year and we are starting to see increased activity in R&D for 400-gig and 800-gig Ethernet this quarter. Mehdi, as far as R&D, we continue to see a robust pipeline for demand for R&D with release 16 features coming out next year. So I would continue to see strength there. With regard to our production test opportunities, we're starting to see the deployments are actually driving ramps in the supply chain and we're benefiting from them and in fact, this quarter we referenced a pretty sizable win for our PXIe, a release of our PXIe modular solution, which also has software content associated with it. So, we'll continue to see a steady improvement there, as well. Yes, there is no doubt there has been some implementation delays in some quarters of the ecosystem. If it were not for this -- given the momentum that the industry is sustaining, we would be further along. Having said that, we saw strong orders for our business, the quarter and for the full year in 5G and we see a robust pipeline for release 16 in R&D and for production-related expansions that customers are planning for. So we continue to believe that 5G represents a long-term opportunity for us, especially as we have talked about our portfolio being broad starting with the physical layer where we have millimeter wave -- bulk of the millimeter wave opportunity in front of us and then, we have the protocol layer where release 16 and release 17 to follow where there has been some delays in release 17 that you referenced, but release 16 is very high impact in terms of its expansion into new use cases that we're very excited about. And lastly, I would say that we saw strong growth in the application layer opportunity where we've expanded our 5G strength even beyond commercial comps into aerospace and defense, with security applications, into our general electronics business through multiple industries, and into automotive with C-V2X. So you piece that altogether, we continue to believe that this is still very early innings in 5G as we stated at Investor Day. Yes, I think we've -- obviously the year-over-year, if you looked at last year, we saw some expansions in traditional smartphone driving up the legacy of 4G business and so, comparatively things declined sharper this year given that customers prioritized 5G, but again, I would go back to saying we have a very broad breadth of tools for the labs that we offer and in many cases, customers delayed that spend and we expect that to stabilize and ramp back up, as customers return and recover from COVID. Yes, thanks. I think our differentiations front, I would say, continues to be strong. You look at the standards-based test cases that we offer and you can see that we're leading and that we are staying on the cutting edge and that's what our customers appreciate. So on the edges, we don't see any material change to our competitive position with regard to these advanced technologies and we have continued to invest this year in R&D to keep our differentiation strong. So that's the point I'll make. With regard to how this is all playing out, you might say, if you just think of the smartphone use case, there is about 7,200 band combinations in 5G that have been defined and to-date only 1,500 of them are being tested. So the latest devices that we have account for 1,500. So you start to see that there is considerable runway just in the smartphone use case and with release 16 that is in front of us, there are new expansion opportunities for industrial applications and automotive applications that creates a healthy pipeline for us. With regard to the wireline, the first phase of the 400-gig deployments have largely been in, what I would consider, East-West traffic that flows in a data center and with more to come, as operators start to deploy this technology when the price on the transceivers start to become more affordable. So that's the second wave we expect, but there is continued evolutions of 400-gig and 800-gig that have started, which feeds into our R&D strength. And just to add to what Neil said, it's too soon to call any share shifts, but we start to see the smartphone -- Tier 2 smartphone makers in China continue to invest in R&D because they see an opportunity. So that's probably one positive offset, if you will. The second one that is evolving is the resurgent interest in Open RAN technology to provide a different alternative to 5G base stations. I think if you look at -- those two things have the potential for us as we look into 2021 and beyond. Yes, Rick. So it's been a little over a year since we integrated the Ixia business into the Commercial Communications segment and we've made some excellent progress in realizing synergies with respect to solutions. I would say in the networking space, we see a 400-gig Ethernet. Our portfolio has been significantly strengthened, not only the physical layer, but also in the protocol layer with the addition of the Ixia's Layer 2, Layer 3 business. We're securing some good wins in the industry as the R&D investment flows and with the security piece of the business that we acquired, now we're able to integrate that with our 5G platform and realize greater synergies there as we position solutions for the aerospace and defence industry. So that's another area where, not only are we addressing traditional opportunities, but also some expansion areas. With 5G now getting deployed, we're starting to see a pick-up in demand for the visibility part of the business where just this quarter, we had a couple of big opportunities that we closed on with operators looking for enhanced application layer visibility there. So overall I would say, you look at the big trends of virtualization, cloud, and the progression that's going into the application layer, we view the portfolio to be strong and we think the outlook is favorable. Obviously, right now, everybody is recovering from COVID, so that gates that recovery. Yes, I'll make some comments, and maybe Mark can also chime in on the on the forward-looking demand. I would say that we had a very strong year for the semi-business. And it's been driven by the growth in the 5G devices, and the high performance computing needs that have proliferated, especially due to folks working remotely and working from home environment. And we've also captured and capitalized on the China IC spend; our position in that -- in the semi business is highly differentiated, and we continue to track the node sizes from 7 to 5, and now a new activity is starting for 3 nanometers; so we're highly differentiated there.

            "name": "Ron Nersesian",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. Keysight delivered an outstanding quarter to finish our fiscal year driven by strong execution and broad-based demand for our differentiated solutions. Despite COVID-related macro challenges, it was a record year for orders, gross margin, operating margin, earnings per share, and free cash flow. Today, I'll focus my comments on three key headlines. First, we delivered exceptional fourth quarter results driven by strong execution as demand for Keysight's next-generation technology solutions continued, and end-market demand began to recover. Second, record profitability and cash flow again demonstrated the durability and strength of our financial operating model despite a challenging macroeconomic environment. And third, our long-term outlook for revenue and earnings growth is strong, and we haven't wavered from our pre-COVID long-term financial commitments and growth expectations announced in March of this year. The power of Keysight's leadership model and our execution this year underscore our ability to deliver on these commitments which includes 46% long-term core revenue growth and achieving 26% to 27% sustainable annual operating margin by no later than fiscal year 2023. Now, let's take a deeper look at the strength of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 financial performance. In the fourth quarter, broad-based demand for Keysight's solutions drove strong results across the business as the economic recovery in certain sectors gained momentum. Record orders of $1.2 billion exceeded revenue and grew 3% year-over-year and 15% sequentially. We achieved fourth quarter revenue growth of 9% year-over-year with growth across all regions. Both, the Communications and Electronic Industrial Solutions Groups achieved record revenue in the quarter. The resilience of our financial operating model resulted in an all-time high profitability and cash flow. In Q4, we delivered gross margin of 66% and operating margin of 29%, and earnings of $1.62 per share, and free cash flow of $308 million. For the year and despite COVID-related macro challenges and supply chain disruption, orders grew to $4.5 billion, an all-time high for Keysight. As you recall, in Q2, we responded to government directors to limit the spread of coronavirus and closed the majority of our offices worldwide, including our order fulfillment and manufacturing operations. We then ramped back up our production capacity in Q3. Despite this significant disruption, full year revenue of $4.2 billion declined only 2% year-over-year. Even in a difficult operating environment, we continue to deliver on our margin expansion commitments. Both, gross margin and operating margin improved by over 100 basis points generating a record $4.85 per share in earnings in fiscal year 2020. Turning to our markets; the Communications Solutions Group record quarterly revenue was driven by growth across the aerospace, defense and government, and commercial communications. Aerospace, defense and government revenue increased 13% year-over-year in Q4, driven by strength in the Americas and Asia, as defense modernizations continues to drive investments in technology with the focus on electromagnetic spectrum operations, space, and new commercial technologies like 5G. In Commercial Communications, 5G technology is scaling and drove strong demand across the design lifecycle from development to deployment. Keysight has the industry's most comprehensive range of 5G design and test solutions enabling the global buildout of networks and devices. 5G has been a strong growth driver for us for over the past three years, and we continue to see new use cases and ongoing innovation as the ecosystem scales and adapts to a new technology. A recent example of our 5G solutions approach includes collaboration on O-RAN with many industry leaders. Investment continues across the Commercial Communications market spanning wireless and wired technologies in data centers, and also in the cloud. This quarter, we announced a new high performance PXIe modular 5G base station solution. It is enabling network equipment manufacturers and small cell vendors to accelerate their time to market. This solution also incorporates enhancements from our PathWave software platform that help automate some of the current workflow limitations. Within Electronic Industrial Solutions Group, orders and revenue for our broad portfolio of general electronics solutions, both grew double-digit driven by gradual economic recovery across most regions and improvement in the education market. Demand for our semiconductor measurement solutions was again strong this quarter as investment in next-generation process technologies continued. In automotive, while macro-driven weakness continues to weigh on the sector, strategic investment in the advanced automotive technology is a market priority; we saw improvement from last quarter as orders grew double-digit sequentially across all regions. Our Scienlab electric vehicle test solutions are expanding in Asia and Europe where government mandates are driving the electrification of vehicles. We continue to add to our solutions portfolio and [pressing] [ph] challenges in the development of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems or ADAS, and ensuring compliance to important standards. In Q4, we introduced a new radar target simulator for ADAS being developed to enable autonomous driving, as well as a new solution for testing automotive Ethernet standards compliance for in-vehicle networks. We also recently announced collaborations with SGS and Qualcomm to advanced testing of cellular vehicle-to-everything or C-V2X technology. Turning to software and services, combined they were one-third of total Keysight revenue for this year after another quarter of solid growth. In addition, recurring revenue increased from 18% of total in FY '19 to 21% in FY '20. On an annualized basis, recurring revenue grew high-teens over last year. Software and services are important elements of our solution-centric strategy and differentiation, and further strengthened the durability of our business model. In Q4, we launched new and enhanced solutions to tap the power of cloud-based processing and advanced analytics to speed design simulation, validation and manufacturing test. These include several new PathWave software solutions targeting advanced design, compliance test, automation, and measurement and manufacturing analytics. Increasingly complex designs and the volume of data associated with their validation are driving demand for Keysight solutions. Keysight's execution and financial performance this year is a testament to Keysight's leadership model, our values, and our commitment to corporate social responsibility. A year ago, I shared with our teams my top priorities for the company. One of these priorities was a specific focus on increasing our inclusion and diversity efforts. In support of this priority, I appointed a new Senior Director of Inclusion and Diversity, who has been working with Keysight leaders and external organizations to increase representation of diverse groups within our workforce. We place a high value on inclusion and diversity at all levels of our organization, including the Board of Directors. We continue to make progress, and I'm pleased to share that as of today, over 30% of our U.S. executives are diverse in gender, race, and/or ethnicity. Before I turn the call over to Neil, I'd like to sincerely thank all of our Keysight employees for their relentless commitment, engagement, and dedication to our success over the past year. Our people and culture are truly a competitive differentiator. Thanks to their efforts, and in the face of unprecedented challenges, Keysight exits this year stronger than ever and is very well positioned to capitalize on our growth opportunities ahead. Now, I will turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail. Yes, I'd certainly expect any margin impact from a migration towards manufacturing to be more or less undetectable at the Keysight level when you think about $4.5 billion of revenue and the progress we're making generally, as a company around software and services and other areas. So, not something that we're concerned about. Make it a good one. Rick, this is Ron. Just one other comment, this is Ron. Just one other comment, we talked about the backlog build in FY 2020. You may want to also go back and look at the backlog build in FY 2019, because it's been a very steady build that we've had for many quarters beyond FY 2020. No, I think it's just broad uncertainty, right. Nobody knows exactly what's going to happen, and it's -- the question about seasonality; typically, we see plus or minus a couple of points as we move from quarter to quarter, you can go look at the history and see what that is. And all, I'm -- we're saying two things; one, you've got this -- you know, kind of broad overarching uncertainty around COVID, and then we've got this backlog burn that's going to be happening, and we think those are going to kind of more or less drown out the typical seasonality that we would see in a current year; so we're expecting a much more steady revenue flow over the course of the next several quarters. Yes. So I'll let Mark comment on that as well. I mean, I think we were a couple of years now into this -- kind of ongoing, back and forth around trade restrictions. And I will tell you that we've weathered it very well, our business in China continues to do very well. And so whether you're talking about the initial tariffs or companies added to the restricted party list or the situations with ZTE and Huawei; we've been through a lot of these things, and our China business continues to grow. We have a very broad portfolio, we have a very broad customer set, the types of things that Keysight does as a company is very well aligned with what's happening in China. And so, I just think that -- and Mark mentioned it, we've been very good at redirecting our own internal sales and other resources to where the market opportunities are. Mark, I don't know if you have anything that you want to add to that. Thank you, everyone for joining us. I -- we are very, very pleased with the results we delivered despite COVID and despite the trade environments; delivering record orders, record revenue record gross margin, record operating margin and record free cash flow. We really believe and see that we have a very strong market position with very differentiated solutions across the ecosystem. And our solutions incorporate world class hardware, very good and strong software analysis capability, as well as services. Our software content continues to increase, our services business is growing, and both of them together are giving us an even stronger business model with more recurring revenue. But our business model is strong, it was tested during the COVID period of time, and you could see the type of results that we can deliver. And last but not least, I really believe we have the best employees in the world that work very hard to bring our customers the best solutions in the world and support them as they try to innovate across their end-markets. And we are committed to create value as we've done in our first six years for our shareholders, and I really believe the best is yet to come. Thank you very much, and have a great day."

            "content": "Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. Before I begin, please note, that all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless specifically noted otherwise. As Ron mentioned, we delivered an outstanding quarter and despite a challenging macro environment, we continued to make great progress towards our long-term annual financial targets. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we delivered record revenue of $1.220 billion, which was above the high-end of our guidance range, and grew 9% or 7% on a core basis. Q4 revenue growth was driven by continued demand in areas such as 5G, semiconductor measurement, and aerospace defense where we have leading positions and differentiated solutions. Demand for general electronics improved significantly in the quarter driven by regional economic recovery, particularly in Asia. Total Keysight orders exceeded revenue in Q4 with the book-to-bill just over 1 [ph]. We delivered a record $1.231 billion in orders, up 3% or 1% on a core basis. Looking at our operational results for Q4; we reported gross margin of 66% and operating expenses of $446 million resulting in operating margin of 29%, an all-time quarterly high. Net income was a record $305 million, and we achieved $1.62 in earnings per share which was well above the high-end of our guidance, and an increase of 22% year-over-year. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 188 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments; our Communication Solutions Group generated record revenue of $901 million, up 8% while delivering record gross margin of 66% and record operating margin of 29%. In Q4, commercial communications generated revenue of $605 million, up 5% driven by strength across the 5G ecosystem from development to early manufacturing, Gen5 high-speed digital applications and data center related 400 gigabit and 800 gigabit technology. Aerospace, defense and government achieved record revenue of $296 million, an increase of 13% versus a prior all-time high in Q4 last year. Growth was driven by strength in the Americas and Asia with improvement in Europe. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated fourth quarter revenue of $319 million, up 12% or 7% on a core basis, driven by strength in general electronics and semiconductor. EISG reported gross margin of 65%, an increase of 230 basis points year-over-year and record operating margin of 30%. Given the challenges that we faced this year, we are very pleased with our full year results. FY '20 revenue totaled $4.2 billion, down 2% year-over-year or 3% on a core basis impacted by supply chain disruptions and macro challenges caused by the pandemic. Despite this small revenue decline, gross margin improved 140 basis points year-over-year to 65%. While continuing to invest in R&D at 16% of revenue or nearly $700 million for the year, operating margin improved 130 basis points to 25%. This year-over-year improvement demonstrates strong progress towards our annual operating margin target of 26% to 27% which we expect to achieve by fiscal 2023. FY '20 non-GAAP net income was $919 million or $4.85 per share for the full year. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended our fourth quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and reported cash flow from operations of $338 million and record free cash flow of $308 million. Free cash flow is net of a $100 million funding contribution to our U.S. pension plan in the quarter, which provides a tax benefit in the current year and a pension expense benefit in FY '21. Total free cash flow for the year was $899 million, representing 21% of revenue and 98% of non-GAAP net income. Under our prior share repurchase authorization, we were opportunistic in deploying capital during the quarter. We acquired approximately 2.2 million shares on the open market at an average price of $96.55 for a total consideration of $215 million and exhausting our $500 million share repurchase authorization from May of 2019. This brings our total share repurchases for the year to approximately 4.3 million shares at an average share price of $95.90 for a total consideration of $410 million or 46% of free cash flow. As announced earlier today, the Keysight Board of Directors has approved a new share repurchase authorization of $750 million, effective immediately. Before moving to FY '21 modeling and our Q1 guidance, I'd like to provide a brief update on global trade concerns. We admittedly have a tough order comp in Q1 due to China trade restrictions and the pending U.S. administration change, which has historically dampened government business during the transition. Despite these headwinds, we have started to see gradual improvements in many of our markets and are entering the year in a strong backlog position giving us confidence in our ability to navigate these near-term perturbations. Looking to FY '21, we expect quarterly revenue seasonality to be more muted than in the past due to ongoing COVID-19 and macro-related uncertainty. Just as we flexed expenses down this year, flexible spending and variable compensation is expected to increase in FY '21 to more normal levels, with Q2 expenses seasonally higher than all other quarters. In addition, FY '21 pension expenses reflected in the other expense line are expected to increase by $5 million per quarter. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $78 million and capital spending is expected to be in the range of $170 million to $180 million as we begin a two-year project to increase the resiliency of our supply chain. Regarding our tax rate, we are modeling a 12% non-GAAP effective tax rate for FY '21. Now turning to our outlook and guidance; we expect first quarter 2021 revenue to be in the range of $1.140 billion to $1.160 billion, and Q1 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.32 to $1.38 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 188 million shares. In closing, our solid outlook for revenue and earnings growth coupled with the durability of our business model give us confidence in our ability to deliver on the long-term financial commitments that we outlined in March prior to COVID. Despite the challenges of this past year, we continue to make good progress towards our long-term targets of 4% to 6% core revenue growth and annual operating margin of 26% to 27%. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A. Yes, this is Neil, why don't I take the first part of that and then maybe we will have Mark comment on China and some of our expectations there. I think the most important comment with regard to Huawei is, the situation with Huawei is not going to change our expectations as it relates to our long-term growth outlooks for our business or for our markets. We're entering the year in a very strong backlog position and I think that strong backlog position is going to enable us to essentially mitigate the impact of any short-term perturbations that may happen on the order line because of the year-over-year Huawei compares. We have an extraordinarily diverse base of customers around the world driving demand in our end markets and we're looking at that and the strengthening we've seen over the past couple of quarters relative to where we were in Q2 and we're going to keep our foot on the gas relative to those long-term targets. Yes, so let me start with the margin side of that first. So first of all, we're very pleased with the margin performance of the business in the year and we look at this year and some of the challenges of this year as a great test of the operating model that we've been talking about really since the launch of the company. That being said, our operating margin targets, our margin targets in general, they are annual targets, not quarterly targets. We hit 25% this year and we've talked about getting to 26% or 27% operating margin is the target that we outlined at our Analyst Day and we are still working towards that objective. I think we're highly confident in our ability to achieve that and as we look forward to this year, I think you can look to -- obviously, in the second and third quarters, with revenue down and the corresponding expenses down, but you saw in Q4 the margin performance that we can put up with expenses returning to a more normalized level. With regard to how we get back to mid-single digits, I think we are seeing some relative strengthening across the broader markets and of economies, in general. I think a great indicator of that is what we're seeing in general electronics. We saw a strong return in our education business, which is, as I think, indicative of some recovery from the COVID situation. Even looking at businesses like auto, while auto orders were still down on a year-over-year basis, we saw very strong sequential improvement in auto. So things are getting better and I think we're going to look really across the entire portfolio for strength and just broad macro strengthening to help drive us to those levels. We expect it to be about a 5 point headwind in the first half. That's roughly how we're thinking about it, but again, I think, given the backlog situation that we have coming into the year, I think that's going to be the dominant driver of our business and so I think that's going to give us the ability and give us some time to overcome what might be some short-term perturbations on the order line. We're highly confident going into the year. No, that's correct and I said as much in my prepared remarks, we clearly have a tough order comp in Q1, but I'd point you back to the backlog situation. We're guiding strong revenue growth in the first quarter and we're going to be in a good position as we migrate through the year. Certainly our revenue comps in Q2 and Q3 get significantly softer, obviously, but the backlog that we built over the last several quarters is going to provide a buffering for us. Let me take the first part of that and I'll let Satish maybe comment on the second part. We do have some ability to sell some small portions of our portfolio into Huawei going forward that don't include any material U.S. technology, but it is a very small portion of the portfolio. We do not expect Huawei to be a material customer for us going forward. Yes, we just think -- again, I'm going to bring you back to the backlog situation as we slowly work off the backlog that we built up over the last couple of quarters, we think that is going to essentially mute the impact of what would typically be more demand-driven quarterly seasonality that we've seen in prior years. We expect a much more muted revenue seasonality over the coming quarters, maybe with a slight uptick in Q4, but much more muted revenue seasonality than what is typical. Yes, I think that the big driver is, obviously, we've talked at length in prior quarters about our variable pay programs and the flexibility of our cost model. That's probably the single biggest driver. Then there are the obvious things that impact many companies, just dramatic reductions in travel, as an example. I would point you to our Q4 expenses. I think we've largely saw our spending return to more normalized levels here in the fourth quarter of the year. Obviously, we'll continue to do administration [ph] and other things, but I think as we look forward, you could look to Q4 as a baseline and then, as we said in the prepared remarks, we do expect Q2 to be higher than the other quarters from an OpEx standpoint in FY 2021. We have not seen any material and any change in de-booking. There is always some noise level of the de-bookings, but that hasn't changed at all. Obviously, we built a significant amount of backlog just looking at the difference between orders and revenue for the year, it's on the order of $300 million, a portion of which you would consider to be abnormal backlog build given the revenue disruptions or the shipment disruptions in the second and third quarter. So it's that abnormal portion of backlog build that we'll be looking to work off over the course of the next several quarters. Yes, so obviously, Jim, we've been a growing business here for a number of years and we would expect that our backlog would be growing in absolute terms just given the overall growth of the business. I think if you look at -- what you saw in Q4 was pretty much a reduction in the rate of growth of that backlog. We built very significant backlog in Q2 and Q3, as I previously referenced, abnormal levels of backlog because shipments were depressed because of the factory shutdown and re-ramp in Q3, while our book-to-bill was over 1, it was just a tick over 1, right? So we were more or less in a neutral position in the fourth quarter and so, as I think about going into next year, we have this backlog that is particularly focused on the abnormal amount of backlog build where we've got to get product delivered to customers. And I think on a positive note, really when we were in the process of building that backlog in Q2 and Q3, while orders remained strong because our customers' businesses were disrupted, we weren't in a situation where they were really pounding on the door saying in most cases -- we need immediate delivery of this product, and we really saw that tick up in the fourth quarter, which is what drove the revenues north of $1.2 billion and I think it's that dynamic of our customers now looking to take delivery of that backlog that was built in the Q2, Q3 time frame, that is going to be the predominant driver of revenue for the next couple of quarters. I'd say a couple of things about that. So first of all, obviously, we've made a commitment to at least at a minimum be anti-dilutive with our buyback programs and we will continue to do that. But just as you saw with us in Q4, and frankly, over the course of FY 2020, we will be opportunistic when those approach. And so, we were very pleased to take 4.3 million shares off the market at an average price somewhere around $96 this year bringing the share count down. And so, when we see those windows, we'll certainly do that, but at a bare minimum, you can count on us to keep the share count constant. We did say in our prepared remarks that we expect in FY 2021 our share count to be 188 million shares, which is flat. So that's our base case we're modeling. When I think about capital -- priorities for capital beyond share repurchase, we continue to have an active M&A funnel development process. We continue to look for ways to put money to work through M&A and assets that are accretive to growth, accretive to gross margin, much like the acquisition that we did of Eggplant at the end of last quarter. So, no real change for our capital allocation priorities at this point in time. Thank you. Sorry, let me repeat that, because I realized my mic was off. We continue to be very pleased with the progress we're making on gross margin. And really, there is a lot that goes into that. First of all, I'd start with software content, right. During this year, our software business continued to grow -- outgrow the broader company, until we continue to see nice growth in software and we continue to make great progress in the conversion of the way our customers buy software from us towards more time-based purchasing; so we've actually saw our annualized recurring revenue grow in the high-teens during FY '20, so that's helpful. We're making great progress; I talked about this last quarter in our services margin portfolio, that's a below average gross margin business for us. But on the operating mind, we have our services business now north of 20%, which has been a long-term goal, and a lot of that improvement has come on the gross margin line. And then, I would talk about our migration towards selling complete solutions across the entire portfolio, right. As we migrate to those complete solutions, they tend to be more highly differentiated, and we can monetize that differentiation. And so you couple that with the strength that we're seeing -- the strengthening we're seeing in the markets over the last couple of quarters. I mean, I think we're very pleased with the way orders -- the strength of orders really through the entire cycle of this year. But the strengthening in Q4, the broad indications of macro recovery across large portions of our portfolio, and large geographies around the world is -- as I think very favorable as we look into FY '20 -- excuse me, FY '21. Yes, it's a two-year program. So I'm envisioning, obviously, we're still a year away, but the FY '22 I think will be similar from a CapEx perspective. And we've essentially got some facility up; I would call it just -- kind of resiliency of our supply chain with some facility upgrades we need to do. In other cases, we're looking to get some alternative sourcing sites for some specialized productions for diversification purposes, those types of activities to just make sure that our supply chain is secure."

Keysight delivered stronger-than-expected third quarter results, demonstrating the exceptional resilience of our business for the second quarter in a row despite ongoing macro challenges. I am proud of how the Keysight team rapidly adapted to a new operating environment while delivering on our commitments to our customers, partners, and shareholders. Today, I'll focus my formal comments on three key headlines for the quarter. First, we delivered stronger-than-expected third quarter results with solid gross margin and record operating margin. Our differentiated solutions drove steady demand through the quarter, and our operational execution was exceptional as we ramped production capacity to nearly 100% by quarter end. Second, despite the ongoing pandemic uncertainty, we remain confident in our differentiated leadership position and the long-term secular growth trends driving our markets. The past two quarters have demonstrated the resilience of the Keysight leadership model, which we believe provides a durable competitive advantage for the long term. And third, despite near-term macro disruption, we expect to achieve year-over-year revenue and earnings growth in the fourth quarter. Now let's take a deeper look into our financial results and the market dynamics within the quarter. Despite the challenging macro-environment, demand for Keysight's differentiated solutions was steady through the quarter. Orders declined 4% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, in line with our typical Q2 to Q3 seasonality. Revenue declined 7% year-over-year while increasing 13% sequentially. The durability of our financial operating model and the flexibility of our cost structure was, again, exceptional as we delivered third quarter gross margin of 64% and record operating margin of 26% and free cash flow of $151 million. In commercial communications, we continue to see the global adoption of Keysight's 5G platform. Our end-to-end solutions for the 5G life cycle across both wired and wireless domain and from R&D and high-value manufacturing are enabling the ecosystem to scale from product development to deployments. 5G commercialization is progressing and on track to add an estimated 190 million subscribers in 2020. Device design and development investments continue to be strong, driven by the large-scale ramps in Asia. As 5G deployment expands and ongoing innovations gain customer interest, we continue to see strength in R&D. With several test house announcements this quarter, Keysight's leadership is further solidified as our 5G test platforms are now being used by all the leading test houses worldwide. Keysight's first-to-market 5G design and test solutions are also helping to accelerate and enable the virtualization of the radio access network and the rapid adoption of the open radio access network technologies. We also saw strong demand for our high-speed digital and optical solutions driven by 400G manufacturing, expansion, and an uptick in R&D investments in 800G. Keysight is well positioned to capitalize on commercial rollouts and mainstream deployments. Our comprehensive platform provides end-to-end solutions that enable customer innovation throughout the entire 5G life cycle. In aerospace, defense, and government, orders were strong in the U.S., offset by lower investment in Europe, and to a lesser extent, in Asia. We continue to see strong demand for our electromagnetic spectrum threat simulation platform as well as solutions for radar, space, satellite, and 5G. In addition, we continue to enable our customers' initiatives to increase their electronic supply chain capacity and reliability in the U.S., which we believe will be a multiyear opportunity. In the automotive sector, macro-driven weakness persists. However, the fundamental drivers for the long-term investment in electric and our autonomous vehicle technologies continue to be a strategic industry priority. As the industry adapts to tremendous change in multiple technology disruptions, Keysight is investing in first-to-market solutions and remains firmly engaged with key market players. We recently announced a multiyear collaboration with IPG Automotive and Nordsys to jointly develop a new modular test platform for autonomous drive emulation. This will accelerate the validation of advanced driver-assisted systems and functions for autonomous driving. Strategic investment in next-generation semiconductor process technology remains a priority for our customers. Demand is being driven by 5G smartphone processors, high-speed networking, and high-performance data center applications to serve the work-from-home economy. This trend resulted in double-digit year-over-year order growth for semiconductor measurement solutions. Software and services, again, delivered solid revenue growth this quarter. Our software-centric solutions strategy is providing strong value to our customers. Services and support, such as KeysightCare, continue to expand to higher value-added consulting and optimization offerings. At greater than 30% of total revenue, our growing mix of software and services is contributing to the durability of our business model while increasing recurring revenue and improving gross margins. With the bulk of our 5G opportunity ahead of us and millimeter-wave commercialization still in its early days, we recently launched a PathWave design 2021 software suite. This advanced software accelerates 5G design, simulation, and verification workflows with an integrated solution that ensures design performance, improves accuracy, and speeds time to market. In the manufacturing arena, Keysight continues to collaborate with leading 5G infrastructure customers, a new cloud-based PathWave manufacturing solutions. We continue to increase our solution differentiation with strategic acquisitions, expanding into the application layer in growing our addressable market. We recently acquired Eggplant, an industry-leading software test automation platform provider. Eggplant's differentiated technology uses artificial intelligence and analytics to automate test creation and test execution. With this acquisition, Keysight is now the only company that can provide test capability from the physical layer through the application layer and extending to the user experience, or UX. Eggplant's customers span a wide range of sectors overlapping Keysight's existing customer base while expanding software test opportunities into new end markets. Looking back at the past two quarters, our performance exemplifies the core values of the Keysight Leadership Model on multiple fronts. We demonstrated operational excellence and the durability of our financial operating model. KLM also expands beyond financial accountability and aligns with our foundational pillars of corporate social responsibility. We released our latest annual CSR report in May. We are proud to have surpassed our social impact goals in community and education while making progress on our governance and environmental goals, including climate change.  Lastly, as a result of recent events, we are taking further actions to expand our inclusion and diversity programs to advance racial equality. For example, we are working with academic institutions, including historically black colleges and universities to reinforce our diversity recruiting strategy. We are committed to accelerating racial equality and will do our part to make a difference. To wrap up my comments, Keysight's execution this quarter is a reflection of our values and our commitment to customers to deliver first-to-market solutions for their businesses and technology challenges. I couldn't be prouder of the Keysight team. They have risen to the occasion in a challenging environment and continue to execute on customer commitments, while at the same time upholding the values that makes Keysight a diverse, inclusive work environment with the culture of innovation, ownership, passion, and respect. Now, I will turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail.\nNeil Dougherty: Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. Note that all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless specifically noted otherwise. Keysight delivered a solid quarter, thanks to steady demand and strong execution. Despite a challenging economic environment and supply chain disruption, our financial and operational performance demonstrated the durability of our operating model as reported record operating margin and solid cash flow. This performance also proved for the second quarter in a row, the effectiveness of our financial playbook, which is designed to preserve margins and cash generation during challenging times. For the third quarter of 2020, we delivered revenue of $1.011 billion, down 7% on a reported and core basis. Our team executed well in ramping production capacity and managing supply chain constraints, which resulted in stronger-than-expected sequential revenue growth of 13%. Orders of $1.067 billion were down 4% on a reported and core basis and were steady through the quarter in aggregate. Regionally, demand accelerated in Asia and began to stabilize in the U.S., while Europe lagged as the pandemic continues to hamper their economic recovery. Turning to our operational results for Q3. We reported gross margin of 64% with improved mix and lower discretionary spending, offsetting the impact of lower revenue. Expenses were well managed as we benefited from our flexible cost structure and the specific actions that we initiated last quarter. The combination of strong gross margin performance and expense discipline resulted in record operating margin of 26%. Net income in the third quarter was $226 million. On a per-share basis, we delivered $1.19 in earnings on weighted average share count for the quarter of 190 million shares. Regarding the performance of our segments, we saw continued strength in 5G investments, both in R&D and in manufacturing as well as next-generation semiconductor node technologies, which drove double-digit order growth across both markets, respectively. This strength was offset by weaker spending in legacy communications, automotive, general electronics and international, aerospace defense and government markets. Exceptional execution and expense discipline resulted in CSG operating margin of 26% and EISG operating margin of 27%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our third quarter with $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, with $450 million of additional liquidity available under our undrawn revolving credit facility. Our quarter end cash balance reflects the impact of the $319 million net of cash acquisition of Eggplant. We reported cash flow from operations of $183 million and free cash flow of $151 million. We did not repurchase any shares during the quarter. Turning to our outlook and guidance. As Ron mentioned, we expect to make continued progress in Q4. And as a result, we expect fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of $1.170 billion to $1.190 and Q4 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.42 to $1.48 based on a weighted average share count of 190 million shares. At the midpoint, this represents 5% year-over-year revenue growth and 9% year-over-year earnings growth. These expectations assume limited incremental supply chain constraints or disruption from additional shutdowns or a second wave of the pandemic. While the near term remains challenging, the long-term secular growth trends in our markets remain intact. We continue to invest in R&D and focus on our long-term strategy of enabling customer success through first-to-market leading-edge solutions. As I mentioned last quarter, the durability of our business model, steady cash generation, strong balance sheet and market leadership give us confidence in our long-term core revenue growth target of 4% to 6% and operating margin target of 26% to 27%. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.\nJason Kary: Thank you, Neal. Chris, will you give the instructions for the Q&A, please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. \nSamik Chatterjee: If I can just start off with asking for a bit more color about the order trends. Orders did moderate slightly on a sequential basis, and I know you have referred to it as largely seasonal, but maybe if you can share some insights on what you're seeing in terms of order trends outside of the normal seasonality? For example, in commercial communication, how would the order trends for the quarter? And in the markets, end markets that are weak, for example, automotive, what are the magnitude of kind of declines or changes in order trends you're seeing there? And I have a follow-up.\nRon Nersesian: Samik, this is Ron. I'm going to ask Mark Wallace, the Head of Sales, to talk about the order trends first. And then I think Satish can also add some more color commentary towards your commercial communications questions.\nMark Wallace: Okay. Thanks, Ron. Samik, thanks for your question. So orders were very steady throughout the quarter. And actually, in certain areas, they trended to increase as we saw some of the COVID-related impact diminish. But we've seen continued investment in next-generation technologies with strong order growth in 5G. That's already been mentioned. Our high-speed digital and optical solutions to support our 400-gigabit data center expansion, customers around the world has been very strong. And the advanced semiconductor process technologies, including EUV, which is extreme ultraviolet. 5-nanometer continue to be very strong. And with semiconductor, in particular, we saw strength across all of the regions. So the other part that was up was aerospace defense for us in the U.S., and that was offset by some weakness in Europe. Principally due to the COVID effects and some mix conditions in Asia. The COVID impact, I would say, there was some disruption certainly across all regions, but Asia was least affected because they came out first. And on a relative basis, we saw a larger impact across Continental Europe, where many of the countries and economies started slowly restarting and reopening in late May and June. So where do we see this impact? We saw it in general electronics, some of our indirect channels and in areas where government funding was redirected like in education and in research. And then the macro impact from automotive remains soft. But as Ron noted, EV and AV continues to be a very strong top priority for our customers for the industry, and we had several large new customer wins in the quarter. So what I would summarize this as, overall, there were COVID-19 headwinds, but our sales productivity and customer engagement remained very high. We delivered steady and improving orders throughout the quarter. Much of that was delivered by growth and demand from our solutions for 5G, 400-gig, next-generation semi. And we also delivered strong growth for services as customers relied on us to help support their operations and the adoption of KeysightCare continues to grow. And we built a strong funnel along the way as well. So Satish, I'll hand it back to you and you can make some further comments on commercial costs.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I think, Mark, you covered it. I'll just maybe say that the strength in our 5G was broad, and we continue to see strong demand for our offerings.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. If I can just follow-up on question on margins and maybe this is more for Neil. But Neil, in calculating the implied operating margin of somewhere close to 27% in the fourth quarter based on your guidance and when I look at it on a sequential basis I think it's implying more of a 33% incremental margin. So I just wanted to check on that. It does sound a bit low. Particularly, it does imply your ramp up on the OpEx level that I wanted to check if that's really realistic given some of the changes you might have made in the cost structure as well as some of the temporary cost reductions you're benefiting from.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. we typically see some -- even in a normal and -- Sorry about that. My mic is now on, so it's probably easier to hear me. We do typically see even as in a typical year as you migrate from Q3 to Q4, some uptick in expenses, some of that is related to the field as we get to the back half of the year and the push to finish the year strong. The 40% incremental is never intended to be something that is quarter-to-quarter, there are going to be quarters where we're above and quarters where we're below, but we're committed to over the medium to long term achieving that 40% incremental, which is something we've been able to do. So that said, I think we're very well positioned from that perspective.\nOperator: And our next question is from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.\nBrandon Couillard: Maybe Ron or Neil, could you just elaborate on what you saw in China in the quarter in terms of core orders and revenues? And remind us what the total impact of the trade restrictions were in the third quarter, was that about 3% or 4% in total?\nRon Nersesian: Brandon, this is Ron. I'm going to pass this over to Mark, who manages, obviously, China sales, but I think he also can make some comments with regards to Huawei because new news came out this week.\nMark Wallace: Yes. Thanks, Ron. So, business in China during Q3 was strong. We saw order growth and revenue growth. And much like my comments earlier, we saw a steady flow of business throughout the quarter. Again, strength in 5G with some of the market leaders as well as increasingly selling to this longer tail of customers within the ecosystem, this is where we saw a lot of growth with high-speed digital and optical manufacturing, again, driven by this global demand from our data centers or the data center customers around the world, and China continued to invest in semiconductor capability. We saw some headwinds from COVID, mainly from other parts of the world as opposed to in China directly, some macroeconomic influence from automotive. We did see an impact in Q3 in aerospace and defense. As you may recall, there were some new regulations that were announced in May that were put into place in late June around military end-user customers. So, we saw a small effect because it was later in the quarter. We are starting to see some rebound in some of the markets that were early affected by COVID, like general electronics starting to show some signs of recovery. But outside the quarter, Ron referenced this earlier this week, there was a new regulation for Huawei and a broader entity list that was published. And this was describing some increased restrictions on the sale of products, which are manufactured outside of the U.S., but have U.S.-based technology or software as part of the development. So, this shift to tighter restrictions than the previous regulation will limit sales to Huawei and their affiliates. There were some additional announcements made on some additional affiliates added as well that don't have much of an impact. So I'm going to pass it to Neil to make some more quantitative comments. The one thing I will say, though, is that we faced adversity and challenges in China in the past, and we've been very effective at redirecting our focus and priorities and we're certainly looking at that as we continue to digest the information. So Neil, why don't I pass it to you, you can comment further on the FX.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes, I just wanted to give some more specific quantification of the likely impact of this new Huawei news. So we had said previously, based on previous rounds of restrictions to Huawei that we expected Huawei to be a 1% to 2% customer. Year-to-date, they've actually been exceeding that. They're closer to double that rate with increased sales in Q1, which we talked about and then, again, here in the third quarter. As we look forward to next year, it does look like these new restrictions are pretty comprehensive. And so we expect Huawei to be a very small customer for us going forward, but again if you think about it from long term, we were already expecting them to be a 1% to 2% customer. So the headwinds are a little bit bigger next year, potentially up to 4%. But over the long term, it's a pretty minor adjustment from what we've been expecting.\nBrandon Couillard: That's very helpful. Just maybe one for Ron on the Eggplant acquisition. It sounds like a pretty interesting asset. Can you sort of speak to the growth rate of the business, some of the primary end markets and the margin profile of the business and whether that acquisition is dilutive to EPS near-term or not?\nRon Nersesian: Sure, Brandon. Eggplant is really an exciting acquisition for us. Again, as we move more and more to software-centric solutions. This fits in right with our strategy. And the way to think about this is a lot of our products or most of our products test hardware or test firmware within our customers' end products. This tests software, so we're finally using software to test software. And in particular, this is used to test user interface development. So when someone's developing new user interface, how do you know that it's effective and it will be something that can get customers through the interface and have a really good user experience. So it's a special unique set of AI that's existed by anybody that creates any type of user experience on the web. The customer base is broad aerospace defense, it's one area where there is a lot of sales, but it even sells, for instance, even into the financial community. It is accretive to us. It's a small acquisition. It is growing and growing roughly double digits. But it has tremendous potential as we marry that in the future with the rest of Keysight and, in particular, with our PathWave architecture.\nOperator: Next question is from John Marchetti with Stifel.\nJohn Marchetti: I was wondering if we could just come back to China, maybe a little bit more broadly and not just Huawei, in particular. Neil, I know you gave us some of the numbers there about the headwind that you're expected to face. But you mentioned some of the strength you saw in their efforts to be more semiconductor independent and things like that. How much, I guess, is we're looking a little bit more broadly than just Huawei? Do you see this as a potential headwind as we look out maybe over the next several quarters, if we're going to see some broader entity -- enforcement on this list against U.S. technology?\nMark Wallace: So John, this is Mark. I'll answer part of that question. So first of all, China, as we've said before, is a very -- and you mentioned this, a very broad, diverse business for us because we serve multiple segments. And semi is one of those, right? Now based on the regulations that were just put out, our semiconductor test solutions are not directly affected by the new regulations as these parametric test systems are engineered and manufactured outside the U.S. So what we are watching is a possible impact from reduced capacity demand for chips through the foundries. We're monitoring that situation and looking at the forward-looking path. But again, we expect to see continued investments driven by 5G or the other leading technologies, not only in China, but from around the world to support these next-generation process technologies.\nJohn Marchetti: Got it. And then maybe if when we look out over the next quarter or so, how should we think maybe about some of these geographies. You said you saw some improvements, obviously, post-COVID. As that continues maybe to get a little bit better in Europe and, hopefully, here in North America, do you expect some of the easy order strength or some of the momentum come back into that order line? Just sort of getting back to Samik's question about down again on a year-over-year basis, a little bit worse sequentially. Just trying to get a sense for how you're feeling about the overall order trends of the business.\nMark Wallace: Yes. So if you're referring to semi specifically, there's going to still be market constraints in the coming quarters. The demand will be based somewhat on supply and how much acceleration occurs in the end markets. More broadly, we are seeing improving conditions clearly in North America at the early rebound of some of the business that was impacted by COVID in Europe, in particular. We saw the sequential improvement during Q3, particularly in Europe, and we expect to see that continue in those two geographies. Asia is pretty much through that as we stand now. And then you have some seasonal effects with aerospace defense being large in the U.S. in Q4, and we're expecting to see that surge occur, again, as we get to the end of the government's fiscal year. \nOperator: Next question is from Tim Long with Barclays.\nTim Long: I wanted to ask on the 5G side. Could you talk a little bit about where we are in the transition to the manufacturing side, it sounded like both R&D and manufacturing were strong in the quarter. But could you just touch on kind of where you're starting to see a little bit more traction on the manufacturing side as equipment manufacturers start to ramp up to meet the growing demand and then secondly, if we could just touch on 400-gig and 800-gig. It sounds pretty positive for the traditional wireline and Ixia businesses. Could you just give us a little color on kind of the complexion of that business. How much is data center? How much is telco? How much is in the China end market? That would be great.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thanks. I think, first, I want to say that from a 5G perspective, the industry continues to progress in a very strong manner. There have been some pushouts in some parts of the world, acceleration in others. Net-net, our long-term view and outlook remains unchanged, and we look at it both from deployments and actually the number of devices that are going to be manufactured this year. So pretty strong from that point of view. And we see that strength reflected in increasing demand for our R&D solutions, but also on a year-over-year basis, we had a very strong uptick for our manufacturing solutions. I think I referenced before, our modular offerings, especially are resonating very well with base station manufacturing and components, and our funnel strength in that area continues to be strong as well. With regard to the 400-gig business, this is the third straight quarter where that business has had strong growth. We've had differentiated offerings. You're right in that a lot of the demand so far has been driven by the web scale companies into data centers, which we think will continue to accelerate and the industry is not done and awaiting. So there's more innovation on the 800-gig that's underway as well and a bulk of this opportunity from a production perspective is playing out in Asia, and we're capturing majority of the share on that front. And we'll continue to see that as the industry progresses to 5G and especially stand-alone use cases, more of the operator-based or metro-based versions of 400-gig play out. So we feel strong about the overall wireline opportunity as well.\nRon Nersesian: I would just add a comment, too. When you look at oscilloscope, which includes sampling scopes that serve this optical market, the results were very strong with double-digit growth in orders. And when we look at that on a competitive basis, we're very happy with our performance and our relative performance.\nOperator: Next question is from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna.\nMehdi Hosseini: My first one has to do with your guide. When I look at the past 3 to 4 years, you have done a great job of keeping book-to-bill above 1.0. And if I were to take the midpoint of your revenue guide, it would suggest that booking would have to be up by double digit on a sequential basis and kind of flattish on a year-over-year basis. And I'm not asking for a guide or a booking, but I'm just wondering the funnel of business opportunities that you laid out last earnings conference call seems to me that is beginning to materialize, especially with COVID behind us. And is this the right way to think about it? And anything else you can add to it will be great. And then I have a follow-up.\nRon Nersesian: Sure, Mehdi. Yes obviously, we don't guide orders, as you know, and we haven't commented on orders in general. We have built our backlog up over the past quarters. That's good. And given all the supply constraints and things that come in from external to Keysight's manufacturing, we see that backlog position that we have remaining roughly in the same area with some puts and takes as we go forward. And as far as orders, as far as going in that, we're very pleased where we are. Quarter-by-quarter, we'll see how Q4 happens. We clearly were very pleased with our order performance this last quarter and our book-to-bill based on what's going on in the environment. But I'll leave it at that.\nMehdi Hosseini: Got it. And I wanted to dive into the networking Ixia. It seems to me that based on the peer group, there is acceleration on R&D for 600 and 800-gig and perhaps this could minimize the tailwind of 400. And I'm just wondering if you could comment on it just to remind us how you see your networking split between R&D and production.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I think the way to think about it, Mehdi, is we have a diverse portfolio in commercial communications. And on the wireline side, have a good breadth for solutions, both between R&D and production, and they sort feed each other. We start early with customers and follow that life cycle as they get into production and get back into deployments with operators. So it's that whole, let's say, solution franchise that we have that allows us to maintain a pretty steady business. And on the wireline side, in particular, the business has been a lot more steady and augmented by the addition of the layer two, layer three capabilities from the Ixia acquisition. So yes, right now, data centers is driving 400-gig demand. We expect then the telecom demand to pick up and then simultaneously 800-gig with the first instantiation being 100-gig serial-based will start, and that goes into production. So these waves continue and give us a lot of stability in our commercial communications outlook.\nMehdi Hosseini: But does that include the R&D that is being scaled for the next generation?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Absolutely. Yes.\nOperator: Next question is from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.\nMark Delaney: First just something to better understand the growth outlook in the EISG segment and understanding that the comments that the company made in prepared remarks about some weakness that has been seen in the industrial and automotive portions of your business. But when I look at the ISM Index back to year-over-year growth, auto production is ramping back up pretty quickly. The company commented about electric and autonomous vehicle investment continuing. I'm wondering when you think some of those factors may translate into better demand indicators for your EISG segment?\nRon Nersesian: Mark, this is Ron. First of all, congratulations on your new role. And thank you very much for covering Keysight. We're happy to have you with us. With regards to automotive, we're not ready to call a big upturn. We've seen the negative rates of growth in the automotive industry, although the second order -- where the second derivative, I should say, is positive and the growth rate or the decline rate is lessening, we're still not at a point where we believe that, that's translating into more and more cash into the auto industry, which would feed into the R&D funds. So we're going to play it cautiously through this period of time, we are ready, obviously, to capitalize on any new spending that's there. And where you see a lot of the spending in AV and EV, it's really a big strategic priority for us. We have a lot of solutions that are in the market, and we have other ones that we're working on. And over this multiyear scenario, we see tremendous potential for us.\nMark Delaney: And also, thank you for the nice welcome. And for my other question, I do want to understand on EBIT margins, company did a 26% non-GAAP EBIT margin this quarter, which I believe was the target model for 2023. So coming in well ahead of your plan with respect to profitability margins. Maybe you can talk about how sustainable you think this level of EBIT margin may be certainly implied to be at the kind of levels again next quarter. But as you think about between now and 2023, you're already at those levels today? Is this something that you think you can sustain? Or can you even potentially operate above your target margins?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. Obviously, we just put out those long-term target margins of 26% to 27%. And as I said in my prepared comments over the longer term, we are highly confident in our ability to get to and sustain those things. Obviously, we've hit 26% this quarter. These are clearly not normal times nor do we expect next quarter to be normal times. We have a unique operating model that allows us to maintain profitability and cash flow generation in tough economic times. A key portion of that model is the variable pay component for 100% of our employees, the drivers there, organic growth and operating margin. Obviously, the organic growth situation right now, driven by the macroeconomy is allowing us to save significant money on the single biggest component of our cost structure, which is our people. We see other areas so that's a direct result of COVID, spending has decreased significantly, whether that's travel, which is an obvious one, R&D project materials with engineers working from home, those types of things as well as we've taken specific actions around NKWs and -- excuse me, temporary workers and in other areas to really put a clamp on discretionary spending. So again, over the longer term, we're committed to 26% to 27%. We're very pleased with the results we're getting in the short run. As those costs come back as we face some other expenses as we go into '21, one of the things we are watching very carefully is our pension expense. With interest rates being at historically low levels, we're expecting pension expenses to increase next year. So there are going to be some things that in the short run are going to probably push us back a little bit the other direction in turn, but we're well on our way towards a long-term trend of getting to and sustaining those 26% to 27% operating margins.\nRon Nersesian: Yes. As Neil said, there are a lot of things, puts and takes that we're managing, as he said, everything from pension expenses in this low interest rate environment. We had temporary executive salary cuts. The overall comp that we had on a variable pay basis, travel, et cetera. However, it is worthwhile to note from my chair, it's always a balance between long-term profitability and short-term profitability. And as we look at this, as we look at the margins, could we take the margins a little bit higher? Yes. But we're investing to make sure we have a differentiated, competitive advantage versus the competition and can give customer solutions that they want to provide growth. And as we model this all out, we think we're in a very good shape to create the most value for the shareholders, balancing investment with short-term return.\nOperator: The next question is from Jim Suva with Citigroup Investment Research.\nJim Suva: I have two questions, and I'll ask them at the same time. So you could kind of answer them at any order you wanted. But regarding the Eggplant acquisition that you just closed, can you talk to us a little bit about the contribution for the revenues that it will be for the quarter outlook you did? I'm trying to look at the organic growth rate. I want to see what's going on there. And does it also impact your order growth rate that you just reported, which I think was down about 4% for this reported quarter? Or is Eggplant not into your orders? Then my second question is, can you help us better understand about the connection between your higher revenues next quarter year-over-year, yet your order rates still being negative year-over-year? Kind of how do you bridge those two fundamental metrics?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. Let me take the first question with regard to Eggplant. As you know, or as we've said, it's a relatively small business. But as we report core growth numbers, relative to as reported, we would expect Eggplant to have about a 1-point impact on our growth rates. It's going to add about a point of growth on, either the order or revenue line on a go-forward basis. Obviously, they were only part of Keysight for a portion of the third quarter. But on a go-forward basis, that puts it into an order of magnitude. With regard to Q4 and kind of the revenue being sequentially up, but orders continuing to be down on a year-over-year basis, obviously, we are in a strong backlog position. We've been building capacity over the course of the last 3 months and are now in a position where we can ship essentially at a level that was on par with where we were before coming into COVID, and so that's driving revenue As Mark said, the macroeconomy is still highly uncertain. We're seeing areas of relative strength and areas of relative weakness, but the COVID situation is impacting more or less every business in the industry equally, and we remain confident in our competitive position and the strength of our technology and over the long-term in the secular growth trends that are driving our end markets.\nOperator: Next question is from Rick Eastman with Baird.\nRick Eastman: A tremendous quarter. Just a question around the book-to-bill here in the quarter. Obviously, the math is at 1.05 for Keysight in the quarter. Could you just give us a sense, was the book-to-bill greater than 1 in EISG and A&D?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. Obviously, we're not reporting orders at the segment level. You have the information for Keysight, and we're just not going into that level of granularity.\nRick Eastman: Okay. Well, let me ask another question. When you look at EISG orders, and potentially, aerospace and defense and you just look at the absolute dollar amount of the orders, is there a general sense that we're stabilizing at this lower level? I mean, we assume the book-to-bill of one. Is there some stabilization in the overall EISG business? And the same question around aerospace defense.\nNeil Dougherty: Let me take the EISG portion, and then I'll let Satish address the CSG and specifically the aerospace defense question. EISG, we've talked about the various segments within EISG. And we clearly have an auto industry that is going through some pretty difficult times and our business selling directly into auto was similarly impacted, right? And so you're seeing, I'd say, a more severe macro impact or an above-average negative macro impact in the auto industry. At the flip side, you've got the semi industry, within EISG, which is doing very well right now as folks are investing in process technology, you have 5G and other things that are driving semiconductor demand. And so not just us, but across the semi industry, you're seeing relative strength even in a time of broad macro weakness. And then the third piece being general electronics is the one that's kind of most macro-tied, and we've often talked about that being as our most GDP-linked business. And so there, I think you're going to see the performance of our general electronics business largely mirror what happens with the broader economy as we recover from COVID. So Satish, do you want to comment on aerospace defense?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Sure. So obviously, I think you see the revenue line was down for the aerospace and defense business. But when you look at the orders, this was the second highest Q3 in the last five years. So the business is actually holding up very well with strength in the U.S. And our own position with respect to electromagnetic spectrum operations, 5G and space and satellite is strong. And when you couple that with the prime contractor backlog that has continued to increase through the year, it also sort of portends a strong indicator for future orders as well.\nRick Eastman: Okay. And then if I could just sneak in one more thing. Satish, lots of puts and takes around adoption curves for sub-6 and for millimeter wave. I'm curious if there is a measurable impact on either orders or demand as Open RAN seems to be maybe gaining some traction. And again, I don't know what the Keysight's content would be into those development efforts, but is that having any kind of measurable impact on demand, whether it be orders or revenue?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Well, first of all, I want to say our 5G platform continues to do well across the ecosystem and on a whole range of applications, so we call it the end-to-end platform, both wireless and wireline, as Ron has mentioned before. I would say the next sort of demand driver in the business continues to be the adoption of the stand-alone version of 5G, along with millimeter wave, and then we just had to release 16 version of standard that just got passed in July. So we have some strong drivers going for the business. When you then compound it with this macro situation that's going on with security concerns around for base stations clearly Open RAN or virtualized RAN has got a lot of interest. And the fact that we have the total technology stack, including Ixia's core network test capabilities that we're now able to purpose to address this opportunity. In fact, this quarter, we just launched our Open RAN toolkit to enable developers there. While there isn't a big player yet that's emerging in Open RAN, there's a lot of customers. It's broader market space that's emerging with different test needs and interoperability needs. We're participating in the O RAN standards, and we're already starting to book some orders as well.\nOperator: Next question is from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson, Davis.\nAdam Thalhimer: Curious for your revenue outlook for Q4, do you see revenue up in both segments? Or is the growth really driven by communications?\nNeil Dougherty: Are you talking sequentially or year-over-year?\nAdam Thalhimer: Year-over-year.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. We don't guide at the segment level. So I don't think that's information we want to share at this point in time.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. And then I was hoping maybe you could give some high-level '21 thoughts, just given that two quarters of low single-digit order declines, how that might juxtapose against your thoughts on '21 growth?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. For '21, it's difficult to call even three months out. Obviously, we've got a lot of factors that are at play, including what's the pace of the COVID recovery, what happens with the U.S. elections and those types of things. Again, I think as we look over the longer term, we continue to be encouraged by our relative position in the marketplace. We recognize that those macro factors are going to more or less impact everybody equally. And so not only our market position, but the strength of our portfolio and our technology is going to enable us to weather everything better than most. And so we're very encouraged by that. I did touch on some of the specific headwinds that we're going to be facing going into FY '21, specifically about Huawei. But other than that, we've got a great operating model. I think that's driving strong profitability and cash flow today, and that will continue to do so no matter how the macroeconomy develops over the course of the next several quarters.\nOperator: Next question is from David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: So I wanted to ask how much of the backlog that you built in second quarter, so you had about a $200 million build, were you able to ship in the third quarter?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. As you can see, we built backlog here again in the third quarter. So we did not see a backlog reduction. I guess the way I would answer that is we're working very closely with our customers to meet their most urgent delivery needs. And to this point, we are not aware of a single instance where we have lost an order because of inability to ship. So we continue to -- we revamp production consistently throughout the year. We're very close to 100% capacity across all of our internal manufacturing. We do see some supply chain constraints regard -- with some of our suppliers, but we're very actively managing those. And as Ron said, as we look forward, we expect our backlog position to be similar to where it is today.\nRon Nersesian: And tactically, I think it's probably pretty obvious. A lot of the orders that we received that went into backlog in Q2 were shipped in Q3. However, the orders that came in Q3, in particular, typically, the orders that come in towards the end of Q3 go into the backlog. So although you don't see a backlog change in Q3 or you see one of your roughly $50 million, it doesn't mean we ship those orders and didn't get to Q3. It's always two rolling accounts, and we're always shipping first based on customer requirement. And typically, the customer requirements that we receive from the Q2 orders are things that are needed by our customers before the Q3 orders. So it's rolling. We are clearing out, obviously, what we received in Q2. And then in Q3, we build up again and it sort of works that way through the quarter, depending on the seasonality month-to-month.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Got it. And as you sit here in August, do you think it would -- there's a six month time frame for kind of getting back to, if you will, sort of a normal backlog age, i.e., shipping all the things on a normal schedule, if you will?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. We're back to, as I said, close to 100% capacity at this point in time and very successfully managing other supply chain constraints. So I think we are right now shipping for an overall schedule and able to meet the demand requirements of our customers.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Got it. And just one last one, if I could. Was there anything unusual in terms of the mix of revenues that was either a benefit or a drag on gross margins?\nNeil Dougherty: The only thing I would say is that, obviously, we had a very strong -- semi business continues to be very strong at this point in time, and that tends to be above-average from a gross margin perspective. And then we continue to see great performance in our software business, adding recurring revenue. Software and services in combination, as we mentioned, north of 30% of our total revenue, and so that is also additive to gross margins.  And even if you look at services, specifically, it is a below-average gross margin business, but we have, over the course of the last -- services used to be a separately reported segment for us. Over the course of the last 18 months, we've continued to make great progress on services profitability. So we've talked over the long term about getting services profitability up north of 20%, and we now achieve that objective for our services. So it's come a long way as well. It's not as dilutive as it used to be.\nRon Nersesian: Yes, the services business, which has been part of our growth strategies. That was one of our key elements, continues to grow. Orders and revenue grew double digits. And that is a chain that keeps going. And that helps our ARR. There's no doubt about that. And it has increased our margins. And as Neil mentioned, it's above 20%. And also, software typically grows faster than the rest of our business, and that helps our gross margin. But we produced a real solid 64% gross margin this quarter, and there's nothing really unusual with regard to what we delivered relative to our strategy.\nOperator: That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to turn the conference back to Jason Kary for any closing comments.\nJason Kary: Well, thank you, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with many of you at the upcoming virtual conferences. And with that, I wish you to have a great day. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Ron. Samik, thanks for your question. So orders were very steady throughout the quarter. And actually, in certain areas, they trended to increase as we saw some of the COVID-related impact diminish. But we've seen continued investment in next-generation technologies with strong order growth in 5G. That's already been mentioned. Our high-speed digital and optical solutions to support our 400-gigabit data center expansion, customers around the world has been very strong. And the advanced semiconductor process technologies, including EUV, which is extreme ultraviolet. 5-nanometer continue to be very strong. And with semiconductor, in particular, we saw strength across all of the regions. So the other part that was up was aerospace defense for us in the U.S., and that was offset by some weakness in Europe. Principally due to the COVID effects and some mix conditions in Asia. The COVID impact, I would say, there was some disruption certainly across all regions, but Asia was least affected because they came out first. And on a relative basis, we saw a larger impact across Continental Europe, where many of the countries and economies started slowly restarting and reopening in late May and June. So where do we see this impact? We saw it in general electronics, some of our indirect channels and in areas where government funding was redirected like in education and in research. And then the macro impact from automotive remains soft. But as Ron noted, EV and AV continues to be a very strong top priority for our customers for the industry, and we had several large new customer wins in the quarter. So what I would summarize this as, overall, there were COVID-19 headwinds, but our sales productivity and customer engagement remained very high. We delivered steady and improving orders throughout the quarter. Much of that was delivered by growth and demand from our solutions for 5G, 400-gig, next-generation semi. And we also delivered strong growth for services as customers relied on us to help support their operations and the adoption of KeysightCare continues to grow. And we built a strong funnel along the way as well. So Satish, I'll hand it back to you and you can make some further comments on commercial costs. Yes. Thanks, Ron. So, business in China during Q3 was strong. We saw order growth and revenue growth. And much like my comments earlier, we saw a steady flow of business throughout the quarter. Again, strength in 5G with some of the market leaders as well as increasingly selling to this longer tail of customers within the ecosystem, this is where we saw a lot of growth with high-speed digital and optical manufacturing, again, driven by this global demand from our data centers or the data center customers around the world, and China continued to invest in semiconductor capability. We saw some headwinds from COVID, mainly from other parts of the world as opposed to in China directly, some macroeconomic influence from automotive. We did see an impact in Q3 in aerospace and defense. As you may recall, there were some new regulations that were announced in May that were put into place in late June around military end-user customers. So, we saw a small effect because it was later in the quarter. We are starting to see some rebound in some of the markets that were early affected by COVID, like general electronics starting to show some signs of recovery. But outside the quarter, Ron referenced this earlier this week, there was a new regulation for Huawei and a broader entity list that was published. And this was describing some increased restrictions on the sale of products, which are manufactured outside of the U.S., but have U.S.-based technology or software as part of the development. So, this shift to tighter restrictions than the previous regulation will limit sales to Huawei and their affiliates. There were some additional announcements made on some additional affiliates added as well that don't have much of an impact. So I'm going to pass it to Neil to make some more quantitative comments. The one thing I will say, though, is that we faced adversity and challenges in China in the past, and we've been very effective at redirecting our focus and priorities and we're certainly looking at that as we continue to digest the information. So Neil, why don't I pass it to you, you can comment further on the FX. So John, this is Mark. I'll answer part of that question. So first of all, China, as we've said before, is a very -- and you mentioned this, a very broad, diverse business for us because we serve multiple segments. And semi is one of those, right? Now based on the regulations that were just put out, our semiconductor test solutions are not directly affected by the new regulations as these parametric test systems are engineered and manufactured outside the U.S. So what we are watching is a possible impact from reduced capacity demand for chips through the foundries. We're monitoring that situation and looking at the forward-looking path. But again, we expect to see continued investments driven by 5G or the other leading technologies, not only in China, but from around the world to support these next-generation process technologies. Yes. So if you're referring to semi specifically, there's going to still be market constraints in the coming quarters. The demand will be based somewhat on supply and how much acceleration occurs in the end markets. More broadly, we are seeing improving conditions clearly in North America at the early rebound of some of the business that was impacted by COVID in Europe, in particular. We saw the sequential improvement during Q3, particularly in Europe, and we expect to see that continue in those two geographies. Asia is pretty much through that as we stand now. And then you have some seasonal effects with aerospace defense being large in the U.S. in Q4, and we're expecting to see that surge occur, again, as we get to the end of the government's fiscal year."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Satish Dhanasekaran",
            "content": "Yes. I think, Mark, you covered it. I'll just maybe say that the strength in our 5G was broad, and we continue to see strong demand for our offerings. Yes. Thanks. I think, first, I want to say that from a 5G perspective, the industry continues to progress in a very strong manner. There have been some pushouts in some parts of the world, acceleration in others. Net-net, our long-term view and outlook remains unchanged, and we look at it both from deployments and actually the number of devices that are going to be manufactured this year. So pretty strong from that point of view. And we see that strength reflected in increasing demand for our R&D solutions, but also on a year-over-year basis, we had a very strong uptick for our manufacturing solutions. I think I referenced before, our modular offerings, especially are resonating very well with base station manufacturing and components, and our funnel strength in that area continues to be strong as well. With regard to the 400-gig business, this is the third straight quarter where that business has had strong growth. We've had differentiated offerings. You're right in that a lot of the demand so far has been driven by the web scale companies into data centers, which we think will continue to accelerate and the industry is not done and awaiting. So there's more innovation on the 800-gig that's underway as well and a bulk of this opportunity from a production perspective is playing out in Asia, and we're capturing majority of the share on that front. And we'll continue to see that as the industry progresses to 5G and especially stand-alone use cases, more of the operator-based or metro-based versions of 400-gig play out. So we feel strong about the overall wireline opportunity as well. Yes. I think the way to think about it, Mehdi, is we have a diverse portfolio in commercial communications. And on the wireline side, have a good breadth for solutions, both between R&D and production, and they sort feed each other. We start early with customers and follow that life cycle as they get into production and get back into deployments with operators. So it's that whole, let's say, solution franchise that we have that allows us to maintain a pretty steady business. And on the wireline side, in particular, the business has been a lot more steady and augmented by the addition of the layer two, layer three capabilities from the Ixia acquisition. So yes, right now, data centers is driving 400-gig demand. We expect then the telecom demand to pick up and then simultaneously 800-gig with the first instantiation being 100-gig serial-based will start, and that goes into production. So these waves continue and give us a lot of stability in our commercial communications outlook. Absolutely. Yes. Sure. So obviously, I think you see the revenue line was down for the aerospace and defense business. But when you look at the orders, this was the second highest Q3 in the last five years. So the business is actually holding up very well with strength in the U.S. And our own position with respect to electromagnetic spectrum operations, 5G and space and satellite is strong. And when you couple that with the prime contractor backlog that has continued to increase through the year, it also sort of portends a strong indicator for future orders as well. Well, first of all, I want to say our 5G platform continues to do well across the ecosystem and on a whole range of applications, so we call it the end-to-end platform, both wireless and wireline, as Ron has mentioned before. I would say the next sort of demand driver in the business continues to be the adoption of the stand-alone version of 5G, along with millimeter wave, and then we just had to release 16 version of standard that just got passed in July. So we have some strong drivers going for the business. When you then compound it with this macro situation that's going on with security concerns around for base stations clearly Open RAN or virtualized RAN has got a lot of interest. And the fact that we have the total technology stack, including Ixia's core network test capabilities that we're now able to purpose to address this opportunity. In fact, this quarter, we just launched our Open RAN toolkit to enable developers there. While there isn't a big player yet that's emerging in Open RAN, there's a lot of customers. It's broader market space that's emerging with different test needs and interoperability needs. We're participating in the O RAN standards, and we're already starting to book some orders as well."

            "name": "Ron Nersesian",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. Keysight delivered stronger-than-expected third quarter results, demonstrating the exceptional resilience of our business for the second quarter in a row despite ongoing macro challenges. I am proud of how the Keysight team rapidly adapted to a new operating environment while delivering on our commitments to our customers, partners, and shareholders. Today, I'll focus my formal comments on three key headlines for the quarter. First, we delivered stronger-than-expected third quarter results with solid gross margin and record operating margin. Our differentiated solutions drove steady demand through the quarter, and our operational execution was exceptional as we ramped production capacity to nearly 100% by quarter end. Second, despite the ongoing pandemic uncertainty, we remain confident in our differentiated leadership position and the long-term secular growth trends driving our markets. The past two quarters have demonstrated the resilience of the Keysight leadership model, which we believe provides a durable competitive advantage for the long term. And third, despite near-term macro disruption, we expect to achieve year-over-year revenue and earnings growth in the fourth quarter. Now let's take a deeper look into our financial results and the market dynamics within the quarter. Despite the challenging macro-environment, demand for Keysight's differentiated solutions was steady through the quarter. Orders declined 4% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, in line with our typical Q2 to Q3 seasonality. Revenue declined 7% year-over-year while increasing 13% sequentially. The durability of our financial operating model and the flexibility of our cost structure was, again, exceptional as we delivered third quarter gross margin of 64% and record operating margin of 26% and free cash flow of $151 million. In commercial communications, we continue to see the global adoption of Keysight's 5G platform. Our end-to-end solutions for the 5G life cycle across both wired and wireless domain and from R&D and high-value manufacturing are enabling the ecosystem to scale from product development to deployments. 5G commercialization is progressing and on track to add an estimated 190 million subscribers in 2020. Device design and development investments continue to be strong, driven by the large-scale ramps in Asia. As 5G deployment expands and ongoing innovations gain customer interest, we continue to see strength in R&D. With several test house announcements this quarter, Keysight's leadership is further solidified as our 5G test platforms are now being used by all the leading test houses worldwide. Keysight's first-to-market 5G design and test solutions are also helping to accelerate and enable the virtualization of the radio access network and the rapid adoption of the open radio access network technologies. We also saw strong demand for our high-speed digital and optical solutions driven by 400G manufacturing, expansion, and an uptick in R&D investments in 800G. Keysight is well positioned to capitalize on commercial rollouts and mainstream deployments. Our comprehensive platform provides end-to-end solutions that enable customer innovation throughout the entire 5G life cycle. In aerospace, defense, and government, orders were strong in the U.S., offset by lower investment in Europe, and to a lesser extent, in Asia. We continue to see strong demand for our electromagnetic spectrum threat simulation platform as well as solutions for radar, space, satellite, and 5G. In addition, we continue to enable our customers' initiatives to increase their electronic supply chain capacity and reliability in the U.S., which we believe will be a multiyear opportunity. In the automotive sector, macro-driven weakness persists. However, the fundamental drivers for the long-term investment in electric and our autonomous vehicle technologies continue to be a strategic industry priority. As the industry adapts to tremendous change in multiple technology disruptions, Keysight is investing in first-to-market solutions and remains firmly engaged with key market players. We recently announced a multiyear collaboration with IPG Automotive and Nordsys to jointly develop a new modular test platform for autonomous drive emulation. This will accelerate the validation of advanced driver-assisted systems and functions for autonomous driving. Strategic investment in next-generation semiconductor process technology remains a priority for our customers. Demand is being driven by 5G smartphone processors, high-speed networking, and high-performance data center applications to serve the work-from-home economy. This trend resulted in double-digit year-over-year order growth for semiconductor measurement solutions. Software and services, again, delivered solid revenue growth this quarter. Our software-centric solutions strategy is providing strong value to our customers. Services and support, such as KeysightCare, continue to expand to higher value-added consulting and optimization offerings. At greater than 30% of total revenue, our growing mix of software and services is contributing to the durability of our business model while increasing recurring revenue and improving gross margins. With the bulk of our 5G opportunity ahead of us and millimeter-wave commercialization still in its early days, we recently launched a PathWave design 2021 software suite. This advanced software accelerates 5G design, simulation, and verification workflows with an integrated solution that ensures design performance, improves accuracy, and speeds time to market. In the manufacturing arena, Keysight continues to collaborate with leading 5G infrastructure customers, a new cloud-based PathWave manufacturing solutions. We continue to increase our solution differentiation with strategic acquisitions, expanding into the application layer in growing our addressable market. We recently acquired Eggplant, an industry-leading software test automation platform provider. Eggplant's differentiated technology uses artificial intelligence and analytics to automate test creation and test execution. With this acquisition, Keysight is now the only company that can provide test capability from the physical layer through the application layer and extending to the user experience, or UX. Eggplant's customers span a wide range of sectors overlapping Keysight's existing customer base while expanding software test opportunities into new end markets. Looking back at the past two quarters, our performance exemplifies the core values of the Keysight Leadership Model on multiple fronts. We demonstrated operational excellence and the durability of our financial operating model. KLM also expands beyond financial accountability and aligns with our foundational pillars of corporate social responsibility. We released our latest annual CSR report in May. We are proud to have surpassed our social impact goals in community and education while making progress on our governance and environmental goals, including climate change.  Lastly, as a result of recent events, we are taking further actions to expand our inclusion and diversity programs to advance racial equality. For example, we are working with academic institutions, including historically black colleges and universities to reinforce our diversity recruiting strategy. We are committed to accelerating racial equality and will do our part to make a difference. To wrap up my comments, Keysight's execution this quarter is a reflection of our values and our commitment to customers to deliver first-to-market solutions for their businesses and technology challenges. I couldn't be prouder of the Keysight team. They have risen to the occasion in a challenging environment and continue to execute on customer commitments, while at the same time upholding the values that makes Keysight a diverse, inclusive work environment with the culture of innovation, ownership, passion, and respect. Now, I will turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail. Samik, this is Ron. I'm going to ask Mark Wallace, the Head of Sales, to talk about the order trends first. And then I think Satish can also add some more color commentary towards your commercial communications questions. Brandon, this is Ron. I'm going to pass this over to Mark, who manages, obviously, China sales, but I think he also can make some comments with regards to Huawei because new news came out this week. Sure, Brandon. Eggplant is really an exciting acquisition for us. Again, as we move more and more to software-centric solutions. This fits in right with our strategy. And the way to think about this is a lot of our products or most of our products test hardware or test firmware within our customers' end products. This tests software, so we're finally using software to test software. And in particular, this is used to test user interface development. So when someone's developing new user interface, how do you know that it's effective and it will be something that can get customers through the interface and have a really good user experience. So it's a special unique set of AI that's existed by anybody that creates any type of user experience on the web. The customer base is broad aerospace defense, it's one area where there is a lot of sales, but it even sells, for instance, even into the financial community. It is accretive to us. It's a small acquisition. It is growing and growing roughly double digits. But it has tremendous potential as we marry that in the future with the rest of Keysight and, in particular, with our PathWave architecture. I would just add a comment, too. When you look at oscilloscope, which includes sampling scopes that serve this optical market, the results were very strong with double-digit growth in orders. And when we look at that on a competitive basis, we're very happy with our performance and our relative performance. Sure, Mehdi. Yes obviously, we don't guide orders, as you know, and we haven't commented on orders in general. We have built our backlog up over the past quarters. That's good. And given all the supply constraints and things that come in from external to Keysight's manufacturing, we see that backlog position that we have remaining roughly in the same area with some puts and takes as we go forward. And as far as orders, as far as going in that, we're very pleased where we are. Quarter-by-quarter, we'll see how Q4 happens. We clearly were very pleased with our order performance this last quarter and our book-to-bill based on what's going on in the environment. But I'll leave it at that. Mark, this is Ron. First of all, congratulations on your new role. And thank you very much for covering Keysight. We're happy to have you with us. With regards to automotive, we're not ready to call a big upturn. We've seen the negative rates of growth in the automotive industry, although the second order -- where the second derivative, I should say, is positive and the growth rate or the decline rate is lessening, we're still not at a point where we believe that, that's translating into more and more cash into the auto industry, which would feed into the R&D funds. So we're going to play it cautiously through this period of time, we are ready, obviously, to capitalize on any new spending that's there. And where you see a lot of the spending in AV and EV, it's really a big strategic priority for us. We have a lot of solutions that are in the market, and we have other ones that we're working on. And over this multiyear scenario, we see tremendous potential for us. Yes. As Neil said, there are a lot of things, puts and takes that we're managing, as he said, everything from pension expenses in this low interest rate environment. We had temporary executive salary cuts. The overall comp that we had on a variable pay basis, travel, et cetera. However, it is worthwhile to note from my chair, it's always a balance between long-term profitability and short-term profitability. And as we look at this, as we look at the margins, could we take the margins a little bit higher? Yes. But we're investing to make sure we have a differentiated, competitive advantage versus the competition and can give customer solutions that they want to provide growth. And as we model this all out, we think we're in a very good shape to create the most value for the shareholders, balancing investment with short-term return. And tactically, I think it's probably pretty obvious. A lot of the orders that we received that went into backlog in Q2 were shipped in Q3. However, the orders that came in Q3, in particular, typically, the orders that come in towards the end of Q3 go into the backlog. So although you don't see a backlog change in Q3 or you see one of your roughly $50 million, it doesn't mean we ship those orders and didn't get to Q3. It's always two rolling accounts, and we're always shipping first based on customer requirement. And typically, the customer requirements that we receive from the Q2 orders are things that are needed by our customers before the Q3 orders. So it's rolling. We are clearing out, obviously, what we received in Q2. And then in Q3, we build up again and it sort of works that way through the quarter, depending on the seasonality month-to-month. Yes, the services business, which has been part of our growth strategies. That was one of our key elements, continues to grow. Orders and revenue grew double digits. And that is a chain that keeps going. And that helps our ARR. There's no doubt about that. And it has increased our margins. And as Neil mentioned, it's above 20%. And also, software typically grows faster than the rest of our business, and that helps our gross margin. But we produced a real solid 64% gross margin this quarter, and there's nothing really unusual with regard to what we delivered relative to our strategy."

            "name": "Neil Dougherty",
            "content": "Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. Note that all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless specifically noted otherwise. Keysight delivered a solid quarter, thanks to steady demand and strong execution. Despite a challenging economic environment and supply chain disruption, our financial and operational performance demonstrated the durability of our operating model as reported record operating margin and solid cash flow. This performance also proved for the second quarter in a row, the effectiveness of our financial playbook, which is designed to preserve margins and cash generation during challenging times. For the third quarter of 2020, we delivered revenue of $1.011 billion, down 7% on a reported and core basis. Our team executed well in ramping production capacity and managing supply chain constraints, which resulted in stronger-than-expected sequential revenue growth of 13%. Orders of $1.067 billion were down 4% on a reported and core basis and were steady through the quarter in aggregate. Regionally, demand accelerated in Asia and began to stabilize in the U.S., while Europe lagged as the pandemic continues to hamper their economic recovery. Turning to our operational results for Q3. We reported gross margin of 64% with improved mix and lower discretionary spending, offsetting the impact of lower revenue. Expenses were well managed as we benefited from our flexible cost structure and the specific actions that we initiated last quarter. The combination of strong gross margin performance and expense discipline resulted in record operating margin of 26%. Net income in the third quarter was $226 million. On a per-share basis, we delivered $1.19 in earnings on weighted average share count for the quarter of 190 million shares. Regarding the performance of our segments, we saw continued strength in 5G investments, both in R&D and in manufacturing as well as next-generation semiconductor node technologies, which drove double-digit order growth across both markets, respectively. This strength was offset by weaker spending in legacy communications, automotive, general electronics and international, aerospace defense and government markets. Exceptional execution and expense discipline resulted in CSG operating margin of 26% and EISG operating margin of 27%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our third quarter with $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, with $450 million of additional liquidity available under our undrawn revolving credit facility. Our quarter end cash balance reflects the impact of the $319 million net of cash acquisition of Eggplant. We reported cash flow from operations of $183 million and free cash flow of $151 million. We did not repurchase any shares during the quarter. Turning to our outlook and guidance. As Ron mentioned, we expect to make continued progress in Q4. And as a result, we expect fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of $1.170 billion to $1.190 and Q4 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.42 to $1.48 based on a weighted average share count of 190 million shares. At the midpoint, this represents 5% year-over-year revenue growth and 9% year-over-year earnings growth. These expectations assume limited incremental supply chain constraints or disruption from additional shutdowns or a second wave of the pandemic. While the near term remains challenging, the long-term secular growth trends in our markets remain intact. We continue to invest in R&D and focus on our long-term strategy of enabling customer success through first-to-market leading-edge solutions. As I mentioned last quarter, the durability of our business model, steady cash generation, strong balance sheet and market leadership give us confidence in our long-term core revenue growth target of 4% to 6% and operating margin target of 26% to 27%. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A. Yes. we typically see some -- even in a normal and -- Sorry about that. My mic is now on, so it's probably easier to hear me. We do typically see even as in a typical year as you migrate from Q3 to Q4, some uptick in expenses, some of that is related to the field as we get to the back half of the year and the push to finish the year strong. The 40% incremental is never intended to be something that is quarter-to-quarter, there are going to be quarters where we're above and quarters where we're below, but we're committed to over the medium to long term achieving that 40% incremental, which is something we've been able to do. So that said, I think we're very well positioned from that perspective. Yes, I just wanted to give some more specific quantification of the likely impact of this new Huawei news. So we had said previously, based on previous rounds of restrictions to Huawei that we expected Huawei to be a 1% to 2% customer. Year-to-date, they've actually been exceeding that. They're closer to double that rate with increased sales in Q1, which we talked about and then, again, here in the third quarter. As we look forward to next year, it does look like these new restrictions are pretty comprehensive. And so we expect Huawei to be a very small customer for us going forward, but again if you think about it from long term, we were already expecting them to be a 1% to 2% customer. So the headwinds are a little bit bigger next year, potentially up to 4%. But over the long term, it's a pretty minor adjustment from what we've been expecting. Yes. Obviously, we just put out those long-term target margins of 26% to 27%. And as I said in my prepared comments over the longer term, we are highly confident in our ability to get to and sustain those things. Obviously, we've hit 26% this quarter. These are clearly not normal times nor do we expect next quarter to be normal times. We have a unique operating model that allows us to maintain profitability and cash flow generation in tough economic times. A key portion of that model is the variable pay component for 100% of our employees, the drivers there, organic growth and operating margin. Obviously, the organic growth situation right now, driven by the macroeconomy is allowing us to save significant money on the single biggest component of our cost structure, which is our people. We see other areas so that's a direct result of COVID, spending has decreased significantly, whether that's travel, which is an obvious one, R&D project materials with engineers working from home, those types of things as well as we've taken specific actions around NKWs and -- excuse me, temporary workers and in other areas to really put a clamp on discretionary spending. So again, over the longer term, we're committed to 26% to 27%. We're very pleased with the results we're getting in the short run. As those costs come back as we face some other expenses as we go into '21, one of the things we are watching very carefully is our pension expense. With interest rates being at historically low levels, we're expecting pension expenses to increase next year. So there are going to be some things that in the short run are going to probably push us back a little bit the other direction in turn, but we're well on our way towards a long-term trend of getting to and sustaining those 26% to 27% operating margins. Yes. Let me take the first question with regard to Eggplant. As you know, or as we've said, it's a relatively small business. But as we report core growth numbers, relative to as reported, we would expect Eggplant to have about a 1-point impact on our growth rates. It's going to add about a point of growth on, either the order or revenue line on a go-forward basis. Obviously, they were only part of Keysight for a portion of the third quarter. But on a go-forward basis, that puts it into an order of magnitude. With regard to Q4 and kind of the revenue being sequentially up, but orders continuing to be down on a year-over-year basis, obviously, we are in a strong backlog position. We've been building capacity over the course of the last 3 months and are now in a position where we can ship essentially at a level that was on par with where we were before coming into COVID, and so that's driving revenue As Mark said, the macroeconomy is still highly uncertain. We're seeing areas of relative strength and areas of relative weakness, but the COVID situation is impacting more or less every business in the industry equally, and we remain confident in our competitive position and the strength of our technology and over the long-term in the secular growth trends that are driving our end markets. Yes. Obviously, we're not reporting orders at the segment level. You have the information for Keysight, and we're just not going into that level of granularity. Let me take the EISG portion, and then I'll let Satish address the CSG and specifically the aerospace defense question. EISG, we've talked about the various segments within EISG. And we clearly have an auto industry that is going through some pretty difficult times and our business selling directly into auto was similarly impacted, right? And so you're seeing, I'd say, a more severe macro impact or an above-average negative macro impact in the auto industry. At the flip side, you've got the semi industry, within EISG, which is doing very well right now as folks are investing in process technology, you have 5G and other things that are driving semiconductor demand. And so not just us, but across the semi industry, you're seeing relative strength even in a time of broad macro weakness. And then the third piece being general electronics is the one that's kind of most macro-tied, and we've often talked about that being as our most GDP-linked business. And so there, I think you're going to see the performance of our general electronics business largely mirror what happens with the broader economy as we recover from COVID. So Satish, do you want to comment on aerospace defense? Are you talking sequentially or year-over-year? Yes. We don't guide at the segment level. So I don't think that's information we want to share at this point in time. Yes. For '21, it's difficult to call even three months out. Obviously, we've got a lot of factors that are at play, including what's the pace of the COVID recovery, what happens with the U.S. elections and those types of things. Again, I think as we look over the longer term, we continue to be encouraged by our relative position in the marketplace. We recognize that those macro factors are going to more or less impact everybody equally. And so not only our market position, but the strength of our portfolio and our technology is going to enable us to weather everything better than most. And so we're very encouraged by that. I did touch on some of the specific headwinds that we're going to be facing going into FY '21, specifically about Huawei. But other than that, we've got a great operating model. I think that's driving strong profitability and cash flow today, and that will continue to do so no matter how the macroeconomy develops over the course of the next several quarters. Yes. As you can see, we built backlog here again in the third quarter. So we did not see a backlog reduction. I guess the way I would answer that is we're working very closely with our customers to meet their most urgent delivery needs. And to this point, we are not aware of a single instance where we have lost an order because of inability to ship. So we continue to -- we revamp production consistently throughout the year. We're very close to 100% capacity across all of our internal manufacturing. We do see some supply chain constraints regard -- with some of our suppliers, but we're very actively managing those. And as Ron said, as we look forward, we expect our backlog position to be similar to where it is today. Yes. We're back to, as I said, close to 100% capacity at this point in time and very successfully managing other supply chain constraints. So I think we are right now shipping for an overall schedule and able to meet the demand requirements of our customers. The only thing I would say is that, obviously, we had a very strong -- semi business continues to be very strong at this point in time, and that tends to be above-average from a gross margin perspective. And then we continue to see great performance in our software business, adding recurring revenue. Software and services in combination, as we mentioned, north of 30% of our total revenue, and so that is also additive to gross margins.  And even if you look at services, specifically, it is a below-average gross margin business, but we have, over the course of the last -- services used to be a separately reported segment for us. Over the course of the last 18 months, we've continued to make great progress on services profitability. So we've talked over the long term about getting services profitability up north of 20%, and we now achieve that objective for our services. So it's come a long way as well. It's not as dilutive as it used to be."

And now, I will turn the call over to Ron.\nRon Nersesian: Thank you, Jason and thank you all for joining us. First and foremost, we hope that you're all staying safe and well and our thoughts are with everyone affected by the coronavirus pandemic. The world has faced unprecedented challenges over the past several months and I would like to thank all of our employees for their continued dedication and commitment to Keysight, our customers, and our partners. Our execution and results this quarter underscore the power of our balance sheet, business model, and our Keysight leadership model, which drives our unique high performance culture and guides our company to continuously delivering greater value to customers, shareholders, and employees. I'll focus my formal comments today on three key headlines for the quarter. First, the health and safety of our employees is our top priority. After acting quickly to temporarily close most of our global locations in mid-March and implementing risk mitigation measures in response to the pandemic, we are now re-opening sites and our production capacity is ramping rapidly. Second, despite the mandatory government shutdown of our production facilities and resulting supply disruption impact on our Q2 revenue, Keysight delivered steady orders, strong operating margin, and record free cash flow. Our results demonstrated the exceptional resilience of our business and the durability of our financial operating model. And third, despite the near-term uncertainty, we are confident in our differentiated market leadership position, the strength of our operating model, and the long-term secular growth trends across our diverse set of end markets. Turning to the dynamics that impacted second quarter results. Demand was steady across markets in February. As the impact of the pandemic expanded beyond China in early March, we responded quickly to limit the spread of the coronavirus and mitigate the risk to employees, customers, and suppliers while also responding to local government directives. On March 18th, we issued a press release to announce the temporary closure of most locations around the world, including our production and order fulfillment facilities, which were fully closed for two weeks in March and had limited activity in April. We also took the necessary steps to deliver on our customer commitments, particularly those that provide essential services and support the communities in which we operate around the world. Working with local governments and health officials to implement health and safety measures at all of our locations, we are pleased to announce that we are re-opening sites worldwide. Despite ongoing broader industry supply chain challenges, we are ramping our Keysight production and services operation and expect to be back to 100% capacity by the end of the third quarter. Now let's take a deeper look into our financial results. Order growth was positive through March, followed by a decline in April to finish the quarter down only 3% compared to last year's record second quarter. While we don't typically comment on calendar quarter performance, given the dynamic nature of the situation, it's worth noting that Keysight's orders and revenues both grew mid-single digits in the January through March time frame. Despite lower than expected revenue as a result of supply chain disruptions, the resilience of Keysight's business model was exceptional and our flexible cost structure performed as expected. As a result of our immediate actions to reduce costs and preserve liquidity, we delivered operating margin of 19%, record free cash flow of $275 million, and a record cash balance of $1.8 billion. Our second quarter revenue declined 18% year-over-year as both segments of the business were impacted by the limited manufacturing capacity. However, we continue to see steady demand across several end markets with ongoing investment in next generation technologies such as 5G, 400 gig, and advanced semiconductor node processes. Other markets such as general electronics and automotive are expected to be more challenged in the near-term. In Commercial Communications, our ongoing 5G order momentum resulted in a new record. Our end-to-end solutions portfolio continues to gain strong global customer adoption and is enabling the commercial 5G launches underway. We are further solidifying our global leadership position across both the wireless and wired 5G ecosystem through close collaborations with market leadership and standards and first-to-market 5G design and test solutions. This quarter, we introduced Keysight's new 5G core network test solution called LoadCore. The 5G core testing software simulates complex real-world subscriber models. This enables mobile operators and network equipment manufacturers to qualify performance and reliability of voice and data transferred over 5G networks. This solution leverages from the Ixia and PRISMA acquisitions to deliver testing capability needed by our customers. We also announced a collaboration with Rakuten, an operator in Japan, to enable their 5G deployments using our solutions for test, validation, and optimization of devices and networks. Keysight's comprehensive solutions portfolio spanning the entire ecosystem is a key differentiator in the market. In aerospace, defense and government, order growth was driven by strong demand in the U.S. which was partially offset by lower international investment. Our solutions for electromagnetic spectrum operations, radar, space, and satellite continue to benefit from a favorable U.S. spending environment and ongoing investments in technology modernization. Despite the substantial challenges in the automotive sector, next generation electric and autonomous vehicle technology is a strategic priority for our customers. Keysight continues to invest to be first-to-market with solutions and remains highly engaged with key market players. For example, we recently announced the use of our Scienlab battery test solution in the BMW Group's new Battery Cell Competence Center in Germany. Foundry customers are continuing to prioritize investment in advanced process node technologies and incremental infrastructure. This resulted in revenue growth for our semiconductor measurement solutions where we had less supply chain disruption. Software and services continue to contribute to the differentiation of our solutions and recurring revenue base. While growing above the company average over time, they are strengthening the durability and diversity of our business model. In Q2, the combination of both software and services represented approximately 35% of revenue. Turning back to the current COVID-19 pandemic, we are committed to supporting our customers and our communities through this challenge. For our customers, we launched an Innovate Anywhere Program to enable IT teams to support remote users ensuring VPN performance and security. We also implemented various health and safety measures at our facilities to ensure all safeguards are met before production and other operations resumes. For our communities, we are contributing to the relief efforts globally through monetary and supply donations. These include donations of personal protective equipment to local hospitals and government agencies providing support to children, families, and the most vulnerable. We are also making direct financial contributions to local communities and global non-profit organizations. Before turning the call over to Neil, I'll close with a few key points. Keysight is a market leader in large, diverse, and growing end markets and serves a diversified global base of over 32,000 customers across multiple industries. The challenges of this pandemic are unprecedented and I'm proud on how our team has responded. Our execution demonstrates the durability of our business and the resilience of our business model with 19% operating margin and solid cash flow even with a Q2 revenue impact. We continue our significant investment in R&D and remain focused on first-to-market solutions. Our sales teams remain highly engaged with our customers and we continue to execute our strategy for long-term above market growth. While we expect ongoing COVID-19 demand and supply chain headwinds over the next few quarters, our long-term secular market growth trends and the strength of our operating model remain intact. We expect to come through this challenge stronger than ever. Now, I will turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and the outlook in more detail.\nNeil Dougherty: Thank you, Ron and hello everyone. Before I get started, I will note that all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless specifically noted otherwise. Keysight delivered a solid quarter thanks to strong execution in a challenging environment. While supply chain disruptions dampened our revenue performance during the second half of the quarter, our results demonstrated the resiliency of our operating model and durable cash generation. We responded quickly with proactive measures to reduce costs and preserve liquidity while supporting our customers and advancing key projects. For the second quarter of 2020, we delivered revenue of $895 million, down 18% on a reported and core basis due to our site closures and supply chain disruptions that started in mid-March and continued through the end of the quarter. Orders of $1.1 billion were down 3% on a reported and core basis. As Ron mentioned, we continued to see steady demand in investment across multiple end markets, particularly for our next generation communication solutions. Turning to our operational results for Q2, we reported gross margin of 63% with improved mix and lower spending partially offsetting the impact of lower revenue. The flexibility of our cost structure resulted in lower variable compensation and a reduction in outsourced manufacturing costs. This combined with other specific actions such as a temporary hiring freeze and reductions in discretionary spending enabled our flexible operating model to perform as expected resulting in 19% operating margin for the quarter. Net income in the second quarter was $148 million. On a per share basis, we delivered $0.78 in earnings. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 189 million shares. Regarding the performance of our segments. In light of the broad supply chain disruptions, CSG and EISG expense management and margin performance were exceptional. CSG operating margin was 18% while EISG delivered 24% operating margin. On the demand side, general electronics, education, and automotive were weak while investment continued in 5G, aerospace defense, and other leading-edge technology solutions. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our second quarter with a record $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents with $450 million of additional liquidity available under our undrawn revolving credit facility. We reported cash flow from operations of $298 million and record free cash flow of $275 million or 31% of revenue. The strength of our cash generation reflects the power of our financial operating model, which incorporates a flexible cost structure and includes a financial playbook that is designed to preserve margins and cash generation during challenging times. Under our share repurchase authorization, we acquired approximately 1.3 million shares on the open market in the first half of the quarter at an average price of $91.14 for a total consideration of $120 million. Our year-to-date repurchases are sufficient to achieve our objective of being anti-dilutive for the full year and to exit the year at 190 million shares. While we are focused on optimizing liquidity, given our strong operating model and cash generation, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. Now turning to our outlook and guidance. While we are not quite back to full capacity, our production operations and those of our suppliers have been ramping since mid-April. We expect to make continued progress in Q3 and as a result, expect third quarter revenue, operating margin, and earnings to be in line with or better than Q2. These expectations are based on our order funnel, a strong backlog position, and assume limited incremental supply chain constraints or disruption from additional shutdowns or a second wave of the pandemic. While maintaining R&D investments for future growth, we will continue to focus on profitability and leverage the flexibility of our operating model to manage expenses. In closing, the near-term situation is obviously challenging, but we remain focused on our long-term strategy of enabling our customers' success through first-to-market leading-edge solutions. Once the COVID-19 situation stabilizes, the durability of our business model, cash generation, strong balance sheet, and market leadership position give us confidence in our long-term financial targets that we shared with you at our Investor Day in early March, specifically sustainable long-term core growth of 4% to 6%, operating margin of 26% to 27%, and EPS growth of at least 10% over the long-term. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.\nJason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Robert, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMehdi Hosseini: I want to go back to your reported backlog. Despite the shortfall in revenues, you were still able to grow backlog by double-digit and given your assumption for booking for the current July quarter, do you expect a resumption of year-over-year growth in quarterly revenue by the October quarter and I have a follow-up. Thanks.\nRon Nersesian: Yes, this is Ron. Our backlog - our book-to-bill was 1.22 for the quarter showing very strong backlog build and obviously, our profitability - our operating model was strong and held up at 19%. If we had shipped that, we clearly would have been in very strong shape with operating margin in the mid-20s. As far as the quarter going forward, we have seen our operations turn on. Our main international operations that we have in Penang, Malaysia is back to 100% capacity. The main operations that we have in the U.S. are at about 70% capacity and will be at 100% by the end of the quarter. So even though there is a short-term disruption to the end of - to the second half of Q2 and the first half of Q3, we expect Q3 revenue to be at about the same level. We don't guide for orders for the future quarter though.\nMehdi Hosseini: Perhaps maybe I could rephrase the question a different way. I'm assuming that the strength in your communication group is driven by orders for millimeter wave on R&D and also you highlighted 400 gig networking. As R&D activity on the millimeter wave picks up, is there any synergy between that and the networking that would enable you with a bigger size of the customer wallet. In other words the stack approach that you have focused on, would that finally become material so that you could capture a bigger part of the customer and is that what's going to be driving the momentum with booking for some of the growth areas.\nRon Nersesian: Yes, we had a strong quarter in 5G. We had a very strong quarter in 400 gig back into the network and our overall play of winning up and down the ecosystem does create that synergy. I'm going to let Satish talk a little bit about the details.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes, thanks, Ron. Mehdi, you're correct in that communications especially these new areas such as 5G with millimeter wave adoption and 400 gig and such are really gaining increased importance in today's world given what we have seen in terms of a disruption. So that should start to manifest itself. In fact, with discussions with customers we're having today, the focus is on accelerating innovation and going faster. So that positions us well having the entire layer one to layer seven capabilities internal to the company and having built that platform I referenced at the Investor Day gives us an advantage to go faster and deploy solutions with customers. You will also notice that we have a number of industry-leading collaborations that we announced just this quarter with the likes of Qualcomm, Rakuten, China Unicom, SONiC and others that spans the wireless to wireline arenas and positions us well for the future.\nMehdi Hosseini: So, does that mean that the synergies are beginning to materialize?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes, I think so and you'll start to see them accelerate as we launch more solutions. We have some 90 new solutions planned for the second half of the year, which we're investing for and that should continue to position us very well in the communication space.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTim Long: I just wanted to ask about the China market. Could you talk a little bit about the trends there. Obviously, the timing for manufacturing and businesses opening was a little bit different and obviously some more political talk there. So can you just give us an update how China was and how you're viewing that - the next few quarters and then I had a follow-up?\nMark Wallace: So, Tim, this is Mark, Mark Wallace. I'll take that question talking about China. So the main headline from Q2 is that our business remained steady. We had a stronger February than we expected coming out of the Lunar New Year that as you recall was extended by an extra week and we saw strength continuing in 5G and commercial comms as Satish had talked about both at the physical layer and across the protocol stack, 400 gigabit R&D and optical manufacturing continued to ramp as we saw global demand come from the carriers and the data centers. Automotive was down and we saw some mixed conditions in general electronics and education as we made comments in the opening remarks. And China, you know, continues to accelerate investments in semiconductor capability particularly around next generation semiconductor technology and as you alluded to, there is a continuing set of evolving U.S. regulations. We're paying very close attention to these. At this point, there might be some indirect impact to some of the foundry business, we're not really able to quantify that just yet. We have assessed the overall situation in terms of the most recent [USDOC] restrictions and regulations and we believe it represents something on the order of 1 points to 2 points of headwind going forward, but you know as we did with the August 2018 RPL additions, we will redirect sales resources to go after new opportunities to drive growth elsewhere and all of these restrictions go across all of our technology companies that supply into China and not just Keysight. So the bottom line I would say with China is our customer engagements remained high during the quarter as we adapted to the new remote environment that we're now leveraging across other geographies and our business in China remained steady despite all of these challenges and headwinds.\nTim Long: And then just as a follow-up, I think you mentioned 35% of revenues coming from software and service in the quarter. Could you talk a little bit about the ramp there and do you think - are you hearing from customers with the kind of global disruption like this that there might be more of an accelerated move to those type of models. Thank you.\nMark Wallace: Yes, Tim, this is Mark again. I'll take that. Regarding software and services, as you point out, we saw revenue growth in the quarter faster than the rest of Keysight as has been the case for many quarters. Revenue for software was roughly flat, services was up slightly on a core basis. We had a record high Q2 for our design software orders, which indicates the continued demand from customers who continued to work remotely during the global pandemic and as Ron mentioned in his opening comments, we introduced the Innovate Anywhere initiative, which was very successful really enabling thousands of software engineers to work from home. And moving forward, we see this program feeding into the superior software and services growth that we've been delivering for a long time. Our customers and their engineering workflow has changed and we expect to see customers continuing to work in this mixed lab and work from home environment and I think our software and services provides us another way to support their engineering teams in either case to maintain engineering productivity. So yes, we do see our software strength continuing to be a factor, especially in the new go-forward environment that we're experiencing.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Marchetti with Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJohn Marchetti: Ron, I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on the demand side as you've gone through these last couple of months. You mentioned obviously that January through March, both orders and revenue were growing in the mid-single digits, but I'm just curious with orders down 3% year-over-year for the quarter, did you have customer behavior change dramatically in that month of April as well that coincided with your ability to ship. How has this sort of disrupted your customer landscape not just your own supply-side issues?\nRon Nersesian: Sure. Obviously, we had a drop off in April when everything pretty much shut down. So our order level was lower. Our sales organization worked from home and actually has been very effective after the first couple of weeks just trying to figure out how to contact customers. A matter of fact, they've been finding it pretty efficient to be able to get on with Zoom as long as they have an established relationship with those customers, but that's what we saw with regards to the seasonality in the quarter. Revenue, we've talked about that and how that is ramping now and we'll be back to full strength by the end of the quarter. Mark, would you like to add anything?\nMark Wallace: Yes, what I would add is we did see customers working hard from home. They were actually more accessible than they normally would be because we knew where to find them. So we engaged with them. We continue to book business and we continue to build our funnel for Q3 and beyond. It's at the highest level really it's ever been looking out three months, but there was some pull back in certain areas. As an example, some of our general electronics business is tied to new engineers being hired, right? And obviously, that wasn't going on. Some of the government-funded activities such as research obviously, our education business based on the universities being closed were affected and we saw that effect happen more towards the end of the quarter. So there's some dynamics from the industry that really played into that timing as well.\nJohn Marchetti: And then maybe just as a follow-up to that, was there a big difference that you saw, geographically. Obviously, we all know that China has kind of come back from this a little bit more quickly than some other areas just given that that's where everything started, but as you look out across North America and Europe, have there been, I guess, big regional differences as you've seen those demand trends play out?\nMark Wallace: Yes, John, what I would say is, there was some regional differences mainly from kind of the distribution of different segments and different customer behaviors. As an example, we already talked about the fact that we saw strong order growth in the U.S. from aerospace defense that continued throughout the quarter from both the direct government and the prime contractors whereas in Europe, the strength was really more around semiconductor solutions tied to advanced technologies like EUV, which is extreme ultraviolet lithography and some next generation processes and then we saw some growth in commercial comms in Europe tied to some new 5G design wins and - so it varied. What I would say is most regions saw the impact when it came to kind of the general electronics and automotive segments. So there is some variety from region to region based on different industry dynamics in each of the regions.\nRon Nersesian: John, it is interesting to note though that a lot of our major customers has said they're not slipping schedules and they're doing everything they can to either stay on track or make up for any type of shortfall what they have and that bodes well for some type of let's say accelerated purchasing at some point when they do need it.\nJohn Marchetti: So as we get back to a more normal environment, you would expect that you'll be able to at least sort of make up some of the shortfall here in this fiscal 2Q and 3Q.\nRon Nersesian: Yes and clearly with the backlog, you could see, we've built $200 million worth of backlog in the last quarter. There is no doubt that we will be able to clear that out at some point in the future. We've guided or given you a range for Q3 where we expect to be, but beyond that, we expect ourselves to be at 100% and we'll be ramping rapidly from there.\nMark Wallace: You know, Ron, the only other add I had for John just real quick, we look at cancellations, we didn't see any increase in cancellations. We look at, is there any kind of push outs to Ron's point about projects staying on track, we really didn't see a lot of push outs either. So we've built a strong funnel and I think we're going to be in a good position when the economy begins to recover.\nRon Nersesian: And the good news is the global race continues to be ahead in 5G, which nobody wants to take a pause.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nToshiya Hari: Ron, you talked about record 5G bookings in the quarter, I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit more on that in terms of the composition of those orders between R&D test and production test and if you can kind of speak to the individual customer groups like the chip guys and the base station customers, the mobile smartphone customers, that would be helpful. And then I've got a quick follow-up.\nRon Nersesian: Sure, Toshiya, I'll let Satish, who is right in the middle of it, give you more of the details.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes, Toshi, it's a very strong order quarter for 5G. Our orders grew at record levels as we mentioned before in Ron's comments, but equally worth noting was the strength continued into April and the growth that we saw was broad. It was across all regions grew and all segments of the customer base grew, all the ones that you referenced, chipsets, devices, and the NEMs and even the operator segments. I would say if we fill back the types of applications, the sustained investments in R&D, manufacturing started to ramp. In fact, we had a good uptick for our modular offerings, which we're enabling some of the component manufacturers to ramp up. So that was a positive note for us. And then we also saw success in new verticals such as automotive with the C-V2X application that we just launched and with our Aerospace and Defense solution with some of the 5G security offerings we have launched. So in summary, some of the opportunity progression that I had outlined at Investor Day sort of started to play out in Q2 and we also added 40 new customers for our 5G platform through our marketing efforts and working with our sales teams globally. I also want to say that our customer engagement through this phase has been very strong, even though some of our customers are working from home, they have been continually engaged as Ron mentioned to make sure that their projects don't slip too much and in some cases where they are slipping, they're looking at ways to accelerate. I also want to highlight some of our, let's say, remote working with customers is working very well. In fact, our 5G virtual events have been well attended by over 8,000 customers. So that points to the strength of our solutions there.\nToshiya Hari: And then as a quick follow-up, you spoke about some of the near-term headwinds related to automotive, general electronics, education, and government. I'm curious what percentage of your overall business to those end markets collectively account for and is it fair to say fundamentals, whether it be bookings or revenue troughed in the April quarter or could there be continued weakness into July and as a follow-up to that, if you can kind of speak to your exposure to Huawei and the foundries in semiconductor business, that would be very helpful. Thank you.\nRon Nersesian: Yes, we haven't sized those specific markets Toshiya but the GE and automotive markets are a significant portion, more than half of EISG obviously the part that's missing there is the semi business which has been strong, but EISG's business is kind of more heavily or more - the weaker market areas are more heavily weighted towards EISG with general electronics, automotive, EISG, these things that tend to be more tightly linked to GDP.\nMark Wallace: The auto business in particular has slowed down, we obviously saw significant slowdowns as everybody has seen in the industries for the old technologies or old auto. Some of the new auto wasn't as strong as it was pre-COVID, but we still feel very good about our position. So we are there for when that market snaps back.\nNeil Dougherty: And then to your second part of your question as it relates to Huawei. We don't really have any change at this point as it relates to our expectations of Huawei going forward. We kind of still we expect them to be a 1% to 2% customer for us on a go-forward basis.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nJohn Pitzer: Ron, I was just wondering if you could help us understand what you think the supply impact was for COVID in the quarter and I guess in your prepared comments, you said it was both a production and an order fulfillment hit. So I'd be kind of curious as to how much revenue and orders do you think you lost in the quarter from the supply side of COVID?\nRon Nersesian: Yes, I mean it's impossible for us to know what would have happened right, but I think if you go back to where we were at the beginning of the quarter, we obviously put a guide out for the quarter that we had a high degree of confidence in our ability to hit. And so you could look at that delta relative to our guidance on the revenue line and for all intents and purposes, I would attribute that shortfall to COVID. I think from our perspective, the world changed in mid-March. As we talked about the sites being closed, limited productivity in April, but we continue to be very optimistic about how we're positioned on a go-forward basis. We're a leader in our markets, we have a strong technology position and I think as markets recover, we are going to come through this even stronger.\nJohn Pitzer: I'm sorry, go ahead.\nRon Nersesian: Yes, I think it is fair to say taking a look at our order rate and knowing how we do our supply chain planning, a book to bill of around 1 was probably would have been normal if there wasn't a COVID issue for Q2.\nJohn Pitzer: That's helpful. And then, guys, I know you're not giving official guidance for the July quarter, but I'm just kind of curious from a production perspective, if you look at the April quarter, relative to 100% where were you for the blended average of the quarter and as you look into July, I know there's a lot of moving parts, but how do you think sort of relative to 100% your production levels looked in July versus April?\nRon Nersesian: Well, you could go back and look at history of where we've been operating somewhere around the $1.1 billion per quarter kind of range as close to full production. So that gives you an idea of something to key off of. Obviously, the dynamic is a little bit different, right? We were going full steam ahead through mid-March and then it shut off pretty quickly with the ramp in April. We're now continuing to ramp in May, expecting to be back to something close to 100% across the ecosystem by the end of the quarter. So you kind of have to ramp down last quarter followed by the ramp-up this quarter and as close as we can call it, at this point, the revenue numbers and the profitability numbers are going to be in the same vicinity as one another.\nNeil Dougherty: So if you look at that, you could see where we were down roughly a couple of hundred million dollars, we're down at roughly 80% of capacity. So the fact that we took out - we lost a couple of weeks in March and then you could take another week or two out of April, just as you start to see that ramp or ramp linearly. So that's a very rough estimate, but I think it's pretty accurate.\nJohn Pitzer: And Ron, if I could just sneak one last one in, just given your production issues, can you talk a little bit about your share position and is there any concern that competitors might be able to take this opportunity to steal some share on the margin?\nRon Nersesian: I don't think so. There could have been - there can be some very minor issues, but if I take a look at orders and I look at orders January, February and March, we grew mid-single digits on the order line, which is pretty competitive. Nobody else or very few people have reported in our industry what happened in April. So when they come out, I'd be surprised if their numbers were not the same. We've been growing above market every single quarter now for years and for everything that was going on, I do anticipate that we are at market or better and our backlog position now is so strong, you'll see that flow into revenue and profitability and cash flow as we go forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAdam Thalhimer: I wanted to try to understand the margin disparity in Q2 just because the EISG margins held up so much better and is that a trend you expect to continue?\nRon Nersesian: Yes. So, I mean if you look across our business, right, the one area where we saw actual revenue growth was in semi, which is all within EISG and it's also a very high margin segment for us. So I think predominantly looking at a mix issue or not issue, a mix benefit that EISG received with the very strong semi shipments relative to the other parts of their business and so that's really what you see going on there. And it's worthwhile to note that obviously with a lot of fixed infrastructure as we start to see the business come back, you'll continue to see very strong gross margin performance.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay and then so high level, it sounds like you're kind of girding for a more protracted downturn in EISG, but at communications, it sounds like when the COVID situation allows, you'll kind of quickly turn back to revenue growth, is that fair?\nRon Nersesian: Yes, I think EISG has businesses that are more GDP linked. We've talked about general electronics, which includes the education segment, but if we just talk about education for a while, until - there's really two aspects of education, there's the teaching aspect and the research aspect, but in both cases, you need students on campus, right, to really get those education markets up and going. Automotive, we know what's happening in the auto industry. So we still don't know what the shape of the recovery is going to look like. You can read all the same reports that I read about what the ultimate recovery is looking like, but EISG I think tends to be more macro linked and more linked to GDP where the drivers within CSG the roll out of 5G, the roll out of 400 gigabit, the aerospace defense investments potentially have the ability to buck some of those trends as folks work to get those technologies to market.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup. Your line is open.\nJim Suva: I have two questions. I'll ask them both at the same time so you can answer them in any order and they are pretty straightforward. The first is with coronavirus, is the R&D cycle still lengthening or are people now adjusted to work from home and work remotely now where it's actually compressing. The reason why I ask is it seems like two months ago, was everything progressing slower and it now sounds like from your comments and other companies comments, things are kind of coming back. So I was just kind of wondering about the design cycle and then my second question is your inventory went up quite a bit, but you talked about supply chain issues. Was that simply not having all the right parts to put together your heavy equipment and your big calibration items in your test and measurement things or did some of your inventory like trapped in certain locations or you're missing just a couple of widgets that go into it and so you're like 98% of the box completed before it can ship. Thank you.\nRon Nersesian: Sure, Jim, this is Ron. I'll just take the questions. I'll take them in reverse order. With regards to the inventory situation, it's real simple. We have parts coming in the door and we have no one in the factory to build them and that's the case that we had in the second half of March. It's not the case now as we have Penang up and running, but we also supply parts from our tech center in the United States. So when there is nobody putting together parts or even if things are put together and they're not shipped, there is no revenue credit. So all parts have to be there in order to complete a product. There are thousands of parts in certain products, some made within Keysight and more of the commodity type pieces that are put into products in addition to our unique differentiators. Some of them flow in and some flow out, but the bottom line was we weren't putting together any systems or shipping them out and that was because of not only internal to the Keysight manufacturing facilities, but also the contract manufacturers that would do sub-assemblies, but now we're very happy with the progress that has been made and where we are now and where we expect to be by the end of this quarter. The second issue with regard to the R&D cycle, there was a bit of a stop but everyone's trying to figure out how to operate in this new normal where every customer that we spoke to are very, very high percentage of them went through that. Now they've situated to work at home, to go in part time, to use test systems or in some cases, like China, return back to work. So we see the R&D engineers being much more efficient and accordingly, they're trying to figure out how to keep their projects on track because they are competing against their ultimate competition. So that's why we see things accelerating in that cycle. How much equipment acceleration we'll see at what rate is yet to be seen, but we feel very positive as we look forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Robert Baird. Your line is open.\nRichard Eastman: Just a few questions, two questions, one just kind of targeted at aerospace defense, and just a couple of thoughts here. What was the order growth in A&D year-over-year? And then secondly was the - with A&D, was the business in the revenue there disproportionately impacted by the plant shutdowns, because it wasn't a very tough comp and I'm just curious with the revenue down 25%, if there was a disproportionate impact there?\nRon Nersesian: Yes, so I'll take that. From the order perspective, orders were basically stable versus last year. With regard to the revenue impact, some of that stuff, particularly for the U.S. markets require to be built in the U.S. We did get earlier access to our Penang facilities than we did to some of our locations in the U.S. and so there probably was - I think it is fair to say that there was a disproportionate impact on aerospace defense from a manufacturing perspective just given the fact that the access to the U.S. facilities lagged the access to our facilities in Asia in April.\nRichard Eastman: And then just a follow-up question around the backlog. One would expect perhaps that given access just globally is better to customers as hopefully they - everybody starts to return to work here and we got some of the access kinks maybe worked out a little bit in the fiscal second quarter, but typically, your orders are flat to a bit softer in the third quarter relative to the second, but again with improvements around access, would you expect to build backlog again in the third quarter given where you are and the disconnect between the production ramp and kind of what's going on the order and sales side?\nRon Nersesian: We don't guide orders out for Q3. Rick, I think as you know, but we're going to try to do everything we can to lower our backlog. I'm not saying that we've guided that but what we're trying to do is improve our position to get our deliveries out to the customers that need them. You're right on a typical non-COVID environment, we see a ramp at the end of Q2 and then the biggest ramp at the end of Q4, which is literally how we do the comp in the field organization and then Q3 is not as high as you would expect when looking at Q2, but overall, we expect orders to be very solid and not out of line with what we've seen in the past.\nMark Wallace: Yes, I mean obviously the COVID situation is going to supersede the normal seasonality of the business. From a Q2 perspective, we had the first half of the quarter, which was, I don't want to say unimpacted, but through the first half of our quarter, this was essentially still viewed as largely a China problem, it didn't go global until mid-March in the second part of the quarter. I think the macro side of things is where it is now, we don't know where it's headed, but - so I think you're going to see a different seasonality than is as typical and then I like Ron's way of characterizing it, I mean, I think we've guided revenue in Q3 in line with Q2. We're certainly pushing on the manufacturing side as hard as we can push it, but right now, the way we see it and way we see the ramp progressing, you're going to be looking at revenues that are more or less in line.\nRon Nersesian: And the reason why you see that isn't so much the internal capacity, you could do the math and say for 100% right now internationally in Penang and we're at 70% in the U.S. and you do some type of linear extrapolation of basically the facility that we have in our fab in the U.S., you could come up with a much higher number. But in order to produce products, you need three things, you need all the parts, you need your contract manufacturers for sub-assemblies and you need the Keysight manufacturing facilities. The CMs are very close to 100%, you see our facilities getting close to 100%, but we still are relying on the delivery of components from different suppliers that go into our products and that is something that is a bit extended that is figured into our guide.\nRichard Eastman: And can I just putting that all together just tying it together. Neil, if we're looking at a similar cadence of revenues, monthly through the fiscal third quarter, we've got the issues that you've spoken to around production, production ramp overhead. Is there any reason to assume the decremental for the third quarter won't be similar to the second quarter given the flexibility in the model?\nNeil Dougherty: I expect it to be similar.\nRichard Eastman: I got you. Thanks for the short answer to a long question. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Ridley Lane with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: So, China's stimulus package included $30 billion or so earmarked for data centers and in the U.S. and Europe, the work-from-home trend has shown some of the weaknesses that are out there in corporate data centers and networks. How do you think about Keysight and their ability to benefit on a relative basis from those trends?\nRon Nersesian: Satish owns the data center portion and I'll let him answer.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: We think with the upgrades to data center technology and in lieu of what people have learned from working at home and at this scale is definitely going to be a positive driver for us, especially for our Ixia business with multiple implications, speed is one of them, security is one of them, and visibility being the other piece to it. Right now, we did have a bit strong double-digit quarter for 400 gig based on some ramps we're seeing in China and our outlook for that part of the business continues to be favorable.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: And then a question, could you maybe quantify the cost savings actions that you took and if there are - some that are structural in nature could you may be call that out. Thank you.\nRon Nersesian: Yes, we're very pleased with the way our operating model has performed. We've talked a lot about what we felt we could do in a down cycle. The business there - the model has a number of structural elements that are designed to respond instantaneously to changes in condition. The number one of those is the variable pay component. Again 100% of our employees have a portion of their pay that fluctuates with our business results. Outside of the executives, the rank and file, if you will, that's really tied to our growth rates and to our operating margins and so as both of those things corrected in the third quarter, we saw a significant reduction in our people-related costs. Similarly, contract manufacturing, outsource sales, those types of things, those came online. Beyond that we took action to reduce discretionary spend, everything from - again, certain things happened relatively automatically like travel basically crashed towards zero in the second half of the quarter, reductions in temporary workers, the executives who have actually put in a pay cuts for our executive team ranging from 100% at the CEO level to 50% for the senior vice presidents. So we've taken a number of different actions to further reduce spending.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nBrandon Couillard: Ron, just a quick one for you, now that you're back to the net cash position, I'm curious what you might be seeing in terms of the M&A funnel and if the dislocation in the market has perhaps created some incremental opportunities for you to take a look out here.\nRon Nersesian: Yes, well, Brandon, we have the same priorities that we had before obviously to fund organic growth to make sure that we stay neutral or anti-dilutive and to look at M&A opportunities. In certain cases, things have become more attractive, but we still have a high hurdle to beat our cost of capital with our - excuse me, to beat our WACC with our ROIC and we continue to look pretty aggressively at those but again, we will make sure that the ROIC is high enough.\nBrandon Couillard: A quick one for Neil just on the CapEx line for the year, you still thinking about $120 million for the year, is that still a firm number or would you expect some of those projects to maybe get pushed out on\u2026\nNeil Dougherty: Yes, no, we'll probably push out a little bit, obviously we made significant capital commitments already for the year, but we will - we would expect to under spend. We're probably now - we're looking at something more like a $100 million to $110 million for the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nSamik Chatterjee: I just wanted to start off with more a question on the manufacturing footprint here. I mean, we've seen a lot of companies face supply chain headwinds this quarter, but your magnitude of the shortfall has been obviously larger given your kind of concentration in the U.S. and Malaysia. Just wanted to get your thoughts about whether you're thinking any differently about the long-term plan related to the manufacturing footprint, anything to mitigate that risk. Obviously, I understand its once in a lifetime thing, but how are you thinking about it in the long-term about where you want to be?\nRon Nersesian: Yes, to have a global pandemic come and literally be ordered out of our own factories is something that we don't think is typical and I don't know if it's once in a lifetime, but it's a very rare occasion. We also have a lot of our manufacturing capacity that are spread around with CMs and the CMs are located in different countries where they can move, they can move their production from one facility to another and move it around into different countries. So we look at that, we review that annually and make sure that we have an optimized footprint trying to balance what we typically would see and what type of benefit there is financially versus spreading out over multiple factories. So we continue to do that analysis. We have the discussions all the time and there are some things that we do, do, that were not always public.\nSamik Chatterjee: Just a follow-up and I know you've commented quite a bit on the call here about how kind of the strength in the order trends you're seeing. Just wanted to kind of see if you can help us to match that up relative to kind of how you expect some of the customers that you are interacting with to respond if the macro remains quite weak going into the second half. Obviously the order trends here are strong, but the expectation I think remains from the customers that macro will hold up quite well. What do you think in terms of where do you expect to see some incremental weakness or which customers or projects do you expect to be more fungible relative to if we have a weaker macro in the back half of the year? Thank you.\nRon Nersesian: I think the country by country race to lead in 5G will continue regardless of the macro situation. There is too much at stake for a lot of our large customers and you know them from the NEMs right through the whole ecosystem in communications and they will continue to drive towards getting to market first. When you look at the GDP plus or the GDP or GDP plus businesses, such as general electronics and the general manufacturing, there you could see a slow down as we've seen, for instance, in automotive. So I think those are the businesses that will continue to see some weaknesses which are automotive and general electronics, but I do expect the communications business where there is a race for that to be robust going forward and as you know, that's the strongest part of the business and that enabled us to produce 19% operating margin.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd now like to turn the conference back over to Jason Kary for any closing comments.\nJason Kary: Thank you, Robert and thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to hopefully speaking with many of you at the upcoming virtual conferences that we mentioned and wish you all a good day.\nOperator: This concludes our conference call.

            "name": "Mark Wallace",
            "content": "So, Tim, this is Mark, Mark Wallace. I'll take that question talking about China. So the main headline from Q2 is that our business remained steady. We had a stronger February than we expected coming out of the Lunar New Year that as you recall was extended by an extra week and we saw strength continuing in 5G and commercial comms as Satish had talked about both at the physical layer and across the protocol stack, 400 gigabit R&D and optical manufacturing continued to ramp as we saw global demand come from the carriers and the data centers. Automotive was down and we saw some mixed conditions in general electronics and education as we made comments in the opening remarks. And China, you know, continues to accelerate investments in semiconductor capability particularly around next generation semiconductor technology and as you alluded to, there is a continuing set of evolving U.S. regulations. We're paying very close attention to these. At this point, there might be some indirect impact to some of the foundry business, we're not really able to quantify that just yet. We have assessed the overall situation in terms of the most recent [USDOC] restrictions and regulations and we believe it represents something on the order of 1 points to 2 points of headwind going forward, but you know as we did with the August 2018 RPL additions, we will redirect sales resources to go after new opportunities to drive growth elsewhere and all of these restrictions go across all of our technology companies that supply into China and not just Keysight. So the bottom line I would say with China is our customer engagements remained high during the quarter as we adapted to the new remote environment that we're now leveraging across other geographies and our business in China remained steady despite all of these challenges and headwinds. Yes, Tim, this is Mark again. I'll take that. Regarding software and services, as you point out, we saw revenue growth in the quarter faster than the rest of Keysight as has been the case for many quarters. Revenue for software was roughly flat, services was up slightly on a core basis. We had a record high Q2 for our design software orders, which indicates the continued demand from customers who continued to work remotely during the global pandemic and as Ron mentioned in his opening comments, we introduced the Innovate Anywhere initiative, which was very successful really enabling thousands of software engineers to work from home. And moving forward, we see this program feeding into the superior software and services growth that we've been delivering for a long time. Our customers and their engineering workflow has changed and we expect to see customers continuing to work in this mixed lab and work from home environment and I think our software and services provides us another way to support their engineering teams in either case to maintain engineering productivity. So yes, we do see our software strength continuing to be a factor, especially in the new go-forward environment that we're experiencing. Yes, what I would add is we did see customers working hard from home. They were actually more accessible than they normally would be because we knew where to find them. So we engaged with them. We continue to book business and we continue to build our funnel for Q3 and beyond. It's at the highest level really it's ever been looking out three months, but there was some pull back in certain areas. As an example, some of our general electronics business is tied to new engineers being hired, right? And obviously, that wasn't going on. Some of the government-funded activities such as research obviously, our education business based on the universities being closed were affected and we saw that effect happen more towards the end of the quarter. So there's some dynamics from the industry that really played into that timing as well. Yes, John, what I would say is, there was some regional differences mainly from kind of the distribution of different segments and different customer behaviors. As an example, we already talked about the fact that we saw strong order growth in the U.S. from aerospace defense that continued throughout the quarter from both the direct government and the prime contractors whereas in Europe, the strength was really more around semiconductor solutions tied to advanced technologies like EUV, which is extreme ultraviolet lithography and some next generation processes and then we saw some growth in commercial comms in Europe tied to some new 5G design wins and - so it varied. What I would say is most regions saw the impact when it came to kind of the general electronics and automotive segments. So there is some variety from region to region based on different industry dynamics in each of the regions. You know, Ron, the only other add I had for John just real quick, we look at cancellations, we didn't see any increase in cancellations. We look at, is there any kind of push outs to Ron's point about projects staying on track, we really didn't see a lot of push outs either. So we've built a strong funnel and I think we're going to be in a good position when the economy begins to recover. The auto business in particular has slowed down, we obviously saw significant slowdowns as everybody has seen in the industries for the old technologies or old auto. Some of the new auto wasn't as strong as it was pre-COVID, but we still feel very good about our position. So we are there for when that market snaps back. Yes, I mean obviously the COVID situation is going to supersede the normal seasonality of the business. From a Q2 perspective, we had the first half of the quarter, which was, I don't want to say unimpacted, but through the first half of our quarter, this was essentially still viewed as largely a China problem, it didn't go global until mid-March in the second part of the quarter. I think the macro side of things is where it is now, we don't know where it's headed, but - so I think you're going to see a different seasonality than is as typical and then I like Ron's way of characterizing it, I mean, I think we've guided revenue in Q3 in line with Q2. We're certainly pushing on the manufacturing side as hard as we can push it, but right now, the way we see it and way we see the ramp progressing, you're going to be looking at revenues that are more or less in line."

            "name": "Satish Dhanasekaran",
            "content": "Yes, thanks, Ron. Mehdi, you're correct in that communications especially these new areas such as 5G with millimeter wave adoption and 400 gig and such are really gaining increased importance in today's world given what we have seen in terms of a disruption. So that should start to manifest itself. In fact, with discussions with customers we're having today, the focus is on accelerating innovation and going faster. So that positions us well having the entire layer one to layer seven capabilities internal to the company and having built that platform I referenced at the Investor Day gives us an advantage to go faster and deploy solutions with customers. You will also notice that we have a number of industry-leading collaborations that we announced just this quarter with the likes of Qualcomm, Rakuten, China Unicom, SONiC and others that spans the wireless to wireline arenas and positions us well for the future. Yes, I think so and you'll start to see them accelerate as we launch more solutions. We have some 90 new solutions planned for the second half of the year, which we're investing for and that should continue to position us very well in the communication space. Yes, Toshi, it's a very strong order quarter for 5G. Our orders grew at record levels as we mentioned before in Ron's comments, but equally worth noting was the strength continued into April and the growth that we saw was broad. It was across all regions grew and all segments of the customer base grew, all the ones that you referenced, chipsets, devices, and the NEMs and even the operator segments. I would say if we fill back the types of applications, the sustained investments in R&D, manufacturing started to ramp. In fact, we had a good uptick for our modular offerings, which we're enabling some of the component manufacturers to ramp up. So that was a positive note for us. And then we also saw success in new verticals such as automotive with the C-V2X application that we just launched and with our Aerospace and Defense solution with some of the 5G security offerings we have launched. So in summary, some of the opportunity progression that I had outlined at Investor Day sort of started to play out in Q2 and we also added 40 new customers for our 5G platform through our marketing efforts and working with our sales teams globally. I also want to say that our customer engagement through this phase has been very strong, even though some of our customers are working from home, they have been continually engaged as Ron mentioned to make sure that their projects don't slip too much and in some cases where they are slipping, they're looking at ways to accelerate. I also want to highlight some of our, let's say, remote working with customers is working very well. In fact, our 5G virtual events have been well attended by over 8,000 customers. So that points to the strength of our solutions there. We think with the upgrades to data center technology and in lieu of what people have learned from working at home and at this scale is definitely going to be a positive driver for us, especially for our Ixia business with multiple implications, speed is one of them, security is one of them, and visibility being the other piece to it. Right now, we did have a bit strong double-digit quarter for 400 gig based on some ramps we're seeing in China and our outlook for that part of the business continues to be favorable."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Ron Nersesian",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason and thank you all for joining us. First and foremost, we hope that you're all staying safe and well and our thoughts are with everyone affected by the coronavirus pandemic. The world has faced unprecedented challenges over the past several months and I would like to thank all of our employees for their continued dedication and commitment to Keysight, our customers, and our partners. Our execution and results this quarter underscore the power of our balance sheet, business model, and our Keysight leadership model, which drives our unique high performance culture and guides our company to continuously delivering greater value to customers, shareholders, and employees. I'll focus my formal comments today on three key headlines for the quarter. First, the health and safety of our employees is our top priority. After acting quickly to temporarily close most of our global locations in mid-March and implementing risk mitigation measures in response to the pandemic, we are now re-opening sites and our production capacity is ramping rapidly. Second, despite the mandatory government shutdown of our production facilities and resulting supply disruption impact on our Q2 revenue, Keysight delivered steady orders, strong operating margin, and record free cash flow. Our results demonstrated the exceptional resilience of our business and the durability of our financial operating model. And third, despite the near-term uncertainty, we are confident in our differentiated market leadership position, the strength of our operating model, and the long-term secular growth trends across our diverse set of end markets. Turning to the dynamics that impacted second quarter results. Demand was steady across markets in February. As the impact of the pandemic expanded beyond China in early March, we responded quickly to limit the spread of the coronavirus and mitigate the risk to employees, customers, and suppliers while also responding to local government directives. On March 18th, we issued a press release to announce the temporary closure of most locations around the world, including our production and order fulfillment facilities, which were fully closed for two weeks in March and had limited activity in April. We also took the necessary steps to deliver on our customer commitments, particularly those that provide essential services and support the communities in which we operate around the world. Working with local governments and health officials to implement health and safety measures at all of our locations, we are pleased to announce that we are re-opening sites worldwide. Despite ongoing broader industry supply chain challenges, we are ramping our Keysight production and services operation and expect to be back to 100% capacity by the end of the third quarter. Now let's take a deeper look into our financial results. Order growth was positive through March, followed by a decline in April to finish the quarter down only 3% compared to last year's record second quarter. While we don't typically comment on calendar quarter performance, given the dynamic nature of the situation, it's worth noting that Keysight's orders and revenues both grew mid-single digits in the January through March time frame. Despite lower than expected revenue as a result of supply chain disruptions, the resilience of Keysight's business model was exceptional and our flexible cost structure performed as expected. As a result of our immediate actions to reduce costs and preserve liquidity, we delivered operating margin of 19%, record free cash flow of $275 million, and a record cash balance of $1.8 billion. Our second quarter revenue declined 18% year-over-year as both segments of the business were impacted by the limited manufacturing capacity. However, we continue to see steady demand across several end markets with ongoing investment in next generation technologies such as 5G, 400 gig, and advanced semiconductor node processes. Other markets such as general electronics and automotive are expected to be more challenged in the near-term. In Commercial Communications, our ongoing 5G order momentum resulted in a new record. Our end-to-end solutions portfolio continues to gain strong global customer adoption and is enabling the commercial 5G launches underway. We are further solidifying our global leadership position across both the wireless and wired 5G ecosystem through close collaborations with market leadership and standards and first-to-market 5G design and test solutions. This quarter, we introduced Keysight's new 5G core network test solution called LoadCore. The 5G core testing software simulates complex real-world subscriber models. This enables mobile operators and network equipment manufacturers to qualify performance and reliability of voice and data transferred over 5G networks. This solution leverages from the Ixia and PRISMA acquisitions to deliver testing capability needed by our customers. We also announced a collaboration with Rakuten, an operator in Japan, to enable their 5G deployments using our solutions for test, validation, and optimization of devices and networks. Keysight's comprehensive solutions portfolio spanning the entire ecosystem is a key differentiator in the market. In aerospace, defense and government, order growth was driven by strong demand in the U.S. which was partially offset by lower international investment. Our solutions for electromagnetic spectrum operations, radar, space, and satellite continue to benefit from a favorable U.S. spending environment and ongoing investments in technology modernization. Despite the substantial challenges in the automotive sector, next generation electric and autonomous vehicle technology is a strategic priority for our customers. Keysight continues to invest to be first-to-market with solutions and remains highly engaged with key market players. For example, we recently announced the use of our Scienlab battery test solution in the BMW Group's new Battery Cell Competence Center in Germany. Foundry customers are continuing to prioritize investment in advanced process node technologies and incremental infrastructure. This resulted in revenue growth for our semiconductor measurement solutions where we had less supply chain disruption. Software and services continue to contribute to the differentiation of our solutions and recurring revenue base. While growing above the company average over time, they are strengthening the durability and diversity of our business model. In Q2, the combination of both software and services represented approximately 35% of revenue. Turning back to the current COVID-19 pandemic, we are committed to supporting our customers and our communities through this challenge. For our customers, we launched an Innovate Anywhere Program to enable IT teams to support remote users ensuring VPN performance and security. We also implemented various health and safety measures at our facilities to ensure all safeguards are met before production and other operations resumes. For our communities, we are contributing to the relief efforts globally through monetary and supply donations. These include donations of personal protective equipment to local hospitals and government agencies providing support to children, families, and the most vulnerable. We are also making direct financial contributions to local communities and global non-profit organizations. Before turning the call over to Neil, I'll close with a few key points. Keysight is a market leader in large, diverse, and growing end markets and serves a diversified global base of over 32,000 customers across multiple industries. The challenges of this pandemic are unprecedented and I'm proud on how our team has responded. Our execution demonstrates the durability of our business and the resilience of our business model with 19% operating margin and solid cash flow even with a Q2 revenue impact. We continue our significant investment in R&D and remain focused on first-to-market solutions. Our sales teams remain highly engaged with our customers and we continue to execute our strategy for long-term above market growth. While we expect ongoing COVID-19 demand and supply chain headwinds over the next few quarters, our long-term secular market growth trends and the strength of our operating model remain intact. We expect to come through this challenge stronger than ever. Now, I will turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and the outlook in more detail. Yes, this is Ron. Our backlog - our book-to-bill was 1.22 for the quarter showing very strong backlog build and obviously, our profitability - our operating model was strong and held up at 19%. If we had shipped that, we clearly would have been in very strong shape with operating margin in the mid-20s. As far as the quarter going forward, we have seen our operations turn on. Our main international operations that we have in Penang, Malaysia is back to 100% capacity. The main operations that we have in the U.S. are at about 70% capacity and will be at 100% by the end of the quarter. So even though there is a short-term disruption to the end of - to the second half of Q2 and the first half of Q3, we expect Q3 revenue to be at about the same level. We don't guide for orders for the future quarter though. Yes, we had a strong quarter in 5G. We had a very strong quarter in 400 gig back into the network and our overall play of winning up and down the ecosystem does create that synergy. I'm going to let Satish talk a little bit about the details. Sure. Obviously, we had a drop off in April when everything pretty much shut down. So our order level was lower. Our sales organization worked from home and actually has been very effective after the first couple of weeks just trying to figure out how to contact customers. A matter of fact, they've been finding it pretty efficient to be able to get on with Zoom as long as they have an established relationship with those customers, but that's what we saw with regards to the seasonality in the quarter. Revenue, we've talked about that and how that is ramping now and we'll be back to full strength by the end of the quarter. Mark, would you like to add anything? John, it is interesting to note though that a lot of our major customers has said they're not slipping schedules and they're doing everything they can to either stay on track or make up for any type of shortfall what they have and that bodes well for some type of let's say accelerated purchasing at some point when they do need it. Yes and clearly with the backlog, you could see, we've built $200 million worth of backlog in the last quarter. There is no doubt that we will be able to clear that out at some point in the future. We've guided or given you a range for Q3 where we expect to be, but beyond that, we expect ourselves to be at 100% and we'll be ramping rapidly from there. And the good news is the global race continues to be ahead in 5G, which nobody wants to take a pause. Sure, Toshiya, I'll let Satish, who is right in the middle of it, give you more of the details. Yes, we haven't sized those specific markets Toshiya but the GE and automotive markets are a significant portion, more than half of EISG obviously the part that's missing there is the semi business which has been strong, but EISG's business is kind of more heavily or more - the weaker market areas are more heavily weighted towards EISG with general electronics, automotive, EISG, these things that tend to be more tightly linked to GDP. Yes, I mean it's impossible for us to know what would have happened right, but I think if you go back to where we were at the beginning of the quarter, we obviously put a guide out for the quarter that we had a high degree of confidence in our ability to hit. And so you could look at that delta relative to our guidance on the revenue line and for all intents and purposes, I would attribute that shortfall to COVID. I think from our perspective, the world changed in mid-March. As we talked about the sites being closed, limited productivity in April, but we continue to be very optimistic about how we're positioned on a go-forward basis. We're a leader in our markets, we have a strong technology position and I think as markets recover, we are going to come through this even stronger. Yes, I think it is fair to say taking a look at our order rate and knowing how we do our supply chain planning, a book to bill of around 1 was probably would have been normal if there wasn't a COVID issue for Q2. Well, you could go back and look at history of where we've been operating somewhere around the $1.1 billion per quarter kind of range as close to full production. So that gives you an idea of something to key off of. Obviously, the dynamic is a little bit different, right? We were going full steam ahead through mid-March and then it shut off pretty quickly with the ramp in April. We're now continuing to ramp in May, expecting to be back to something close to 100% across the ecosystem by the end of the quarter. So you kind of have to ramp down last quarter followed by the ramp-up this quarter and as close as we can call it, at this point, the revenue numbers and the profitability numbers are going to be in the same vicinity as one another. I don't think so. There could have been - there can be some very minor issues, but if I take a look at orders and I look at orders January, February and March, we grew mid-single digits on the order line, which is pretty competitive. Nobody else or very few people have reported in our industry what happened in April. So when they come out, I'd be surprised if their numbers were not the same. We've been growing above market every single quarter now for years and for everything that was going on, I do anticipate that we are at market or better and our backlog position now is so strong, you'll see that flow into revenue and profitability and cash flow as we go forward. Yes. So, I mean if you look across our business, right, the one area where we saw actual revenue growth was in semi, which is all within EISG and it's also a very high margin segment for us. So I think predominantly looking at a mix issue or not issue, a mix benefit that EISG received with the very strong semi shipments relative to the other parts of their business and so that's really what you see going on there. And it's worthwhile to note that obviously with a lot of fixed infrastructure as we start to see the business come back, you'll continue to see very strong gross margin performance. Yes, I think EISG has businesses that are more GDP linked. We've talked about general electronics, which includes the education segment, but if we just talk about education for a while, until - there's really two aspects of education, there's the teaching aspect and the research aspect, but in both cases, you need students on campus, right, to really get those education markets up and going. Automotive, we know what's happening in the auto industry. So we still don't know what the shape of the recovery is going to look like. You can read all the same reports that I read about what the ultimate recovery is looking like, but EISG I think tends to be more macro linked and more linked to GDP where the drivers within CSG the roll out of 5G, the roll out of 400 gigabit, the aerospace defense investments potentially have the ability to buck some of those trends as folks work to get those technologies to market. Sure, Jim, this is Ron. I'll just take the questions. I'll take them in reverse order. With regards to the inventory situation, it's real simple. We have parts coming in the door and we have no one in the factory to build them and that's the case that we had in the second half of March. It's not the case now as we have Penang up and running, but we also supply parts from our tech center in the United States. So when there is nobody putting together parts or even if things are put together and they're not shipped, there is no revenue credit. So all parts have to be there in order to complete a product. There are thousands of parts in certain products, some made within Keysight and more of the commodity type pieces that are put into products in addition to our unique differentiators. Some of them flow in and some flow out, but the bottom line was we weren't putting together any systems or shipping them out and that was because of not only internal to the Keysight manufacturing facilities, but also the contract manufacturers that would do sub-assemblies, but now we're very happy with the progress that has been made and where we are now and where we expect to be by the end of this quarter. The second issue with regard to the R&D cycle, there was a bit of a stop but everyone's trying to figure out how to operate in this new normal where every customer that we spoke to are very, very high percentage of them went through that. Now they've situated to work at home, to go in part time, to use test systems or in some cases, like China, return back to work. So we see the R&D engineers being much more efficient and accordingly, they're trying to figure out how to keep their projects on track because they are competing against their ultimate competition. So that's why we see things accelerating in that cycle. How much equipment acceleration we'll see at what rate is yet to be seen, but we feel very positive as we look forward. Yes, so I'll take that. From the order perspective, orders were basically stable versus last year. With regard to the revenue impact, some of that stuff, particularly for the U.S. markets require to be built in the U.S. We did get earlier access to our Penang facilities than we did to some of our locations in the U.S. and so there probably was - I think it is fair to say that there was a disproportionate impact on aerospace defense from a manufacturing perspective just given the fact that the access to the U.S. facilities lagged the access to our facilities in Asia in April. We don't guide orders out for Q3. Rick, I think as you know, but we're going to try to do everything we can to lower our backlog. I'm not saying that we've guided that but what we're trying to do is improve our position to get our deliveries out to the customers that need them. You're right on a typical non-COVID environment, we see a ramp at the end of Q2 and then the biggest ramp at the end of Q4, which is literally how we do the comp in the field organization and then Q3 is not as high as you would expect when looking at Q2, but overall, we expect orders to be very solid and not out of line with what we've seen in the past. And the reason why you see that isn't so much the internal capacity, you could do the math and say for 100% right now internationally in Penang and we're at 70% in the U.S. and you do some type of linear extrapolation of basically the facility that we have in our fab in the U.S., you could come up with a much higher number. But in order to produce products, you need three things, you need all the parts, you need your contract manufacturers for sub-assemblies and you need the Keysight manufacturing facilities. The CMs are very close to 100%, you see our facilities getting close to 100%, but we still are relying on the delivery of components from different suppliers that go into our products and that is something that is a bit extended that is figured into our guide. Satish owns the data center portion and I'll let him answer. Yes, we're very pleased with the way our operating model has performed. We've talked a lot about what we felt we could do in a down cycle. The business there - the model has a number of structural elements that are designed to respond instantaneously to changes in condition. The number one of those is the variable pay component. Again 100% of our employees have a portion of their pay that fluctuates with our business results. Outside of the executives, the rank and file, if you will, that's really tied to our growth rates and to our operating margins and so as both of those things corrected in the third quarter, we saw a significant reduction in our people-related costs. Similarly, contract manufacturing, outsource sales, those types of things, those came online. Beyond that we took action to reduce discretionary spend, everything from - again, certain things happened relatively automatically like travel basically crashed towards zero in the second half of the quarter, reductions in temporary workers, the executives who have actually put in a pay cuts for our executive team ranging from 100% at the CEO level to 50% for the senior vice presidents. So we've taken a number of different actions to further reduce spending. Yes, well, Brandon, we have the same priorities that we had before obviously to fund organic growth to make sure that we stay neutral or anti-dilutive and to look at M&A opportunities. In certain cases, things have become more attractive, but we still have a high hurdle to beat our cost of capital with our - excuse me, to beat our WACC with our ROIC and we continue to look pretty aggressively at those but again, we will make sure that the ROIC is high enough. Yes, to have a global pandemic come and literally be ordered out of our own factories is something that we don't think is typical and I don't know if it's once in a lifetime, but it's a very rare occasion. We also have a lot of our manufacturing capacity that are spread around with CMs and the CMs are located in different countries where they can move, they can move their production from one facility to another and move it around into different countries. So we look at that, we review that annually and make sure that we have an optimized footprint trying to balance what we typically would see and what type of benefit there is financially versus spreading out over multiple factories. So we continue to do that analysis. We have the discussions all the time and there are some things that we do, do, that were not always public. I think the country by country race to lead in 5G will continue regardless of the macro situation. There is too much at stake for a lot of our large customers and you know them from the NEMs right through the whole ecosystem in communications and they will continue to drive towards getting to market first. When you look at the GDP plus or the GDP or GDP plus businesses, such as general electronics and the general manufacturing, there you could see a slow down as we've seen, for instance, in automotive. So I think those are the businesses that will continue to see some weaknesses which are automotive and general electronics, but I do expect the communications business where there is a race for that to be robust going forward and as you know, that's the strongest part of the business and that enabled us to produce 19% operating margin."

            "name": "Neil Dougherty",
            "content": "Thank you, Ron and hello everyone. Before I get started, I will note that all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless specifically noted otherwise. Keysight delivered a solid quarter thanks to strong execution in a challenging environment. While supply chain disruptions dampened our revenue performance during the second half of the quarter, our results demonstrated the resiliency of our operating model and durable cash generation. We responded quickly with proactive measures to reduce costs and preserve liquidity while supporting our customers and advancing key projects. For the second quarter of 2020, we delivered revenue of $895 million, down 18% on a reported and core basis due to our site closures and supply chain disruptions that started in mid-March and continued through the end of the quarter. Orders of $1.1 billion were down 3% on a reported and core basis. As Ron mentioned, we continued to see steady demand in investment across multiple end markets, particularly for our next generation communication solutions. Turning to our operational results for Q2, we reported gross margin of 63% with improved mix and lower spending partially offsetting the impact of lower revenue. The flexibility of our cost structure resulted in lower variable compensation and a reduction in outsourced manufacturing costs. This combined with other specific actions such as a temporary hiring freeze and reductions in discretionary spending enabled our flexible operating model to perform as expected resulting in 19% operating margin for the quarter. Net income in the second quarter was $148 million. On a per share basis, we delivered $0.78 in earnings. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 189 million shares. Regarding the performance of our segments. In light of the broad supply chain disruptions, CSG and EISG expense management and margin performance were exceptional. CSG operating margin was 18% while EISG delivered 24% operating margin. On the demand side, general electronics, education, and automotive were weak while investment continued in 5G, aerospace defense, and other leading-edge technology solutions. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our second quarter with a record $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents with $450 million of additional liquidity available under our undrawn revolving credit facility. We reported cash flow from operations of $298 million and record free cash flow of $275 million or 31% of revenue. The strength of our cash generation reflects the power of our financial operating model, which incorporates a flexible cost structure and includes a financial playbook that is designed to preserve margins and cash generation during challenging times. Under our share repurchase authorization, we acquired approximately 1.3 million shares on the open market in the first half of the quarter at an average price of $91.14 for a total consideration of $120 million. Our year-to-date repurchases are sufficient to achieve our objective of being anti-dilutive for the full year and to exit the year at 190 million shares. While we are focused on optimizing liquidity, given our strong operating model and cash generation, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. Now turning to our outlook and guidance. While we are not quite back to full capacity, our production operations and those of our suppliers have been ramping since mid-April. We expect to make continued progress in Q3 and as a result, expect third quarter revenue, operating margin, and earnings to be in line with or better than Q2. These expectations are based on our order funnel, a strong backlog position, and assume limited incremental supply chain constraints or disruption from additional shutdowns or a second wave of the pandemic. While maintaining R&D investments for future growth, we will continue to focus on profitability and leverage the flexibility of our operating model to manage expenses. In closing, the near-term situation is obviously challenging, but we remain focused on our long-term strategy of enabling our customers' success through first-to-market leading-edge solutions. Once the COVID-19 situation stabilizes, the durability of our business model, cash generation, strong balance sheet, and market leadership position give us confidence in our long-term financial targets that we shared with you at our Investor Day in early March, specifically sustainable long-term core growth of 4% to 6%, operating margin of 26% to 27%, and EPS growth of at least 10% over the long-term. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A. And then to your second part of your question as it relates to Huawei. We don't really have any change at this point as it relates to our expectations of Huawei going forward. We kind of still we expect them to be a 1% to 2% customer for us on a go-forward basis. So if you look at that, you could see where we were down roughly a couple of hundred million dollars, we're down at roughly 80% of capacity. So the fact that we took out - we lost a couple of weeks in March and then you could take another week or two out of April, just as you start to see that ramp or ramp linearly. So that's a very rough estimate, but I think it's pretty accurate. I expect it to be similar. Yes, no, we'll probably push out a little bit, obviously we made significant capital commitments already for the year, but we will - we would expect to under spend. We're probably now - we're looking at something more like a $100 million to $110 million for the year."

And now, I'll turn the call over to Ron.\nRon Nersesian: Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. Keysight delivered another outstanding quarter. Our consistent performance illustrates the strength of our differentiated solutions, the diversity of our end markets, as well as the robustness of our business model. I will now focus my formal comments on three key headlines for the quarter. First, Keysight delivered a strong start to the year demonstrating sustained profitable growth across multiple dimensions of our business, both revenue and earnings exceeded the high end of our guidance and we achieved record first quarter orders, revenue and earnings, including an all-time record of gross margin of 65%. Second, our ongoing strength in 5G-related investments and Keysight's leading solutions across the ecosystem resulted in record 5G orders and continued growth in Commercial Communications. In addition, secular growth trends are fueling broad-based momentum across our target markets. And third, we are monitoring the coronavirus situation and want to acknowledge those who have been affected. While we do see some potential for near-term impact, we remain confident in the strength of our broad portfolio of industry-focused solutions, software and services. Now, let's take a deeper look into our first quarter. We achieved $1.26 in earnings per share, which was $0.16 above the high end of our guidance and represents 36% year-over-year earnings growth. We achieved record first quarter orders that grew 12% year-over-year, reflecting the resilience of our business and extensive market reach. Revenue grew 9% year-over-year to reach a new first quarter record. First quarter revenue performance was driven by strength in Commercial Communications, Aerospace, Defense and Government, and Semiconductor Measurement Solutions. In commercial communications, record first quarter revenue was driven by continued investments in 5G, fueled by the transformation of communications systems, including wireless access, infrastructure, wireline technologies, data center and the cloud. Our success is being driven by close collaboration with key market players to innovate and create many industry firsts. For example, we recently introduced the Value Series Channel Emulation Solution called PROPSIM FS16. This solution was enabled by the Anite acquisition and is the latest in a long line of our innovative first-to-market solutions to accelerate 5G development and commercialization. We\u2019re also excited to announce today another industry-first solution that enables customers to model 5G security threats in the lab. 5G technology innovation is enabling a massive proliferation of connected devices resulted in greater security, vulnerabilities, and an expanded attack surface. Keysight's 5G security testbed was made possible by the cybersecurity expertise and technology gained through the Ixia acquisition. Recall, that as of the first quarter, we integrated the Ixia Solutions Group, ISG, into our Communication Solutions Group to accelerate solution synergies and the teams are already getting very good traction. For the second consecutive quarter, orders for Ixia Solutions grew double-digits as we saw continued strength in network visibility and 400-gigabit Ethernet investment in Layer 2/3 protocol solutions. Ixia and our other commercial communications acquisitions such as Anite, AT4 and PRISMA enable us to provide our customers with a broad and differentiated set of solutions that span the stack layers as 5G evolves over the years to come. We are pleased with the broad global adoption of our 5G platform as our R&D solutions continue to lead the industry.  For example, we recently announced that Keysight's 5G conformance test solutions have been selected by the Korea testing laboratory for global 5G device certification. We are also seeing success beyond R&D with key wins this quarter in component manufacturing for base stations and devices as 5G production begins to ramp globally. Moving on to other growth factors, our strong performance beyond commercial communications reinforces our broad momentum across Keysight's diverse end markets. In Aerospace Defense and Government, our revenue grew double digits to achieve a first quarter record with broad base strength across all regions. This was the third consecutive quarter of strong year-over-year order growth in Aerospace Defense. Our solutions for electromagnetic spectrum operations, radar, space and satellite continue to benefit from a favorable U.S. spending environment and ongoing investments in technology modernization. In automotive and energy, revenue grew high single digits with increasing customer demand for key strategic applications. Our success in automotive is being driven by our first-to-market solutions and focus on next-generation technologies. For example, this quarter we achieved 3GPP validation of the industry's first C-V2X or cellular vehicle-to-everything radio frequency conformance test case. As a result, Keysight is enabling the automotive industry to accelerate commercialization of connected cars and autonomous vehicles. We also announced a collaboration with a leading provider of battery cells on cell formation. This collaboration supports the electrification of vehicles by enabling the development and manufacture of advanced battery cells. In Semiconductor Measurement Solutions, we achieved strong order and revenue growth driven by our customer strategic investments in next-generation process readiness. Our software and services continue to play an increasingly important role in Keysight's differentiated portfolio of customer-centric solutions. Software orders once again grew above our overall growth rate. Notably, this quarter, Keysight was named the organizational winner of the 2020 Business Intelligence Group Award for our PathWave Test 2020 software released just last October. PathWave Test 2020 was selected from a range of recent innovations submitted by organizations around the globe. I'm also happy to report that services orders and revenue grew double-digits in the quarter. We continue to see good adoption of our new support offerings such as Keysight Care, which was also a contributor to our year-over-year gross margin expansion. In summary, we delivered another outstanding quarter and a strong start to the year. Differentiated solutions across diverse end markets, consistent execution, and strong financial performance continue to drive our value creation. We have an exciting lineup for you at our Investor Day next week on March 3 and we look forward to sharing an update on our strategy and our long-term expectations to the business. Now, I will turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail.\nNeil Dougherty: Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. Before I get started, I will note that all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless specifically noted otherwise. We delivered another strong quarter as we continue to capitalize on the broad-based momentum across Keysight's diverse end markets. For the first quarter of 2020, we delivered non-GAAP revenue of $1.095 billion, which was well above the high end of our guidance range and grew 8% on a core basis. Better than expected revenue results were driven by broad strength across multiple end markets. Orders outpaced revenue for the sixth consecutive quarter as Q1 orders of $1.141 billion grew 12% in total and 11% on a core basis. Looking at our operational results for Q1, we reported record gross margin of 65% and our operating expenses of $433 million, resulting in our fourth consecutive quarter with operating margin at or above 25%. We also achieved net income of $240 million and delivered $1.26 in earnings per share, which was well above the high end of our guidance. Now, moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated total revenue of $818 million, up 9% while delivering record gross margin of 66% and operating margin of 25%. In Q1, Commercial Communications delivered double-digit order growth and revenue of $573 million, driven by strength in 5G solutions.  As Ron mentioned earlier, starting in the first quarter, we have aligned the former Ixia Solutions Group or ISG with our commercial communications end market and are now reporting Ixia results within our Communications Solutions Group. Aerospace Defense and Government generated revenue of $245 million, an increase of 10% and a first quarter record driven by a broad-based growth across all regions as investment in advanced technology continued. Order growth for this end market was high-single digits and we have a strong funnel going into Q2. EISG generated first quarter revenue of $277 million, up 8% driven by strength in semiconductor measurement and next-gen automotive solutions. EISG reported gross margin of 61% and operating margin of 26%. Moving onto the balance sheet and cash flow, we enter our first quarter with $1.69 billion in cash and cash equivalents and reported cash flow from operations of $197 million and free cash flow of $165 million or 15% of revenue. Under our share repurchase authorization, during the quarter, we acquired approximately 730,000 shares on the open market at an average price of $102.48 for a total consideration of $75 million. Now, turning to our outlook and guidance. We expect second quarter 2020 revenue to be in the range of $1.138 billion to $1.178 billion. For the first half of 2020, the midpoint of our guidance reflects 7% revenue growth or 6% core growth. This guidance incorporates our current assessment of the coronavirus impact. Given the dynamics of the situation, we expect any impact from coronavirus to simply be a push-out in demand and do not anticipate any impact on our full-year results at this time. We expect Q2 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.28 to $1.38 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 191 million shares. The midpoint of this guidance reflects approximately 20% earnings growth for the first half of 2020. As Ron mentioned, we look forward to sharing our strategy to drive profitable growth, as well as our latest long-term expectations for the business at our upcoming Investor Day on March 3. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.\nJason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Josh, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nJohn Pitzer: Yes. Good afternoon, Ron and Neil. Congratulations on the solid results. Neil, I know you said in your prepared comments that the guidance for the fiscal second quarter includes your view of the coronavirus impact. I'm just wondering if you can quantify it for us a little bit \u2013 for us? Did it bring down the midpoint? Did it widen the range? And I guess, how are you thinking about kind of your exposure? Is it mainly a function of what you're shipping into China or if you can just walk through the methodology that would be helpful.\nRon Nersesian: Yes. Hi, John. This is Ron. I'm going to give you a little bit of a long answer on this because I figure there's a lot of interest in the effects of the coronavirus. First of all, it's a very unfortunate situation affecting not only China, but we're seeing it obviously in South Korea, Italy, and other countries, including customers around the world. The situation is changing, so here is an up-to-the-minute update, as far as what we know at this point. The first thing I'd like to say is that we have a lot of sales in China, but we do not do much manufacturing at all. Over 99% of our products are not manufactured in China. We do receive about 10% of our parts or a little bit less than 10% of our parts from China, but all of this is built into what our guide is. So, let's talk about our employees. We have 991 people in China and another about 233 non-Keysight workers that help us in sales, support, and research and development. Of those 1,224 workers, luckily none have reported coronavirus cases at all. The other thing that's worthwhile to note is, if you look at Hubei province in Wuhan, they're not a big employment center for us. We have folks in Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu in Szechwan Province and Shenzhen primarily, as well as some salespeople that are scattered throughout the rest of China. One third of those people are back at work already as we've opened up offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, and Shenzhen and the rest, the other 770 folks are working remotely through video conferences, remote support with remote control of instruments and giving daily reports to the sales management. So, we get a daily report on the health status of every one, the sales funnel and how everybody is doing in order to make sure we're taking care of our customers, as well as our employees. We're working through that same process in other parts of the field or in other regions, but clearly the impact in other regions is smaller and not as big of a center for us. So, let's talk about the business implications as we know it. Last quarter, we guided [$1.055 billion] in revenue and we delivered [$1.141 billion] in orders or we delivered $86 million in orders above what we said assuming a book to bill of 1%. Of that $86 million in orders, we shipped $40 million of it. So we actually delivered revenue of $1.095 billion, not $1.055 billion, but the additional $46 million we have in backlog that can help smooth out any timing delays that we would see from the coronavirus. We have guided $1.158 billion, plus or minus $20 million, and we've built in approximately $20 million worth of impact into our guide. The key point though that you should remember is that we have a good backlog situation. We have very differentiated products, and we're very confident at this point that we'll be able to make up any delays that we see in the second half of the year, therefore not affecting Keysight's performance in fiscal year 2020. I hope that helps, John.\nJohn Pitzer: Very thorough \u2013 very thorough and helpful, Ron. I guess, as my follow up, second consecutive strong quarter for Ixia. It's a relatively new business within your portfolio. For us in the investment community, we haven't had a lot of experience with the Ixia asset. I'm just kind of curious as to how you would characterize sustainability of the growth you're seeing now. Is this in your mind a naturally lumpy business or do you feel like Ixia has kind of turned the corner and there's sustainability to these [terms].\nRon Nersesian: There's two main parts of the Ixia \u2013 what was the Ixia business, which is now our network assurance solutions, one of them is network test and then the other section is network visibility. Network visibility is a consistent grower. It was smaller, but it continues to get larger and larger, and we're very happy with that. And there we see a little bit more of a linear growth. The network test business isn't as linear; it depends on basically the build-outs that happen in our end customers. I'll turn it over to Satish to maybe add a couple of more comments, but that's the high level summary.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thanks Ron. I'll just say that the improved performance is a function of a few factors. First, it's improving market dynamics associated with the broader adoption of 400-gig Ethernet, technologies from data centers, and then solid execution both on the business and the sales side through the changes that we have just instituted.  The differentiated products and solutions that are coming out are gaining good traction with customers. On the visibility side, as Ron mentioned with network packet brokers and taps and on the test side with our [Layer 2/3 business], which is a big part of that portfolio which had a record quarter through the broad adoption of the 400-gig technologies. Looking ahead, we're really focused on accelerating synergies inside the group. As we've talked about, 5G is a big trend that impacts both wireless and wire line technologies and that convergence is really a sweet spot that we're targeting. We have started some new solution offerings in the space, for example, with the combination of RAM and co-testing, we are very uniquely positioned there. And second, we've recently launched the security testbed for 5G that does reference to Ron's transcript, which is really a combination of Ixia security toolkit and applied to the 5G technologies, which is gaining a lot of interest from customers. So, in summary, improving market dynamics, solid execution combined with this synergy utilization should position us well in this business. Thank you.\nRon Nersesian: The other thing I would like to say is that obviously with the second quarter of double-digit growth, we're very happy with the way this business is progressing. At first, we had to do a lot more integration work than we thought. We had to move the supply chain to ours to get basically the improvements and the synergies that we expected on the cost side and we had to enhance the quality. So that took a little bit more time than we had expected originally. However, the business and the business dynamics and where it's going in the synergies that we have really makes us excited about this business' contribution to Keysight in the long-term and our ability to provide complete workflow solutions from one end to the other.\nJohn Pitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Couillard: Thanks. Good afternoon.\nRon Nersesian: Hi, Brandon.\nBrandon Couillard: Ron, Europe \u2013 and the European region kind of grew 2%, slowest on a two-year stack in about a year. Can you sort of give us sort of macro picture maybe what you've seen in terms of the sub-segments in that region?\nRon Nersesian: Sure. I'm going to turn it over to Mark. Our order growth was higher than the 2% than we reported, and revenue was roughly 5% growth. So, that's a little bit of a different picture, but Mark, the Head of Sales, will take you further.\nMark Wallace: Right. So, Brandon, we have seen gradually improving business conditions across Europe. And as Ron said, revenue up 4%, 5% on orders, and we're seeing some of that come from the commercial comps side of our business. Automotive, especially advanced automotive solutions and next-generation auto and semiconductor continue to show signs of recovery. Aerospace Defense is mixed, the situation in Russia remains slow and there are some delays to some of those orders. On the other side, general electronics is an area that we put a lot of focus on not only in Europe but around the world, both from our broad portfolio of customers, as well as our education customers and we continue to see growth there as well. And then finally, the automotive business, particularly around electric vehicle, continues to expand with new customers and a strong funnel of new opportunities going forward. Some of these customers are more traditional automotive mechanical type of customers that are now moving into the electronics domain, and we are very well-positioned to support them with our solutions from Scienlab, as well as our broader offering of services. So, we're seeing improving conditions as compared to kind of the middle of last year and we hope to see that continue going forward.\nBrandon Couillard: Thanks. And a follow-up for Neil, 65% gross margin in the first quarter is a step up from the kind of where you exited the year last year; can you sort of speak to the room to continue to push that higher and perhaps help us bridge the year-over-year gross margin expansion in terms of the factors and drivers behind that? Thanks.\nMark Wallace: I think we have multiple levers that are helping us on the gross margin line. First of all, I pointed the overall strategy to migrate towards first-to-market solutions to that first-to-market nature, as well as just the nature of providing complete solutions as opposed to tools leads to higher differentiation in the marketplace of the solutions and to have higher software content.  So, mix is helping us not only in terms of the mix of software, but the continued mix shift toward winning in R&D tends to be a higher gross margin sale as well. And notably, this quarter, we actually saw a pretty strong improvement in our services gross margins that it's a smaller business. It does have below-average gross margin in total, but we saw nice improvement in our services business. I think you see the migration toward Keysight Care, which is our new pay-for support or offering is being \u2013 is additive there as well.\nBrandon Couillard: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Marchetti from Stifel. Your line is open.\nRon Nersesian: Hi, John.\nJohn Marchetti: Sorry about that. I just wanted to ask, Ron, you talked about obviously the 5G strength globally. And just curious if you can characterize that, is there still a fair number of new customers that you're winning in that business? Is it the strengthening or reordering by existing customers? Just curious as you're looking at that business continuing to sort of gain momentum, how we should think about the customer profile within it?\nRon Nersesian: Yes. Satish will take you through that, but I'm really pleased with the breadth of our overall customer base as it starts to go from Tier 1 to other players. And he'll talk about that.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thanks, Ron. Very pleased with the results on 5G. I would say a new record as we indicated and growth across all regions and representing customers across this diverse set of ecosystems. The collaborations that we have sustained through years of work with them continue to be very strong and a foundation for the business, but we're also adding new customers as 5G scale. So this quarter, we added 40-plus new customers into our 5G platform, which has been a source of strength. One particular driver that I like to maybe point out that is \u2013 that'll play out to this year and the remaining part of this year is the adoption of number of devices that are being announced for 5G. Over 200 devices have been announced to-date. That is up 100% since August of 2019 when we last spoke about this. So that is a big driver for the ecosystem and that will continue to place as well. And finally, from an application point of view, we continue to be strong in R&D where our differentiation is increasing through the test coverage and the new features we're landing, but we're also starting to pick up wins in manufacturing as we have stated we're following our customers' lifecycle. And we've had some pretty decent wins in manufacturing for components in base stations this quarter as well.\nJohn Marchetti: And maybe as a follow-up to that, I mean, historically you guys have talked about wanting to make sure you're really in cast where there's a high cost of failure. And as you're looking at some of the production opportunities within 5G, does that still fit that category? Is it that this is such a complicated technology for OEMs and operators to roll out that that cost of failure is still higher? Is it a little bit of a change in strategy to try to broaden out the reach within 5G? Thank you.\nRon Nersesian: There is plenty of manufacturing opportunities for us in 5G. There is no doubt that our R&D presence has grown and has grown dramatically, and that really plays well to our business model, but there are a high value-add opportunities for us in manufacturing. Whether you see that with components or subassemblies, or you look at it down even on the wired part of 5G, you can't just put in wireless 5G and not be able to handle the data on the wired side. So when you look at everything from fiber optic tools and going all the way through the network, there is more and more opportunities for us especially you'll see that on the physical layer, on the physical layer back in the network. On top of that, as everything moves to millimeter-wave, it gets more complex, more difficult to do, and that's where we've been playing for many, many decades and it's relatively new to most of our competitors. So that provides us an opportunity not only to focus on areas where the cost of failure is high, but really we focus on where we can add value-add in total and generate great margins for us.\nJohn Marchetti: Thank you.\nRon Nersesian: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is open.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Ron, a couple of quarters ago, you tried to take some of the revenue opportunity associated with Huawei, and there was like a 200 basis point to 500 basis point of the first half of the revenue target that was taken off to de-risk from Huawei, especially with the tariffs. And now we have the coronavirus, but what I want to learn is, assuming that this is more of push out, what happens when like 6, 9, 12 months from now coronavirus is over and hopefully the tariff is over. Can you help us understand what happens to these opportunities \u2013 revenue opportunities that are pushed out? And I have a follow up.\nRon Nersesian: Yes. I'll start and I'm going to let Neil go ahead and quantify the Huawei situation, but I'll just say this, the Huawei customers really like our products and solutions and they come to us and there's a good demand for those products. As we look further in the year, we have a modest amount in our forecast, but for the long-term they're looking to lead in many markets and we have the differentiated tools to help them out.\nNeil Dougherty: I think that's right. I think the same is largely to a broader coronavirus, as I said in my comments, we believe that any disruption that we may see in the short-term that results from coronavirus would simply be a push-out in demand. We don't believe it has an ultimate impact on the absolute level of demand in this fiscal year. I think if you look at Huawei more specifically, we saw broad strength within the quarter. We are limited in terms of what we can sell to Huawei, we're complying with the Department of Commerce regulations, but even with that limited portfolio, our sales to Huawei in the first quarter were a bit ahead of where we expected them to be. I think as we look forward, however we're pretty comfortable with the estimate that we provided of thinking of Huawei as a 1% to 2% customer as we move forward from here.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay. And then, I know you're going to dive into this next week, but as we think about your incremental booking, how much of this is driven by your ability to offer full of stack? Are you actually seeing any traction there? Is there any incremental business you're capturing by offering full stack or is that more of a longer-term target?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. No \u2013 this is Satish here, and I'll just maybe offer a follow-through. Yes, I think the ability to serve the entire ecosystem is a huge differentiator for us. It separates us from any product-oriented competition that may come up with products. I'd give you an example. In many cases, we're working with operators. We just announced recently that we released 600 test scripts for the four U.S. operator test plans for 5G.  So, someone that wants to service these operators in that ecosystem now have a fastest way of ramping up and getting their time-to-market. So, that's an example of sort of the advantage you get when you are working with somebody that has the end-to-end portfolio. Our ability to reconfigure and create solutions with the broad capabilities we have is another advantage. I'll just give you an example again with the five-year security testbed. A number of our Aerospace and Defense customers wanted to prototype this threat environment in the lab. We were the ones that were able to provide them the solutions. So, hopefully, those help.\nMehdi Hosseini: Your revenue from Europe was up double-digit on a sequential basis. Was that driven by OEM customers, OEM incumbent companies, or is that more of a broad base?\nNeil Dougherty: We don't look at Europe or many other regions on a sequential basis because there is such seasonality built into our customer base, as well as into even our sales force and the commissions and how that works out. So, we look at it on a year-over-year compare and that's why we've taken it modestly to 5% order growth and 2% revenue growth for the quarter.\nMark Wallace: Yes. And this is Mark. I would just add again like I said before, we did see some softness in certain end markets last year particularly automotive. There was some mixed conditions in Aerospace and Defense and we're starting to see some moderating trends in that respect. We're starting to see some improvements in semiconductor. We're seeing our broad-based customers and the solutions we're providing to them, shows some signs of improvement as well. So, it's trending in a more positive direction.\nMehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Ridley-Lane from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Good afternoon. I wanted to get a little bit more color on what \u2013 helping to drive the aerospace defense revenue and order growth and was that you \u2013 did you see any potentially budget flush at the end of the year or do you feel like this is pretty good underlying payment as well?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes, hi. This is Satish. I will take it. On the Aerospace and Defense front, record orders this quarter, building on the $1 billion record finish we had last year. So, very pleased with the results so far. The budget stability in the U.S. is a big contribution factor. There is a lot of program wins that are being awarded by DoD, that\u2019s flowing through to the prime contractors in the supply chain. Our differentiated capability combined with decades of providing solutions to the space position us well. In particular, our Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations Solutions, Space and Satellite solutions are receiving good growth for us in that region. We also see a broader \u2013 internationally, a broader wave of defense modernization where people are re-tooling and upgrading their capabilities, and that position us well for the long run.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: And then a different topic, the sales force expansion, can you maybe talk about how the recent hires are ramping up in productivity and just sort of your early results on those hirers, potentially biased you towards increasing your sales headcounts even further? Thank you.\nMark Wallace: Sure. This is Mark; I'll make a comment on that. So, we are on track in making really good progress with doubling the number of frontline sellers across key site and next week, at the Investor Day conference, I will be outlining a tremendous amount of detail on where we stand and what our next steps are. What I can tell you is we are hiring across all regions, we're focused on where the growth is. So, we're concentrating our hires to where we see the best opportunities, and we're equipping our teams with the right tools and training. So not only are we seeing an increase in capacity in terms of just the number of frontline sellers we've deployed, but their productivity is also improving as well. So, again, stay tuned for more. I'll go through a lot more in detail next week.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Okay. I look forward to. Thank you very much.\nRon Nersesian: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer from Thompson Davis. Your line is open.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Congrats on a great quarter.\nRon Nersesian: Thank you.\nAdam Thalhimer: I wanted to ask first about Millimeter Wave, your thoughts on Millimeter Wave in general and how it's performing in the field?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes, it's still very early days for millimeter wave deployments at scale. I would say that, you know a large part of the deployment so far subscale 6-gigahertz and still even there, there's a lot of challenges that our customers face, which is why our tools continue to be embraced and are helping with scaling up the ecosystem. The other factor I would mention here is this sort of heterogeneous spectrum environment both with new frequency bands and the higher frequency bands getting integrated is creating sort of this cycle of demand for our tools in this marketplace. So, very early days overall with millimeter-wave, and but there is no doubt that millimeter-wave will be realized just because of all the spectrum that's being put in place and the high innovation that currently the ecosystem is undergoing. Eventually there will be millimeter-wave based offerings with [time].\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. And I wanted to ask about cash flow and balance sheet. Your net debt is now, I think, tied for the lowest since the IPO. What are your thoughts on cash deployment? And on M&A, is there any big out there you could do or do you think it's more about continued tuck-ins?\nRon Nersesian: Yes. I don't think you see any \u2013 we don't expect to have any significant changes to our capital allocation priorities. We're looking to strike balance with what we'll do, we continue to invest, to drive organic growth in the investments we're making in R&D close to $700 million per year, the investments Mark just talked about in terms of doubling our sales force.  You mentioned M&A, we have an active funnel development process, but we'll remain patient and disciplined when it comes to that, but we are out there actively looking for opportunities to add value \u2013 add value through acquisitions. And then we're returning capital as well, right? We have, I think, $335 million remaining on the authorization that we have outstanding, which is $75 million worth of stock this last quarter. And so, I think you'll see us continue to strike that balance and will trade off amongst those categories as appropriate over time.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva of Citigroup Investments. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJim Suva: Thank you. And I have two questions now and at the same time so you can take them in any order that you'd like to. If I heard correctly, it sounds like the coronavirus you believe is just a push out. So, the question I have is, does it impact the revenue guidance only in the revenues or did it also impact the orders? And the reason why I ask is the orders I believe were up about 12% year-over-year, up 11% on a core basis, which looks like the orders actually reaccelerated, but I understand the coronavirus on sales. I just don't know about the impact orders or some hesitancy on orders also. Then my second question is, when we think about you expanding your sales force, you mentioned kind of across all the front lines in all regions. Is it also going into more different types of work like more higher volume or still very focused on the R&D side of things or how should we kind of think about you guys really putting up a lot of more resources behind the sales force expansion? Thank you.\nRon Nersesian: Thanks, Jim. I'll start off first with the coronavirus. First of all, we didn't see any impact on Q1 orders. As you know, our Q1 ends at the end of January and right near the end of January a matter of fact I was in China I think it was the third week of January. People were at that point starting to head out for Chinese New Year. So, people had planned ahead, so that's great. Going forward in Q2, we're assuming, it will hit us with about 2% or 3%, but we're very happy with our backlog situation and accordingly we've guided the revenue as we did.\nMark Wallace: And Jim, this is Mark. I will make a few more comments. I don't want to steal all the thunder from next week, but there's basically three areas that we're concentrating and deploying more selling capacity. One is, we've talked a lot about acquiring new customers and increasing our reach into the geographies to diversify and broaden our business. So, we're continuing on that. We are also deploying e-commerce as part of that as well from an efficiency standpoint. Our focus on solutions remains one of our top priorities and that includes how we sell and the value we contribute to our customers. And the third area of concentrated focus is around services and selling our software portfolio. A year-and-a-half ago, we launched a services sales channel and we continue to expand that including a focus on the renewal part of our business, which is helping to feed and grow our recurring revenue. So, again, more coming next week. I appreciate the interest.\nJim Suva: Thank you so much. It's greatly appreciated. We'll see you next week.\nRon Nersesian: Thanks, Jim.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Brian Yun with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrian Yun: Hi, guys. Nice to see all-time high kind of gross margins. I had a few questions on your...\nRon Nersesian: Thanks.\nBrian Yun: ...software opportunity. First, are you able to share what software is as a percent of revenues this quarter? And then, just broadly, if you can talk about how software is being purchased today, what percent of sales or licenses versus subscription and if you see that changing over the next few years? And then, finally, I think the 5G test measurement software use case is very clear, but maybe if you can expand on the automotive software opportunity.\nRon Nersesian: Yes. Let me just make a couple of comments with regards to software. Orders grew double-digits. Revenue grew single digits, but the growth was driven a lot by our network emulation solutions and our network assurance business. The great thing is and why we see the order growth higher than the revenue growth, we continue to shift our portfolio from more and more subscription services over time so we could see more recurring revenue. And we're working on increasing our ARR, and that's not an instantaneous change, but we're very pleased with the direction that we're taking.\nNeil Dougherty: And then, I will just add that, the \u2013 what we're providing to our customers are complete solutions, and that's the combination of hardware and software and the services. So, all of this is coming together around the solutions play, whether it's around our 5G or a network application security solutions, or as you mentioned the automotive solutions, that is a large and growing part of our portfolio. And I think the difference that's occurring now is accelerating is the way customers consume those applications in terms of a more of a subscription based model. So, over time, we're supporting them with updates through a renewal process or through services, which support the application that's being deployed whether it's automotive or 5G.\nBrian Yun: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes that question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back to Jason Kary for any closing comments.\nJason Kary: Okay. Thanks, Josh. I'll turn it over to Ron to close this up.\nRon Nersesian: Well, thank you everyone for attending. As you probably know, we're very pleased with the performance that we have. And we've seen in Q1 and we were very pleased with the long-term prospects of Keysight. And we look forward to seeing many of you next week for our annual or biannual Analyst Day. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Mark Wallace",
            "content": "Right. So, Brandon, we have seen gradually improving business conditions across Europe. And as Ron said, revenue up 4%, 5% on orders, and we're seeing some of that come from the commercial comps side of our business. Automotive, especially advanced automotive solutions and next-generation auto and semiconductor continue to show signs of recovery. Aerospace Defense is mixed, the situation in Russia remains slow and there are some delays to some of those orders.

            "name": "Satish Dhanasekaran",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks Ron. I'll just say that the improved performance is a function of a few factors. First, it's improving market dynamics associated with the broader adoption of 400-gig Ethernet, technologies from data centers, and then solid execution both on the business and the sales side through the changes that we have just instituted.  The differentiated products and solutions that are coming out are gaining good traction with customers. On the visibility side, as Ron mentioned with network packet brokers and taps and on the test side with our [Layer 2/3 business], which is a big part of that portfolio which had a record quarter through the broad adoption of the 400-gig technologies. Looking ahead, we're really focused on accelerating synergies inside the group. As we've talked about, 5G is a big trend that impacts both wireless and wire line technologies and that convergence is really a sweet spot that we're targeting. We have started some new solution offerings in the space, for example, with the combination of RAM and co-testing, we are very uniquely positioned there. And second, we've recently launched the security testbed for 5G that does reference to Ron's transcript, which is really a combination of Ixia security toolkit and applied to the 5G technologies, which is gaining a lot of interest from customers. So, in summary, improving market dynamics, solid execution combined with this synergy utilization should position us well in this business. Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Ron. Very pleased with the results on 5G. I would say a new record as we indicated and growth across all regions and representing customers across this diverse set of ecosystems. The collaborations that we have sustained through years of work with them continue to be very strong and a foundation for the business, but we're also adding new customers as 5G scale. So this quarter, we added 40-plus new customers into our 5G platform, which has been a source of strength. One particular driver that I like to maybe point out that is \u2013 that'll play out to this year and the remaining part of this year is the adoption of number of devices that are being announced for 5G. Over 200 devices have been announced to-date. That is up 100% since August of 2019 when we last spoke about this. So that is a big driver for the ecosystem and that will continue to place as well. And finally, from an application point of view, we continue to be strong in R&D where our differentiation is increasing through the test coverage and the new features we're landing, but we're also starting to pick up wins in manufacturing as we have stated we're following our customers' lifecycle. And we've had some pretty decent wins in manufacturing for components in base stations this quarter as well. Yes. No \u2013 this is Satish here, and I'll just maybe offer a follow-through. Yes, I think the ability to serve the entire ecosystem is a huge differentiator for us. It separates us from any product-oriented competition that may come up with products. I'd give you an example. In many cases, we're working with operators. We just announced recently that we released 600 test scripts for the four U.S. operator test plans for 5G.  So, someone that wants to service these operators in that ecosystem now have a fastest way of ramping up and getting their time-to-market. So, that's an example of sort of the advantage you get when you are working with somebody that has the end-to-end portfolio. Our ability to reconfigure and create solutions with the broad capabilities we have is another advantage. I'll just give you an example again with the five-year security testbed. A number of our Aerospace and Defense customers wanted to prototype this threat environment in the lab. We were the ones that were able to provide them the solutions. So, hopefully, those help. Yes, hi. This is Satish. I will take it. On the Aerospace and Defense front, record orders this quarter, building on the $1 billion record finish we had last year. So, very pleased with the results so far. The budget stability in the U.S. is a big contribution factor. There is a lot of program wins that are being awarded by DoD, that's flowing through to the prime contractors in the supply chain. Our differentiated capability combined with decades of providing solutions to the space position us well. In particular, our Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations Solutions, Space and Satellite solutions are receiving good growth for us in that region. We also see a broader \u2013 internationally, a broader wave of defense modernization where people are re-tooling and upgrading their capabilities, and that position us well for the long run."

            "name": "Ron Nersesian",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. Keysight delivered another outstanding quarter. Our consistent performance illustrates the strength of our differentiated solutions, the diversity of our end markets, as well as the robustness of our business model. I will now focus my formal comments on three key headlines for the quarter. First, Keysight delivered a strong start to the year demonstrating sustained profitable growth across multiple dimensions of our business, both revenue and earnings exceeded the high end of our guidance and we achieved record first quarter orders, revenue and earnings, including an all-time record of gross margin of 65%. Second, our ongoing strength in 5G-related investments and Keysight's leading solutions across the ecosystem resulted in record 5G orders and continued growth in Commercial Communications. In addition, secular growth trends are fueling broad-based momentum across our target markets. And third, we are monitoring the coronavirus situation and want to acknowledge those who have been affected. While we do see some potential for near-term impact, we remain confident in the strength of our broad portfolio of industry-focused solutions, software and services. Now, let's take a deeper look into our first quarter. We achieved $1.26 in earnings per share, which was $0.16 above the high end of our guidance and represents 36% year-over-year earnings growth. We achieved record first quarter orders that grew 12% year-over-year, reflecting the resilience of our business and extensive market reach. Revenue grew 9% year-over-year to reach a new first quarter record. First quarter revenue performance was driven by strength in Commercial Communications, Aerospace, Defense and Government, and Semiconductor Measurement Solutions. In commercial communications, record first quarter revenue was driven by continued investments in 5G, fueled by the transformation of communications systems, including wireless access, infrastructure, wireline technologies, data center and the cloud. Our success is being driven by close collaboration with key market players to innovate and create many industry firsts. For example, we recently introduced the Value Series Channel Emulation Solution called PROPSIM FS16. This solution was enabled by the Anite acquisition and is the latest in a long line of our innovative first-to-market solutions to accelerate 5G development and commercialization. We're also excited to announce today another industry-first solution that enables customers to model 5G security threats in the lab. 5G technology innovation is enabling a massive proliferation of connected devices resulted in greater security, vulnerabilities, and an expanded attack surface. Keysight's 5G security testbed was made possible by the cybersecurity expertise and technology gained through the Ixia acquisition. Recall, that as of the first quarter, we integrated the Ixia Solutions Group, ISG, into our Communication Solutions Group to accelerate solution synergies and the teams are already getting very good traction. For the second consecutive quarter, orders for Ixia Solutions grew double-digits as we saw continued strength in network visibility and 400-gigabit Ethernet investment in Layer 2/3 protocol solutions. Ixia and our other commercial communications acquisitions such as Anite, AT4 and PRISMA enable us to provide our customers with a broad and differentiated set of solutions that span the stack layers as 5G evolves over the years to come. We are pleased with the broad global adoption of our 5G platform as our R&D solutions continue to lead the industry.  For example, we recently announced that Keysight's 5G conformance test solutions have been selected by the Korea testing laboratory for global 5G device certification. We are also seeing success beyond R&D with key wins this quarter in component manufacturing for base stations and devices as 5G production begins to ramp globally. Moving on to other growth factors, our strong performance beyond commercial communications reinforces our broad momentum across Keysight's diverse end markets. In Aerospace Defense and Government, our revenue grew double digits to achieve a first quarter record with broad base strength across all regions. This was the third consecutive quarter of strong year-over-year order growth in Aerospace Defense. Our solutions for electromagnetic spectrum operations, radar, space and satellite continue to benefit from a favorable U.S. spending environment and ongoing investments in technology modernization. In automotive and energy, revenue grew high single digits with increasing customer demand for key strategic applications. Our success in automotive is being driven by our first-to-market solutions and focus on next-generation technologies. For example, this quarter we achieved 3GPP validation of the industry's first C-V2X or cellular vehicle-to-everything radio frequency conformance test case. As a result, Keysight is enabling the automotive industry to accelerate commercialization of connected cars and autonomous vehicles. We also announced a collaboration with a leading provider of battery cells on cell formation. This collaboration supports the electrification of vehicles by enabling the development and manufacture of advanced battery cells. In Semiconductor Measurement Solutions, we achieved strong order and revenue growth driven by our customer strategic investments in next-generation process readiness. Our software and services continue to play an increasingly important role in Keysight's differentiated portfolio of customer-centric solutions. Software orders once again grew above our overall growth rate. Notably, this quarter, Keysight was named the organizational winner of the 2020 Business Intelligence Group Award for our PathWave Test 2020 software released just last October. PathWave Test 2020 was selected from a range of recent innovations submitted by organizations around the globe. I'm also happy to report that services orders and revenue grew double-digits in the quarter. We continue to see good adoption of our new support offerings such as Keysight Care, which was also a contributor to our year-over-year gross margin expansion. In summary, we delivered another outstanding quarter and a strong start to the year. Differentiated solutions across diverse end markets, consistent execution, and strong financial performance continue to drive our value creation. We have an exciting lineup for you at our Investor Day next week on March 3 and we look forward to sharing an update on our strategy and our long-term expectations to the business. Now, I will turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail. Yes. Hi, John. This is Ron. I'm going to give you a little bit of a long answer on this because I figure there's a lot of interest in the effects of the coronavirus. First of all, it's a very unfortunate situation affecting not only China, but we're seeing it obviously in South Korea, Italy, and other countries, including customers around the world. The situation is changing, so here is an up-to-the-minute update, as far as what we know at this point. The first thing I'd like to say is that we have a lot of sales in China, but we do not do much manufacturing at all. Over 99% of our products are not manufactured in China. We do receive about 10% of our parts or a little bit less than 10% of our parts from China, but all of this is built into what our guide is. So, let's talk about our employees. We have 991 people in China and another about 233 non-Keysight workers that help us in sales, support, and research and development. Of those 1,224 workers, luckily none have reported coronavirus cases at all. The other thing that's worthwhile to note is, if you look at Hubei province in Wuhan, they're not a big employment center for us. We have folks in Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu in Szechwan Province and Shenzhen primarily, as well as some salespeople that are scattered throughout the rest of China. One third of those people are back at work already as we've opened up offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, and Shenzhen and the rest, the other 770 folks are working remotely through video conferences, remote support with remote control of instruments and giving daily reports to the sales management. So, we get a daily report on the health status of every one, the sales funnel and how everybody is doing in order to make sure we're taking care of our customers, as well as our employees. We're working through that same process in other parts of the field or in other regions, but clearly the impact in other regions is smaller and not as big of a center for us. So, let's talk about the business implications as we know it. Last quarter, we guided [$1.055 billion] in revenue and we delivered [$1.141 billion] in orders or we delivered $86 million in orders above what we said assuming a book to bill of 1%. Of that $86 million in orders, we shipped $40 million of it. So we actually delivered revenue of $1.095 billion, not $1.055 billion, but the additional $46 million we have in backlog that can help smooth out any timing delays that we would see from the coronavirus. We have guided $1.158 billion, plus or minus $20 million, and we've built in approximately $20 million worth of impact into our guide. The key point though that you should remember is that we have a good backlog situation. We have very differentiated products, and we're very confident at this point that we'll be able to make up any delays that we see in the second half of the year, therefore not affecting Keysight's performance in fiscal year 2020. I hope that helps, John. There's two main parts of the Ixia \u2013 what was the Ixia business, which is now our network assurance solutions, one of them is network test and then the other section is network visibility. Network visibility is a consistent grower. It was smaller, but it continues to get larger and larger, and we're very happy with that. And there we see a little bit more of a linear growth. The network test business isn't as linear; it depends on basically the build-outs that happen in our end customers. I'll turn it over to Satish to maybe add a couple of more comments, but that's the high level summary. The other thing I would like to say is that obviously with the second quarter of double-digit growth, we're very happy with the way this business is progressing. At first, we had to do a lot more integration work than we thought. We had to move the supply chain to ours to get basically the improvements and the synergies that we expected on the cost side and we had to enhance the quality. So that took a little bit more time than we had expected originally. However, the business and the business dynamics and where it's going in the synergies that we have really makes us excited about this business' contribution to Keysight in the long-term and our ability to provide complete workflow solutions from one end to the other. Hi, Brandon. Sure. I'm going to turn it over to Mark. Our order growth was higher than the 2% than we reported, and revenue was roughly 5% growth. So, that's a little bit of a different picture, but Mark, the Head of Sales, will take you further. Hi, John. Yes. Satish will take you through that, but I'm really pleased with the breadth of our overall customer base as it starts to go from Tier 1 to other players. And he'll talk about that. There is plenty of manufacturing opportunities for us in 5G. There is no doubt that our R&D presence has grown and has grown dramatically, and that really plays well to our business model, but there are a high value-add opportunities for us in manufacturing. Whether you see that with components or subassemblies, or you look at it down even on the wired part of 5G, you can't just put in wireless 5G and not be able to handle the data on the wired side. So when you look at everything from fiber optic tools and going all the way through the network, there is more and more opportunities for us especially you'll see that on the physical layer, on the physical layer back in the network. On top of that, as everything moves to millimeter-wave, it gets more complex, more difficult to do, and that's where we've been playing for many, many decades and it's relatively new to most of our competitors. So that provides us an opportunity not only to focus on areas where the cost of failure is high, but really we focus on where we can add value-add in total and generate great margins for us. Thanks, John. Yes. I'll start and I'm going to let Neil go ahead and quantify the Huawei situation, but I'll just say this, the Huawei customers really like our products and solutions and they come to us and there's a good demand for those products. As we look further in the year, we have a modest amount in our forecast, but for the long-term they're looking to lead in many markets and we have the differentiated tools to help them out. Thank you. Thank you. Yes. I don't think you see any \u2013 we don't expect to have any significant changes to our capital allocation priorities. We're looking to strike balance with what we'll do, we continue to invest, to drive organic growth in the investments we're making in R&D close to $700 million per year, the investments Mark just talked about in terms of doubling our sales force.  You mentioned M&A, we have an active funnel development process, but we'll remain patient and disciplined when it comes to that, but we are out there actively looking for opportunities to add value \u2013 add value through acquisitions. And then we're returning capital as well, right? We have, I think, $335 million remaining on the authorization that we have outstanding, which is $75 million worth of stock this last quarter. And so, I think you'll see us continue to strike that balance and will trade off amongst those categories as appropriate over time. Thanks, Jim. I'll start off first with the coronavirus. First of all, we didn't see any impact on Q1 orders. As you know, our Q1 ends at the end of January and right near the end of January a matter of fact I was in China I think it was the third week of January. People were at that point starting to head out for Chinese New Year. So, people had planned ahead, so that's great. Going forward in Q2, we're assuming, it will hit us with about 2% or 3%, but we're very happy with our backlog situation and accordingly we've guided the revenue as we did. Thanks, Jim. Thanks. Yes. Let me just make a couple of comments with regards to software. Orders grew double-digits. Revenue grew single digits, but the growth was driven a lot by our network emulation solutions and our network assurance business. The great thing is and why we see the order growth higher than the revenue growth, we continue to shift our portfolio from more and more subscription services over time so we could see more recurring revenue. And we're working on increasing our ARR, and that's not an instantaneous change, but we're very pleased with the direction that we're taking. Well, thank you everyone for attending. As you probably know, we're very pleased with the performance that we have. And we've seen in Q1 and we were very pleased with the long-term prospects of Keysight. And we look forward to seeing many of you next week for our annual or biannual Analyst Day. Thank you."

            "name": "Neil Dougherty",
            "content": "Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. Before I get started, I will note that all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless specifically noted otherwise. We delivered another strong quarter as we continue to capitalize on the broad-based momentum across Keysight's diverse end markets. For the first quarter of 2020, we delivered non-GAAP revenue of $1.095 billion, which was well above the high end of our guidance range and grew 8% on a core basis. Better than expected revenue results were driven by broad strength across multiple end markets. Orders outpaced revenue for the sixth consecutive quarter as Q1 orders of $1.141 billion grew 12% in total and 11% on a core basis. Looking at our operational results for Q1, we reported record gross margin of 65% and our operating expenses of $433 million, resulting in our fourth consecutive quarter with operating margin at or above 25%. We also achieved net income of $240 million and delivered $1.26 in earnings per share, which was well above the high end of our guidance. Now, moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated total revenue of $818 million, up 9% while delivering record gross margin of 66% and operating margin of 25%. In Q1, Commercial Communications delivered double-digit order growth and revenue of $573 million, driven by strength in 5G solutions.  As Ron mentioned earlier, starting in the first quarter, we have aligned the former Ixia Solutions Group or ISG with our commercial communications end market and are now reporting Ixia results within our Communications Solutions Group. Aerospace Defense and Government generated revenue of $245 million, an increase of 10% and a first quarter record driven by a broad-based growth across all regions as investment in advanced technology continued. Order growth for this end market was high-single digits and we have a strong funnel going into Q2. EISG generated first quarter revenue of $277 million, up 8% driven by strength in semiconductor measurement and next-gen automotive solutions. EISG reported gross margin of 61% and operating margin of 26%. Moving onto the balance sheet and cash flow, we enter our first quarter with $1.69 billion in cash and cash equivalents and reported cash flow from operations of $197 million and free cash flow of $165 million or 15% of revenue. Under our share repurchase authorization, during the quarter, we acquired approximately 730,000 shares on the open market at an average price of $102.48 for a total consideration of $75 million. Now, turning to our outlook and guidance. We expect second quarter 2020 revenue to be in the range of $1.138 billion to $1.178 billion. For the first half of 2020, the midpoint of our guidance reflects 7% revenue growth or 6% core growth. This guidance incorporates our current assessment of the coronavirus impact. Given the dynamics of the situation, we expect any impact from coronavirus to simply be a push-out in demand and do not anticipate any impact on our full-year results at this time. We expect Q2 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.28 to $1.38 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 191 million shares. The midpoint of this guidance reflects approximately 20% earnings growth for the first half of 2020. As Ron mentioned, we look forward to sharing our strategy to drive profitable growth, as well as our latest long-term expectations for the business at our upcoming Investor Day on March 3. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A. I think that's right. I think the same is largely to a broader coronavirus, as I said in my comments, we believe that any disruption that we may see in the short-term that results from coronavirus would simply be a push-out in demand. We don't believe it has an ultimate impact on the absolute level of demand in this fiscal year. I think if you look at Huawei more specifically, we saw broad strength within the quarter. We are limited in terms of what we can sell to Huawei, we're complying with the Department of Commerce regulations, but even with that limited portfolio, our sales to Huawei in the first quarter were a bit ahead of where we expected them to be. I think as we look forward, however we're pretty comfortable with the estimate that we provided of thinking of Huawei as a 1% to 2% customer as we move forward from here. We don't look at Europe or many other regions on a sequential basis because there is such seasonality built into our customer base, as well as into even our sales force and the commissions and how that works out. So, we look at it on a year-over-year compare and that's why we've taken it modestly to 5% order growth and 2% revenue growth for the quarter. Yes, it's still very early days for millimeter wave deployments at scale. I would say that, you know a large part of the deployment so far subscale 6-gigahertz and still even there, there's a lot of challenges that our customers face, which is why our tools continue to be embraced and are helping with scaling up the ecosystem. The other factor I would mention here is this sort of heterogeneous spectrum environment both with new frequency bands and the higher frequency bands getting integrated is creating sort of this cycle of demand for our tools in this marketplace. So, very early days overall with millimeter-wave, and but there is no doubt that millimeter-wave will be realized just because of all the spectrum that's being put in place and the high innovation that currently the ecosystem is undergoing. Eventually there will be millimeter-wave based offerings with [time]. And then, I will just add that, the \u2013 what we're providing to our customers are complete solutions, and that's the combination of hardware and software and the services. So, all of this is coming together around the solutions play, whether it's around our 5G or a network application security solutions, or as you mentioned the automotive solutions, that is a large and growing part of our portfolio. And I think the difference that's occurring now is accelerating is the way customers consume those applications in terms of a more of a subscription based model. So, over time, we're supporting them with updates through a renewal process or through services, which support the application that's being deployed whether it's automotive or 5G."

And now, I will turn the call over to Ron.\nRon Nersesian: Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. Keysight delivered a record quarter and fiscal year. Strong demand for our portfolio of differentiated solutions is fueling continued momentum across all of our end markets. Today, I\u2019ll focus my comments on four key headlines: First, demand for Keysight\u2019s differentiated solutions continues to be very strong with orders exceeding our expectations. Outstanding order growth of 21% in the fourth quarter topped off an excellent fiscal year where we grew 18%. Demand continues to be balanced across our business with double-digit gains across all end markets and regions, both in the fourth quarter and for the full fiscal year. Second, we delivered outstanding Q4 results despite a tightening supply environment. Exceptional execution by Keysight employees around the world resulted in record revenue, gross margin, operating margin and earnings per share for the fourth quarter and for the fiscal year 2021. Third, we entered 2022 with strong momentum, robust end market demand and record backlog. Assuming a loosening of the supply situation in the second half of the calendar year, we expect fiscal year 2022 revenue growth of 6% to 7%, while delivering 10% earnings growth. Beyond 2022, we are increasingly confident in our ability to deliver sustained above-market results. We have established a strong track record of execution, and our competitive position earned over the past seven years of investment in transformation has only grown stronger. Lastly, given the strength of our cash position and generation, we continue to see tremendous opportunities for value-creation through disciplined investment in organic capabilities, targeted acquisitions and accordingly, today, we announced a new share repurchase authorization of $1.2 billion. Now, let\u2019s take a deeper look at the strength of our fourth quarter and the fiscal year 2021 financial performance. In the fourth quarter, we saw continued momentum in the demand environment. Orders exceeded our expectations and grew 21% year-over-year. Revenue grew 6% with growth across all regions. Operational excellence resulted in record profitability as we delivered gross margin of 66%, operating margin of 31% and earnings of $1.82 per share. Fourth quarter results drove a very strong finish to an excellent year. In 2021, we overcame 5 percentage points of China trade headwinds and delivered 18% order growth to outpace the overall market, which continues to be strong. Despite a tightening supply environment, we ended the year with 17% revenue growth and achieved record profitability with gross margin of 65%, operating margin of 28% and earnings of $6.23 per share. Compared to pre-pandemic fiscal year 2019, orders and revenue have grown 21% and 15% respectively over this two-year period, highlighting the continued strong demand for our market-leading solutions. Broad-based growth across multiple dimensions of the business demonstrates the breadth of our customer base. We added more than 2,000 customers in 2021 and more than 1,900 in 2020 as we continue to expand our footprint, adding to the stability and durability of our business model. Despite the headwinds we faced in 2021, we delivered annual double-digit order and revenue growth in both business segments. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group achieved its fifth consecutive quarter of record revenue, driven by double-digit growth in semiconductor solutions and in automotive. Another quarter of record semiconductor revenue was fueled by ongoing investments in advanced technology nodes and capacity expansion to address pent-up demand. In automotive, we achieved record orders for the third consecutive quarter of double-digit order and revenue growth. Investment remains strong in EV and AV technologies. This quarter, we announced the collaboration with NIO, one of China\u2019s top EV automakers who selected Keysight\u2019s 5G and C-V2X network emulation solutions. Strong demand for general electronics solutions was driven by continued investments in digital transformation, industrial IoT, digital health, Industrial 4.0 and advanced academic research. The Communications Solutions Group delivered double-digit order growth and record revenue in the fourth quarter. For the year, orders and revenue grew double digits despite the impact of China trade restrictions. Commercial Communications achieved all-time record orders and revenue in the fourth quarter. Q4 was another record quarter for 5G driven by the strength of our platform, continued O-RAN adoption and new industry applications. In addition, we saw ongoing investments in 400G and 800G R&D across the entire communications ecosystem. Increased spending in data centers and network security drove double-digit order growth in network test and visibility. In aerospace, defense and government, double-digit order growth was driven by ongoing investments in technology with the focus on space and new commercial technologies like 5G. We recently announced a collaboration with Lockheed Martin to advance 5G in support of mission-critical communications for aerospace and defense applications. Keysight\u2019s first-to-market solutions are enabling the rapid progression of new technologies and winning engagement with industrial leaders like NXP, NEC and MediaTek. In Q4, we joined Google\u2019s cloud partner initiative to support agile orchestration of innovative 5G services at the network edge. Our end-to-end solutions portfolio continues to capture new opportunities as the 5G life cycle progresses and expands into aerospace, defense and government, automotive and industrial applications. We continue to accelerate Keysight\u2019s capabilities to provide industry-leading solutions through strategic acquisitions and recently added SCALABLE Network Technologies to our software-centric solutions portfolio. SCALABLE is a provider of best-in-class network simulation solutions to model and visualize communication networks and cyber threats for aerospace, defense and government customers. We\u2019re excited to welcome the SCALABLE team to Keysight. Our software-centric solutions and higher value services continue to drive differentiation, strengthen our competitive position and capture a higher percentage of our customers\u2019 wallet share. In fiscal year 2021, software and services not only delivered double-digit order and revenue growth, but also outpaced Keysight\u2019s overall growth. Combined, they represented just over one-third of Keysight\u2019s total revenue for the year. We also continue to grow annualized recurring revenue, which now exceeds $1 billion. The growth in software and services as well as the recurring revenue further strengthens the durability and resiliency of our business model, while at the same time contributing to Keysight\u2019s margin expansion. Keysight\u2019s focus on first-to-market software-centric solutions and operational excellence drive our consistent execution. We have a strong track record of performance and proven business resiliency. Since our inception as a public company seven years ago, we have achieved a 10% compound annual revenue growth rate, expanded gross margin by over 800 basis points, increased operating margin by nearly 1,000 basis points and generated 16% annualized EPS growth, all while significantly increasing investment in R&D and sales to drive future growth. Over the same period, we have nearly tripled the size of our software revenue and more than doubled recurring revenue while growing services 75%. These accomplishments are a testament to Keysight\u2019s leadership model, our values and our people. I would like to thank all Keysight employees for their exceptional execution and dedication. We continue to capitalize on these multiple ways of technology innovation and long-term secular growth trends across multiple markets. We exit this year in a strong competitive position and expect to continue to deliver sustained above-market profitable growth. Now, I will turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail. Happy Thanksgiving.\nNeil Dougherty: Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. As Ron mentioned, we delivered an outstanding quarter and fiscal year. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we delivered record revenue of $1,294 million, which was above the high end of our guidance range and grew 6% or 5% on a core basis despite a tightening supply environment. The further contraction of the supply chain within the quarter tempered total revenue results and was more impactful on the Communications Solutions Group businesses. With demand outpacing supply, we delivered a record $1,491 million in orders, up 21% on a reported and core basis and enter fiscal year 2022 with over $2 billion in backlog, which will position us well as the supply chain situation improves. Looking at our operational results for Q4, we reported record gross margin of 66% and operating expenses of $456 million, resulting in an operating margin of 31%, an all-time high. Net income was a record $338 million, and we achieved $1.82 in earnings per share, which was well above the high end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 186 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated record revenue of $919 million, up 2%. CSG delivered gross margin of 66% and operating margin of 28%. In Q4, commercial communications generated revenue of $622 million, up 3% driven by strength across the 5G ecosystem, O-RAN adoption and investment in 400-gigabit and 800-gigabit R&D. Aerospace, defense and government achieved record revenue of $297 million, up slightly from the same quarter last year as solid growth in Asia Pacific was offset by supply chain constraints that impacted revenue in the U.S. and Europe. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated fourth quarter revenue of $375 million, up 18% on a reported and core basis, driven by strength in semiconductor and automotive. EISG reported record gross margin of 66% and record operating margin of 36%. Given tightening supply chain constraints and trade headwinds, we are very pleased with our full year results. In FY21, revenue totaled $4.9 billion, up 17% year-over-year or 15% on a core basis. Gross margin improved 40 basis points year-over-year to 65%. We continue to invest in R&D at 16% of revenue or $788 million for the year, while operating margin improved 260 basis points to 28%. On the strength of this performance, we have achieved our long-term operating margin target of 26% to 27%, two years ahead of plan. FY21 non-GAAP net income was $1.2 billion or $6.23 per share, up 28%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our fourth quarter with $2.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generated cash flow from operations of $368 million and free cash flow of $295 million. Total free cash flow for the year was $1.1 billion, representing 23% of revenue and 99% of non-GAAP net income. As announced earlier today, the Keysight Board of Directors has approved a new share repurchase authorization of $1.2 billion, effective immediately. Under our prior share repurchase authorization, we acquired approximately 2.1 million shares in the quarter at an average share price of $171 for a total consideration of $353 million. This brings our total share repurchase for the year to approximately 4.4 million shares at an average share price of $154 for a total consideration of $673 million or 59% of free cash flow. Now, turning to our outlook and guidance. Despite a strong demand backdrop, supply chain constraints continue to moderate shipment expectations. As a result, we expect first quarter 2022 revenue to be in the range of $1.225 billion to $1.245 billion and Q1 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.50 to $1.56 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 185 million shares. Looking forward to 2022, we expect supply chain to remain tight in the first half of the year. Assuming a loosening of the supply situation in the second half, we expect full year revenue growth to be in the range of 6% to 7%, while delivering 10% earnings growth. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $78 million and capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $240 million to $260 million with increasing capacity and technology investments. Regarding our tax rate, we are modeling a 12% non-GAAP effective tax rate for FY22, which assumes no change to current U.S. tax policy. In closing, we are entering the fiscal year with strong momentum, a record backlog position and a strong track record of operational excellence. We\u2019re encouraged by the strong dynamics across our end markets and are competitively positioned to drive sustainable and profitable growth going forward. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.\nJason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Katherine, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan.\nJoe Cardoso: Hi. This is Joe Cardoso on for Samik. My first question is just around the full year guide. So, you\u2019re guiding the full year to 6% to 7% growth, and I\u2019m just trying to flip that with your commentary last quarter around -- expectations around a more muted seasonality. First of all, does that expectation still stand true? And if so, does that imply that we should expect to see a similar cadence to revenue as we did in fiscal \u201821, or is there something I\u2019m not appreciating here as I think about revenue trends for the full year, such as maybe the benefits of the loosening of the supply chain as we head into the back half of the year?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. Hi, Samik. It\u2019s a great question. So, yes, as we mentioned on the call, we did see the supply chain situation tightened during the quarter, and our guidance does assume that we will see some relaxation in that environment in the back half of the year. So, if I was thinking about the seasonality for FY22, I\u2019d say two things. I think, first of all, I think we\u2019d expect revenue to build as we move throughout the year. And then, maybe if you think about it in terms of year-over-year growth, right, our guidance of 6% to 7% for the full year. I was thinking about that on a quarter-by-quarter basis, I\u2019d be expecting growth rates in the first half of the year that are below that 6% to 7% level and growth rates in the back half of the year that are slightly above that 6% to 7% level, so that we average that for the full year.\nJoe Cardoso: Got it. I appreciate the color there. And then, just on my second question, EISG posted record operating margin this quarter. They were really strong. Just curious to hear what were some of the big drivers or contributors to the margin there relative to operating margins? And just curious to hear if there was any onetime benefits in the quarter that we should consider?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. No onetime benefits, but I mean I think the thing that comes immediately to the forefront is obviously the extraordinarily strong revenue growth for the year with 30% revenue growth on the year. The business -- the demand for those products has been very strong. We\u2019ve seen a very nice rebound this year in the automotive business, the semi business, we all have -- everybody has seen the press on the continued strength in semi. So, you take that strong demand picture and -- which essentially allowed them to leverage their OpEx infrastructure and drive really high levels of operating margin in the short run. I think as we look forward, we continue to see great opportunities to continue to grow the business as well as to invest in further technology investments to serve these end markets.\nOperator: The next question is from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.\nJohn Pitzer: Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the solid results. Neil, I wonder if you could just dig a little bit deeper into kind of some of the supply constraints that you\u2019re seeing out there. I think you said in your prepared comments, it\u2019s hitting you guys, EISG stronger than comms. I\u2019m kind of curious, is this logistical constraints? Is it component constraints? Is it a little bit of everything? And is there a dollar amount you can give us that impacted revenue, both in the fiscal fourth quarter and the fiscal first quarter?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. Thanks, John. It\u2019s a great question. So, first of all, I said the opposite. The impact was greater on CSG businesses than in EISG businesses. If you think about why that is, the CSG products tend to be more complex. They have a longer bill of materials. And so, there are more parts and components that go into building those instruments on average. And so that, just by its nature, increases the risk and the challenges that we have to fulfill that supply chain. I think, it\u2019s also true on average that the CSG products tend to be at the higher end of the technology spectrum. And so, there are fewer suppliers for those cutting-edge technology products than for a little bit more of the mainstream products that exist within EISG. I think, if you think about the impact of supply chain, I\u2019d maybe lump COVID and supply chain together because we\u2019ve really seen this phenomenon over the last couple of years. And if you\u2019re starting to think about how to quantify those impacts, I\u2019d really kind of focus your attention, not on any one quarter, but over time you\u2019re looking at the full fiscal years, as an example, at our order rates, right? If you look at our history prior to 2020, we have done a pretty good job of converting our orders to revenue. There\u2019s typically a little bit of a lag at certain percentage of each quarter\u2019s order ship within the quarter, another portion shift out into the following quarters. But over the past couple of years in 2020 because of COVID and in 2021 because of supply chain, we have seen that delta between orders and revenue grow. And so, I think we estimate that if you think about it in terms of kind of an abnormal backlog build, that abnormal backlog build over the last couple of years is in the $300 million to $400 million range. And so, I think that\u2019s the opportunity for us as we look forward to eventually clear that backlog, once the supply chain situation fixes itself. I don\u2019t expect that we\u2019ll flush that in a quarter or two. I think it will happen over time because the kind of the remedies of the supply chain are going to happen over time as well. But, that\u2019s the rough magnitude of what we\u2019ve -- what the impact has been here over a couple of year period of time.\nJohn Pitzer: That\u2019s really helpful color. And then, Ron, over the last several years, we, on this side of the world, have been trying to compare and contrast sort of the 5G rollout with the 4G rollout relative to your business. And I guess, what I was hoping to do is get a little bit more color about the software strategy you\u2019re deploying this time around, which seems like an incremental driver. I\u2019m just kind of curious, can you size the potential TAM opportunity that gives you, especially as the network more from just being a backbone for handsets and mobile to actually being a backbone for a lot of new incremental applications. And to the extent that software and services is a third of the business now, sort of how do we think about that over like the next three to five years?\nRon Nersesian: Thanks, John. It\u2019s very, very clear that software and services continues to be a bigger and bigger percentage of our total business as we move from a hardware product supplier to a software-centric solution provider and the solutions obviously include hardware, software and services. And we\u2019ve seen great growth obviously in our software and our services, and they\u2019ve outpaced the hardware growth. Looking overall at 5G versus 4G, we made a decision in 2013, we announced at Agilent, we\u2019re going to spin off Keysight in 2013, which we eventually did in November of 2014. But in 2013, I started working with the team that was developing to invest in 5G and make sure that we were going to be leaders. In 4G, we were providing a little bit more of, let\u2019s say, cash contribution to Agilent where we were not investing as heavily in the communications rollout of 4G by a substantial amount. So, we invested earlier. We invested a greater amount as now we\u2019re roughly at 16% R&D where we used to be at approximately 12% of R&D. And we\u2019ve gone from roughly $400 million to roughly $800 million in R&D spend over this period of time, but software is a key part. What we did was we consolidated our hardware development facilities into one organization as opposed to in separate divisions. And accordingly, that enabled us to basically provide software that could span the whole product offering. And we made an acquisition for instance of a company called Anite, which gave us software capability. They had some capability in 4G. We moved them over to 5G. And all this together, investing more, starting earlier, having a consistent R&D and investment profile has really gave us the lead and caused us to be a much, much stronger provider, and I believe the leading provider for 5G. 5G is still growing, and we anticipate it growing for years. I\u2019m going to turn it over to Satish, who could tell you a little bit more about our results and our growth in, not only 2021, but what he sees going forward.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Ron. Great question. I think at the summary, we\u2019ve had another record quarter for 5G and the drivers are scaling deployments, but equally important is the new application space. And I think we outplayed that as a strategy. We had to continue the progression from physical to protocol to application, and this application area is very rich, right? As I look forward, some of these application spaces have software as a percentage of the total value proposition in the 30%, 40%, 50% range and one we pursue very actively. I\u2019ll just make a few examples of these, right? So, you can think of on the 5G side, O-RAN being a great example of that. On the wireline side, the protocols with 400-gig, 800-gig getting more complex. You look at new emerging spaces like SD-WAN, SASE and MACsec and the security domain. So, you look at the commercial comms portfolio, it\u2019s very rich in applications that really favor our strategy of being more software-centric and one we\u2019re investing to pursue, and we\u2019re generating strong results.\nJason Kary: We are ready for the next question from Jim Suva of Citibank.\nJim Suva: I had a thought about your vertical integration. You\u2019re a lot more vertically integrated than the other companies. Has that materially benefited you during the supply chain bottlenecks, or are there like little things, whether it be plastics or connector or housing that held you back just as much as the other? And I\u2019m just trying to think about does this now cause you to even want to be a little bit more vertically integrated, or how core are you at the sweet spot of your vertical integration? Thank you.\nRon Nersesian: Sure, Jim. The first thing that\u2019s probably really important to note is that our differentiating technologies that have given us the leadership position outside of the software that we have developed is semiconductors that have very particular high-performance capabilities. And as you know, we have an on-site fab that exists in Santa Rosa, and that fab makes gallium arsenide and indium phosphide semiconductors. So, a lot of people are having trouble now getting more custom components built. And we build a lot of those custom components in-house. So, that has definitely helped us. Now, again, if you don\u2019t have all the parts, you can\u2019t ship anything. And we are in relatively good shape compared to other competitors, but there\u2019s no doubt that we have to make sure that we get all the components that are needed in order to ship the product. We always will look for opportunities to integrate, provided that it makes financial sense. We feel very good about what we have in-house right now. It\u2019s not so much the plastic pieces and things like that. There are obviously not only components, but there is the whole logistical shipping issues that the whole world is going through. So, we are impacted, a little bit less than others. And I think the overall organization has done a real good job of being able to deliver during these very challenging times.\nJim Suva: Great. Thank you. Congratulations to you and your team at Keysight.\nJason Kary: Great. And the next question goes to Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs.\nMark Delaney: Some of the defense primes have spoken to slowing Department of Defense budget outlays, and I appreciate that Keysight reported broad-based order strength. But, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more on what you\u2019re seeing in your AD&G segment? And if you are experiencing any slower end market trends, even if in certain portions of that business segment?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. So, again, a pretty strong quarter for aerospace defense orders growing double digits, finishing off a year with double-digit growth. If you look at what drove that growth, it\u2019s recovery in the macro environment globally, similar spend, especially towards technology that continues to increase, both in the U.S. and internationally and one we\u2019re capturing. We also took some concerted steps last year or two years ago, in fact, to take our 5G technology stack and customize it for aerospace, defense applications, and as you\u2019ve probably seen, our collaboration with Lockheed Martin that we announced. So we\u2019re very pleased with the progression that we\u2019re making with commercial technologies that are getting adopted. So, all of these are pretty favorable. We are observing that right now, the -- we are under continuing resolution from a budget perspective in the U.S. But, if you look at the budget that has been put in place and if -- or that has been proposed and if it\u2019s approved, it does call for a year-over-year increase and also increased spend in technology or our T&E line item, which we view as a favorable dynamic. Peripherally, the Infrastructure Bill that is getting through the Congress has some sustained spend outlays for EV and broadband and semiconductor, which we also think is favorable for us.\nMark Delaney: That\u2019s really helpful color. Thank you for all those comments. And my follow-up question was on the supply chain. And if you could talk in a bit more depth around what is leading to your comments of potential alleviation in the second half of this coming fiscal year? Thank you.\nRon Nersesian: Yes. I mean, the supply chain situation is very dynamic, I guess, I would start by saying that. And we are -- we have very close relationships with our key suppliers and are in constant dialogue with them during this period of time to make sure that we are procuring the parts that are necessary to meet the needs of our customers. I think it\u2019s -- our confidence and our guide reflects a -- the start of a recovery in the supply chain situation in the back half, and that stems from direct indications that we\u2019ve got from key suppliers within our supply chain environment.\nOperator: We\u2019ll move over to Tim Long from Barclays.\nTim Long: Thank you. Two, if I could. Maybe on the wireless side, could you talk a little bit about kind of the impact of C-band and current views on millimeter wave and particularly with the C-band, any impacts from these potential delays with the FAA, et cetera? And then secondly, maybe, Neil, could you just kind of update us -- it\u2019s obviously been a great period of margin expansion. Can you talk a little bit -- give us an updated view on kind of leverage and incremental margin growth and operating from these levels? Thank you.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: I\u2019ll make a few comments on 5G. As we stated before, the continuing deployments that are going on, especially in the low frequency bands across the world, we view it as a favorable dynamic, specifically the C-band auction was a near-term catalyst. And we\u2019ve had some strong results, as I mentioned, double -- strong double-digit growth in 5G this quarter, capping off a double-digit growth in 5G for the full fiscal year. And a big part of that was driven by the C-band auction and the related investments that are going on in the Americas. Our Americas business was -- grew the strongest in our 5G from a regional perspective, and we also saw our FR1, our low frequency business double year-over-year. So, very strong results, all the while when our millimeter wave business has been pretty stable this year. And as we have mentioned before, in the medium term, we\u2019re expecting that the millimeter wave adoption continues to rise in a very steady manner and we\u2019re watching for the Beijing Olympics use cases to emerge from the success of the Beijing Olympics that we expect to occur next year.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. And Tim, to your second question, yes, we\u2019ve obviously had a great run here in terms of margin expansion since the birth of Keysight, adding 800 basis points approximately to gross margins, about 1,000 basis points to operating margins. And I think the key point is that as we look forward over the longer term, we continue to see opportunities for further expansion of margins within the Keysight portfolio. I think as we look to next year, it\u2019s a really dynamic time, obviously, with supply chain pressures putting a little bit of a governor on revenue. At the same time, we\u2019ve got inflationary pressures across the broader economy. And then, the other thing that we\u2019re looking forward -- looking to, that\u2019s a little bit of a cost up within next year is hopefully a return to kind of a post-COVID or a pre-COVID normal in terms of our general operating environment, and that includes the costs associated with the facilities management as we return to the office, increase travel as people get back out and start seeing customers and conducting more business in person rather than over Zoom. I think -- and maybe the last point being that we saw -- we invested in R&D this year just under 16% of revenue. I think we continue to see great opportunities to invest in technology and bring new solutions into the marketplace. I think you\u2019re likely to see R&D tick upward next year into that kind of mid-16% range. So from those perspectives, I think FY22 may be a bit of a catch-up year. But over the longer term, a lot of opportunity as we expand our software portfolio, expand our solutions portfolio, continue to work with customers and provide them with first-to-market solutions to continue to drive both, gross and operating margins northward.\nJason Kary: And the next question comes from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. This is Nick on for Matthew. Congrats on the quarter. So just first, I wanted to talk about CapEx, the guide is picking up next year. I just want to know what\u2019s driving that uplift and whether that should carry on into future years, like is that sustainable, or is there a specific project that\u2019s going on, and I have a follow-up.\nRon Nersesian: So, we started to -- or we talked about in this recently completed fiscal year that we expected a couple of years of elevated CapEx as a result efforts to improve the resiliency of our supply chain. And that, in fact, did pan out with CapEx of approximately $175 million this year. I think, in addition to continuing those investments, we see incremental investments that are necessary as we continue to expand our own capacity and invest in key technologies to drive the future growth of our business. So, I think those are additive, given everything that\u2019s happening across the economic sphere today, there is, relative to what we were seeing this time last year, an increased need to spend money on capacity investments here within Keysight. And so, I do not believe that the approximately $250 million of CapEx that we\u2019ve communicated for next year is the new steady state, that is not the case. That steady state is significantly lower, exactly where -- a little bit difficult to call at this point, but materially lower than the $250 million that we\u2019re indicating for FY22.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. That makes sense. And then, just a quick follow-up on competitive environment. I mean, there are a few puts and takes that I\u2019m just thinking about and I was wondering you could provide some color. On the one hand, a lot of competitors are having a harder time sending up shipments, does that create a positive pricing environment? And then, a slightly different angle, one of your competitors recently made some easy acquisitions. Just how you think about EISG from the competitive landscape going forward?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Very strong performance in our EISG business. Again, strength, as I mentioned, in the semiconductor, where new wafer starts are really enabling us to continue to drive growth there. A very strong year again, building off of a strong double-digit year last year in semiconductor as well. So, when I think about what we\u2019re doing there, we\u2019re definitely taking share and we are continuing to invest to keep that portfolio growing and capitalizing on the environment we see semiconductor. With regard to automotive, it\u2019s been a newer market entry for us. Relatively speaking, we started this in spin. We\u2019re very pleased with the results we\u2019re seeing so far. And we\u2019ve made -- if you look at this fiscal year, we\u2019ve had some wins in the manufacturing expansions that have happened in the EV sector. And as we shore up our contributions in the AV market, we\u2019ve announced a partnership with NIO, as an example, of what we\u2019re doing by extending our 5G technology stack in C-V2X. In summary, all-in-all, you look at our entire portfolio for automotive, it is growing and it is much more comprehensive than any of our traditional competitors at this point, and we are continuing to invest in growing that business. So overall, pleased with where we find ourselves with the EISG business.\nRon Nersesian: And your second question, which was with competitors having a little tougher time on shipments, are we going ahead and taking advantage of that for pricing? The answer is no. We\u2019re in this for the long haul with customers. We\u2019ve been back from the original Hewlett-Packard days, over 80 years working with customers. We\u2019re not taking advantage of them. Where costs are up in certain areas for shipments and others, we will do price increases, but not because of any competitive position or hard ability for our customers to get products from competitors.\nJason Kary: Next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder of UBS.\nChris Snyder: So, the Company in the past has talked to industry growth in the 3% to 5% range with expectations for about 100 to 200 bps of outgrowth for Keysight above the industry. But, when we look at it over the last four years now, the Company has been growing about 10% organically per annum. So, I guess, my question is, is this level of growth more so driven by just much stronger industry growth over the last four years or just better Keysight outgrowth or a combination of both? Can you just kind of help us unpack how we kind of bridge that gap?\nRon Nersesian: I\u2019ll make a couple of comments and then turn it over. I think it\u2019s a combination of two. There\u2019s no doubt that we\u2019ve seen more growth and more opportunity in 5G. But, as we see the digitization of everything, the market is, there is no doubt, a great place to be. And we have a very-diversified portfolio, and we\u2019re seeing growth in semiconductor. We\u2019re seeing growth in Industrial 4.0. We\u2019re seeing growth all across our real stated growth initiatives and the markets that we\u2019ve gone after. So, there is no doubt we pick markets that are winning, and we have been growing faster than the market in general. And I think the execution of the team, the investment that we have and our strategy of providing customers with total solutions is unmatched in the industry. Others are trying to mimic it to a certain extent. But I do believe with our outstanding sales force, sales support organization, our overall organization that provides hardware, software and, we\u2019ll call it, partnership with key market makers, it makes a huge difference on how successful we are. So, I\u2019ll stop there, and Satish may want to make another comment.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Ron, I think you\u2019re absolutely right. With regard to what we see in the marketplace is this expanding ecosystem as we have expanded our portfolio from just products to offering total solutions to customers, we remain focused on the end markets that we\u2019ve called out. Another angle to this that Mark Wallace can add is the customer adds that occurs has this expanding contribution that we\u2019re making.\nMark Wallace: Yes. Thanks, Satish. Chris, to add to this, I think our go-to market, the investments we\u2019ve made in sales and marketing and customer engagement is making a big difference. As you\u2019ve heard, we had strong double-digit order growth across all regions and all end markets, not just for Q4, but for the entire fiscal year. So, this is a very sustaining effect that we\u2019ve had as we engage with the market leaders implanting our solutions engineers to help innovate with customers, our largest customers have grown substantially, our long tail of small and medium-sized business customers have grown. And, as Ron has mentioned in the prepared statements, we continue to add new customers, every quarter and every year, more than 2,000 were added during fiscal year \u201821, which creates sustaining opportunities for us going forward, diversifies our business. And then, it\u2019s not just all about our direct channel. We have a very strong partnership or partner channel with the indirect channel distribution sales helping us reach more than 30,000 customers per year, and we\u2019re seeing continued growth from our e-commerce channels as well. So, we have multiple ways to serve our customers and deliver these great solutions. And I think that\u2019s a big part of it, too.\nChris Snyder: Yes. I appreciate all of that color from everybody. I guess, my follow-up would be -- so in terms of the above normal industry growth, how long can that last? And is it reasonable to think that lasts until 5G peaks, which I believe is expected maybe in the \u201823 or \u201824 time frame? And then, in addition to that, is there any reason why we should expect Keysight outgrowth over the market to compress back to the 100 or 200 bps kind of guided levels, just given the R&D scale investment advantage the Company has?\nRon Nersesian: If we were sitting at a total of, let\u2019s say, 60% market share or 70% market share, you may say there\u2019s diminishing returns. But when we look overall, where we are -- we\u2019re in the 25% to 30% range, we have a lot of headroom, and I believe it\u2019s going to go way past 5G. 5G, whether you\u2019re talking \u201824 or whatever your perspective is on that, we\u2019re already investing in 6G. We\u2019re investing in EV. We\u2019re investing in AV. And there are so many more opportunities that are being put right in front of us or that we see, we are aiming to go ahead and outgrow the market for many, many years.\nNeil Dougherty: The only thing I would add to that is our ability to spend $800 million a year in R&D as a real differentiator in the marketplace, and I think goes to at least to indicate what our ability to continue to outperform the broader market should be over time.\nJason Kary: Next question comes from the line of Rob Mason at Baird.\nRob Mason: Yes. Thanks [Technical Difficulty]\nJason Kary: Sorry, Rob. We\u2026\nRon Nersesian: Rob, your audio has cut out.\nNeil Dougherty: I think we just lost the call.\nRon Nersesian: We can come back to you.\nOperator: Mr. Mason, your line is open.\nRob Mason: Yes. Can you hear me?\nRon Nersesian: Yes, we can hear you, Rob. Go ahead.\nRob Mason: Okay. Apologies, not sure what happened. I did have a clarification question just on the first quarter guidance. So, I guess, Neil, maybe this directed to you. Is the assumption that margins would be down year-over-year within your guidance? I\u2019m not sure I totally caught your below-the-line guidance.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. All I said was relative to where we just finished Q4, right, we finished the year at 15.9% R&D investment. It was a point lower than that in the fourth quarter. And I think we look and see a tremendous amount of opportunity for us to invest via the R&D line to bring new technologies to market. So, I think over the course of FY22, you could expect us to return our R&D spend more into that mid-16% kind of a range, which will obviously have a little bit of a pressure on margins. The only other thing I would say is in Q4, we did have extraordinary -- we did a very favorable product mix within the quarter, at least, as we see Q1 taking shape, we expect mix on a sequential basis to be a little bit less favorable, so. And then, there are some normal items for Keysight that also typically impact Q1, most notably that we do company-wide salary administration in the first quarter. And given the inflationary environment that we\u2019re in, that is a larger than typical salary increase, this Q1.\nRob Mason: I see. How would...\nRon Nersesian: And again that\u2019s compared to Q4, which was a 31% operating margin. That was very, very high record.\nRob Mason: Right. How would your expectation within 10% type EPS growth, how would your assumptions around incentive compensation play out on a year-over-year basis?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. So obviously, there\u2019s two components to our incentive programs. There\u2019s the incentive programs for the broader employee base, which are driven based on the organic growth rate of the Company as well as our operating margins. And so, those would be the true drivers there. I think, for the executive population\u2019s ability to grow EPS, and this is for the cash compensation portion, its ability to grow EPS and grow the top line. And over the longer term, we -- our primary source of variable compensation is based on total shareholder return. And so, I think as we look forward to FY22, we\u2019re seeing wages up significantly as a result of kind of the broader inflationary environment, and that\u2019s being offset by a decrease in the broader variable pay programs.\nRob Mason: Okay. Just a quick follow-up. With respect to your capital allocation plan, could you just give us an update on how you view the M&A pipeline, where -- maybe where your focus would be at this point?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. Absolutely, Ron?\nRon Nersesian: Yes. Again, in our target markets, what we\u2019re looking to do is provide total solutions. But, as we -- and there\u2019s no doubt if there are certain parts or components of a total solution that we need, that would be the first priority. The second thing that we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re expanding into adjacent markets. As Satish had mentioned earlier, we started off in 5G or 4G, mostly on the physical layer going ahead and providing solutions there, then we moved up into the protocol layer and now you can see we\u2019re in the application layer and security. So, we continue to look for adjacent opportunities also. That is what we\u2019re looking at. We have a very robust funnel, but we also have very high hurdles. So, we have the ability to not only make the acquisitions that we need to make, but also to return cash to the shareholders, and that\u2019s why we announced $1.2 billion share buyback program.\nJason Kary: Next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer of Thompson Davis.\nAdam Thalhimer: Just a quick one on margins. I\u2019m curious how you guys are thinking about operating margin improvement by segment. You had such tough -- you had a great year at EISG. I just wonder if that creates a tough comp for you, or if you can even build off of the \u201821 result?\nRon Nersesian: Yes. Certainly, obviously, a very tough comp for EISG, given the strong results, not just within the quarter where they reached up into the upper 30s, but 36%, for the full year here. I think we have opportunities to increase margins across both segments. I think we have initiatives in place across both segments to increase software content, to increase solutions content and to increase the value added that we\u2019re bringing to customers. And so, I think if you think about opportunities in EV and IoT for EISG and, of course, in not just 5G, but 6G and quantum and aerospace, defense on the CSG side, there\u2019s ample market opportunity for us to continue to increase the value add that Keysight brings to our customers. And I think as we do that that has a chance to be margin accretive across both groups.\nJason Kary: Great. Thanks, Adam. So, well, that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I\u2019d like to thank you all for joining us. And we look forward to speaking with many of you at the upcoming conferences. So, thanks again, and have a great day.\nOperator: That concludes today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Satish. Chris, to add to this, I think our go-to market, the investments we've made in sales and marketing and customer engagement is making a big difference. As you've heard, we had strong double-digit order growth across all regions and all end markets, not just for Q4, but for the entire fiscal year. So, this is a very sustaining effect that we've had as we engage with the market leaders implanting our solutions engineers to help innovate with customers, our largest customers have grown substantially, our long tail of small and medium-sized business customers have grown. And, as Ron has mentioned in the prepared statements, we continue to add new customers, every quarter and every year, more than 2,000 were added during fiscal year \u201821, which creates sustaining opportunities for us going forward, diversifies our business. And then, it's not just all about our direct channel. We have a very strong partnership or partner channel with the indirect channel distribution sales helping us reach more than 30,000 customers per year, and we're seeing continued growth from our e-commerce channels as well. So, we have multiple ways to serve our customers and deliver these great solutions. And I think that's a big part of it, too."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Satish Dhanasekaran",
            "content": "Thank you, Ron. Great question. I think at the summary, we've had another record quarter for 5G and the drivers are scaling deployments, but equally important is the new application space. And I think we outplayed that as a strategy. We had to continue the progression from physical to protocol to application, and this application area is very rich, right? As I look forward, some of these application spaces have software as a percentage of the total value proposition in the 30%, 40%, 50% range and one we pursue very actively. I'll just make a few examples of these, right? So, you can think of on the 5G side, O-RAN being a great example of that. On the wireline side, the protocols with 400-gig, 800-gig getting more complex. You look at new emerging spaces like SD-WAN, SASE and MACsec and the security domain. So, you look at the commercial comms portfolio, it's very rich in applications that really favor our strategy of being more software-centric and one we're investing to pursue, and we're generating strong results. Yes. So, again, a pretty strong quarter for aerospace defense orders growing double digits, finishing off a year with double-digit growth. If you look at what drove that growth, it's recovery in the macro environment globally, similar spend, especially towards technology that continues to increase, both in the U.S. and internationally and one we're capturing. We also took some concerted steps last year or two years ago, in fact, to take our 5G technology stack and customize it for aerospace, defense applications, and as you've probably seen, our collaboration with Lockheed Martin that we announced. So we're very pleased with the progression that we're making with commercial technologies that are getting adopted. So, all of these are pretty favorable. We are observing that right now, the -- we are under continuing resolution from a budget perspective in the U.S. But, if you look at the budget that has been put in place and if -- or that has been proposed and if it's approved, it does call for a year-over-year increase and also increased spend in technology or our T&E line item, which we view as a favorable dynamic. Peripherally, the Infrastructure Bill that is getting through the Congress has some sustained spend outlays for EV and broadband and semiconductor, which we also think is favorable for us. I'll make a few comments on 5G. As we stated before, the continuing deployments that are going on, especially in the low frequency bands across the world, we view it as a favorable dynamic, specifically the C-band auction was a near-term catalyst. And we've had some strong results, as I mentioned, double -- strong double-digit growth in 5G this quarter, capping off a double-digit growth in 5G for the full fiscal year. And a big part of that was driven by the C-band auction and the related investments that are going on in the Americas. Our Americas business was -- grew the strongest in our 5G from a regional perspective, and we also saw our FR1, our low frequency business double year-over-year. So, very strong results, all the while when our millimeter wave business has been pretty stable this year. And as we have mentioned before, in the medium term, we're expecting that the millimeter wave adoption continues to rise in a very steady manner and we're watching for the Beijing Olympics use cases to emerge from the success of the Beijing Olympics that we expect to occur next year. Yes. Very strong performance in our EISG business. Again, strength, as I mentioned, in the semiconductor, where new wafer starts are really enabling us to continue to drive growth there. A very strong year again, building off of a strong double-digit year last year in semiconductor as well. So, when I think about what we're doing there, we're definitely taking share and we are continuing to invest to keep that portfolio growing and capitalizing on the environment we see semiconductor. With regard to automotive, it's been a newer market entry for us. Relatively speaking, we started this in spin. We're very pleased with the results we're seeing so far. And we've made -- if you look at this fiscal year, we've had some wins in the manufacturing expansions that have happened in the EV sector. And as we shore up our contributions in the AV market, we've announced a partnership with NIO, as an example, of what we're doing by extending our 5G technology stack in C-V2X. In summary, all-in-all, you look at our entire portfolio for automotive, it is growing and it is much more comprehensive than any of our traditional competitors at this point, and we are continuing to invest in growing that business. So overall, pleased with where we find ourselves with the EISG business. Yes. Ron, I think you're absolutely right. With regard to what we see in the marketplace is this expanding ecosystem as we have expanded our portfolio from just products to offering total solutions to customers, we remain focused on the end markets that we've called out. Another angle to this that Mark Wallace can add is the customer adds that occurs has this expanding contribution that we're making."

            "name": "Ron Nersesian",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. Keysight delivered a record quarter and fiscal year. Strong demand for our portfolio of differentiated solutions is fueling continued momentum across all of our end markets. Today, I'll focus my comments on four key headlines: First, demand for Keysight's differentiated solutions continues to be very strong with orders exceeding our expectations. Outstanding order growth of 21% in the fourth quarter topped off an excellent fiscal year where we grew 18%. Demand continues to be balanced across our business with double-digit gains across all end markets and regions, both in the fourth quarter and for the full fiscal year. Second, we delivered outstanding Q4 results despite a tightening supply environment. Exceptional execution by Keysight employees around the world resulted in record revenue, gross margin, operating margin and earnings per share for the fourth quarter and for the fiscal year 2021. Third, we entered 2022 with strong momentum, robust end market demand and record backlog. Assuming a loosening of the supply situation in the second half of the calendar year, we expect fiscal year 2022 revenue growth of 6% to 7%, while delivering 10% earnings growth. Beyond 2022, we are increasingly confident in our ability to deliver sustained above-market results. We have established a strong track record of execution, and our competitive position earned over the past seven years of investment in transformation has only grown stronger. Lastly, given the strength of our cash position and generation, we continue to see tremendous opportunities for value-creation through disciplined investment in organic capabilities, targeted acquisitions and accordingly, today, we announced a new share repurchase authorization of $1.2 billion. Now, let's take a deeper look at the strength of our fourth quarter and the fiscal year 2021 financial performance. In the fourth quarter, we saw continued momentum in the demand environment. Orders exceeded our expectations and grew 21% year-over-year. Revenue grew 6% with growth across all regions. Operational excellence resulted in record profitability as we delivered gross margin of 66%, operating margin of 31% and earnings of $1.82 per share. Fourth quarter results drove a very strong finish to an excellent year. In 2021, we overcame 5 percentage points of China trade headwinds and delivered 18% order growth to outpace the overall market, which continues to be strong. Despite a tightening supply environment, we ended the year with 17% revenue growth and achieved record profitability with gross margin of 65%, operating margin of 28% and earnings of $6.23 per share. Compared to pre-pandemic fiscal year 2019, orders and revenue have grown 21% and 15% respectively over this two-year period, highlighting the continued strong demand for our market-leading solutions. Broad-based growth across multiple dimensions of the business demonstrates the breadth of our customer base. We added more than 2,000 customers in 2021 and more than 1,900 in 2020 as we continue to expand our footprint, adding to the stability and durability of our business model. Despite the headwinds we faced in 2021, we delivered annual double-digit order and revenue growth in both business segments. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group achieved its fifth consecutive quarter of record revenue, driven by double-digit growth in semiconductor solutions and in automotive. Another quarter of record semiconductor revenue was fueled by ongoing investments in advanced technology nodes and capacity expansion to address pent-up demand. In automotive, we achieved record orders for the third consecutive quarter of double-digit order and revenue growth. Investment remains strong in EV and AV technologies. This quarter, we announced the collaboration with NIO, one of China's top EV automakers who selected Keysight's 5G and C-V2X network emulation solutions. Strong demand for general electronics solutions was driven by continued investments in digital transformation, industrial IoT, digital health, Industrial 4.0 and advanced academic research. The Communications Solutions Group delivered double-digit order growth and record revenue in the fourth quarter. For the year, orders and revenue grew double digits despite the impact of China trade restrictions. Commercial Communications achieved all-time record orders and revenue in the fourth quarter. Q4 was another record quarter for 5G driven by the strength of our platform, continued O-RAN adoption and new industry applications. In addition, we saw ongoing investments in 400G and 800G R&D across the entire communications ecosystem. Increased spending in data centers and network security drove double-digit order growth in network test and visibility. In aerospace, defense and government, double-digit order growth was driven by ongoing investments in technology with the focus on space and new commercial technologies like 5G. We recently announced a collaboration with Lockheed Martin to advance 5G in support of mission-critical communications for aerospace and defense applications. Keysight's first-to-market solutions are enabling the rapid progression of new technologies and winning engagement with industrial leaders like NXP, NEC and MediaTek. In Q4, we joined Google's cloud partner initiative to support agile orchestration of innovative 5G services at the network edge. Our end-to-end solutions portfolio continues to capture new opportunities as the 5G life cycle progresses and expands into aerospace, defense and government, automotive and industrial applications. We continue to accelerate Keysight's capabilities to provide industry-leading solutions through strategic acquisitions and recently added SCALABLE Network Technologies to our software-centric solutions portfolio. SCALABLE is a provider of best-in-class network simulation solutions to model and visualize communication networks and cyber threats for aerospace, defense and government customers. We're excited to welcome the SCALABLE team to Keysight. Our software-centric solutions and higher value services continue to drive differentiation, strengthen our competitive position and capture a higher percentage of our customers' wallet share. In fiscal year 2021, software and services not only delivered double-digit order and revenue growth, but also outpaced Keysight's overall growth. Combined, they represented just over one-third of Keysight's total revenue for the year. We also continue to grow annualized recurring revenue, which now exceeds $1 billion. The growth in software and services as well as the recurring revenue further strengthens the durability and resiliency of our business model, while at the same time contributing to Keysight's margin expansion. Keysight's focus on first-to-market software-centric solutions and operational excellence drive our consistent execution. We have a strong track record of performance and proven business resiliency. Since our inception as a public company seven years ago, we have achieved a 10% compound annual revenue growth rate, expanded gross margin by over 800 basis points, increased operating margin by nearly 1,000 basis points and generated 16% annualized EPS growth, all while significantly increasing investment in R&D and sales to drive future growth. Over the same period, we have nearly tripled the size of our software revenue and more than doubled recurring revenue while growing services 75%. These accomplishments are a testament to Keysight's leadership model, our values and our people. I would like to thank all Keysight employees for their exceptional execution and dedication. We continue to capitalize on these multiple ways of technology innovation and long-term secular growth trends across multiple markets. We exit this year in a strong competitive position and expect to continue to deliver sustained above-market profitable growth. Now, I will turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail. Happy Thanksgiving. Thanks, John. It's very, very clear that software and services continues to be a bigger and bigger percentage of our total business as we move from a hardware product supplier to a software-centric solution provider and the solutions obviously include hardware, software and services. And we've seen great growth obviously in our software and our services, and they've outpaced the hardware growth. Looking overall at 5G versus 4G, we made a decision in 2013, we announced at Agilent, we're going to spin off Keysight in 2013, which we eventually did in November of 2014. But in 2013, I started working with the team that was developing to invest in 5G and make sure that we were going to be leaders. In 4G, we were providing a little bit more of, let's say, cash contribution to Agilent where we were not investing as heavily in the communications rollout of 4G by a substantial amount. So, we invested earlier. We invested a greater amount as now we're roughly at 16% R&D where we used to be at approximately 12% of R&D. And we've gone from roughly $400 million to roughly $800 million in R&D spend over this period of time, but software is a key part. What we did was we consolidated our hardware development facilities into one organization as opposed to in separate divisions. And accordingly, that enabled us to basically provide software that could span the whole product offering. And we made an acquisition for instance of a company called Anite, which gave us software capability. They had some capability in 4G. We moved them over to 5G. And all this together, investing more, starting earlier, having a consistent R&D and investment profile has really gave us the lead and caused us to be a much, much stronger provider, and I believe the leading provider for 5G. 5G is still growing, and we anticipate it growing for years. I'm going to turn it over to Satish, who could tell you a little bit more about our results and our growth in, not only 2021, but what he sees going forward. Sure, Jim. The first thing that's probably really important to note is that our differentiating technologies that have given us the leadership position outside of the software that we have developed is semiconductors that have very particular high-performance capabilities. And as you know, we have an on-site fab that exists in Santa Rosa, and that fab makes gallium arsenide and indium phosphide semiconductors. So, a lot of people are having trouble now getting more custom components built. And we build a lot of those custom components in-house. So, that has definitely helped us. Now, again, if you don't have all the parts, you can't ship anything. And we are in relatively good shape compared to other competitors, but there's no doubt that we have to make sure that we get all the components that are needed in order to ship the product. We always will look for opportunities to integrate, provided that it makes financial sense. We feel very good about what we have in-house right now. It's not so much the plastic pieces and things like that. There are obviously not only components, but there is the whole logistical shipping issues that the whole world is going through. So, we are impacted, a little bit less than others. And I think the overall organization has done a real good job of being able to deliver during these very challenging times. Yes. I mean, the supply chain situation is very dynamic, I guess, I would start by saying that. And we are -- we have very close relationships with our key suppliers and are in constant dialogue with them during this period of time to make sure that we are procuring the parts that are necessary to meet the needs of our customers. I think it's -- our confidence and our guide reflects a -- the start of a recovery in the supply chain situation in the back half, and that stems from direct indications that we've got from key suppliers within our supply chain environment. So, we started to -- or we talked about in this recently completed fiscal year that we expected a couple of years of elevated CapEx as a result efforts to improve the resiliency of our supply chain. And that, in fact, did pan out with CapEx of approximately $175 million this year. I think, in addition to continuing those investments, we see incremental investments that are necessary as we continue to expand our own capacity and invest in key technologies to drive the future growth of our business. So, I think those are additive, given everything that's happening across the economic sphere today, there is, relative to what we were seeing this time last year, an increased need to spend money on capacity investments here within Keysight. And so, I do not believe that the approximately $250 million of CapEx that we've communicated for next year is the new steady state, that is not the case. That steady state is significantly lower, exactly where -- a little bit difficult to call at this point, but materially lower than the $250 million that we're indicating for FY22. And your second question, which was with competitors having a little tougher time on shipments, are we going ahead and taking advantage of that for pricing? The answer is no. We're in this for the long haul with customers. We've been back from the original Hewlett-Packard days, over 80 years working with customers. We're not taking advantage of them. Where costs are up in certain areas for shipments and others, we will do price increases, but not because of any competitive position or hard ability for our customers to get products from competitors. I'll make a couple of comments and then turn it over. I think it's a combination of two. There's no doubt that we've seen more growth and more opportunity in 5G. But, as we see the digitization of everything, the market is, there is no doubt, a great place to be. And we have a very-diversified portfolio, and we're seeing growth in semiconductor. We're seeing growth in Industrial 4.0. We're seeing growth all across our real stated growth initiatives and the markets that we've gone after. So, there is no doubt we pick markets that are winning, and we have been growing faster than the market in general. And I think the execution of the team, the investment that we have and our strategy of providing customers with total solutions is unmatched in the industry. Others are trying to mimic it to a certain extent. But I do believe with our outstanding sales force, sales support organization, our overall organization that provides hardware, software and, we'll call it, partnership with key market makers, it makes a huge difference on how successful we are. So, I'll stop there, and Satish may want to make another comment. If we were sitting at a total of, let's say, 60% market share or 70% market share, you may say there's diminishing returns. But when we look overall, where we are -- we're in the 25% to 30% range, we have a lot of headroom, and I believe it's going to go way past 5G. 5G, whether you're talking \u201824 or whatever your perspective is on that, we're already investing in 6G. We're investing in EV. We're investing in AV. And there are so many more opportunities that are being put right in front of us or that we see, we are aiming to go ahead and outgrow the market for many, many years. Rob, your audio has cut out. We can come back to you. Yes, we can hear you, Rob. Go ahead. And again that's compared to Q4, which was a 31% operating margin. That was very, very high record. Yes. Again, in our target markets, what we're looking to do is provide total solutions. But, as we -- and there's no doubt if there are certain parts or components of a total solution that we need, that would be the first priority. The second thing that we're doing is we're expanding into adjacent markets. As Satish had mentioned earlier, we started off in 5G or 4G, mostly on the physical layer going ahead and providing solutions there, then we moved up into the protocol layer and now you can see we're in the application layer and security. So, we continue to look for adjacent opportunities also. That is what we're looking at. We have a very robust funnel, but we also have very high hurdles. So, we have the ability to not only make the acquisitions that we need to make, but also to return cash to the shareholders, and that's why we announced $1.2 billion share buyback program. Yes. Certainly, obviously, a very tough comp for EISG, given the strong results, not just within the quarter where they reached up into the upper 30s, but 36%, for the full year here. I think we have opportunities to increase margins across both segments. I think we have initiatives in place across both segments to increase software content, to increase solutions content and to increase the value added that we're bringing to customers. And so, I think if you think about opportunities in EV and IoT for EISG and, of course, in not just 5G, but 6G and quantum and aerospace, defense on the CSG side, there's ample market opportunity for us to continue to increase the value add that Keysight brings to our customers. And I think as we do that that has a chance to be margin accretive across both groups."

            "name": "Neil Dougherty",
            "content": "Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. As Ron mentioned, we delivered an outstanding quarter and fiscal year. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we delivered record revenue of $1,294 million, which was above the high end of our guidance range and grew 6% or 5% on a core basis despite a tightening supply environment. The further contraction of the supply chain within the quarter tempered total revenue results and was more impactful on the Communications Solutions Group businesses. With demand outpacing supply, we delivered a record $1,491 million in orders, up 21% on a reported and core basis and enter fiscal year 2022 with over $2 billion in backlog, which will position us well as the supply chain situation improves. Looking at our operational results for Q4, we reported record gross margin of 66% and operating expenses of $456 million, resulting in an operating margin of 31%, an all-time high. Net income was a record $338 million, and we achieved $1.82 in earnings per share, which was well above the high end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 186 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated record revenue of $919 million, up 2%. CSG delivered gross margin of 66% and operating margin of 28%. In Q4, commercial communications generated revenue of $622 million, up 3% driven by strength across the 5G ecosystem, O-RAN adoption and investment in 400-gigabit and 800-gigabit R&D. Aerospace, defense and government achieved record revenue of $297 million, up slightly from the same quarter last year as solid growth in Asia Pacific was offset by supply chain constraints that impacted revenue in the U.S. and Europe. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated fourth quarter revenue of $375 million, up 18% on a reported and core basis, driven by strength in semiconductor and automotive. EISG reported record gross margin of 66% and record operating margin of 36%. Given tightening supply chain constraints and trade headwinds, we are very pleased with our full year results. In FY21, revenue totaled $4.9 billion, up 17% year-over-year or 15% on a core basis. Gross margin improved 40 basis points year-over-year to 65%. We continue to invest in R&D at 16% of revenue or $788 million for the year, while operating margin improved 260 basis points to 28%. On the strength of this performance, we have achieved our long-term operating margin target of 26% to 27%, two years ahead of plan. FY21 non-GAAP net income was $1.2 billion or $6.23 per share, up 28%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our fourth quarter with $2.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generated cash flow from operations of $368 million and free cash flow of $295 million. Total free cash flow for the year was $1.1 billion, representing 23% of revenue and 99% of non-GAAP net income. As announced earlier today, the Keysight Board of Directors has approved a new share repurchase authorization of $1.2 billion, effective immediately. Under our prior share repurchase authorization, we acquired approximately 2.1 million shares in the quarter at an average share price of $171 for a total consideration of $353 million. This brings our total share repurchase for the year to approximately 4.4 million shares at an average share price of $154 for a total consideration of $673 million or 59% of free cash flow. Now, turning to our outlook and guidance. Despite a strong demand backdrop, supply chain constraints continue to moderate shipment expectations. As a result, we expect first quarter 2022 revenue to be in the range of $1.225 billion to $1.245 billion and Q1 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.50 to $1.56 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 185 million shares. Looking forward to 2022, we expect supply chain to remain tight in the first half of the year. Assuming a loosening of the supply situation in the second half, we expect full year revenue growth to be in the range of 6% to 7%, while delivering 10% earnings growth. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $78 million and capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $240 million to $260 million with increasing capacity and technology investments. Regarding our tax rate, we are modeling a 12% non-GAAP effective tax rate for FY22, which assumes no change to current U.S. tax policy. In closing, we are entering the fiscal year with strong momentum, a record backlog position and a strong track record of operational excellence. We're encouraged by the strong dynamics across our end markets and are competitively positioned to drive sustainable and profitable growth going forward. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A. Yes. Hi, Samik. It's a great question. So, yes, as we mentioned on the call, we did see the supply chain situation tightened during the quarter, and our guidance does assume that we will see some relaxation in that environment in the back half of the year. So, if I was thinking about the seasonality for FY22, I'd say two things. I think, first of all, I think we'd expect revenue to build as we move throughout the year. And then, maybe if you think about it in terms of year-over-year growth, right, our guidance of 6% to 7% for the full year. I was thinking about that on a quarter-by-quarter basis, I'd be expecting growth rates in the first half of the year that are below that 6% to 7% level and growth rates in the back half of the year that are slightly above that 6% to 7% level, so that we average that for the full year. Yes. No onetime benefits, but I mean I think the thing that comes immediately to the forefront is obviously the extraordinarily strong revenue growth for the year with 30% revenue growth on the year. The business -- the demand for those products has been very strong. We've seen a very nice rebound this year in the automotive business, the semi business, we all have -- everybody has seen the press on the continued strength in semi. So, you take that strong demand picture and -- which essentially allowed them to leverage their OpEx infrastructure and drive really high levels of operating margin in the short run. I think as we look forward, we continue to see great opportunities to continue to grow the business as well as to invest in further technology investments to serve these end markets. Yes. Thanks, John. It's a great question. So, first of all, I said the opposite. The impact was greater on CSG businesses than in EISG businesses. If you think about why that is, the CSG products tend to be more complex. They have a longer bill of materials. And so, there are more parts and components that go into building those instruments on average. And so that, just by its nature, increases the risk and the challenges that we have to fulfill that supply chain. I think, it's also true on average that the CSG products tend to be at the higher end of the technology spectrum. And so, there are fewer suppliers for those cutting-edge technology products than for a little bit more of the mainstream products that exist within EISG. I think, if you think about the impact of supply chain, I'd maybe lump COVID and supply chain together because we've really seen this phenomenon over the last couple of years. And if you're starting to think about how to quantify those impacts, I'd really kind of focus your attention, not on any one quarter, but over time you're looking at the full fiscal years, as an example, at our order rates, right? If you look at our history prior to 2020, we have done a pretty good job of converting our orders to revenue. There's typically a little bit of a lag at certain percentage of each quarter's order ship within the quarter, another portion shift out into the following quarters. But over the past couple of years in 2020 because of COVID and in 2021 because of supply chain, we have seen that delta between orders and revenue grow. And so, I think we estimate that if you think about it in terms of kind of an abnormal backlog build, that abnormal backlog build over the last couple of years is in the $300 million to $400 million range. And so, I think that's the opportunity for us as we look forward to eventually clear that backlog, once the supply chain situation fixes itself. I don't expect that we'll flush that in a quarter or two. I think it will happen over time because the kind of the remedies of the supply chain are going to happen over time as well. But, that's the rough magnitude of what we've -- what the impact has been here over a couple of year period of time. Yes. And Tim, to your second question, yes, we've obviously had a great run here in terms of margin expansion since the birth of Keysight, adding 800 basis points approximately to gross margins, about 1,000 basis points to operating margins. And I think the key point is that as we look forward over the longer term, we continue to see opportunities for further expansion of margins within the Keysight portfolio. I think as we look to next year, it's a really dynamic time, obviously, with supply chain pressures putting a little bit of a governor on revenue. At the same time, we've got inflationary pressures across the broader economy. And then, the other thing that we're looking forward -- looking to, that's a little bit of a cost up within next year is hopefully a return to kind of a post-COVID or a pre-COVID normal in terms of our general operating environment, and that includes the costs associated with the facilities management as we return to the office, increase travel as people get back out and start seeing customers and conducting more business in person rather than over Zoom. I think -- and maybe the last point being that we saw -- we invested in R&D this year just under 16% of revenue. I think we continue to see great opportunities to invest in technology and bring new solutions into the marketplace. I think you're likely to see R&D tick upward next year into that kind of mid-16% range. So from those perspectives, I think FY22 may be a bit of a catch-up year. But over the longer term, a lot of opportunity as we expand our software portfolio, expand our solutions portfolio, continue to work with customers and provide them with first-to-market solutions to continue to drive both, gross and operating margins northward. The only thing I would add to that is our ability to spend $800 million a year in R&D as a real differentiator in the marketplace, and I think goes to at least to indicate what our ability to continue to outperform the broader market should be over time. I think we just lost the call. Yes. All I said was relative to where we just finished Q4, right, we finished the year at 15.9% R&D investment. It was a point lower than that in the fourth quarter. And I think we look and see a tremendous amount of opportunity for us to invest via the R&D line to bring new technologies to market. So, I think over the course of FY22, you could expect us to return our R&D spend more into that mid-16% kind of a range, which will obviously have a little bit of a pressure on margins. The only other thing I would say is in Q4, we did have extraordinary -- we did a very favorable product mix within the quarter, at least, as we see Q1 taking shape, we expect mix on a sequential basis to be a little bit less favorable, so. And then, there are some normal items for Keysight that also typically impact Q1, most notably that we do company-wide salary administration in the first quarter. And given the inflationary environment that we're in, that is a larger than typical salary increase, this Q1. Yes. So obviously, there's two components to our incentive programs. There's the incentive programs for the broader employee base, which are driven based on the organic growth rate of the Company as well as our operating margins. And so, those would be the true drivers there. I think, for the executive population's ability to grow EPS, and this is for the cash compensation portion, its ability to grow EPS and grow the top line. And over the longer term, we -- our primary source of variable compensation is based on total shareholder return. And so, I think as we look forward to FY22, we're seeing wages up significantly as a result of kind of the broader inflationary environment, and that's being offset by a decrease in the broader variable pay programs. Yes. Absolutely, Ron?"

And now, I will turn the call over to Ron.\nRon Nersesian: Thank you, Jason. And thank you, everyone, for joining us. Keysight delivered another Quarter of excellent results. Solid industry dynamics are accelerating demand for our differentiated solutions and we continue to capitalize on broad-based technology investment across a diverse set of growing markets. Today, I'll focus my comments on three key headlines. First, we delivered record Q3 orders, all-time record revenue, and our highest quarterly operating margin of the year. The durability of our business model was on full display as we continued to effectively navigate supply chain challenges.  Second, Keysight's first-to-market software-centric solution strategy continues to yield consistently strong results. Since our launch in 2015, through our expected 2021 finish, we will have delivered 9% compound annual revenue growth and 16% annualized earnings growth, both well above our long-term commitments. Despite significant headwinds of trade restrictions and a global pandemic. Our investments are well aligned with the highest impact market opportunities as we continue to enable our customer success and deliver value to our shareholders.  Third, given our outstanding performance year-to-date, we expect to achieve 2021 year-over-year revenue growth of 16% and EPS of $6.03, which represents 24% earnings growth at the midpoint of our guidance. We have strong momentum entering 2022, and our long-term revenue and earnings growth targets remain intact. And we expect to drive incremental margin expansion going forward. Now let's take a deeper look at our Third Quarter performance. Record Q3 orders of 1.3 billion grew 23%. All-time record revenue also grew 23% to 1.2 billion. We delivered a gross margin of 65%, operating margin of 27%, and earnings of $1.54, which was well above the high-end of our guidance and represents 29% year-over-year earnings growth.  Keysight continues to deliver outstanding growth despite year-over-year headwinds due to trade restrictions in ongoing supply chain disruption. Our growth rates are not only just a result of soft year-over-year comparisons but also reflect sustained multi-year above-market growth. For example, Q3 orders are up 18%, and revenue was up 15% versus the same quarter in 2019, prior to the global pandemic. The strength and durability of our business model are delivering as expected. We see accelerated demand from our differentiated solutions, from both existing and new customers.  Our customer engagement throughout the pandemic has been strong with approximately 1,900 new customers added in 2020, which we will expect to exceed in 2021. Looking at our business segments for the third quarter in a row, we've reported double-digit year-over-year order and revenue growth across both segments and all regions. Demonstrating the breadth and differentiated portfolio across a diverse set of end markets. Our Electronic Industrial Solutions Group achieved strong double-digit order and revenue growth across all regions, as well as its fourth consecutive quarter of record revenue.  Continued investment in chipsets for 5G data center cloud and AI applications drove demand for our differentiated semiconductor solutions, resulting in another Quarter of record orders and revenue. Investment also remains high in advanced technology nodes in capacity expansion for mature processes to address surging global semiconductor demand. Our general electronics business achieved record Q3 orders and revenue. 4 consecutive Quarters s of double-digit order and revenue growth demonstrate Keysight's breadth of contributions across multiple industries.  Strength in the Quarter was driven by investments in customers' broad-based digital transformation, industrial IOT, digital health, Industry 4.0, and advanced academic research. in automotive, record Q3 orders and all-time record revenue were driven by the ongoing macroeconomic recovery, acceleration in EV and AV technology investment, and manufacturing expansion to meet pent-up demand. As the trend towards autonomous vehicles gains momentum, Keysight remains focused on enabling next-generation technologies across the automotive R&D workflow.  We recently announced a new cellular vehicle or C-V2X autonomous drive emulation solution, which provides a real-world environment emulator for in-lab testing to simulate realistic roadway scenarios. We continue to see steady demand for EV and AV solutions, including automotive ethernet compliance and cybersecurity test. Our communications solutions group achieved record third-quarter orders in revenue and delivered double-digit order and revenue growth despite trade restrictions that impacted one of our larger customers in China.  Aerospace, defense, and government delivered record Q3 orders and revenue. Revenue grew double-digits across all major regions. While benefiting from a soft prior-year comparison, growth was again driven by space satellite, electromagnetic spectrum operations, 5G, and early 6G research applications. U.S. government and prime contractor investment were strong, while internationally, Europe rebounded from a year ago, coupled with solid growth in Asia. Our application solution strategy drove a significant win with a leading research institute in this quarter.  Keysight 's leading-edge integrated wireless and wireline testbed is enabling their next-generation terabit and 6G research. Our aerospace, defense, and government customers will also benefit from our differentiated services offering to enable their mission-critical program needs. In Q3, we entered into multiple U.S. prime contractor engagements for calibration and uptime surfaces. Commercial Communications achieved third-quarter record orders in revenue adjusted for the impact of China trade restrictions, Commercial Communications orders and revenue both grew double-digits.  Ongoing strength was driven by global 5G deployments and the rollout of new 5G chipsets and devices, ORAN adoption, 400-gig and 800-gig Ethernet for data centers, and increased spending by service providers. Our collaboration with key 5G innovators remains strong as we continue to lead with new industry firsts. In partnership with Qualcomm, we were the first to achieve 10 gigabits per second 5G data connections. Keysight was also selected by Vodafone, along with other industry leaders such as Samsung, NEC, and Dell to deliver end-to-end cloud solutions for the deployment of Europe's first commercial O-RAN network.  [Indiscernible], acquired earlier this year, had a strong quarter driven by expanding adoption of our WaveJudge wireless test system, which further enhances Keysight's 5G solutions for deployments. Keysight continues to enable next-generation wireline standards, such as 800 Gigabit ethernet. Our newly announced 800 Gigabit ethernet solutions saw strong demand within the Quarter. In a recent partnership with Cisco and Amphenol, we demonstrated high data rate, multi-vendor interoperability, a key enabler of next-generation networks. The combination of our network apps and our leading physical layer Bit Error Rate testers and oscilloscopes is driving new levels of customer insight and value.  Higher-value services are driving differentiation while strengthening our competitive position. [Indiscernible] with AIR [Indiscernible] exceeding $1 billion. Our growing mix of software and services is increasing the durability of our business model while reducing overall cyclicality. They are both contributing to Keysight 's margin expansion with an Operating margin at or above the Company average. Keysight 's focus on operational excellence continues to drive our consistent execution and our employees are critical to our success.  Employee growth is a key component of the Keysight leadership model and we view our high-performance culture as a competitive advantage. As such, we are honored to have our team in Malaysia recognized as the overall winner of the employee experience awards by human resources online. This award is in recognition of the innovative [Indiscernible] team to proactively engage employees and create positive experiences, despite unprecedented pandemic-related challenges.  Our employees in Malaysia have done an outstanding job under difficult circumstances since COVID restrictions were imposed and our production operations were impacted. To mitigate the risk of COVID - 19 to employees, customers, and suppliers. Keysight implemented a vaccine program for both Keysight employees and our suppliers. Over 95% of our employees at the Malaysian facility are now vaccinated. In addition, vaccination rates at a large U.S. site are above their local community averages.  In summary, our momentum continues, and our strategy is generating strong results. We have a track record of consistent execution and delivering on our commitments. I am confident in our ability to capitalize on many growth opportunities ahead of us as we finish the fiscal year, and look forward to 2022. Now, I would like to turn it over to Neil, to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail.\nNeil Dougherty: Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. As Ron mentioned, Keysight delivered another outstanding quarter as broad-based technology investment accelerated demand for our differentiated solutions. Resulting in better-than-expected results in the quarter. Third-quarter revenue of one billion was above the high-end of our guidance and grew 23% or 21% on a core basis. We achieved third-quarter orders of $1,310,000 up 23% or 20% on a core basis. Excluding the impact of China trade restrictions, orders grew 29%. Turning to our operational results, we reported a Q3 gross margin of 65%, which increased 60 basis points year-over-year.  Operating expenses of $472 million were well-managed despite higher variable compensation. The operating margin was 27%, up over 100 basis points. We achieved a net income of $286 million and delivered $1.54 in earnings per share, which was above the high-end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the Quarter was 186 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments, our Communications Solutions Group, or CSG, achieved Third Quarter revenue of $875 million up 15%. CSG delivered a gross margin of 66%, which increased 50 basis points year-over-year.  The operating margin was 26%. Commercial Communications revenue of $595 million increased 6%, driven by continued investments across the 5G lifecycle, and our leadership in emerging applications. As Ron mentioned, adjusting for the transient impact of unfavorable trade restrictions, Commercial Communications revenue grew double-digits. Aerospace, Defense, and Government revenue of $280 million grew 39% and recorded double-digit growth across all major regions led by U.S. and Europe. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group or EISG generated another record revenue quarter of $371 million up 48% or 44% on a core basis.  Order and revenue strength were notable across all markets and regions as semiconductor, general electronics, and automotive solutions, orders and revenue all grew strong, double-digits. EISG reported a gross margin of 64% and a record operating margin of 31%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our third quarter with over $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and reported cash flow from operations of $257 million, and free cash flow of $217 million or 17% of revenue. Our capital allocation priorities are unchanged and remain focused on investments in organic growth, value-creating acquisitions, and share repurchase.  Under our share repurchase authorization during the Quarter, we acquired approximately 570,000 shares on the open market and an average price of $140. For a total consideration of $80 million. Now, turning to our outlook and guidance. We expect the Fourth Quarter of 2021 revenue to be in the range of $1,250,000,000 to 1,270 billion, which represents 3% revenue growth at the midpoint. Full-year revenue at the midpoint of our guidance is $4.9 billion, representing 16% revenue growth.  We expect Q4 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.59 -$1.65 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 186 million shares. Full-year earnings at the midpoint of our guidance are $6.03, representing 24% EPS growth. In closing, our expected 2021 revenue and earnings per share represent 7%, and 13% compounded annual growth over the last two years, since 2019. Both are not only above our long-term expectations but accomplished in the face of significant COVID-related disruption last year and the substantial negative effect of China trade restrictions.  Our consistent execution demonstrates the resilience of our business and our ability to drive sustainable and profitable growth. Beyond 2021, our long-term revenue and earnings growth targets, as well as our financial model remain intact as we see continued opportunity for incremental margin expansion. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.\nJason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Holly, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A?\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, [Operator Instructions]. We do ask that you please limit yourself to one question [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup. Jim, your line is open. Okay, we'll go to the next caller. Our next question will come from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. Two follow-up questions, regarding the communications group. Could it be possible that some of the high-end equipment you sell that is used for high-frequency and traditionally categorized under communication -- under commercial communications is now categorized in mid-layer or vice versa, like it's early in the adoption, maybe more millimeter way of application is currently categorize in middle arrow.  And then when it's commercialized, it would be reclassified under Commercial Communications? And I have a follow-up.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Mehdi, this is Satish, I'll take this. Clearly, the focus for us is to maintain a lot of leverage across our portfolio between CSG, both commercial and aerospace, and defense. And in our Industrial business across the portfolio, we sell a common set of tools to all engineers. And you're right in pointing out that the millimeter-wave opportunity is pretty broad.  Now, it will take quite a bit of time to play out in the end markets driven by spectrum and different interests across the globe. But it is broad, such as millimeter-wave is clearly being used in space and satellite communications. It's being used in aerospace -- in automotive for sure.  And now with the commercialization of this technology finds its application in 5G. And we actually classify orders based on customers who buy them. And we're able to maintain a lot of operating leverage across our businesses that way.\nMehdi Hosseini: Thank you. And then one follow-up for Neil. When are we going to get an update on the longer-term target operating margin? I know you have been focusing on increasing the ratable mix of business and software mix, but you're -- you have been operating above the long-term target, and I just -- we're in a phase where it's like how long can you operate above it? Any metric, any update will be great here. Thank you.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. Just make one final comment to tack on to Satish 's answer. As a result of our classification of sales by customer, we actually have 5G orders and revenue not only within aerospace, defense, and commercial comps but also with EISG as well because of the way that, that is done. Under a question about, long-term operating model. First, we're very pleased with the results.  If you look at our 3 quarters to date here in 2020 -- FY21 plus our guide for Q4, we expect to finish this year with an Operating margin basically at the long-term target that we outlined at our March 2019 Analyst Day where we said 20 -- 26 to 27%. We are going to be at that 27% level here in FY '21. So, we're pleased that we've achieved that objective two years ahead of where we expected to achieve it.  So, we've been making progress faster than expected. And then, as we said in our prepared comments today, we don't believe that we're done. We believe that we have continued room for margin expansion. And while I don't have an updated guide for you today or an updated long-term model. I will tell you that we do have multiple levers that we're working across the business.  You noted a couple of them, continuing to grow our software and services businesses at a rate that's faster than the overall Company average and therefore growing our ARR at rates that are faster abroad instead of initiatives focused on gross margin improvement wherever you've seen our gross margin improvement over the last several years go from the upper 50s into the mid-60 percent range and then continuing to leverage our G&A infrastructure.  And so, we believe we continue to have a lot of levers and we remain confident in our ability to continue to drive margin improvement going forward.\nMehdi Hosseini: Thank you, guys.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup.\nJim Suva: Thank you very much. Can you hear me?\nRon Nersesian: Yes.\nJim Suva: Great. Thank you. When I think about the longer-term, specifically your end markets, and I look at them, I take a look at automotive, where it looks like you've been underpenetrated or at least a smaller portion of your sales.  As you look ahead, is that something that you think could materially be pretty big for the Company in the years ahead, or is there something unique about it? I mean, I look at every car that's being sold out there or the newer ones coming out, they just have a lot more electronics and things that need to be calibrated and tested, or is there something unique about that industry that would prevent you from going into it?  Or maybe it's already big for you now, how much is it? Is the profitability the same, it seems like the design times should actually be more favorable because you design a car for multiple years compared to consumer electronics. If you can give us some insights on the automotive strategic view that you may have?\nRon Nersesian: Sure. This is Ron. Hi, Jim. If you take a look at our overall automotive business. It is really transforming in a very large way. As you know, the automobile is really turning into a computer with big batteries and a lot of wireless sensors that communicate to many, many different devices. And that really plays right into our strength. In the old world, the electromechanical car with the combustion engine was relatively low-tech with regards to electronics. Sure, there are transducers and things that are put on suspension systems.  To look at shocks and engine performance. But more and more microprocessors are in cars and the whole car itself is really built around electronics that we test. Whether it's computers or the wireless sensors for either radar or for 5G, et cetera. So, we see this as a very big long-term trend for us. As far as production, it depends. Things that are more complex, we're going to have a role in.  Things that get reduced to a simple test; we won't be playing in that area as it's a very price competitive market that doesn't really need as much value from us. But in R&D, where we focus, that is the sweet spot for us. So, R&D-focused AV, EV technology is really, really a great opportunity for us going forward.\nJim Suva: Thank you so much for the details and congratulations to you and all your teams.\nRon Nersesian: Thanks, Jim. The team did a great job.\nOperator: And our next question is going to come from the line of Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank.\nMatt Niknam: Hey guys, thank you for taking the questions. I have on eon supply chain and one follow-up. Just on the supply chain, you've obviously managed to navigate through some of the challenges of peers you're seeing. Can you comment on whether you saw any incremental Headwinds or even Tailwinds or improvement relative to Last Quarter, and then thoughts on any impact you've embedded into the next quarter's guide?  And then my follow-up, you talked about adding 1900 new customers last year and expecting to exceed that this year. Just any color you can provide in terms of skew or mix, in terms of where these new customers are coming from? Thanks.\nRon Nersesian: Sure. This is Ron. I'll start off on the supply chain answer, and then turn it over to Neil as we go forward. And then Mark Wallace, our head of sales, will talk about the excellent progress of our new customers.  First, with regard to the supply chain, we've commented on this before. The more complex semiconductors that are in our products, we make right in-house. So, we have a boutique fab that has to produce products that literally have, in many cases, 10 times the performance of commercial products because we're the measurement device, and we have to be more accurate to be able to measure the performance on the commercial devices.  That gives us more control of our supply chain, although we do obviously buy parts and some common -- some common components from other suppliers. But I think we have an exceptional management team and order fulfillment. We have the largest order fulfillment organization in the test and measurement industry.  And I think they've done an excellent job working with our suppliers. There is no doubt that we continue to beat our expectations Quarter after Quarter, after Quarter. But obviously, if there were more components, we'd be able to take our revenue up a little bit more quickly. Now we'll turn it over to Neil, who will add some more commentary.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. Just the -- we're not immune to the supply chain situation that's I guess where I would start, but as Ron said, the vertical integration of our supply chain and the fact that we control the production of our most highly specialized parts really helps to mute the impact.  And so, while the impact is not 0 within the quarter, and it's not 0 within Q4 where -- where we just guided the impact is relatively small. And so, I don't think it's a terribly huge concern, I think we're doing a good job managing the expectations of our customers and getting the product into the hands of customers on a timeline that they find to be acceptable.  I can't point to any examples at this point where we have had orders canceled because of the inability of us to manage our supply chain risks and get the product into the hands of our customers. So, I'll leave it at that.\nRon Nersesian: And with regard to new customers, before I turn it over to Mark, that's an effort of doing many different things. First, we have added many folks to our feet on the street program that Mark will talk about, or direct field engineers or salespeople that could expand our presence. We've worked in indirect channels and expanding our efforts there, as well as increasing our marketing efforts to make sure that people understand our value. And all of those things feed on top of each other.\nMark Wallace: That's right. Thanks, Ron. And Matt, I'll just build on that. As you've heard our results were very broad-based across all segments in all regions. And we put a lot of attention as you hear from these calls on innovating with the industry leaders. Our largest customers are top 20 were up very strong, high double-digit. But we added 600 more than 600 new customers during Q3. And as Ron mentioned in his prepared statements, we're on track to exceeding 1900, which we added last year. And this is by design.  We have a focus on reaching new customers through a combination of marketing, our direct channel, which, at the end of this year, will be more than twice as big as it was just a few years ago, and through our indirect channel, which is a combination of distributors and our e-commerce platform, where the majority of customers who access Keysight electronically online, are new customers.  So, I think you could think of it's broad-based across all the segments that we are focused on delivering solutions to today. And it gives us this broader footprint and this higher diversity of customer base that adds to our strength in addition to the top-line growth that delivers quarter after quarter.\nMatt Niknam: That's great. Thank you, guys, all for the caller.\nRon Nersesian: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS.\nChris Snyder: Thank you. My question is on the guide, which puts I think FQ4 revenues at the midpoint of 4% below FQ3 orders. I mean, looking back the last few years, FQ4 revenues had outpaced the Q3 orders. So, does the guidance reflects expectations that supply chain headwinds will persist? Or are we seeing longer customer lead times or just a longer duration backlog as the Company continues to push into software and return revenues?\nRon Nersesian: Yes. I think it's a mix of several of those factors. I certainly don't feel like at this point that we can say the supply chain concerns are behind us. We're continuing to very actively manage the supply chain, and we do expect there'll continue to be some limitations on our ability to ship as a result of those supply chain constraints going forward.  I think you highlighted some of the efforts that are going on in our services and software business that is resulting in increases in our deferred revenue accounts and the ratable recognition of some revenues. And then I think in some markets, most notably the semi market, we have seen -- we have seen customers look to place orders earlier in the system for delivery later out, just as they're looking to secure supply and communicate their own needs.  But we take comfort from the fact that we see the amount of fab construction that is underway and we believe that those orders, particularly given the relationship that Keysight has with that relatively limited customer set are very strong.\nChris Snyder: I appreciate all that. And then I just want to follow up on the previous comments around new customers. 1900 new customers are a lot for a Company who has the market share and the history that Keysight has.  Is the strong rate of customer additions driven by the fact that the total addressable market here is expanding? As we're seeing that the 5G ecosystem brings new verticals into it or is the Company taking wallet share from just existing customers that maybe haven't known, or existing people in the supply chain that have not done business with Keysight previously?\nMark Wallace: Yes. Chris, this is Mark. I will add some more color to that. You have to first start with the baseline that we do business with more than 30,000 customers each and every year. So, we have -- in more than 100 countries. So, our presence is broad and wide. You did hit on one of the key elements, which is the expansion of various ecosystems. O-RAN is a great example that is accelerating bringing new customers into the 5G ecosystem.  And then the success we're achieving in really all the ecosystems is expanding our footprint through that leverage. The other part again that Ron mentioned is the combination of marketing and increased selling capacity is enabling us to reach more customers into some of the more broad-based segments.  As an example, in the last several quarters, we saw more education customers turn on, we saw more research. And as we spoke about earlier in the call, it's still early days on the ramp of automotive.  And with that transformation, from prior ICE vehicles to electric and autonomous vehicles, we're seeing a large number of new companies and customers that we're serving in all 4 regions. It's -- as I said before, this is a part of our strategy. We've been running this for 5 years and it's helping us to build this base of customers and accounts going forward.\nRon Nersesian: And the only --\nChris Snyder: Appreciate all of that.\nRon Nersesian: And the only thing I would add to that is if you look at wallet share, you're exactly right. We've expanded into services to get more of our customer's wallet share. We've expanded with our software offerings, and we have added more solutions up and down the communications ecosystem, which clearly gives us a higher percentage of our customer share.  But it's also important to take a look at our competitors and just go back over the last 1, 2, 3, 4 years and take a look at our growth rates versus others. And I think you'll also see market share gains for Keysight.\nChris Snyder: Thank you.\nRon Nersesian: You're welcome.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.\nJoe Cardoso: Hi, this is Joe Cardoso, I'm for respondent [Indiscernible] Samik Chatterjee. Just one question for me and circling back to automotive. Within the auto, there has been this general excitement around EVs and AV's both with not auto-aligned and not auto-aligned companies looking to leverage those upcoming opportunities.  Can you touch on the competitive landscape there? Particularly in that area of auto and whether you're finding it incrementally tougher relative to the traditional automotive world, given the potential of new competition and how is driving differentiation there? Thank you.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Thanks, Samik. I think if you -- on one dimension, you look at the biggest changes going on in auto around EV and av as Ron mentioned, in the EV space, it's all about bringing the best precision metrology that we have to measure current and voltage and other basic parameters that enable decision making on extending ranges and this is a matter of us making -- configuring our IP to apply to a different application set. And it's one where there are a lot of Pavlov trends of innovation going on. And we're able to do that today.  And its still very early days in the EV segment, but we're getting embedded with a lot of lead innovators and the larger eco-system that's forming. With regard to AV, clearly, 5G is going to be a big factor that's going to impact the autonomous cars just from the connectivity aspect and the entire technology stack that goes with it. And that's were extending our strength and differentiation in 5G into this marketplace continues to give us a unique position of differentiation.  Some of the successes we're having are on account of that. And as you saw, we just entered into a partnership with Dechra as well to continue to promote this new standard approach to test in this marketplace. Still very early days, we're very pleased with the results this Quarter. We had strong growth and second consecutive Quarter of double-digit growth in auto and there's plenty of runways ahead.\nJoe Cardoso: And then competitive landscaping tougher?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. But there's not to the competitive landscape. Clearly, anytime there are traditional competitors that have been in the combustible marketplace, that are trying to configure to try to address this opportunity. But as we think about it, the expertise needed and that -- and the IP needed to play in this space long term. I think we bring a very unique perspective there.\nJoe Cardoso: Got it. I appreciate the color., Thanks, guys.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Good evening. So Keysight came into Fiscal year '21, with a backlog built up due to COVID-19 disruptions in the prior year, and year-to-date, you've already built up what I would kind of call an above-average backlog. So how do you see this interplay of delivery timing, of the supply chain? Do you think that you are able to deliver on that excess backlog over the next 12 months? Is it something that extends? How should we think about that?\nMark Wallace: Yes. It's a great question. So again, I'd start by reiterating the points that I made, which I think we've done a really good job of meeting the needs of our customers and getting them the products that they need in timing, which is satisfactory, at least. I think as you know, we've built up a significant backlog.  I think that backlog is going to -- it's going to come down over temporal, to growing into a right to businesses significantly larger now than it has been previously. So, we would expect to be carrying higher amounts of backlog.  But I don't expect that there's going to be a one or two-quarter flush of material backlog. I think we're going to work it down over time and continue to meet the needs of our customers working with them on scheduling deliveries as we manage the supply chain constraints and the addition of capacity, which we're still investing in to ultimately bring backlog levels in line with the size of our business.\nRon Nersesian: That does provide a lot of confidence for us to be able to continue to grow our revenue base having such a strong backlog situation that we have.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Got it. And then I think this is the first quarter than you've cited O-RAN as a driver for orders. I know there's been -- you've been making investments. There's been a lot of industry interest here. But are you starting to see via tangible orders as a result?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yeah. O-RAN was the strategic pact we made a year or so ago, we were participating with the original O-RAN Alliance for a longer time than that. At the highest level, we've long seen that the technology stacks are going to get virtualized to take advantage of the economics and the flexibility that comes with the cloud.  And so, we -- you remember, a couple of years ago, we made the acquisition of Prisma, which gave us some unique capabilities, which were then able to combine with our Ixia acquisition that we made subsequently and we've launched the Keysight open ran architect capability Last quarter.  And we've received a sizable order already, and we have a very strong pipeline and this Quarter, we -- we took the Keysight, open ran architect and have now made it available on the Amazon cloud as an offering\nSatish Dhanasekaran: As in for customers that are coming into this opportunity from a software perspective. So; it's software testing software. We feel very good about our position in the marketplace. Just want to highlight that multiple open ran test and integration centers around the globe have already selected us in our core offering.  And you've also heard -- I think Ron referenced the success had with Vodafone, one of the phones selecting Keysight as a partner for design and test. So very pleased with it. But again, from a timeline of O-RAN, this is a long-term trend, one that we're well-positioned today, but we'll continue to grow this business over time.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Alright. Thank you very much and congratulations on the great results in a very tough market. Thank you.\nRon Nersesian: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis.\nAdam Thalhimer: Thanks. Good afternoon, guys, and congratulations.\nRon Nersesian: Thanks, Adam.\nAdam Thalhimer: I wanted to ask one question on semiconductors, can you give us a sense of where we are in the semiconductor cycle for Keysight? And also, how much visibility do you have there?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: I'll take this. Clearly, very strong quarter. Again, building on 4 consecutive quarters of record, orders, and revenue in the business. We're very pleased with the performance there. With regard to where we play, we're playing in the wafer test, which is on the front end of the semi-process.  And given the dynamics that are going on around lithography and the advancements that are playing out, especially driven by 5G and datacenter applications for 7-nanometer, 5-nanometer, and 3-nanometers. I think all of those new node-size-based opportunities are still in the very early innings, because one, those nodes have to get stable and then ramp up. So, it's still very early stages there.  So, we view the capital spend for those new node sizes to be, to be fairly stable over time. Obviously, there is a part of the business that is about scaling capacity into mature processes. And we think that will continue given this current semi shortage that is going on and demand being high through '22. And it remains to be seen what happens longer-term.  We also -- it's important to highlight that given the infrastructure spend that's likely to come into the U.S and Europe and other regions, looking to localize supply chain, it's one dynamic that's not factored into any of these outlook projections, but could have more upside for the semi business. But again, you look at the end-market dramatic drivers, whether it's a new memory, topology, or 5G, or data center demand, all of those are feeding into this at this point.\nAdam Thalhimer: Good outlook. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Rob Mason with Baird.\nRob Mason: Yes. Good afternoon. Several questions already around supply chain, but I -- perhaps I missed it. But did you speak to your own efforts internally to kind of boost capacity? I know production capacity trying to increase that, at the same time, you're battling some of the COVID-related restrictions was an effort, maybe just an update on that front.  And maybe relatedly as well, is just how do you think about the seasonality of the business we went through this year with the kind of muted seasonality for several reasons, that seasonality continuing as we head into -- or kind of muted seasonality continuing as we head into '22?\nRon Nersesian: Yeah. A great question. So obviously we have been and continue to invest in increasing our own capacity just as a point, we did $4.2 million of revenue last year. We're going to be at $4.9 billion of revenue this year. So, we've added significantly to revenue. Last quarter, we did talk about how within our own factories in subcontractors, we did have some capacity constraints. Those where items were not gating items for us this quarter.  We've added enough capacity that it was no longer the gating item. That doesn't mean that we're done investing as we continue to look forward to the future growth of our business, we're continuing to make investments in further capacity expansion but right now I feel like we're -- doing a good job of staying ahead of the curve, and certainly particularly given that there is some supply chain constraint potentially is relieving a little bit of the -- a little bit of the pressure there.  On the seasonality question, I've answered this question many times over the years. When I sit back to model our businesses at the beginning of any year, we tend to think of coming off of Q4 as our biggest quarter of the year as we model sequentially down in Q1, up in Q2, down a little bit in Q3, and then a big finish in Q4 with the highest quarter of the year.  That's how I would sit down to model our business. As we talked about all through this year, we expected because of the rebound from COVID, and then more recently with some of the supply chain constraints and the needs capacity, we expected that seasonality to be more muted this year than it has historically been.  And I think that's proven out here over the last several quarters. I think as we look forward, at least over the next couple of quarters, I expect that muted seasonality to remain intact. That doesn't mean there won't be any, I just think that the swings will be less than they typically are, and beyond that, it's hard to call.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.\nMark Delaney: Yes. Good afternoon. And thanks for taking the question. The Companies cited trade restructuring into China as a headwind to the growth rate that you reported. I was hoping you could elaborate a bit more on what you've ended up seeing and some of the puts and takes in the context of maybe there are certain customers are not able to shift too.  But to what extent have you been able to offset some of those trade-related headwinds, either as you focus more of your own resources on other customers, or some of the other customers perhaps took market share?\nRon Nersesian: Mark, do you want to take that or --\nMark Wallace: Yes. Yes, I will be happy to. Hey, Mark. As I mentioned before, we did see some uplift from the COVID recovery in certain segments that were really more affected by the impact last year and the early part of this year. You would consider that to be automotive, manufacturing supply chain, the things we've talked about, right, Education and research.  And then our sales into some of the broad customers, both direct and indirect. So, you know that's a dynamic that we certainly experience. We had some pull-in as we talked about before in semiconductor, but it was small and it really gives us this longer visibility through their forecasts and funnels going out many, many quarters as that are a slower moving process with fabs and so forth.  But again, most of our growth in the quarter still comes from the continuing investments in the areas that we're talking about for next-generation technologies across commercial comms, and aerospace, defense, and eMobility. And we've done a great job of capturing those in all regions, including China, where we get all obviously, that's where the headwinds originate. And this last quarter, we overcame them again, sustaining top-line growth in China, double-digit growth when you exclude the trade impact.  And it's really a testament to our ability to pivot to the broad-based business that's available to us in China. And the ability to capture that throughout the various cycles. So, semiconductor again, automotive, general electronics. So, we've not only pivoted in China, but we've also captured this around the world.\nRon Nersesian: And getting more specifically with regard to the trade headwinds, there's no doubt there have been some more companies that have been added to the restricted list. But the team has done an excellent job with still providing growth despite that and making up for, let's say, large sales that were a headwind going into this year. And most of that is behind us. And we look forward to the future.\nMark Wallace: Yeah. I just want to add a little more on that. Q3 was the last quarter of a strong headwind from one customer in China. So, it's going to be a little better going forward.\nMark Delaney: Just a follow-up question on supply chain, and specifically with Malaysia. Given the vaccination rates that you mentioned within your factory, can you talk about to what extent you can operate at normal or near-normal levels of capacity in Malaysia because of those vaccination rates, or are there still restrictions on how much you can have operating in Malaysia? Thanks.\nRon Nersesian: Yes. We're in Penang in Malaysia. Some of the bigger outbreaks that they did have in Malaysia first occurred in the southern part of Malaysia, not in Penang where we are. But regardless of that, we had a very massive effort to not only vaccinate our employees but also folks that we work with, our partners, some of our contract manufacturers, our shippers that come in.  Anybody that gets in contact with us and we have over 95% that have received the first dose as of the beginning of this week. This week, they were getting the second dose. So that feels very good. That's not a constraint right now. But as the orders grow, we'll continue to build that.  The constraint is just getting some, lower-level components in certain areas but we feel very good about the production capacity that we have in Malaysia. As well as what we have in the other facilities where we do manufacture as we do some manufacturing in the U.S., we do some in Germany. And all together, it's all built into the guide.\nMark Delaney: Thank you.\nRon Nersesian: You're welcome.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.\nBrandon Couillard: Hey, good afternoon. Neil, just clarification on the 4Q guide. I mean, if the [Indiscernible] headwinds roll-off in the fourth quarter, a little surprise is that the implied revenue growth in the fourth quarter wouldn't be better than low single-digits. If that's the case, which would imply a deceleration on two to three-year stack comps.  It doesn't sound like the in-market to change all that much. You talked about supply chains and trains here and there. But you seem to be managing it fairly well. So, am I missing something here or are you embedding perhaps a little more conservatism around in one particular end market?\nNeil Dougherty: Yeah, no, I think as we've gone through this year, we've been building our ability to ship and our ability to drive incremental revenues as we've gone through the year right 1180 Q1,1220 Q2, 1246 Q3. We are guiding to 1260 Q4. So, we're making some stepped-up aggressions. In terms of the year-over-year growth rates, obviously, the Q4 of last year was the big bounce-back quarter after our factories reopened up and revamp, following additional COVID shutdown.  And so, we have an unusually tough comparison from a year ago. And frankly, not just on the revenue line, but we've talked about the extraordinarily favorable mix that we saw in Q4 of last year that grew gross margins and operating margins high.  And so, I thinking -- if you're thinking about it from that perspective, I'd just point really to that tough comp is something that's going to mute growth rates here in the fourth quarter. But we continue to make progress as to adding capacity, continue to making progress in terms of ramping our revenue and we're really well-positioned as we look forward to FY '22.\nBrandon Couillard: Okay. And then maybe I missed this, but did you give the software and service revenue growth for the third quarter?\nNeil Dougherty: We did not, but both businesses do continue to grow very, very strongly here in the fourth quarter. And we're very pleased with the progress we're making in both areas, double-digits for both lines of business.\nBrandon Couillard: Got you. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And with that, that will conclude today's question and answer session, and I will turn the call over to Jason Kary for closing comments.\nJason Kary: Thank you, Holly. And thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with many of you at the upcoming conferences and wish you all a great day and a great evening.\nOperator: Once again, we'd like to thank you for your participation in today's conference call.

            "content": "Mehdi, this is Satish, I'll take this. Clearly, the focus for us is to maintain a lot of leverage across our portfolio between CSG, both commercial and aerospace, and defense. And in our Industrial business across the portfolio, we sell a common set of tools to all engineers. And you're right in pointing out that the millimeter-wave opportunity is pretty broad.  Now, it will take quite a bit of time to play out in the end markets driven by spectrum and different interests across the globe. But it is broad, such as millimeter-wave is clearly being used in space and satellite communications. It's being used in aerospace -- in automotive for sure.  And now with the commercialization of this technology finds its application in 5G. And we actually classify orders based on customers who buy them. And we're able to maintain a lot of operating leverage across our businesses that way. Thanks, Samik.

And we think that will continue given this current semi shortage that is going on and demand being high through '22. And it remains to be seen what happens longer-term.  We also -- it's important to highlight that given the infrastructure spend that's likely to come into the U.S and Europe and other regions, looking to localize supply chain, it's one dynamic that's not factored into any of these outlook projections, but could have more upside for the semi business. But again, you look at the end-market dramatic drivers, whether it's a new memory, topology, or 5G, or data center demand, all of those are feeding into this at this point."

            "content": "Thank you, Jason. And thank you, everyone, for joining us. Keysight delivered another Quarter of excellent results. Solid industry dynamics are accelerating demand for our differentiated solutions and we continue to capitalize on broad-based technology investment across a diverse set of growing markets. Today, I'll focus my comments on three key headlines. First, we delivered record Q3 orders, all-time record revenue, and our highest quarterly operating margin of the year. The durability of our business model was on full display as we continued to effectively navigate supply chain challenges.  Second, Keysight's first-to-market software-centric solution strategy continues to yield consistently strong results. Since our launch in 2015, through our expected 2021 finish, we will have delivered 9% compound annual revenue growth and 16% annualized earnings growth, both well above our long-term commitments. Despite significant headwinds of trade restrictions and a global pandemic. Our investments are well aligned with the highest impact market opportunities as we continue to enable our customer success and deliver value to our shareholders.  Third, given our outstanding performance year-to-date, we expect to achieve 2021 year-over-year revenue growth of 16% and EPS of $6.03, which represents 24% earnings growth at the midpoint of our guidance. We have strong momentum entering 2022, and our long-term revenue and earnings growth targets remain intact. And we expect to drive incremental margin expansion going forward. Now let's take a deeper look at our Third Quarter performance. Record Q3 orders of 1.3 billion grew 23%. All-time record revenue also grew 23% to 1.2 billion. We delivered a gross margin of 65%, operating margin of 27%, and earnings of $1.54, which was well above the high-end of our guidance and represents 29% year-over-year earnings growth.  Keysight continues to deliver outstanding growth despite year-over-year headwinds due to trade restrictions in ongoing supply chain disruption. Our growth rates are not only just a result of soft year-over-year comparisons but also reflect sustained multi-year above-market growth. For example, Q3 orders are up 18%, and revenue was up 15% versus the same quarter in 2019, prior to the global pandemic. The strength and durability of our business model are delivering as expected. We see accelerated demand from our differentiated solutions, from both existing and new customers.  Our customer engagement throughout the pandemic has been strong with approximately 1,900 new customers added in 2020, which we will expect to exceed in 2021. Looking at our business segments for the third quarter in a row, we've reported double-digit year-over-year order and revenue growth across both segments and all regions. Demonstrating the breadth and differentiated portfolio across a diverse set of end markets. Our Electronic Industrial Solutions Group achieved strong double-digit order and revenue growth across all regions, as well as its fourth consecutive quarter of record revenue.  Continued investment in chipsets for 5G data center cloud and AI applications drove demand for our differentiated semiconductor solutions, resulting in another Quarter of record orders and revenue. Investment also remains high in advanced technology nodes in capacity expansion for mature processes to address surging global semiconductor demand. Our general electronics business achieved record Q3 orders and revenue. 4 consecutive Quarters s of double-digit order and revenue growth demonstrate Keysight's breadth of contributions across multiple industries.  Strength in the Quarter was driven by investments in customers' broad-based digital transformation, industrial IOT, digital health, Industry 4.0, and advanced academic research. in automotive, record Q3 orders and all-time record revenue were driven by the ongoing macroeconomic recovery, acceleration in EV and AV technology investment, and manufacturing expansion to meet pent-up demand. As the trend towards autonomous vehicles gains momentum, Keysight remains focused on enabling next-generation technologies across the automotive R&D workflow.  We recently announced a new cellular vehicle or C-V2X autonomous drive emulation solution, which provides a real-world environment emulator for in-lab testing to simulate realistic roadway scenarios. We continue to see steady demand for EV and AV solutions, including automotive ethernet compliance and cybersecurity test. Our communications solutions group achieved record third-quarter orders in revenue and delivered double-digit order and revenue growth despite trade restrictions that impacted one of our larger customers in China.  Aerospace, defense, and government delivered record Q3 orders and revenue. Revenue grew double-digits across all major regions. While benefiting from a soft prior-year comparison, growth was again driven by space satellite, electromagnetic spectrum operations, 5G, and early 6G research applications. U.S. government and prime contractor investment were strong, while internationally, Europe rebounded from a year ago, coupled with solid growth in Asia. Our application solution strategy drove a significant win with a leading research institute in this quarter.  Keysight 's leading-edge integrated wireless and wireline testbed is enabling their next-generation terabit and 6G research. Our aerospace, defense, and government customers will also benefit from our differentiated services offering to enable their mission-critical program needs. In Q3, we entered into multiple U.S. prime contractor engagements for calibration and uptime surfaces. Commercial Communications achieved third-quarter record orders in revenue adjusted for the impact of China trade restrictions, Commercial Communications orders and revenue both grew double-digits.  Ongoing strength was driven by global 5G deployments and the rollout of new 5G chipsets and devices, ORAN adoption, 400-gig and 800-gig Ethernet for data centers, and increased spending by service providers. Our collaboration with key 5G innovators remains strong as we continue to lead with new industry firsts. In partnership with Qualcomm, we were the first to achieve 10 gigabits per second 5G data connections. Keysight was also selected by Vodafone, along with other industry leaders such as Samsung, NEC, and Dell to deliver end-to-end cloud solutions for the deployment of Europe's first commercial O-RAN network.  [Indiscernible], acquired earlier this year, had a strong quarter driven by expanding adoption of our WaveJudge wireless test system, which further enhances Keysight's 5G solutions for deployments. Keysight continues to enable next-generation wireline standards, such as 800 Gigabit ethernet. Our newly announced 800 Gigabit ethernet solutions saw strong demand within the Quarter. In a recent partnership with Cisco and Amphenol, we demonstrated high data rate, multi-vendor interoperability, a key enabler of next-generation networks. The combination of our network apps and our leading physical layer Bit Error Rate testers and oscilloscopes is driving new levels of customer insight and value.  Higher-value services are driving differentiation while strengthening our competitive position. [Indiscernible] with AIR [Indiscernible] exceeding $1 billion. Our growing mix of software and services is increasing the durability of our business model while reducing overall cyclicality. They are both contributing to Keysight 's margin expansion with an Operating margin at or above the Company average. Keysight 's focus on operational excellence continues to drive our consistent execution and our employees are critical to our success.  Employee growth is a key component of the Keysight leadership model and we view our high-performance culture as a competitive advantage. As such, we are honored to have our team in Malaysia recognized as the overall winner of the employee experience awards by human resources online. This award is in recognition of the innovative [Indiscernible] team to proactively engage employees and create positive experiences, despite unprecedented pandemic-related challenges.  Our employees in Malaysia have done an outstanding job under difficult circumstances since COVID restrictions were imposed and our production operations were impacted. To mitigate the risk of COVID - 19 to employees, customers, and suppliers. Keysight implemented a vaccine program for both Keysight employees and our suppliers. Over 95% of our employees at the Malaysian facility are now vaccinated. In addition, vaccination rates at a large U.S. site are above their local community averages.  In summary, our momentum continues, and our strategy is generating strong results. We have a track record of consistent execution and delivering on our commitments. I am confident in our ability to capitalize on many growth opportunities ahead of us as we finish the fiscal year, and look forward to 2022. Now, I would like to turn it over to Neil, to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail. Yes. Sure. This is Ron. Hi, Jim. If you take a look at our overall automotive business. It is really transforming in a very large way. As you know, the automobile is really turning into a computer with big batteries and a lot of wireless sensors that communicate to many, many different devices. And that really plays right into our strength. In the old world, the electromechanical car with the combustion engine was relatively low-tech with regards to electronics. Sure, there are transducers and things that are put on suspension systems.  To look at shocks and engine performance. But more and more microprocessors are in cars and the whole car itself is really built around electronics that we test. Whether it's computers or the wireless sensors for either radar or for 5G, et cetera. So, we see this as a very big long-term trend for us. As far as production, it depends. Things that are more complex, we're going to have a role in.  Things that get reduced to a simple test; we won't be playing in that area as it's a very price competitive market that doesn't really need as much value from us. But in R&D, where we focus, that is the sweet spot for us. So, R&D-focused AV, EV technology is really, really a great opportunity for us going forward. Thanks, Jim. The team did a great job. Sure. This is Ron. I'll start off on the supply chain answer, and then turn it over to Neil as we go forward. And then Mark Wallace, our head of sales, will talk about the excellent progress of our new customers.  First, with regard to the supply chain, we've commented on this before. The more complex semiconductors that are in our products, we make right in-house. So, we have a boutique fab that has to produce products that literally have, in many cases, 10 times the performance of commercial products because we're the measurement device, and we have to be more accurate to be able to measure the performance on the commercial devices.  That gives us more control of our supply chain, although we do obviously buy parts and some common -- some common components from other suppliers. But I think we have an exceptional management team and order fulfillment. We have the largest order fulfillment organization in the test and measurement industry.  And I think they've done an excellent job working with our suppliers. There is no doubt that we continue to beat our expectations Quarter after Quarter, after Quarter. But obviously, if there were more components, we'd be able to take our revenue up a little bit more quickly. Now we'll turn it over to Neil, who will add some more commentary. And with regard to new customers, before I turn it over to Mark, that's an effort of doing many different things. First, we have added many folks to our feet on the street program that Mark will talk about, or direct field engineers or salespeople that could expand our presence. We've worked in indirect channels and expanding our efforts there, as well as increasing our marketing efforts to make sure that people understand our value. And all of those things feed on top of each other. Thank you. Yes. I think it's a mix of several of those factors. I certainly don't feel like at this point that we can say the supply chain concerns are behind us. We're continuing to very actively manage the supply chain, and we do expect there'll continue to be some limitations on our ability to ship as a result of those supply chain constraints going forward.  I think you highlighted some of the efforts that are going on in our services and software business that is resulting in increases in our deferred revenue accounts and the ratable recognition of some revenues. And then I think in some markets, most notably the semi market, we have seen -- we have seen customers look to place orders earlier in the system for delivery later out, just as they're looking to secure supply and communicate their own needs.  But we take comfort from the fact that we see the amount of fab construction that is underway and we believe that those orders, particularly given the relationship that Keysight has with that relatively limited customer set are very strong. And the only -- And the only thing I would add to that is if you look at wallet share, you're exactly right. We've expanded into services to get more of our customer's wallet share. We've expanded with our software offerings, and we have added more solutions up and down the communications ecosystem, which clearly gives us a higher percentage of our customer share.  But it's also important to take a look at our competitors and just go back over the last 1, 2, 3, 4 years and take a look at our growth rates versus others. And I think you'll also see market share gains for Keysight. You're welcome. That does provide a lot of confidence for us to be able to continue to grow our revenue base having such a strong backlog situation that we have. Thank you. Thanks, Adam. Yeah. A great question. So obviously we have been and continue to invest in increasing our own capacity just as a point, we did $4.2 million of revenue last year. We're going to be at $4.9 billion of revenue this year. So, we've added significantly to revenue. Last quarter, we did talk about how within our own factories in subcontractors, we did have some capacity constraints. Those where items were not gating items for us this quarter.  We've added enough capacity that it was no longer the gating item. That doesn't mean that we're done investing as we continue to look forward to the future growth of our business, we're continuing to make investments in further capacity expansion but right now I feel like we're -- doing a good job of staying ahead of the curve, and certainly particularly given that there is some supply chain constraint potentially is relieving a little bit of the -- a little bit of the pressure there.  On the seasonality question, I've answered this question many times over the years. When I sit back to model our businesses at the beginning of any year, we tend to think of coming off of Q4 as our biggest quarter of the year as we model sequentially down in Q1, up in Q2, down a little bit in Q3, and then a big finish in Q4 with the highest quarter of the year.  That's how I would sit down to model our business. As we talked about all through this year, we expected because of the rebound from COVID, and then more recently with some of the supply chain constraints and the needs capacity, we expected that seasonality to be more muted this year than it has historically been.  And I think that's proven out here over the last several quarters. I think as we look forward, at least over the next couple of quarters, I expect that muted seasonality to remain intact. That doesn't mean there won't be any, I just think that the swings will be less than they typically are, and beyond that, it's hard to call. Mark, do you want to take that or -- And getting more specifically with regard to the trade headwinds, there's no doubt there have been some more companies that have been added to the restricted list. But the team has done an excellent job with still providing growth despite that and making up for, let's say, large sales that were a headwind going into this year. And most of that is behind us. And we look forward to the future. Yes. We're in Penang in Malaysia. Some of the bigger outbreaks that they did have in Malaysia first occurred in the southern part of Malaysia, not in Penang where we are. But regardless of that, we had a very massive effort to not only vaccinate our employees but also folks that we work with, our partners, some of our contract manufacturers, our shippers that come in.  Anybody that gets in contact with us and we have over 95% that have received the first dose as of the beginning of this week. This week, they were getting the second dose. So that feels very good. That's not a constraint right now. But as the orders grow, we'll continue to build that.  The constraint is just getting some, lower-level components in certain areas but we feel very good about the production capacity that we have in Malaysia. As well as what we have in the other facilities where we do manufacture as we do some manufacturing in the U.S., we do some in Germany. And all together, it's all built into the guide. You're welcome."

            "name": "Neil Dougherty",
            "content": "Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. As Ron mentioned, Keysight delivered another outstanding quarter as broad-based technology investment accelerated demand for our differentiated solutions. Resulting in better-than-expected results in the quarter. Third-quarter revenue of one billion was above the high-end of our guidance and grew 23% or 21% on a core basis. We achieved third-quarter orders of $1,310,000 up 23% or 20% on a core basis. Excluding the impact of China trade restrictions, orders grew 29%. Turning to our operational results, we reported a Q3 gross margin of 65%, which increased 60 basis points year-over-year.  Operating expenses of $472 million were well-managed despite higher variable compensation. The operating margin was 27%, up over 100 basis points. We achieved a net income of $286 million and delivered $1.54 in earnings per share, which was above the high-end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the Quarter was 186 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments, our Communications Solutions Group, or CSG, achieved Third Quarter revenue of $875 million up 15%. CSG delivered a gross margin of 66%, which increased 50 basis points year-over-year.  The operating margin was 26%. Commercial Communications revenue of $595 million increased 6%, driven by continued investments across the 5G lifecycle, and our leadership in emerging applications. As Ron mentioned, adjusting for the transient impact of unfavorable trade restrictions, Commercial Communications revenue grew double-digits. Aerospace, Defense, and Government revenue of $280 million grew 39% and recorded double-digit growth across all major regions led by U.S. and Europe. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group or EISG generated another record revenue quarter of $371 million up 48% or 44% on a core basis.  Order and revenue strength were notable across all markets and regions as semiconductor, general electronics, and automotive solutions, orders and revenue all grew strong, double-digits. EISG reported a gross margin of 64% and a record operating margin of 31%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our third quarter with over $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and reported cash flow from operations of $257 million, and free cash flow of $217 million or 17% of revenue. Our capital allocation priorities are unchanged and remain focused on investments in organic growth, value-creating acquisitions, and share repurchase.  Under our share repurchase authorization during the Quarter, we acquired approximately 570,000 shares on the open market and an average price of $140. For a total consideration of $80 million. Now, turning to our outlook and guidance. We expect the Fourth Quarter of 2021 revenue to be in the range of $1,250,000,000 to 1,270 billion, which represents 3% revenue growth at the midpoint. Full-year revenue at the midpoint of our guidance is $4.9 billion, representing 16% revenue growth.  We expect Q4 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.59 -$1.65 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 186 million shares. Full-year earnings at the midpoint of our guidance are $6.03, representing 24% EPS growth. In closing, our expected 2021 revenue and earnings per share represent 7%, and 13% compounded annual growth over the last two years, since 2019. Both are not only above our long-term expectations but accomplished in the face of significant COVID-related disruption last year and the substantial negative effect of China trade restrictions.  Our consistent execution demonstrates the resilience of our business and our ability to drive sustainable and profitable growth. Beyond 2021, our long-term revenue and earnings growth targets, as well as our financial model remain intact as we see continued opportunity for incremental margin expansion. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A. Yes. Just make one final comment to tack on to Satish 's answer. As a result of our classification of sales by customer, we actually have 5G orders and revenue not only within aerospace, defense, and commercial comps but also with EISG as well because of the way that, that is done. Under a question about, long-term operating model. First, we're very pleased with the results.  If you look at our 3 quarters to date here in 2020 -- FY21 plus our guide for Q4, we expect to finish this year with an Operating margin basically at the long-term target that we outlined at our March 2019 Analyst Day where we said 20 -- 26 to 27%. We are going to be at that 27% level here in FY '21. So, we're pleased that we've achieved that objective two years ahead of where we expected to achieve it.  So, we've been making progress faster than expected. And then, as we said in our prepared comments today, we don't believe that we're done. We believe that we have continued room for margin expansion. And while I don't have an updated guide for you today or an updated long-term model. I will tell you that we do have multiple levers that we're working across the business.  You noted a couple of them, continuing to grow our software and services businesses at a rate that's faster than the overall Company average and therefore growing our ARR at rates that are faster abroad instead of initiatives focused on gross margin improvement wherever you've seen our gross margin improvement over the last several years go from the upper 50s into the mid-60 percent range and then continuing to leverage our G&A infrastructure.  And so, we believe we continue to have a lot of levers and we remain confident in our ability to continue to drive margin improvement going forward. Yes. Just the -- we're not immune to the supply chain situation that's I guess where I would start, but as Ron said, the vertical integration of our supply chain and the fact that we control the production of our most highly specialized parts really helps to mute the impact.  And so, while the impact is not 0 within the quarter, and it's not 0 within Q4 where -- where we just guided the impact is relatively small. And so, I don't think it's a terribly huge concern, I think we're doing a good job managing the expectations of our customers and getting the product into the hands of customers on a timeline that they find to be acceptable.  I can't point to any examples at this point where we have had orders canceled because of the inability of us to manage our supply chain risks and get the product into the hands of our customers. So, I'll leave it at that. Yeah, no, I think as we've gone through this year, we've been building our ability to ship and our ability to drive incremental revenues as we've gone through the year right 1180 Q1,1220 Q2, 1246 Q3. We are guiding to 1260 Q4. So, we're making some stepped-up aggressions. In terms of the year-over-year growth rates, obviously, the Q4 of last year was the big bounce-back quarter after our factories reopened up and revamp, following additional COVID shutdown.  And so, we have an unusually tough comparison from a year ago. And frankly, not just on the revenue line, but we've talked about the extraordinarily favorable mix that we saw in Q4 of last year that grew gross margins and operating margins high.  And so, I thinking -- if you're thinking about it from that perspective, I'd just point really to that tough comp is something that's going to mute growth rates here in the fourth quarter. But we continue to make progress as to adding capacity, continue to making progress in terms of ramping our revenue and we're really well-positioned as we look forward to FY '22. We did not, but both businesses do continue to grow very, very strongly here in the fourth quarter. And we're very pleased with the progress we're making in both areas, double-digits for both lines of business."

Keysight delivered a record quarter and we are entering the second half of the year with momentum. Our broad portfolio of differentiated solutions continues to drive growth across a diverse set of growing markets. Today, I will focus my comments on three key headlines. First, we delivered outstanding Q2 results with all-time record orders, revenue and free cash flow. Second, Keysight is enabling leading-edge disruptive innovation around the world. Our solutions have significant differentiation and contribute significant value to customers, which is fueling our growth for the long term. Third, while we are managing longer lead times and component availability, our leading market position, strong customer relationships and supply chain resiliency gives us the confidence in our ability to deliver on our commitments. Now, let\u2019s take a deeper look across our second quarter performance across both business segments. Record orders of $1.3 billion grew 22%. Revenue grew 36% to $1.2 billion, which was an all-time high. We delivered second quarter gross margin of 64%, operating margin of 26% and earnings of $1.44, which was above the high end of our guidance and represents 85% year-over-year earnings growth. We also achieved record free cash flow of $369 million. Over the last 12 months, Keysight generated just over $1 billion of free cash flow that we\u2019ve deployed through approximately $500 million in acquisitions and $455 million in share repurchases. We continue to be active and disciplined in our capital deployment. Second quarter strength was broad-based with double-digit order and revenue growth across all markets and regions. Outstanding results by both business segments demonstrate the power of Keysight\u2019s diversified portfolio in 5G and beyond. Our Electronic Industrial Solutions Group achieved its third consecutive quarter of record revenue with strong double-digit order and revenue growth in general electronics, semiconductor and automotive.  The breadth of our contributions across multiple industries is exemplified by our double-digit order and revenue growth in our general electronics business. With ongoing investment in broad digital transformation, including advanced consumer electronics, digital healthcare and industrial IoT, Keysight is enabling innovation and capturing technology inflections for the IoT ecosystem. Strong demand for our semiconductor solutions drove record orders and revenue. Customer investment in advanced technology nodes remains high, while capacity is expanding for mature processes to address surging global semiconductor demands. In automotive, record orders resulted from improved macro conditions and increasing investments in EV and AV technologies. Keysight solutions portfolio for the automotive market continues to expand with new advanced technologies such as AC power emulation, millimeter wave radar, power semiconductor technology, automotive ethernet, C-V2X and cybersecurity software systems. As the reinvention of automotive ecosystems continues, Keysight is enabling the disruptive innovation of new mobility technologies. Our Communications Solutions Group achieved record orders and delivered double-digit order and revenue growth in commercial communications and aerospace defense and government. Aerospace, defense and government revenue grew 46%, driven by strong demand in space, satellite, signal monitoring, 5G and early 6G research applications. Keysight\u2019s engagement with key industry players remains strong. We recently enabled a large prime contractors\u2019 first test bed and have secured multiple 5G solutions wins in the aerospace, defense and government markets. Commercial Communications orders and revenue both grew double digits, driven by the ongoing investments in 5G and 400-gig, 800-gig Ethernet solutions for data centers. As 5G progresses and deployments drive sustained investment, we are uniquely positioned to capture the opportunities ahead as the ecosystem scales. Recent engagements include a broadening set of new customers as well as key industry players such as NEC, Fujitsu and MediaTek.  We continue to maximize the 5G lifecycle opportunity and lead the industry with differentiated 5G solutions. In addition, the success of our application layer strategy is reflected in the strong demand for new technologies such as O-RAN and business expansion in new end-to-end verticals. Our ability to provide complete solutions for network protocol test, security and visibility is enabling us to solve many challenges across the industry.  In another area of disruption, we continue to advance our long-term initiative to enable the quantum revolution. We are growing our quantum engagements with key customers worldwide. We also expanded our quantum solutions portfolio this quarter with the acquisition of Quantum Benchmark, which brings deep expertise in the performance validation software for quantum computing. Keysight\u2019s software-centric solutions in higher-value services continue to drive differentiation and recurring revenue growth. For the second quarter in a row, software and services each delivered double-digit order and revenue growth. Beyond innovation, execution and financial discipline, Keysight\u2019s culture has long embraced corporate social responsibility. We believe our focus on climate and diversity provides us with a competitive advantage. We recently published our annual CSR report, which includes progress towards our prior goals and the announcement of our commitment to achieving net zero emissions in the company operations by 2040. We are working to set interim science-based targets to ensure our progress towards this goal. Diversity and inclusion are also embodied in our Keysight leadership model. As a CEO priority, we have specific goals and actions that will be tracked by our leadership team and the Board of Directors. Diversity and inclusion brief will be published this month that describes our longstanding D&I philosophy as well as the details of our strategies and goals. While there is more work to do, Keysight remains steadfast in our commitment to CSR and building a better planet. As we look ahead, we are encouraged by the strong demand for our differentiated solutions while managing the longer lead times and component availability constraints. Our in-house high-performance semiconductor fab and the strength of our order fulfillment team are helping us manage these near-term supply challenges and give us confidence in our ability to navigate them entering the second half of this year. In summary, Keysight is enabling disruptive innovation across multiple waves of technology with a decades-long runway ahead of us. Our execution in the face of many dynamic challenges this past year is a testament to the Keysight leadership model, our employees and the breadth and depth of our customers. Now, I would like to turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail.\nNeil Dougherty: Thank you, Ron and hello everyone. As Ron mentioned, the Keysight team delivered another outstanding quarter and better-than-expected results as robust demand for our differentiated solutions and continued macro recovery resulted in strong growth across all regions. Second quarter revenue of $1.22 billion was above the high end of our guidance range and grew 36% or 33% on a core basis versus a soft compare due to COVID-related disruption. Q2 revenue growth was driven by broad strength across all markets and geographies as the Keysight team navigated macro dynamics and supply chain constraints. We achieved second quarter orders of $1.332 billion, up 22% or 19% on a core basis. Turning to our operational results for Q2, we reported gross margin of 64%, which increased 170 basis points. Operating expenses of $467 million were well managed, resulting in operating margin of 26%. As discussed last quarter, variable pay expense increased approximately $30 million sequentially as a result of higher revenue growth and operating margin. We achieved net income of $270 million and delivered $1.44 in earnings per share, which was above the high end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 187 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments, our Communications Solutions Group achieved second quarter revenue of $877 million, up 34% while delivering gross margin of 65% and operating margin of 25%. Commercial Communications orders and revenue in the second quarter were all-time highs. Revenue of $606 million increased 30%, driven by continued investment across the 5G lifecycle. Aerospace, defense and government revenue of $271 million grew 46%, resulting from strong demand across all regions, primarily in the U.S. and Asia-Pacific, followed by a strong recovery in Europe. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated record revenue of $344 million, up 42% or 37% on a core basis. Order and revenue strength was notable across all regions, particularly in Asia-Pacific. Semiconductor, general electronics measurement and automotive solutions orders and revenue all grew strong double digit. EISG reported gross margin of 64% and operating margin of 28%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended our second quarter with approximately $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and reported cash flow from operations of $402 million and free cash flow of $369 million or 30% of revenue. Our capital allocation priorities are unchanged and are focused on investments in organic growth, value-creating acquisitions and share repurchases. Under our share repurchase authorization during the quarter, we acquired 1.59 million shares on the open market at an average price of $138.36 for a total consideration of $220 million. Now turning to our outlook and guidance, we expect third quarter 2021 revenue to be in the range of $1.205 billion to $1.225 billion, which represents 20% revenue growth at the midpoint. We expect Q3 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.39 to $1.45 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 187 million shares. In closing, we are entering the second half of the year with strong momentum. We are pleased with our operational execution and remain confident in our ability to drive growth and deliver on our commitments. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.\nJason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Gabriel, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Mehdi Hosseini, Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes, thanks for taking my question. Neil, both segments, CSG and EISG, had sequential increase in revenue, but operating margin declined. Can you elaborate is that due to the ongoing COVID costs and what else is impacting? And then where are we in the evolution of millimeter wave? And when is Keysight\u2019s expectation for millimeter wave to go from like R&D into full production? Thank you.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes, Mehdi. Hey, thanks for the question. So yes, you are correct. And as I had indicated last quarter, we were expecting a very sizable sequential increase in our variable pay expense in Q2 relative to Q1. Given that one of the primary drivers of that payout is organic revenue growth and we had the soft revenue comp a year ago because of the COVID disruption. So, we saw about a $30 million sequential increase in variable pay as a result of that. And then I will hand it over to Satish and he can address your millimeter wave question.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Hi, Mehdi. As we have said before, millimeter wave is a long-term opportunity for Keysight. We are already seeing a pretty steady business for millimeter wave offerings from our customers for the past few years. So, we expect it to continue to grow. Again, we are on the front-end of something that\u2019s going to play out over the next decade because of the progression in millimeter wave spectrum from 20 to 40 to 70 to 90 gigahertz. And then with 6G coming in with terahertz, so there is a big long-term roadmap that\u2019s playing out. Specific to your question on 5G, maybe I can offer a data point. If you think of the certification being a critical parameter for 5G devices, about 150 devices are being certified right now. About 30% of them have millimeter wave in it. So that paints the picture hopefully. And the total number of 5G devices right now that are being released is about 700. So, it sort of gives you maybe a framing on where we are. It\u2019s still very early days.\nMehdi Hosseini: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Samik Chatterjee of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJoe Cardoso: Hi. Yes, this is Joe Cardoso on for Samik Chatterjee. I just wanted to follow-up on the last question, particularly around the supply chain issues that have been impacting companies industry-wide. I guess just a clarification on my part. In this quarter, did you see an impact from supply issues on your top line and margins? And if so, what was the impact \u2013 can you quantify the impact? And then relative to the guidance, are you guys baking in any headwind, material headwinds on the top line or margins? Thank you.\nRon Nersesian: Hi, this is Ron. As you know, in the last quarter, we exceeded our revenue guidance. And you have seen our guide for the next quarter, very pleased with the performance and how we have been able to deliver the revenue despite what\u2019s going on in the world. Of course, we see some COVID manufacturing decreases in capacity as well as some supply chain components shortages. However, we planned ahead. We fought for those. And the most important part is that when you look at custom ICs, which have a very, very long lead time for many folks in the industry we have an onsite fab that creates and produces all of our custom ICs. So that enables us to basically have complete control of that supply chain for the critical custom parts. We are very confident in the guide that we have. But there is no doubt that we have built backlog and our order book is strong. So, as the world situation unravels, we could increase revenue even more and more in the future.\nOperator: Your next question will come from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nJohn Pitzer: Yes, good afternoon guys. Congratulations on the strong quarter. Ron, I am just kind of curious, with the recent C-band auctions in the U.S. now behind us, can you help me better understand how that kind of impacts your view on your comms business as we go throughout the balance of this year? And as you do that, I\u2019d be kind of curious as to the sort of geographic distribution specifically. As you think about next quarter and beyond, how much more important is China or are you actually starting to see things percolate in the U.S. and beyond?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes, John, it\u2019s a good question. With regard to the deployment scenarios globally, as we all know, China started to lead the 5G deployments. And with the C-band auction coming in, the major announcements from the U.S. operator referencing a roadmap to deploy more 5G in the country, we view it as a positive. We saw an uptick of our \u2013 in our business in the U.S., specifically for capabilities in the C-band this quarter, and we view the funnel and pipeline to be strong there. But again, not to get too siloed on one spectrum, because at the end of the day, our customers are looking to test for creating devices and products that cater to the global marketplace. And right now, we have 9,000 different band combinations that our customers have to test for eventually. And today, they are testing 2,000. So \u2013 and we are enabling all our customers who are staying in the lead and we feel good about our position there.\nJohn Pitzer: And then just quickly, Neil, on the variable comp, was this quarter a particularly sort of step-up quarter and how do we think about kind of the growth in variable comp from here as you guys continue to execute?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. So, I mean this quarter wasn\u2019t unusual. Obviously, we delivered 36% revenue growth. That\u2019s the total. There was \u2013 some of that was, it was inorganic. But with those high levels of revenue growth, it drives our variable compensation towards the high-end of the \u2013 of what is possible. I think as you look forward next quarter, we still have a reasonably soft comp. We are guiding into the kind of low 20% range, which is still quite aggressive growth and it\u2019s going to see variable comp high again in Q3, not quite as high as Q2, but still quite elevated. And then we start to get to more normalized comps during the quarter and a little bit more of a return to normalized levels.\nJohn Pitzer: Perfect. Helpful guys and congratulations.\nRon Nersesian: Thanks very much, John. And please note that the comp that we are talking about, the variable comp is for all employees in Keysight and that is paid. One big factor is revenue growth, and you saw our revenue growth number, which is driving that near the extreme limit.\nOperator: Your next question will come from John Marchetti with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJohn Marchetti: Thanks very much. I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit on the Malaysian operations that you guys have. Obviously, with some of the surges that we are starting to see, particularly in Southeast Asia, if there is concerns there on your side that you may have to slow some things down there from your own manufacturing standpoint?\nRon Nersesian: No, our manufacturing is very well distributed. We have the largest test and measurement factory in the world in Penang, Malaysia, but we also have facilities that do development, early production runs as well as produce certain products in Europe as well as in the U.S., but the bulk of it is overseas. We don\u2019t manufacture anything of scale in China. So, that\u2019s not an issue to us. And Penang seems to be in a very good position to capitalize on any type of regional shift.\nJohn Marchetti: Got it. And then maybe just a quick follow-up regionally, when we think of the China business overall, you mentioned some of the uptick on the semi side as you are seeing some of the increased capacity, not just there, but elsewhere coming in. But any change that you have seen relative to some of the language or what\u2019s going on in China, just given the bit of exposure that you have across the portfolio there?\nRon Nersesian: No. We actually saw strong order results and order growth as well as revenue growth. Mark will tell you a little bit more about it. We did have about 3 points of headwinds from Huawei, where this is really the second to last quarter that we expect to have that. But despite that, we had very strong order and revenue growth. And I will let Mark, our Head of Sales give you a little more color.\nMark Wallace: Yes. Thank you, Ron. John, it is another quarter where we have mitigated the impact from the headwinds, as Ron said, about 3 points during the second quarter. And we pivot to other opportunities and other customers. It really exemplifies the breadth and strength of our business as well as the investments we\u2019ve made in our direct sales organization there. And we\u2019re seeing strong opportunities and growth across China in semiconductor, 5G commercial space. Automotive is really starting to pick up, and then general electronics as well. So, I\u2019m very pleased with what we\u2019ve seen. We\u2019ve got one more quarter in Q3 with some headwinds, but the bottom line is our business in China is strong with this broad footprint of customers.\nJohn Marchetti: Thanks for the color.\nRon Nersesian: Yes, John, I\u2019d just like to point out the fact that Xiaomi was effectively \u2013 the trade restrictions were loosened, is a positive sign for us. Not so much the account of Xiaomi, but the fact that there is some progress that is being made.\nJohn Marchetti: Got it. Thank you, Ron.\nRon Nersesian: You are welcome.\nOperator: The next question will come from Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMark Delaney: Yes. Good afternoon, and thanks very much for taking the question. I think in the last earnings call, the company had talked about the potential for EPS this fiscal year to grow in the mid to high teens range. And through the first half of the year and with guidance for fiscal 3Q, you\u2019re tracking very well relative to that. So, hoping to better understand if you\u2019re still expecting that sort of a mid to high teens growth rate and we need to be thinking about potentially a slower fiscal fourth quarter. So what would be the cause of that? Or perhaps there is now some upside to the prior commentary around EPS growth this year.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. Mark, I don\u2019t have a specific update for you to that prior number. But obviously, we exceeded the high end of our guidance range here in the second quarter. And you\u2019ve seen our guide for Q3. So, I think at the margin, things are trending a little bit better than they were when we made that statement 3 months ago. But I don\u2019t have a specific update for you at this point in time.\nMark Delaney: Okay. Understood. I will turn it over. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question will come from Adam Thalhimer of Thompson Davis. Please go ahead.\nAdam Thalhimer: Thanks. Great quarter, guys. Hey, just quickly, there was another expense in the quarter. Just curious what that was, because it did detract from the Q2 performance, it looks like.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. We did a modification to our pension schemes in the Netherlands and had some settlement expense as a result as we transferred those liabilities to an insurance company.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question will come from David Ridley-Lane of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Good afternoon. So, I definitely heard you on Keysight having its own supply chain under control. Other companies may be struggling a lot more than you and placing orders ahead of time, trying to make sure that they get the equipment that they need. So I\u2019m wondering, are you seeing anecdotally any sign of pull forward on orders or maybe companies placing the order earlier that would have influenced your strong order growth this quarter?\nMark Wallace: Yes, this is Mark. No, we really didn\u2019t see any evidence of that. What we saw was some \u2013 a little bit of pent-up demand from the impact of COVID last year, which we kind of expected it to somewhat offset the trade headwinds that we talked about earlier. We watch cancellations very closely. They were at a record low for the quarter, and we\u2019re seeing, again, this steady, broad demand. So we have no signs thus far that there is any material pull-in of orders.\nNeil Dougherty: And David, if I could just add on. I like your characterization of the vertically integrated supply chain potentially making us a little bit less susceptible to some of the supply constraints than maybe others are facing. As I sit and look at it, the challenges with regard to movement control and social distancing do make it a challenge to add capacity during these times. And so I\u2019ve talked about in the past, our seasonality being more muted at least through the first part of the year. I think those things are going to really serve to keep that kind of muted seasonality in place really through the end of this fiscal year.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jim Suva of Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nJim Suva: Thank you very much, and congratulations on the results outlook and all the details so far. My question is, there is lots of talk about double ordering and double booking, maybe from other industries like automobiles or consumer electronics or PCs and such. Or are you building in some conservatism for some double ordering or customers that may be putting in a little more orders due to the semiconductor shortage. Just kind of, kind of see if you\u2019re building in a little bit of conservatism or simply in the test and measurement industry do companies just not double order due to the lead times in specialty configurations needed?\nMark Wallace: Yes, Jim, this is Mark. As I said earlier, we do watch for this, and there is really no evidence. Our funnel is very strong now for many months as we continue to supply our solutions. The results, as you\u2019ve seen, are very broad-based. And unlike other industries, as you point out, oftentimes, the planning associated with customers procuring some of our systems and solutions can go out many months. So, it really doesn\u2019t lend itself to that sort of double booking, if you will. If you look at semiconductors, one of our stronger segments, we see activities that are a year or more out in preparation for outfitting a new fab or growing capacity. So it makes it very difficult to see any sort of hedging or double booking. And as I said before, we really aren\u2019t seeing that occur thus far.\nJim Suva: That\u2019s what I thought. Thank you so much.\nMark Wallace: You are welcome.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Tim Long of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nPeter Zdebski: Hi. This is Peter on for Tim. I was wondering if you could give us some color on how much of the double-digit order growth in Commercial Communications was related to 5G versus the other businesses? And in particular, if you could talk a little more on the opportunity on the application layer side in light of some of these new deployments?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. So the commercial comps front, again, was broad. It covered both the wireless and wireline, so it\u2019s 5G on the wireless side and 400 gig on the wireline side as well. We also saw some recovery in our network visibility business as enterprises are planning for return to work and thinking about what that IT infrastructure spend looks like. So those all looked favorable, so generally, a very positive dynamic. Specific to the application layer, we identified a few areas around the different end market verticals and new applications to focus on about a year ago, and that\u2019s paying rich dividends. On the new application front, it\u2019s the Open RAN, where it\u2019s an open virtualized network, bringing in new customers and more players into the ecosystem. So we had strong demand for our solutions that we launched in Q1 and \u2013 Quarter one. And on the new vertical side, we gained traction with a lot of the aerospace and defense companies that are looking to invest in the DoD\u2019s 5G program. So both those are going very well. And when we look forward, and look at the funnel for both these opportunities, they are very healthy, and they are very rich with customer \u2013 strong customer collaborations that are building.\nPeter Zdebski: That\u2019s great color. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Rick Eastman of Baird. Please go ahead.\nRick Eastman: Thank you. Thanks again. And good quarter to be sure, and good work by the Keysight team there. Hey, just a question around maybe the backlog, and maybe let me just start for one second. Again, it looks like you built backlog again and maybe my rough math says your backlog is up maybe 15% or so year-over-year. When you provided second \u2013 or excuse me, third quarter revenue guide, is the assumption that orders or your book-to-bill will be about 1.0? Or is there an assumption that you work off some backlog into that revenue guide for fiscal Q3?\nRon Nersesian: Hi, Rick, this is Ron. Our assumption is that our book-to-bill will be about 1. And we have strong backlog, and we expect to exit Q3 with strong backlog.\nRick Eastman: Okay. Is there a lengthening in your backlog in terms of deliveries? Obviously, another supply chain question, but is there a lengthening out or are you foreseeing some ability to clear some of that backlog in Q4 by year end?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. I think the most important thing at this point, we feel like we are doing a good \u2013 I am sorry, I didn\u2019t have my microphone on. Sorry about that. I said I think the most important factor at this point is that we feel like we\u2019re doing a good job meeting the needs of our customers and getting them the product that they need in the time lines at which they need it. And while we\u2019re not immune to some of the supply chain constraints that are out there, I think we\u2019re doing a good job managing them. We\u2019re benefiting from having to vertically integrated supply chain. And we are making investments to add capacity. Obviously, our revenues are going to be up substantially year-over-year, but not just because of the soft comps, very substantially over 2019 levels as well, and we will continue to make the investments necessary that \u2013 to get products into the hands of customers.\nRick Eastman: Thank you.\nRon Nersesian: It\u2019s also worthwhile to note that if you look at software and you look at services, not only do they both have great double-digit order and double-digit revenue growth. We\u2019ve seen more and more ARR, which is going to go into the backlog and let\u2019s put it this way, slow a little bit how that peels off, but it will provide a great consistency of earnings as we go forward.\nNeil Dougherty: It\u2019s pointing north of $1 billion now. So that\u2019s great, great, yes, position to be in.\nRick Eastman: $1 billion, okay. And then just a last follow-up here. Neil, on the guide for fiscal Q3, maybe the conversion \u2013 is the conversion margin here, which I\u2019m kind of calculating maybe low 20s, is that again reflective of variable comp step up here?\nNeil Dougherty: That\u2019s correct.\nRick Eastman: Okay, alright. Very good. Thank you. Thank you again and a tremendous quarter.\nRon Nersesian: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Chris Snyder of UBS. Please go ahead.\nChris Snyder: Thank you. I wanted to follow-up on Satish\u2019s earlier comments, which if I heard right, that companies are currently testing 2,000 bands, and this is going to 9,000 bands so more than a quadrupling of the testing. I guess the question is, how should we think about this, what it means for industry test capacity? I assume it\u2019s not a one-for-one relationship there. But any color on that just higher level of intensity would be helpful.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I think it\u2019s band combinations. But you\u2019re right that the more frequency spectrum in a heterogeneous manner that gets deployed, the test intensity goes up. And if you think of a typical device maker or companies in the O-RAN space that are putting radio and CU components together and they have to do the testing, the amount of time they have to do the testing doesn\u2019t go up. And so essentially, some of the COVID restrictions, of social distancing and all that, essentially means that customers have \u2013 are looking at ramping up capacity for the future. But it\u2019s a steady demand that gives us confidence in our long-term outlook for the business. That\u2019s just one dimension of capacity. The other ones being all of the complexity associated with Release 15 deployments and now with Release 16 ramping up, we have new capabilities to offer such as what you saw with our press release with MediaTek this quarter.\nChris Snyder: I appreciate all that. And then I guess following up on the buyback. You guys bought back a lot more shares this quarter than just kind of been the historical run rate. I guess going forward, is it fair to assume that the majority of free cash is going to go to share repurchase, assuming there is no M&A.? I guess the question is, is like this $2 billion cash kind of balance the right maybe go-forward run rate to model and put everything excess into share repurchase until M&A starts coming through, until we see M&A come through?\nNeil Dougherty: I think you\u2019ve seen a pretty balanced use of capital from us. As we mentioned in our prepared comments, we generated $1 billion of cash over the last four quarters. We spent $500 million on M&A, just under $500 million on share repurchase. And I would expect you continue to see balance as we look to invest in the future growth of our business. I think specifically as it relates to share repurchase, we\u2019ve committed to at least being anti-dilutive with our buyback program. But we\u2019ve proven, with significant buybacks both in Q4 of last year as well as in Q2 of this year, that when appropriate, we will step up and be more aggressive.\nChris Snyder: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Matthew Niknam of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, guys. This is Nick on for Matt. Congrats on the quarter. Just two quick ones. So first, on free cash flow, came in really strong this quarter. I was just wondering if you guys could provide a little bit more color on that. And kind of how free cash flow should trend moving forward? And then just the follow-up would be, obviously, some other guys or some other companies are seeing tighter gross margins because of the supply chain issues and inflation, etcetera. And so what are we \u2013 your margins are really stable here. Is that because of the in-house fabrication? Any color there would also be really helpful? Thanks.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. So let me take those questions. First of all, with regard to our free cash, obviously, we\u2019re very, very pleased with the cash generation of the business. Cash penetration was unusually strong here in the second quarter. I think there are a couple of drivers of that. One is the increasing deferred revenue balance as a result of our push into software and services and building recurring revenue. So that\u2019s a great long-term trend. And there is one significant timing difference, which we\u2019ve already talked about. And that has to do with the variable pay. Obviously, we\u2019ve recruited that variable pay based on what was earned here in the second quarter, but that will not hit the paychecks of our employees until Q3. And so there\u2019ll be a bit of reversal of that over the course of a couple of quarters, because we expect accruals to be high here in the third quarter as well. As it looks to gross margin, we are seeing, in some cases, some increasing input costs. But as we\u2019ve said, most of our highly differentiated ICs are manufactured in-house. I think that helps shield us. I think long-term, if you look at our business, the push that we have, again towards increasing software content, increasing recurring revenue, the migration of business into selling into our customers\u2019 R&D labs, the move towards complete solutions that are more highly differentiated, all of those things are helping to drive the gross margin performance that you\u2019ve seen in this business over a number of years, right? At the time of our spin, we were in the mid to upper 50s, and now we\u2019re in the mid-60s. And so I think we\u2019ve got a lot of great momentum in that space. And as we continue to build software in our solutions portfolio, I think there is still room for further improvement.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Couillard: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. Ron, the strength in aerospace and defense was pretty impressive. Could you just talk about how you\u2019re feeling about the durability of that current momentum? And how would you characterize the degree of visibility in terms of the both funnel there relative to history?\nMark Wallace: Yes, Brandon, this is Mark. As we\u2019ve said, we\u2019ve had an ongoing focus on aerospace defense and aerospace defense, both in the U.S. and around the world. The orders that we saw during the quarter were very strong across Western Europe as we saw increased program funding. Business in Asia was up. We had several strategic wins as was mentioned earlier for 5G. So the long-term growth drivers are really remaining in place around the whole defense modernization with space and satellite with the addition of 5G. And we are continuing to see our funnels continue to grow as these investments continue, so, growth across multiple regions and strengths in the next-generation technologies as they are going to be deployed over, really many years.\nBrandon Couillard: One more in-market question...\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. One more point to Mark. The Biden administration has just released their first pass-through budget for \u201822, and it actually points to a higher number. That combined with any other potential technology spend from the administration, we view as a favorable dynamic.\nBrandon Couillard: Got it. And then just switching gears, in terms of the auto market, it\u2019s been soft for a few quarters now. Do you feel like that space is finally maybe beginning to start to turn the quarter, in terms of investments in sort of next-gen programs?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. The automotive market had a very solid quarter in quarter two and is driven by some return to normalcy for manufacturing. And I know that as the automotive end market production is projected to increase in the second half that should be a favorable dynamic for the business. But consistent with what we saw even through last year, the demand for R&D offerings in auto continues to be steady. We actually saw an uptick in that, especially around EV and AV. And our funnel for the automotive EV offerings that we have is very strong looking into the second half. We just launched solutions to solidify our EV portfolio in charging test, and we continue to see a long runway for those offerings.\nBrandon Couillard: Great, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. And now I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Jason Kary for any closing remarks.\nJason Kary: Well, thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you at the upcoming conferences and just wish you a good day. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Yes. Thank you, Ron. John, it is another quarter where we have mitigated the impact from the headwinds, as Ron said, about 3 points during the second quarter. And we pivot to other opportunities and other customers. It really exemplifies the breadth and strength of our business as well as the investments we've made in our direct sales organization there. And we're seeing strong opportunities and growth across China in semiconductor, 5G commercial space. Automotive is really starting to pick up, and then general electronics as well. So, I'm very pleased with what we've seen. We've got one more quarter in Q3 with some headwinds, but the bottom line is our business in China is strong with this broad footprint of customers. Yes, this is Mark. No, we really didn't see any evidence of that. What we saw was some \u2013 a little bit of pent-up demand from the impact of COVID last year, which we kind of expected it to somewhat offset the trade headwinds that we talked about earlier. We watch cancellations very closely. They were at a record low for the quarter, and we're seeing, again, this steady, broad demand. So we have no signs thus far that there is any material pull-in of orders. Yes, Jim, this is Mark. As I said earlier, we do watch for this, and there is really no evidence.

So, it really doesn't lend itself to that sort of double booking, if you will. If you look at semiconductors, one of our stronger segments, we see activities that are a year or more out in preparation for outfitting a new fab or growing capacity. So it makes it very difficult to see any sort of hedging or double booking. And as I said before, we really aren't seeing that occur thus far. You are welcome. Yes, Brandon, this is Mark. As we've said, we've had an ongoing focus on aerospace defense and aerospace defense, both in the U.S. and around the world. The orders that we saw during the quarter were very strong across Western Europe as we saw increased program funding. Business in Asia was up. We had several strategic wins as was mentioned earlier for 5G. So the long-term growth drivers are really remaining in place around the whole defense modernization with space and satellite with the addition of 5G. And we are continuing to see our funnels continue to grow as these investments continue, so, growth across multiple regions and strengths in the next-generation technologies as they are going to be deployed over, really many years."

            "content": "Yes. Hi, Mehdi. As we have said before, millimeter wave is a long-term opportunity for Keysight. We are already seeing a pretty steady business for millimeter wave offerings from our customers for the past few years. So, we expect it to continue to grow. Again, we are on the front-end of something that's going to play out over the next decade because of the progression in millimeter wave spectrum from 20 to 40 to 70 to 90 gigahertz. And then with 6G coming in with terahertz, so there is a big long-term roadmap that's playing out. Specific to your question on 5G, maybe I can offer a data point. If you think of the certification being a critical parameter for 5G devices, about 150 devices are being certified right now. About 30% of them have millimeter wave in it. So that paints the picture hopefully. And the total number of 5G devices right now that are being released is about 700. So, it sort of gives you maybe a framing on where we are. It's still very early days. Yes, John, it's a good question. With regard to the deployment scenarios globally, as we all know, China started to lead the 5G deployments. And with the C-band auction coming in, the major announcements from the U.S. operator referencing a roadmap to deploy more 5G in the country, we view it as a positive. We saw an uptick of our \u2013 in our business in the U.S., specifically for capabilities in the C-band this quarter, and we view the funnel and pipeline to be strong there. But again, not to get too siloed on one spectrum, because at the end of the day, our customers are looking to test for creating devices and products that cater to the global marketplace. And right now, we have 9,000 different band combinations that our customers have to test for eventually. And today, they are testing 2,000. So \u2013 and we are enabling all our customers who are staying in the lead and we feel good about our position there. Yes. So the commercial comps front, again, was broad. It covered both the wireless and wireline, so it's 5G on the wireless side and 400 gig on the wireline side as well. We also saw some recovery in our network visibility business as enterprises are planning for return to work and thinking about what that IT infrastructure spend looks like. So those all looked favorable, so generally, a very positive dynamic. Specific to the application layer, we identified a few areas around the different end market verticals and new applications to focus on about a year ago, and that's paying rich dividends. On the new application front, it's the Open RAN, where it's an open virtualized network, bringing in new customers and more players into the ecosystem. So we had strong demand for our solutions that we launched in Q1 and \u2013 Quarter one. And on the new vertical side, we gained traction with a lot of the aerospace and defense companies that are looking to invest in the DoD's 5G program. So both those are going very well. And when we look forward, and look at the funnel for both these opportunities, they are very healthy, and they are very rich with customer \u2013 strong customer collaborations that are building. Yes. I think it's band combinations. But you're right that the more frequency spectrum in a heterogeneous manner that gets deployed, the test intensity goes up. And if you think of a typical device maker or companies in the O-RAN space that are putting radio and CU components together and they have to do the testing, the amount of time they have to do the testing doesn't go up. And so essentially, some of the COVID restrictions, of social distancing and all that, essentially means that customers have \u2013 are looking at ramping up capacity for the future. But it's a steady demand that gives us confidence in our long-term outlook for the business. That's just one dimension of capacity. The other ones being all of the complexity associated with Release 15 deployments and now with Release 16 ramping up, we have new capabilities to offer such as what you saw with our press release with MediaTek this quarter. Yes. One more point to Mark. The Biden administration has just released their first pass-through budget for \u201822, and it actually points to a higher number. That combined with any other potential technology spend from the administration, we view as a favorable dynamic. Yes. The automotive market had a very solid quarter in quarter two and is driven by some return to normalcy for manufacturing. And I know that as the automotive end market production is projected to increase in the second half that should be a favorable dynamic for the business. But consistent with what we saw even through last year, the demand for R&D offerings in auto continues to be steady. We actually saw an uptick in that, especially around EV and AV. And our funnel for the automotive EV offerings that we have is very strong looking into the second half. We just launched solutions to solidify our EV portfolio in charging test, and we continue to see a long runway for those offerings."

            "content": "Thank you, Jason and thank you everyone for joining us. Keysight delivered a record quarter and we are entering the second half of the year with momentum. Our broad portfolio of differentiated solutions continues to drive growth across a diverse set of growing markets. Today, I will focus my comments on three key headlines. First, we delivered outstanding Q2 results with all-time record orders, revenue and free cash flow. Second, Keysight is enabling leading-edge disruptive innovation around the world. Our solutions have significant differentiation and contribute significant value to customers, which is fueling our growth for the long term. Third, while we are managing longer lead times and component availability, our leading market position, strong customer relationships and supply chain resiliency gives us the confidence in our ability to deliver on our commitments. Now, let's take a deeper look across our second quarter performance across both business segments. Record orders of $1.3 billion grew 22%. Revenue grew 36% to $1.2 billion, which was an all-time high. We delivered second quarter gross margin of 64%, operating margin of 26% and earnings of $1.44, which was above the high end of our guidance and represents 85% year-over-year earnings growth. We also achieved record free cash flow of $369 million. Over the last 12 months, Keysight generated just over $1 billion of free cash flow that we've deployed through approximately $500 million in acquisitions and $455 million in share repurchases. We continue to be active and disciplined in our capital deployment. Second quarter strength was broad-based with double-digit order and revenue growth across all markets and regions. Outstanding results by both business segments demonstrate the power of Keysight's diversified portfolio in 5G and beyond. Our Electronic Industrial Solutions Group achieved its third consecutive quarter of record revenue with strong double-digit order and revenue growth in general electronics, semiconductor and automotive.  The breadth of our contributions across multiple industries is exemplified by our double-digit order and revenue growth in our general electronics business. With ongoing investment in broad digital transformation, including advanced consumer electronics, digital healthcare and industrial IoT, Keysight is enabling innovation and capturing technology inflections for the IoT ecosystem. Strong demand for our semiconductor solutions drove record orders and revenue. Customer investment in advanced technology nodes remains high, while capacity is expanding for mature processes to address surging global semiconductor demands. In automotive, record orders resulted from improved macro conditions and increasing investments in EV and AV technologies. Keysight solutions portfolio for the automotive market continues to expand with new advanced technologies such as AC power emulation, millimeter wave radar, power semiconductor technology, automotive ethernet, C-V2X and cybersecurity software systems. As the reinvention of automotive ecosystems continues, Keysight is enabling the disruptive innovation of new mobility technologies. Our Communications Solutions Group achieved record orders and delivered double-digit order and revenue growth in commercial communications and aerospace defense and government. Aerospace, defense and government revenue grew 46%, driven by strong demand in space, satellite, signal monitoring, 5G and early 6G research applications. Keysight's engagement with key industry players remains strong. We recently enabled a large prime contractors' first test bed and have secured multiple 5G solutions wins in the aerospace, defense and government markets. Commercial Communications orders and revenue both grew double digits, driven by the ongoing investments in 5G and 400-gig, 800-gig Ethernet solutions for data centers. As 5G progresses and deployments drive sustained investment, we are uniquely positioned to capture the opportunities ahead as the ecosystem scales. Recent engagements include a broadening set of new customers as well as key industry players such as NEC, Fujitsu and MediaTek.  We continue to maximize the 5G lifecycle opportunity and lead the industry with differentiated 5G solutions. In addition, the success of our application layer strategy is reflected in the strong demand for new technologies such as O-RAN and business expansion in new end-to-end verticals. Our ability to provide complete solutions for network protocol test, security and visibility is enabling us to solve many challenges across the industry.  In another area of disruption, we continue to advance our long-term initiative to enable the quantum revolution. We are growing our quantum engagements with key customers worldwide. We also expanded our quantum solutions portfolio this quarter with the acquisition of Quantum Benchmark, which brings deep expertise in the performance validation software for quantum computing. Keysight's software-centric solutions in higher-value services continue to drive differentiation and recurring revenue growth. For the second quarter in a row, software and services each delivered double-digit order and revenue growth. Beyond innovation, execution and financial discipline, Keysight's culture has long embraced corporate social responsibility. We believe our focus on climate and diversity provides us with a competitive advantage. We recently published our annual CSR report, which includes progress towards our prior goals and the announcement of our commitment to achieving net zero emissions in the company operations by 2040. We are working to set interim science-based targets to ensure our progress towards this goal. Diversity and inclusion are also embodied in our Keysight leadership model. As a CEO priority, we have specific goals and actions that will be tracked by our leadership team and the Board of Directors. Diversity and inclusion brief will be published this month that describes our longstanding D&I philosophy as well as the details of our strategies and goals. While there is more work to do, Keysight remains steadfast in our commitment to CSR and building a better planet. As we look ahead, we are encouraged by the strong demand for our differentiated solutions while managing the longer lead times and component availability constraints. Our in-house high-performance semiconductor fab and the strength of our order fulfillment team are helping us manage these near-term supply challenges and give us confidence in our ability to navigate them entering the second half of this year. In summary, Keysight is enabling disruptive innovation across multiple waves of technology with a decades-long runway ahead of us. Our execution in the face of many dynamic challenges this past year is a testament to the Keysight leadership model, our employees and the breadth and depth of our customers. Now, I would like to turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail. Hi, this is Ron. As you know, in the last quarter, we exceeded our revenue guidance. And you have seen our guide for the next quarter, very pleased with the performance and how we have been able to deliver the revenue despite what's going on in the world. Of course, we see some COVID manufacturing decreases in capacity as well as some supply chain components shortages. However, we planned ahead. We fought for those. And the most important part is that when you look at custom ICs, which have a very, very long lead time for many folks in the industry we have an onsite fab that creates and produces all of our custom ICs. So that enables us to basically have complete control of that supply chain for the critical custom parts. We are very confident in the guide that we have. But there is no doubt that we have built backlog and our order book is strong. So, as the world situation unravels, we could increase revenue even more and more in the future. Thanks very much, John. And please note that the comp that we are talking about, the variable comp is for all employees in Keysight and that is paid. One big factor is revenue growth, and you saw our revenue growth number, which is driving that near the extreme limit. No, our manufacturing is very well distributed. We have the largest test and measurement factory in the world in Penang, Malaysia, but we also have facilities that do development, early production runs as well as produce certain products in Europe as well as in the U.S., but the bulk of it is overseas. We don't manufacture anything of scale in China. So, that's not an issue to us. And Penang seems to be in a very good position to capitalize on any type of regional shift. No. We actually saw strong order results and order growth as well as revenue growth. Mark will tell you a little bit more about it. We did have about 3 points of headwinds from Huawei, where this is really the second to last quarter that we expect to have that. But despite that, we had very strong order and revenue growth. And I will let Mark, our Head of Sales give you a little more color. Yes, John, I'd just like to point out the fact that Xiaomi was effectively \u2013 the trade restrictions were loosened, is a positive sign for us. Not so much the account of Xiaomi, but the fact that there is some progress that is being made. You are welcome. Hi, Rick, this is Ron. Our assumption is that our book-to-bill will be about 1. And we have strong backlog, and we expect to exit Q3 with strong backlog. It's also worthwhile to note that if you look at software and you look at services, not only do they both have great double-digit order and double-digit revenue growth. We've seen more and more ARR, which is going to go into the backlog and let's put it this way, slow a little bit how that peels off, but it will provide a great consistency of earnings as we go forward. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Ron and hello everyone. As Ron mentioned, the Keysight team delivered another outstanding quarter and better-than-expected results as robust demand for our differentiated solutions and continued macro recovery resulted in strong growth across all regions. Second quarter revenue of $1.22 billion was above the high end of our guidance range and grew 36% or 33% on a core basis versus a soft compare due to COVID-related disruption. Q2 revenue growth was driven by broad strength across all markets and geographies as the Keysight team navigated macro dynamics and supply chain constraints. We achieved second quarter orders of $1.332 billion, up 22% or 19% on a core basis. Turning to our operational results for Q2, we reported gross margin of 64%, which increased 170 basis points. Operating expenses of $467 million were well managed, resulting in operating margin of 26%. As discussed last quarter, variable pay expense increased approximately $30 million sequentially as a result of higher revenue growth and operating margin. We achieved net income of $270 million and delivered $1.44 in earnings per share, which was above the high end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 187 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments, our Communications Solutions Group achieved second quarter revenue of $877 million, up 34% while delivering gross margin of 65% and operating margin of 25%. Commercial Communications orders and revenue in the second quarter were all-time highs. Revenue of $606 million increased 30%, driven by continued investment across the 5G lifecycle. Aerospace, defense and government revenue of $271 million grew 46%, resulting from strong demand across all regions, primarily in the U.S. and Asia-Pacific, followed by a strong recovery in Europe. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated record revenue of $344 million, up 42% or 37% on a core basis. Order and revenue strength was notable across all regions, particularly in Asia-Pacific. Semiconductor, general electronics measurement and automotive solutions orders and revenue all grew strong double digit. EISG reported gross margin of 64% and operating margin of 28%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended our second quarter with approximately $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and reported cash flow from operations of $402 million and free cash flow of $369 million or 30% of revenue. Our capital allocation priorities are unchanged and are focused on investments in organic growth, value-creating acquisitions and share repurchases. Under our share repurchase authorization during the quarter, we acquired 1.59 million shares on the open market at an average price of $138.36 for a total consideration of $220 million. Now turning to our outlook and guidance, we expect third quarter 2021 revenue to be in the range of $1.205 billion to $1.225 billion, which represents 20% revenue growth at the midpoint. We expect Q3 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.39 to $1.45 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 187 million shares. In closing, we are entering the second half of the year with strong momentum. We are pleased with our operational execution and remain confident in our ability to drive growth and deliver on our commitments. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A. Yes, Mehdi. Hey, thanks for the question. So yes, you are correct. And as I had indicated last quarter, we were expecting a very sizable sequential increase in our variable pay expense in Q2 relative to Q1. Given that one of the primary drivers of that payout is organic revenue growth and we had the soft revenue comp a year ago because of the COVID disruption. So, we saw about a $30 million sequential increase in variable pay as a result of that. And then I will hand it over to Satish and he can address your millimeter wave question. Yes. So, I mean this quarter wasn't unusual. Obviously, we delivered 36% revenue growth. That's the total. There was \u2013 some of that was, it was inorganic. But with those high levels of revenue growth, it drives our variable compensation towards the high-end of the \u2013 of what is possible. I think as you look forward next quarter, we still have a reasonably soft comp. We are guiding into the kind of low 20% range, which is still quite aggressive growth and it's going to see variable comp high again in Q3, not quite as high as Q2, but still quite elevated. And then we start to get to more normalized comps during the quarter and a little bit more of a return to normalized levels. Yes. Mark, I don't have a specific update for you to that prior number. But obviously, we exceeded the high end of our guidance range here in the second quarter. And you've seen our guide for Q3. So, I think at the margin, things are trending a little bit better than they were when we made that statement 3 months ago. But I don't have a specific update for you at this point in time. Yes. We did a modification to our pension schemes in the Netherlands and had some settlement expense as a result as we transferred those liabilities to an insurance company. And David, if I could just add on. I like your characterization of the vertically integrated supply chain potentially making us a little bit less susceptible to some of the supply constraints than maybe others are facing. As I sit and look at it, the challenges with regard to movement control and social distancing do make it a challenge to add capacity during these times. And so I've talked about in the past, our seasonality being more muted at least through the first part of the year. I think those things are going to really serve to keep that kind of muted seasonality in place really through the end of this fiscal year. Yes. I think the most important thing at this point, we feel like we are doing a good \u2013 I am sorry, I didn't have my microphone on. Sorry about that. I said I think the most important factor at this point is that we feel like we're doing a good job meeting the needs of our customers and getting them the product that they need in the time lines at which they need it. And while we're not immune to some of the supply chain constraints that are out there, I think we're doing a good job managing them. We're benefiting from having to vertically integrated supply chain. And we are making investments to add capacity. Obviously, our revenues are going to be up substantially year-over-year, but not just because of the soft comps, very substantially over 2019 levels as well, and we will continue to make the investments necessary that \u2013 to get products into the hands of customers. It's pointing north of $1 billion now. So that's great, great, yes, position to be in. That's correct. I think you've seen a pretty balanced use of capital from us. As we mentioned in our prepared comments, we generated $1 billion of cash over the last four quarters. We spent $500 million on M&A, just under $500 million on share repurchase. And I would expect you continue to see balance as we look to invest in the future growth of our business. I think specifically as it relates to share repurchase, we've committed to at least being anti-dilutive with our buyback program. But we've proven, with significant buybacks both in Q4 of last year as well as in Q2 of this year, that when appropriate, we will step up and be more aggressive. Yes. So let me take those questions. First of all, with regard to our free cash, obviously, we're very, very pleased with the cash generation of the business. Cash penetration was unusually strong here in the second quarter. I think there are a couple of drivers of that. One is the increasing deferred revenue balance as a result of our push into software and services and building recurring revenue. So that's a great long-term trend. And there is one significant timing difference, which we've already talked about. And that has to do with the variable pay. Obviously, we've recruited that variable pay based on what was earned here in the second quarter, but that will not hit the paychecks of our employees until Q3. And so there'll be a bit of reversal of that over the course of a couple of quarters, because we expect accruals to be high here in the third quarter as well. As it looks to gross margin, we are seeing, in some cases, some increasing input costs. But as we've said, most of our highly differentiated ICs are manufactured in-house. I think that helps shield us. I think long-term, if you look at our business, the push that we have, again towards increasing software content, increasing recurring revenue, the migration of business into selling into our customers' R&D labs, the move towards complete solutions that are more highly differentiated, all of those things are helping to drive the gross margin performance that you've seen in this business over a number of years, right? At the time of our spin, we were in the mid to upper 50s, and now we're in the mid-60s. And so I think we've got a lot of great momentum in that space. And as we continue to build software in our solutions portfolio, I think there is still room for further improvement."

Our consistent performance illustrates the strength of our differentiated solutions, broad-based momentum across diverse end markets and the durability of our business model. Today, I'll focus my comments on three key headlines. First, we achieved record first quarter orders driven by growth across all regions despite China trade headwinds. Second, strong execution by the Keysight team delivered revenue and earnings growth above guidance. And third, we entered the year with solid momentum across multiple end markets and confidence in our revenue and earnings growth trajectory for the year. Despite a short term expectation of elevated expenses from variable compensation, which is due to the high near term revenue growth, we expect to achieve mid to high teens earnings growth in Fiscal 2021. Now let's take a deeper look into our first quarter results. We delivered record first quarter orders of $1.2 billion, which again exceeded revenue and grew 7%. First quarter revenue grew 8% to $1.2 billion. As previously discussed, we faced strong year-over-year headwinds in the first quarter due to China trade restrictions, adjusting for this impact both orders and revenue grew solid double digits. We continue to make strong progress towards our long-term financial targets with consistent execution and enabled by the strengthen discipline of the Keysight leadership model. We delivered first quarter gross margin of 64%, operating margin at 27%, which increased 210 basis points and free cash flow of $267 million. Turning to our markets, aerospace, defense and government achieved record first quarter orders and revenue 20% revenue growth was driven by continued investment in electromagnetic spectrum operations, space and the new commercial technologies like 5G and early 6G research. In commercial communications, we achieved all-time record orders in total, as well as for 5G, while revenue declined 3%. Adjusting to the transit impact of unfavorable trade restrictions, commercial communications orders grew double digits and revenue grew high single digits. Strength was driven by ongoing global 5G deployments and the rollout of new 5G devices and continued investment in 400G and 800G Ethernet for data centers. Keysight's end-to-end solutions portfolio is enabling the rapid progression of new technologies, both in the wireless and wired systems of the communications network, where our value proposition remains strong. Keysight continues to lead the industry in 5G powered by years of close collaboration with market makers in standards bodies. We are advancing our 5G strategy to capture emerging opportunities in the application layer as momentum builds ahead of deployments in 2021. We make great progress this quarter as broad industries embrace our 5G platform and new applications emerge. For example, O-RAN continues to be an area of active investment for our customers. We recently introduced a suite of end-to-end solutions for O-RAN vendors and mobile operators. Our solutions are used to verify the interoperability, performance, conformance, and security of multi-vendor 5G networks. We also announced strategic partnerships in the expanding O-RAN space with industry-leaders like Xilinx, Radisys, ArrayComm and Altiostar. In addition, we continue to accelerate Keysight's capabilities to provide industry-leading solutions through strategic acquisitions. In Q1, we acquired [indiscernible], a leader in wireless test and measurement solutions for protocol decoding and interoperability. [Indiscernible] offerings complement our end-to-end solutions portfolio, providing problem-solving tools that extend from inside the wireless network, out through over-the-air analytics. Record revenue for Electronic Industrial Solutions Group was driven by double-digit growth in semiconductors and general electronic solutions. Record semiconductor revenue was fueled by ongoing investment in next generation process technologies, bolstered by new customer wins in China as we successfully redeployed our salesforce to capitalize on new opportunities. General electronic strength reflected continued economic recovery with growth across all regions and improvement in the advanced research education market. In automotive, despite ongoing macro challenges, end demand is stabilizing as strategic investments in advanced technologies have accelerated in Asia and in the Americas. In Europe, we continue to expand our presence and recently announced a collaboration with ElringKlinger, one of the world's leading Cisco partners to the automotive industry. They chose Keysight's battery test solution to advance e-mobility in the field of battery development for electric vehicles. Software and services each delivered double-digit order and revenue growth. Combined, they were approximately one-third of total Keysight revenue contributing significantly to our software-centric solution strategy and differentiation and further strengthen the durability of our business model with increasing recurring revenue. In summary, I'd like to thank our Keysight employees around the world who have reacted dynamically to a challenging environment to deliver exceptional results for our customers and shareholders. We are pleased with our first quarter performance and encouraged by the broad-based momentum across our markets entering the year. Now, I would like to turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail.\nNeil Dougherty: Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. As Ron mentioned, the Keysight team delivered an outstanding first quarter as continued economic recovery drove a steady improvement in demand across all major regions. First Quarter revenue of $1,180 billion was above the high end of our guidance range and grew 8% or 6% on a core basis. Q1 revenue growth was driven by broad strength across multiple end markets and geographies. Total Keysight orders again exceeded revenue in Q1 with a boat to build just over one. We achieved first quarter orders of $1,223 billion, of 7% or 5% on a core basis, successfully overcoming increased trade restrictions. Turning to operational results for Q1. Reported gross margin of 64% and operating expenses of $439 million were well-managed, resulting in an operating margin of 27%, an increase of 210 basis points year-over-year. We achieve net income of $270 million and delivered $1.43 in earnings per share, which is well above the high end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 188 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communication Solutions Group generated record first quarter revenue of $852 million, up 4% was delivering gross margin of 65% and operating margin of 26%. In Q1, commercial communications achieved all-time record total and 5G quarterly orders. First Quarter revenue declined 3% to $558 million, with commercial communications disproportionately impacted by the China trade restrictions. Aerospace, defense and government achieved record first quarter revenue of $294 million, an increase of 20% versus a strong compare in Q1 last year. Growth was driven by robust year-end spending across all major regions. In the U.S., growth was driven by prime contractor spending, offsetting slightly lower spending from direct government customers as we saw less than expected disruption from the U.S. administration transition. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated record revenue of $328 million of 18% or 13% on a core basis. Orders in revenue for our semiconductor and general electronics measurement solutions broke through double digits for the second quarter in a row, with strong revenue growth across all regions, particularly in Asia Pacific. EISD reported gross margin of 63% and operating margin of 29%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our first quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents and reported a cash flow from operations of $295 million and free cash flow of $267 million or 23% of revenue. Under a share repurchase authorization during the quarter, we acquired approximately 137,000 shares on the open market and an average price of $145.14 for a total consideration of $20 million. Before moving to our guidance, I'd like to remind everyone of my comments last quarter in which I stated that flexible spending and variable compensation is expected to increase in FY 2021, with Q2 expenses seasonally higher than all other quarters. The principal driver is variable compensation, which is a function of organic revenue growth and operating margin. Just as we flexed expenses down last year in response to a decline in revenue, we will flex up this year particularly in quarters with soft revenue comps, notably Q2 and Q3. We believe our variable compensation is an important element of not only our flexible cost structure, but our human capital philosophy in which employees are engaged and participate in both the ups and downs of the business. Now turning to our outlook and guidance. We expect second quarter 2021 revenue to be in the range of $1,190 billion to $1,210 billion, which represents 34% revenue growth at the midpoint. We expect Q2 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.29 to $1.35 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 188 million shares. In closing we're entering the year with the order momentum, a solid backlog position and strong operational execution. We are pleased with the trajectory of our business and expect to achieve mid to high teens earnings growth for the full fiscal year. With that I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.\nJason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Sideris, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A?\nOperator: Yes. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Rick Eastman with Baird.\nRichard Eastman: Yes, good afternoon. Could you perhaps maybe just kind of walk through a little bit of the operating leverage that we really saw in both Commercial Communication Solutions Group? But I'm kind of looking at the out profit number of 170. Is that with the gross margin maybe down? Is that primarily all mix or maybe give us a little bit of a feel for that. And maybe the same question around EISG. Just significant operating leverage there. I'm curious how much of this mix versus volume. That's a new word for it?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes, Rick, This is Neil. I think you've hit on it right. Q4 was a very favorable -- if you're looking sequentially -- Q4 was a very favorable gross margin quarter for us as we really significantly ramped production after the COVID disruptions of Q2 and Q3. And I think just the nature of us responding to immediate customer demand for urgent delivery, kind of shifted the mix in a favorable direction in the fourth quarter. I think what we saw in the first quarter was the return to more normalized mix. It aligns with kind of the quarters leading it up to Q4 as well as slightly lower volume. And I think that that comment is basically true across both the Communications Group as well as EISG. There's nothing really specific in either one of the two businesses.\nRon Nersesian: And you also look at the long-term model that we outlined at analysts day for FY 2023, obviously, our performance shows very strong against that and we have no doubt that we'll be able to deliver to that level going forward.\nRichard Eastman: Great. And then just a quick question, maybe if I could. I'm surprised to see the order growth and it basically looks like you held your backlog up, kind of in the low 20s year-over-year -- 20% year-over-year. I think my math quickly says 23% year-over-year on the backlog side. I know you spoke to orders being strong across geographies, across product lines. Is there any particular place that you might flag whether it be geography, or between the two business segments where you were pleasantly surprised with your order growth in the quarter?\nRon Nersesian: I'll mention a couple and then I'll let Mark chime in with a little more detail. First of all, if you look at China, our China orders were down 6% and we expected them to be down much more because of the effects of the China trade restrictions with Huawei. If you were to strip out Huawei, we had 19% order growth from our other Chinese customers. And as Huawei comes out of the compare in the past, we're very, very pleasantly surprised and pleased with that performance. Our Chinese salesforce was redeployed from the accounts where they cannot sell into other accounts within the geography and we were to do that almost instantaneously to produce the type of the type of results that we did do. So that was clearly one. India was also very strong. Japan was very strong -- both of those well into double digits, as well as Europe, which also hit double digit performance. Mark, you may want to add a couple more regional comments?\nMark Wallace: Sure. Ron covered it really well, Rick, but I would just add that about half our growth in China overcoming the headwinds was from new customers. Again, showing how we're executing and rotating to both new opportunities and new customers and we want additional business with our existing customers, whether that be around 5G to some of the long tail of customers, 400-gigabit Tier 2 customers. And I was very pleased with semiconductor, very strong growth again, both from existing large customers, as well as acquiring two new fabulous semiconductor customers in the quarter in China. Very strong results in Japan for 5G and aerospace defense. And then if you look at Europe, it really was a story of this very broad demand across multiple end markets. We had growth across most of our countries across Europe. And it really goes to show the strength of our portfolio and the depth of our penetration into all these end markets.\nRon Nersesian: Let me add just a couple more comments, Rick. One, our general electronics business was up in orders over 20% and that's a really good sign. That talks about the macro environment in the industrial markets. So, we're very pleased to see that and also our overall corporate strategy and moving to more software-centric solutions, which requires more software and more services. Both software and services. Both grew double digits in orders again this quarter.\nRichard Eastman: Very good. Congrats. Thank you.\nRon Nersesian: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citigroup Investment. Your line is open.\nJim Suva: Thank you very much and really good job on the results in an unclear uncertain environment. My question is a little bit more, just to help us out looking forward. Not so much on the trade and tariff stuff, but recently the supply chain with the freezing in Texas and chip shortages, can you talk to us a little bit about do you have some buffer chips that you're okay for the next three to six months? Or are you tempering your outlook a little bit? I'm just kind of a little bit concerned about the procurement cycle. Seems to have this additional variable. And then my second question is on OpEx. How should we be thinking about that as hopefully COVID becomes behind us at some point? Thank you so much.\nRon Nersesian: Sure, I'll cover the procurement piece and then I'll let Neil talk a little bit more on the OpEx formula going forward. As far as procurement we have taken into account the long lead time cycles that we're seeing from semiconductor providers, as well as the other environmental impacts that we're seeing around the world. As a matter of fact, we have just put out guidance for the midpoint is at $1.2 billion for the next quarter and that takes into account the semi-cycles. We do hope though, that things don't get worse from the standpoint of COVID -- another surge, although we feel very confident that we are in good shape to come out with this guidance, which was above the street consensus for the next quarter.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes, and, Jim, your second question was kind of forward-looking as are related to OpEx. And I made some comments in my prepared remarks. Certainly I think our underlying investment levels are stable and are likely to be stable, going forward. But we do expect some short-term increases over the course of the next couple of quarters -- well, not the only impact, by far the biggest driver of that increase is our variable pay program. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks last quarter, Q2 expenses are expected to be seasonally higher than all other quarters this year. The principal drivers the bounce back of variable compensation relative to last year. That variable compensation is a function of both organic revenue growth and operating margin and in quarters where we have soft revenue comps and therefore higher revenue growth like we will see in Q2 and in Q3 of this year. Our variable compensation is going to be materially higher. So, as you saw we guided very strong revenue growth of 34% in Q2 and expect the sequential increases results in our variable compensation program of more than $30 million relative to Q1. And since all of our non-executive employees are participants in that variable pay program, that increase is split roughly equally between cost of sales, R&D, and SG&A. Specifically impacting the OpEx lines that you asked about. But again, important to note that the underlying investment level is stable and once we get past Q3, our variable pay and our expense levels are going to return to more normalized levels.\nJim Suva: Thank you, and congratulations again, to you and your team. Thank you.\nRon Nersesian: Thanks, Jim. And just to finish that up, if you take a look at our overall model, we think it's a short-term effect and that's why for one of the few times we've guided out for the whole year producing EPS growth in the teens as we had mentioned in our prepared remarks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from a line of John Marchetti with Stifel. Your line is open.\nJohn Marchetti: Thanks very much. I was wondering if you could just take a moment and talk about some of the strength that you continue to see in 5G? How much of that maybe is coming from new customers, as you sort of hinted at in the comment about the older strength? And how much of it is maybe moving into different variants of 5G? Whether it's standalone, versus non, or Millimeter Wave versus sub-6G?\nRon Nersesian: Satish, feel free to answer this question.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes, I'll take that, Ron. I think one of the effects in 5G that we're seeing as deployments of scaling is the broader interest in deploying this technology across different end market verticals. And that as a result of expanding the ecosystem, as we have talked about this quarter, we added over 100 new customers to our 5G platform. So that's that continues to be strong. At the highest level, I think we've stated its growth across all regions, for 5G and all parts of the ecosystem. So, it is broad and we see sort of four teams. Right? You look at the R&D investment cycle, there's new teams such as [indiscernible] and O-RAN that are capturing interest, manufacturing opportunities, scale as 5g deploys, and it's profitable manufacturing as we have talked about as select manufacturing strategy. And -- is the interest in this technology from new verticals such as aerospace, defense, automotive, and industrial. And finally we see this long term steady push to commercialize Millimeter Wave as we've talked about is a long term dynamic for our business, which has got an upgrade pattern and to feed this momentum, we've just announced over 30 new product introductions this quarter and we feel confident about the projections based on everything we see in the industry.\nJohn Marchetti: And maybe just as a follow up there, Satish, you guys have mentioned in the past, you think this market sort of peaked out in 2022 or 2023 for you. I'm curious if that's still the case, or if you think with some of these newer things coming on, that actually extends it out a little bit?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes, I think based on what we have seen in the past, I think we've sort of seen an industry CapEx projected to peak due to the Millimeter Wave parts of 5G being deployed. However, for our business, in comms, we have a broad portfolio of both wired and wireless and the end-to-end portfolio that we have created, not only has sort of a poor incident effect, but as Ron referenced, higher software content, higher services, so we're much more plugged in and able to monetize the lifecycle value from our early, lead.\nJohn Marchetti: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from one of Samik Chatterjee with J.P. Morgan, your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Joker [ph] on for Samik. So my first question is just around aerospace, and electronic industrial business again. Obviously, you had two great quarters of execution in a row. I guess how should we think of the sustainability, the momentum in both those segments? And what is driving your content?\nMark Wallace: Ron, should I take\u2026\nRon Nersesian: Sure.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: As far as aerospace, defense is concerned, very pleased record orders and record revenues. And as we mentioned before, the strength is coming across all the regions, tracking the COVID recovery or macro recovery. And that's probably a common dynamic between our aerospace, defense business and the general electronics business in our industrial segment. Specifically, on the aerospace defense, our portfolios focus on defense modernization, in particular around these new teams continue to position us well. The passage of the NDAA or the budget in the United States in December, we feel cautiously optimistic about the outlook for that business as we look forward. And we also have a pretty healthy, healthy backlog into the business. So, we continue to expect strong growth the next couple of quarters. As far as the EISG business is concerned, again, broad strength from our general electronics business, but also semiconductor where we're seeing increased investments driven by the advanced nodes and the China IC investment that Mark referenced earlier.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it.\nRon Nersesian: I would also comment that different form factors are contributing to that such as our modular solutions, had a very strong quarter, as well as software and services that have been mentioned earlier, all play into this general electronics market and the overall EISG market.\nUnidentified Analyst: I appreciate the color. And then just a quick follow up. You, guys kind of went into detail about the 5G and the momentum that you're seeing there. I'm just curious, can we get an update on how you're seeing the declines play out on the 4G side? I know last year, because COVID, there was obviously a big impact there, but are we seeing declines starting to moderate on the 4G side?\nMark Wallace: Yes, sequentially. 4G has been flat quarter-over-quarter for us and we're very pleased with the uptake in 5G as I referenced. It was a record quarter and was and if you include 5G and 4G together, we've grown at year-over-year and sequentially quarter-over-quarter. We feel we feel good about the portfolio and I did mention that we've launched 30 new products this quarter to feed that momentum in the market.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Appreciate the color, guys. Congrats on the results.\nRon Nersesian: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is open.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. One follow with Satish. Can you please help me understand the mix of a 400-gig and 800-gig ethernet as a mixer for overall communication sector group? And how do you see that trending especially as the volume brand for 400-gig plays out in the second half? And for Neil, it would be great if you could give us some reference. I think there was a mention of software and services accounting for one-third of the revenue. Can you give us a qualitative or quantitative assessment of what the mix of software is? Where was it a year ago? And how should we be thinking about the software mix looking forward?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes, I'll maybe start with the 400-gig question, Mehdi. As we have really done very well with the wireline technology evolutions over the number of years and last year was a pretty strong year for 400-gig, I think we've referenced it on calls. And what we saw this quarter was a broader adaption of 400-gig technologies, still heavily driven by data center demand, which is adapting, I should say, the 400-gig at scale. We saw increased spend from Tier 2 and long tail customers in Asia in particular and we expect as the 400-gig economies of scale and maturity occur, that more of that demand will start to shift in the telco or Metro opportunities. So, we're still on the frontend of that. I would also say that on 800-gig, the investments are in early R&D, which we expect to play out in in production in 18 to 24 months. So, we're engaged early. Just this quarter, we announced the full suite of R&D offerings for 800-gig as well, which positions us well to benefit from not only the wireless on the 5G side, but also from the wireline opportunities in our commercial communications business. As far as the software, I'll kick it off, and maybe Neil can make a comment. We see for our double-digit growth in software coming from our pathway design franchise and from the 5G solutions, which as we have referenced before, have a higher percentage of software content with them. We're also seeing renewals for subscription contracts become important to our 5G growth, which I think helps us with the ARR. I'll just pass it off to Neil.\nNeil Dougherty: Just in terms of the relative size of software, we've said previously that software is approximately 20% of total revenues. And as the Satish has mentioned, it continues to outgrow the broader business, growing double digits again this quarter. So that mix is increasing slowly over time and we expect that it will continue to do so as we continue this migration towards more complete solutions with higher software content.\nMehdi Hosseini: If I may, just a quick follow up for Neil here. If you execute and deliver the software growth above the top line, could that be potentially a source of gross margin upside that could potentially drive EPS growth this year towards the mid to high teens?\nNeil Dougherty: Certainly, over the long run, we see increasing software content as a driver of gross margin. I think you've seen that over the past couple of years as we've added software to our portfolio, as well as taking other actions to drive our gross margins northward. You know, the, the mix shift, it's not dramatic. It's slow and steady over time. So, hard for me to draw a direct link between a mixed shift over the next couple of quarters and immediate EPS increases, there's a lot of things that are going to go into -- they're going to play a role in determining that level over the course of the next several quarters. But generally speaking, yes, our software growth is absolutely contributing to our gross margin improvement over time.\nMehdi Hosseini: Thank you.\nRon Nersesian: Well also, so if you're looking for the short term, or big orders, where to go ahead and where to exceed our projections, when you take a look at our incrementals, we have delivered to our model and then some pretty much consistently over the last five years. And we expect to continue to do so. Ms: Yes. And I was just trying to understand how conservative is that method, high-teen EPS growth? And how should we think about upsides from there?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: I think you can see in our guide that we're very encouraged by the market and our performance in the business on the top line. We do have some short term expense pressures over the couple of quarters that will put some pressure on EPS relative to normal incremental, over the quarter or where the incrementals would otherwise have been over the course of the next several quarters. But by Q4, we're kind of lapped those comps than the impact that they have on our business where we return to kind of more normalized levels.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay, thanks, guys.\nRon Nersesian: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs, your line is open.\nMark Delaney: Yes. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. I was hoping to dig more into the full-year EPS growth commentary of mid to high teens in recognizing the very good or that the company just reported for the quarter. If my math is right, the implied second half EPS growth is relatively flattish to slightly higher, year-over-year, 5% or 10% or so. And yes, I understand the higher variable comp, which makes a lot of sense and is good news. But is there anything else besides the variable comp that you're trying to factor into the implied EPS growth guidance that you're discussing today? Thanks.\nNeil Dougherty: The only thing I mentioned earlier is that, our Q4 gross margins in last year were extraordinarily favorable. Right? Not only do we have the highest revenue quarter we'd had by a pretty significant margin, we had significantly higher gross margins than we'd ever had previously. So, we are going to have a tough year-over-your comp in the fourth quarter that is going to factor into that ultimate equation as well.\nMark Delaney: That's helpful and make sense. My question was on the 5G order strength and the strength that the companies have seen within Millimeter Wave. Can you describe to what extent you're seeing some increased adaption of Millimeter Wave in different geographies and perhaps the opportunity for Millimeter Wave deployments to help your business in China? Thank you.\nRon Nersesian: Yes, thank you. I think as we have referenced before, the Millimeter Wave opportunity is a long term one for us. We see a very steady increase in interest from our customers. At this point, heavily driven by the U.S. bans. You can think of 20 gigahertz to 40 gigahertz sort of spectrum. And with new spectrum coming online, the 66 gigahertz to 90 gigahertz range, I think that tends to sow the seeds for the runway. We're talking about China's 2022 Winter Olympics, we expect it to be a push with a showcase of Millimeter Wave. So those are clearly drivers. And then if you look even further out, you start thinking about some early research occurring the terahertz space. So again, this is a very long-term opportunity. Keysight's got a competitive differentiation. We have talked about this and we're well-positioned to address this. Currently, we're working with customers to solve some critical challenges in commercializing Millimeter Wave like in advanced beam management, peak higher data rates, 10 gigabits per second and above. It's a long term dynamic and we are well-positioned there.\nMark Delaney: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long from Barclays. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good afternoon. This is Peter [ph] on for Tim. Congratulations on the results. On CSG, just again, as we see the 400G cycle coming closer, could you help us parse out what that has meant for you between your wireline hardware business versus the network and ability side and the essence of what inning we are in that cycle from that testing measure perspective? And then also on A&D. How should we think about what this very strong Q1 here implies for Q2 seasonality out? Just going off this very strong pace?\nRon Nersesian: I didn't hear your question. Could you please repeat it?\nUnidentified Analyst: I'm sorry. Is this better?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. If you could slow down just a touch. That would help.\nUnidentified Analyst: Sure. I was just asking on CSG. Just as we see the 400G cycle coming closer, I was wondering if you could help us parse out what that has meant for you between the wireline hardware side versus the network visibility side? And do you have a sense of what inning we are in that cycle from a test measurement perspective? And then just a follow up on A&D, was wondering how we should think about Q2 seasonality, given the starting strong Q1 base?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I'll take the aerospace, defense first. Again, record orders and given the comps from the favorable comms, we have for the next couple of quarters. We expect strong revenue performance in the business and our focus areas around defense modernization are also aligned with some of the strategic priorities of the governments around the world. So we feel good about where we are in the business. With regard to your question on wireline, the entire portfolio of wireline involves the focus in three areas if you think of it. The focus on high speed evolutions, 400-gig, 800-gig, terahertz and terabit ethernet and beyond. And security as a second theme, which is gaining customer interest. And the third area is on visibility. Clearly, we're the drivers for the business right now are 400-gig and 800-gig. In terms of the visibility business, we expect or we're everything we hear and we see the pipeline building towards it is a recovery in enterprise IT span, which would be a good peg. And that to occur as folks return back to work or in a hybrid mode later on in the year. So that's probably a driver for that part of the business. But overall, we're pleased with the synergies we're seeing and you see that reflected in the strength of our commercial communications business this quarter.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thank you for the color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Ridley-Lane from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Thank you. Good evening. Since you've done the math on the impacts from trade restrictions on both orders and revenue, what was the estimated headwind for both of those?\nRon Nersesian: It was roughly six to seven points at the Keysight level. Obviously heavily skewed to CSGs specifically to commercial comm. So, I think if you get to the commercial comms level, it was a double digit headwind for the commercial communications business.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Got it.\nRon Nersesian: Putting the record orders for commercial comms in contact, we were extraordinarily pleased with that result given the China trade headwinds on that business.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Got it? Okay. And then, since no one else has picked up on it, I'll ask. Can you tell us a little bit more on the acquisition that you closed. I think it was about $100 million or so from cash flow revenue. How it fits into the portfolio? And it seems like it's in a very fast-growing part of the market. So, kind of what's your near-term revenue expectations as well?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes, maybe I'll start by saying, it's a smaller acquisition. Roughly half point to the Keysight revenue as an estimate, and it's highly profitable, and it aligns with our M&A strategy of focusing on software-centric product categories, and more importantly, enables us to complete the customer workflow -- plays into the interoperability testing space, which enables customers to resolve complex system issues. And given that the 5G deployments are taking place at scale at new trends, like Open RAN are disaggregating more of what used to be a monolithic block. We believe this acquisition will really help us continue our momentum within the commercial comms business.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Got it. And then last one for me. You're now in a net cash position. How do you think about Keysight's ability to be more aggressive on share repurchase? Is being in a net caps position aligned for you?\nNeil Dougherty: Go ahead, I'm sorry.\nRon Nersesian: Yes. Our first objective, obviously, is to grow the business and provide a great return above our wax. So we continue to look for M&A opportunities that can further our strategy. But again, if we can't go ahead and produce you know an hourly [indiscernible], we're not going to spend it. So, you can see we're very deliberate and we're very focused and we will not go ahead and go after things that are too speculative. So that is our first priority. The second thing if we had excess funds, at the end of the day, we would rather do that through opportunistic share repurchases. As you saw, not this quarter, but as you saw on Q4, where average price was below $100 in the shares that we did repurchase. And then third would be to do something like a dividend that we're far from that at this point. But still, first, we're going ahead and making sure after organic growth is funded through over $700 million in R&D. Second, it's to look for M&A that could go ahead and enhance our growth and produce a higher return on invested capital. Third, clearly is to look for opportunistic share buybacks. which we have done and we plan to make sure we're at least anti-diluted, like we've stated before, but we will get a little bit more aggressive if we see a very big opportunity.\nOperator: Your next question comes from a line of Adam Thalhimer from Thomas [ph] Davis. Your line is open.\nAdam Thalhimer: Close enough. Hi, guys. Great quarter.\nNeil Dougherty: Thanks, Adam.\nRon Nersesian: Thanks, Adam.\nAdam Thalhimer: Shoot, this might be a waste of question, but I got to ask about the Biden administration and Huawei. There have been some early indications that maybe some of their restrictions get eased. I'm just curious if you have any thoughts on that?\nRon Nersesian: Well, we don't have any particular insight as to what the Biden administration will do. But I'm very pleased that we were concerned about having to have that in our compare and to go ahead and seeing what that would do to our top line when we had to go ahead and stop selling, according to the government laws. And we're very, very pleased that we reported double-digit quarter growth and revenue growth outside at our other accounts in order to basically smooth right over that. So, if things were to change at Huawei or with any other government restrictions, that would certainly be significant upside for us.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay, thank you.\nRon Nersesian: Thanks, Adam.\nOperator: Your next question comes from a lot of Chris Snyder from UBS. Your line is open.\nChris Snyder: Thank you. So, just following up on the capital allocation. The company finished the quarter with $1.9 billion of cash, which is certainly well above historical levels. What do you view to be the optimal level of cash to keep on hand? And is there a willingness to go after larger acquisition targets? Because while there's been a steady stream of bolt-on type acquisitions, it feels like that is a little bit difficult to kind of right-size, the cash balance with these just bolt-ons alone?\nRon Nersesian: Sure, well, I'll just say this, that we have looked at over 300 different acquisitions. And again, we're very selective. We've made about a dozen at this point and you're right, most of them have been smaller, except for two of them. And we continue to look for a large and small things that fit into our strategy. But there is a very high hurdle for the large acquisitions, obviously, the upside, is much as much more significant. But when you look at the premium and the amount of dollars that you have to make up in the premium you pay for a company, we want to make sure that pays off for the shareholders. We have more cash than we need to run the company right now. But we are aggressively looking at M&A and unfortunately, we can't share much more than that. Neil, you may have something else you want to add?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes, the only thing I was going to add is that the optimal level of cash -- I would agree with Ron, we have we have more cash than we currently need. But the optimal level of cash is a lot of things that go into that and it fluctuates over time. And we're looking to put that cash to work either through value creating M&A or looking for opportunities to return it in a favorable fashion, like we did in the Q4 of last year. So, we'll continue to continue to do that.\nChris Snyder: Thank you for that. And then just for the second question, can you talk about the pricing environment, both for CSG and EISG? And what level of positive pricing, if any, is baked into the company's mid-single digit long term core growth targets?\nRon Nersesian: We always look at pricing depending on what's going on in the market and how much our differentiation is in a particular segment. So clearly, if there's a lot of competition, we don't have differentiation that it's that great, we cannot go ahead and utilize too much pricing power. But what we're doing in 5G is certainly unique. We're on the leadership end and not only in different products, but when you look across the workflow and we look for opportunities to do so but we're not going to gouge our customers. We want to make sure that we have a good long-term environment and they stick with us. So, we review our pricing at a minimum twice a year and we look for opportunities for price increases and we will continue to do so to drive our margins higher or to offset inflation. But as far as what the amount is, that's something that we do not state publicly.\nChris Snyder: Thank you.\nRon Nersesian: Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: Your next question comes from a line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nBrandon Couillard: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Most of my questions have been covered. But, Ron, I don't think you mentioned any call on the auto market specifically yet. Curious, latest thoughts there? And if there has been kind of any turn perhaps in the order trends in that market? Thanks.\nRon Nersesian: Yes. Well, I'll let Satish answer this. We've been focusing certainly on the battery test and the overall infrastructure for EV. We have mentioned a nice the win that we had in the prepared remarks earlier, and we continue to be in good position in that space. Also, as we look at autonomous vehicles, it's the same thing. But as far as the market, we've seen the market a little bit more depressed, as we all know, in auto and I'll let Satish get a chance to comment on where he sees that going.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. And thanks, Ron. We're seeing signs of slow recovery in the auto market. The business is definitely stabilizing, the manufacturing parts of the business have depressed a strong reference. But there is a steady focus on next gen R&D with AV and EV applications. Definitely the push around the world for more electrification, we view as a long-term opportunity and we're focused on creating value to help extend the ranges, help with interoperability needs by implementing global standards, including in China and focusing on bidirectional charging applications. With 5G in particular, we have a differentiated position on C-V2X technology that we're continuing to progress. So, this may be a market where as the as the auto end market recovers, we start to see even bigger traction, especially in EV and AV. That's our expectation, but our portfolio is strong and we continue to be engaged with customers.\nBrandon Couillard: Thanks. And, Neil, would you remind us just what the China trade headwind is on a year-over-year basis to the top line in the second quarter? That a similar sort of 6% to 7%?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes, what we said what we said before was that it was 5% on the half, obviously skewed towards Q1. We've just told you Q1 was 6%, so Q2 is in the 3% to 4%-ish range.\nBrandon Couillard: Got you. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to turn the conference back to Jason Kary for any closing comments.\nJason Kary: Hi. Thanks, Sedaris. no further comments. I just like to thank everyone for joining us today and wish you all a great day.\nOperator: This concludes our conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Mark Wallace",
            "content": "Sure. Ron covered it really well, Rick, but I would just add that about half our growth in China overcoming the headwinds was from new customers. Again, showing how we're executing and rotating to both new opportunities and new customers and we want additional business with our existing customers, whether that be around 5G to some of the long tail of customers, 400-gigabit Tier 2 customers. And I was very pleased with semiconductor, very strong growth again, both from existing large customers, as well as acquiring two new fabulous semiconductor customers in the quarter in China. Very strong results in Japan for 5G and aerospace defense. And then if you look at Europe, it really was a story of this very broad demand across multiple end markets. We had growth across most of our countries across Europe. And it really goes to show the strength of our portfolio and the depth of our penetration into all these end markets. Ron, should I take... Yes, sequentially. 4G has been flat quarter-over-quarter for us and we're very pleased with the uptake in 5G as I referenced. It was a record quarter and was and if you include 5G and 4G together, we've grown at year-over-year and sequentially quarter-over-quarter. We feel we feel good about the portfolio and I did mention that we've launched 30 new products this quarter to feed that momentum in the market."
        },
        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Satish Dhanasekaran",
            "content": "Yes, I'll take that, Ron. I think one of the effects in 5G that we're seeing as deployments of scaling is the broader interest in deploying this technology across different end market verticals. And that as a result of expanding the ecosystem, as we have talked about this quarter, we added over 100 new customers to our 5G platform. So that's that continues to be strong. At the highest level, I think we've stated its growth across all regions, for 5G and all parts of the ecosystem. So, it is broad and we see sort of four teams. Right? You look at the R&D investment cycle, there's new teams such as [indiscernible] and O-RAN that are capturing interest, manufacturing opportunities, scale as 5g deploys, and it's profitable manufacturing as we have talked about as select manufacturing strategy. And -- is the interest in this technology from new verticals such as aerospace, defense, automotive, and industrial. And finally we see this long term steady push to commercialize Millimeter Wave as we've talked about is a long term dynamic for our business, which has got an upgrade pattern and to feed this momentum, we've just announced over 30 new product introductions this quarter and we feel confident about the projections based on everything we see in the industry. Yes, I think based on what we have seen in the past, I think we've sort of seen an industry CapEx projected to peak due to the Millimeter Wave parts of 5G being deployed. However, for our business, in comms, we have a broad portfolio of both wired and wireless and the end-to-end portfolio that we have created, not only has sort of a poor incident effect, but as Ron referenced, higher software content, higher services, so we're much more plugged in and able to monetize the lifecycle value from our early, lead. As far as aerospace, defense is concerned, very pleased record orders and record revenues. And as we mentioned before, the strength is coming across all the regions, tracking the COVID recovery or macro recovery. And that's probably a common dynamic between our aerospace, defense business and the general electronics business in our industrial segment. Specifically, on the aerospace defense, our portfolios focus on defense modernization, in particular around these new teams continue to position us well. The passage of the NDAA or the budget in the United States in December, we feel cautiously optimistic about the outlook for that business as we look forward. And we also have a pretty healthy, healthy backlog into the business. So, we continue to expect strong growth the next couple of quarters. As far as the EISG business is concerned, again, broad strength from our general electronics business, but also semiconductor where we're seeing increased investments driven by the advanced nodes and the China IC investment that Mark referenced earlier. Yes, I'll maybe start with the 400-gig question, Mehdi. As we have really done very well with the wireline technology evolutions over the number of years and last year was a pretty strong year for 400-gig, I think we've referenced it on calls. And what we saw this quarter was a broader adaption of 400-gig technologies, still heavily driven by data center demand, which is adapting, I should say, the 400-gig at scale. We saw increased spend from Tier 2 and long tail customers in Asia in particular and we expect as the 400-gig economies of scale and maturity occur, that more of that demand will start to shift in the telco or Metro opportunities. So, we're still on the frontend of that. I would also say that on 800-gig, the investments are in early R&D, which we expect to play out in in production in 18 to 24 months. So, we're engaged early. Just this quarter, we announced the full suite of R&D offerings for 800-gig as well, which positions us well to benefit from not only the wireless on the 5G side, but also from the wireline opportunities in our commercial communications business. As far as the software, I'll kick it off, and maybe Neil can make a comment. We see for our double-digit growth in software coming from our pathway design franchise and from the 5G solutions, which as we have referenced before, have a higher percentage of software content with them. We're also seeing renewals for subscription contracts become important to our 5G growth, which I think helps us with the ARR. I'll just pass it off to Neil. I think you can see in our guide that we're very encouraged by the market and our performance in the business on the top line. We do have some short term expense pressures over the couple of quarters that will put some pressure on EPS relative to normal incremental, over the quarter or where the incrementals would otherwise have been over the course of the next several quarters. But by Q4, we're kind of lapped those comps than the impact that they have on our business where we return to kind of more normalized levels. Yes. I'll take the aerospace, defense first. Again, record orders and given the comps from the favorable comms, we have for the next couple of quarters. We expect strong revenue performance in the business and our focus areas around defense modernization are also aligned with some of the strategic priorities of the governments around the world. So we feel good about where we are in the business. With regard to your question on wireline, the entire portfolio of wireline involves the focus in three areas if you think of it. The focus on high speed evolutions, 400-gig, 800-gig, terahertz and terabit ethernet and beyond. And security as a second theme, which is gaining customer interest. And the third area is on visibility. Clearly, we're the drivers for the business right now are 400-gig and 800-gig. In terms of the visibility business, we expect or we're everything we hear and we see the pipeline building towards it is a recovery in enterprise IT span, which would be a good peg. And that to occur as folks return back to work or in a hybrid mode later on in the year. So that's probably a driver for that part of the business. But overall, we're pleased with the synergies we're seeing and you see that reflected in the strength of our commercial communications business this quarter. Yes, maybe I'll start by saying, it's a smaller acquisition. Roughly half point to the Keysight revenue as an estimate, and it's highly profitable, and it aligns with our M&A strategy of focusing on software-centric product categories, and more importantly, enables us to complete the customer workflow -- plays into the interoperability testing space, which enables customers to resolve complex system issues. And given that the 5G deployments are taking place at scale at new trends, like Open RAN are disaggregating more of what used to be a monolithic block. We believe this acquisition will really help us continue our momentum within the commercial comms business. Yes. And thanks, Ron. We're seeing signs of slow recovery in the auto market. The business is definitely stabilizing, the manufacturing parts of the business have depressed a strong reference. But there is a steady focus on next gen R&D with AV and EV applications. Definitely the push around the world for more electrification, we view as a long-term opportunity and we're focused on creating value to help extend the ranges, help with interoperability needs by implementing global standards, including in China and focusing on bidirectional charging applications. With 5G in particular, we have a differentiated position on C-V2X technology that we're continuing to progress. So, this may be a market where as the as the auto end market recovers, we start to see even bigger traction, especially in EV and AV. That's our expectation, but our portfolio is strong and we continue to be engaged with customers."

            "name": "Ron Nersesian",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Keysight delivered another outstanding quarter. Our consistent performance illustrates the strength of our differentiated solutions, broad-based momentum across diverse end markets and the durability of our business model. Today, I'll focus my comments on three key headlines. First, we achieved record first quarter orders driven by growth across all regions despite China trade headwinds. Second, strong execution by the Keysight team delivered revenue and earnings growth above guidance. And third, we entered the year with solid momentum across multiple end markets and confidence in our revenue and earnings growth trajectory for the year. Despite a short term expectation of elevated expenses from variable compensation, which is due to the high near term revenue growth, we expect to achieve mid to high teens earnings growth in Fiscal 2021. Now let's take a deeper look into our first quarter results. We delivered record first quarter orders of $1.2 billion, which again exceeded revenue and grew 7%. First quarter revenue grew 8% to $1.2 billion. As previously discussed, we faced strong year-over-year headwinds in the first quarter due to China trade restrictions, adjusting for this impact both orders and revenue grew solid double digits. We continue to make strong progress towards our long-term financial targets with consistent execution and enabled by the strengthen discipline of the Keysight leadership model. We delivered first quarter gross margin of 64%, operating margin at 27%, which increased 210 basis points and free cash flow of $267 million. Turning to our markets, aerospace, defense and government achieved record first quarter orders and revenue 20% revenue growth was driven by continued investment in electromagnetic spectrum operations, space and the new commercial technologies like 5G and early 6G research. In commercial communications, we achieved all-time record orders in total, as well as for 5G, while revenue declined 3%. Adjusting to the transit impact of unfavorable trade restrictions, commercial communications orders grew double digits and revenue grew high single digits. Strength was driven by ongoing global 5G deployments and the rollout of new 5G devices and continued investment in 400G and 800G Ethernet for data centers. Keysight's end-to-end solutions portfolio is enabling the rapid progression of new technologies, both in the wireless and wired systems of the communications network, where our value proposition remains strong. Keysight continues to lead the industry in 5G powered by years of close collaboration with market makers in standards bodies. We are advancing our 5G strategy to capture emerging opportunities in the application layer as momentum builds ahead of deployments in 2021. We make great progress this quarter as broad industries embrace our 5G platform and new applications emerge. For example, O-RAN continues to be an area of active investment for our customers. We recently introduced a suite of end-to-end solutions for O-RAN vendors and mobile operators. Our solutions are used to verify the interoperability, performance, conformance, and security of multi-vendor 5G networks. We also announced strategic partnerships in the expanding O-RAN space with industry-leaders like Xilinx, Radisys, ArrayComm and Altiostar. In addition, we continue to accelerate Keysight's capabilities to provide industry-leading solutions through strategic acquisitions. In Q1, we acquired [indiscernible], a leader in wireless test and measurement solutions for protocol decoding and interoperability. [Indiscernible] offerings complement our end-to-end solutions portfolio, providing problem-solving tools that extend from inside the wireless network, out through over-the-air analytics. Record revenue for Electronic Industrial Solutions Group was driven by double-digit growth in semiconductors and general electronic solutions. Record semiconductor revenue was fueled by ongoing investment in next generation process technologies, bolstered by new customer wins in China as we successfully redeployed our salesforce to capitalize on new opportunities. General electronic strength reflected continued economic recovery with growth across all regions and improvement in the advanced research education market. In automotive, despite ongoing macro challenges, end demand is stabilizing as strategic investments in advanced technologies have accelerated in Asia and in the Americas. In Europe, we continue to expand our presence and recently announced a collaboration with ElringKlinger, one of the world's leading Cisco partners to the automotive industry. They chose Keysight's battery test solution to advance e-mobility in the field of battery development for electric vehicles. Software and services each delivered double-digit order and revenue growth. Combined, they were approximately one-third of total Keysight revenue contributing significantly to our software-centric solution strategy and differentiation and further strengthen the durability of our business model with increasing recurring revenue. In summary, I'd like to thank our Keysight employees around the world who have reacted dynamically to a challenging environment to deliver exceptional results for our customers and shareholders. We are pleased with our first quarter performance and encouraged by the broad-based momentum across our markets entering the year. Now, I would like to turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail. And you also look at the long-term model that we outlined at analysts day for FY 2023, obviously, our performance shows very strong against that and we have no doubt that we'll be able to deliver to that level going forward. I'll mention a couple and then I'll let Mark chime in with a little more detail. First of all, if you look at China, our China orders were down 6% and we expected them to be down much more because of the effects of the China trade restrictions with Huawei. If you were to strip out Huawei, we had 19% order growth from our other Chinese customers. And as Huawei comes out of the compare in the past, we're very, very pleasantly surprised and pleased with that performance. Our Chinese salesforce was redeployed from the accounts where they cannot sell into other accounts within the geography and we were to do that almost instantaneously to produce the type of the type of results that we did do. So that was clearly one. India was also very strong. Japan was very strong -- both of those well into double digits, as well as Europe, which also hit double digit performance. Mark, you may want to add a couple more regional comments? Let me add just a couple more comments, Rick. One, our general electronics business was up in orders over 20% and that's a really good sign. That talks about the macro environment in the industrial markets. So, we're very pleased to see that and also our overall corporate strategy and moving to more software-centric solutions, which requires more software and more services. Both software and services. Both grew double digits in orders again this quarter. Thank you. Sure, I'll cover the procurement piece and then I'll let Neil talk a little bit more on the OpEx formula going forward. As far as procurement we have taken into account the long lead time cycles that we're seeing from semiconductor providers, as well as the other environmental impacts that we're seeing around the world. As a matter of fact, we have just put out guidance for the midpoint is at $1.2 billion for the next quarter and that takes into account the semi-cycles. We do hope though, that things don't get worse from the standpoint of COVID -- another surge, although we feel very confident that we are in good shape to come out with this guidance, which was above the street consensus for the next quarter. Thanks, Jim. And just to finish that up, if you take a look at our overall model, we think it's a short-term effect and that's why for one of the few times we've guided out for the whole year producing EPS growth in the teens as we had mentioned in our prepared remarks. Satish, feel free to answer this question. Sure. I would also comment that different form factors are contributing to that such as our modular solutions, had a very strong quarter, as well as software and services that have been mentioned earlier, all play into this general electronics market and the overall EISG market. Thank you. Well also, so if you're looking for the short term, or big orders, where to go ahead and where to exceed our projections, when you take a look at our incrementals, we have delivered to our model and then some pretty much consistently over the last five years. And we expect to continue to do so. Ms: Yes. And I was just trying to understand how conservative is that method, high-teen EPS growth? And how should we think about upsides from there? Thank you. Yes, thank you. I think as we have referenced before, the Millimeter Wave opportunity is a long term one for us. We see a very steady increase in interest from our customers. At this point, heavily driven by the U.S. bans. You can think of 20 gigahertz to 40 gigahertz sort of spectrum. And with new spectrum coming online, the 66 gigahertz to 90 gigahertz range, I think that tends to sow the seeds for the runway. We're talking about China's 2022 Winter Olympics, we expect it to be a push with a showcase of Millimeter Wave. So those are clearly drivers. And then if you look even further out, you start thinking about some early research occurring the terahertz space. So again, this is a very long-term opportunity. Keysight's got a competitive differentiation. We have talked about this and we're well-positioned to address this. Currently, we're working with customers to solve some critical challenges in commercializing Millimeter Wave like in advanced beam management, peak higher data rates, 10 gigabits per second and above. It's a long term dynamic and we are well-positioned there. I didn't hear your question. Could you please repeat it? It was roughly six to seven points at the Keysight level. Obviously heavily skewed to CSGs specifically to commercial comm. So, I think if you get to the commercial comms level, it was a double digit headwind for the commercial communications business. Putting the record orders for commercial comms in contact, we were extraordinarily pleased with that result given the China trade headwinds on that business. Yes. Our first objective, obviously, is to grow the business and provide a great return above our wax. So we continue to look for M&A opportunities that can further our strategy. But again, if we can't go ahead and produce you know an hourly [indiscernible], we're not going to spend it. So, you can see we're very deliberate and we're very focused and we will not go ahead and go after things that are too speculative. So that is our first priority. The second thing if we had excess funds, at the end of the day, we would rather do that through opportunistic share repurchases. As you saw, not this quarter, but as you saw on Q4, where average price was below $100 in the shares that we did repurchase. And then third would be to do something like a dividend that we're far from that at this point. But still, first, we're going ahead and making sure after organic growth is funded through over $700 million in R&D. Second, it's to look for M&A that could go ahead and enhance our growth and produce a higher return on invested capital. Third, clearly is to look for opportunistic share buybacks. which we have done and we plan to make sure we're at least anti-diluted, like we've stated before, but we will get a little bit more aggressive if we see a very big opportunity. Thanks, Adam. Well, we don't have any particular insight as to what the Biden administration will do. But I'm very pleased that we were concerned about having to have that in our compare and to go ahead and seeing what that would do to our top line when we had to go ahead and stop selling, according to the government laws. And we're very, very pleased that we reported double-digit quarter growth and revenue growth outside at our other accounts in order to basically smooth right over that. So, if things were to change at Huawei or with any other government restrictions, that would certainly be significant upside for us. Thanks, Adam. Sure, well, I'll just say this, that we have looked at over 300 different acquisitions. And again, we're very selective. We've made about a dozen at this point and you're right, most of them have been smaller, except for two of them. And we continue to look for a large and small things that fit into our strategy. But there is a very high hurdle for the large acquisitions, obviously, the upside, is much as much more significant. But when you look at the premium and the amount of dollars that you have to make up in the premium you pay for a company, we want to make sure that pays off for the shareholders. We have more cash than we need to run the company right now. But we are aggressively looking at M&A and unfortunately, we can't share much more than that. Neil, you may have something else you want to add? We always look at pricing depending on what's going on in the market and how much our differentiation is in a particular segment. So clearly, if there's a lot of competition, we don't have differentiation that it's that great, we cannot go ahead and utilize too much pricing power. But what we're doing in 5G is certainly unique. We're on the leadership end and not only in different products, but when you look across the workflow and we look for opportunities to do so but we're not going to gouge our customers. We want to make sure that we have a good long-term environment and they stick with us. So, we review our pricing at a minimum twice a year and we look for opportunities for price increases and we will continue to do so to drive our margins higher or to offset inflation. But as far as what the amount is, that's something that we do not state publicly. Thanks, Chris. Yes. Well, I'll let Satish answer this. We've been focusing certainly on the battery test and the overall infrastructure for EV. We have mentioned a nice the win that we had in the prepared remarks earlier, and we continue to be in good position in that space. Also, as we look at autonomous vehicles, it's the same thing. But as far as the market, we've seen the market a little bit more depressed, as we all know, in auto and I'll let Satish get a chance to comment on where he sees that going."

            "name": "Neil Dougherty",
            "content": "Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. As Ron mentioned, the Keysight team delivered an outstanding first quarter as continued economic recovery drove a steady improvement in demand across all major regions. First Quarter revenue of $1,180 billion was above the high end of our guidance range and grew 8% or 6% on a core basis. Q1 revenue growth was driven by broad strength across multiple end markets and geographies. Total Keysight orders again exceeded revenue in Q1 with a boat to build just over one. We achieved first quarter orders of $1,223 billion, of 7% or 5% on a core basis, successfully overcoming increased trade restrictions. Turning to operational results for Q1. Reported gross margin of 64% and operating expenses of $439 million were well-managed, resulting in an operating margin of 27%, an increase of 210 basis points year-over-year. We achieve net income of $270 million and delivered $1.43 in earnings per share, which is well above the high end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 188 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communication Solutions Group generated record first quarter revenue of $852 million, up 4% was delivering gross margin of 65% and operating margin of 26%. In Q1, commercial communications achieved all-time record total and 5G quarterly orders. First Quarter revenue declined 3% to $558 million, with commercial communications disproportionately impacted by the China trade restrictions. Aerospace, defense and government achieved record first quarter revenue of $294 million, an increase of 20% versus a strong compare in Q1 last year. Growth was driven by robust year-end spending across all major regions. In the U.S., growth was driven by prime contractor spending, offsetting slightly lower spending from direct government customers as we saw less than expected disruption from the U.S. administration transition. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated record revenue of $328 million of 18% or 13% on a core basis. Orders in revenue for our semiconductor and general electronics measurement solutions broke through double digits for the second quarter in a row, with strong revenue growth across all regions, particularly in Asia Pacific. EISD reported gross margin of 63% and operating margin of 29%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our first quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents and reported a cash flow from operations of $295 million and free cash flow of $267 million or 23% of revenue. Under a share repurchase authorization during the quarter, we acquired approximately 137,000 shares on the open market and an average price of $145.14 for a total consideration of $20 million. Before moving to our guidance, I'd like to remind everyone of my comments last quarter in which I stated that flexible spending and variable compensation is expected to increase in FY 2021, with Q2 expenses seasonally higher than all other quarters. The principal driver is variable compensation, which is a function of organic revenue growth and operating margin. Just as we flexed expenses down last year in response to a decline in revenue, we will flex up this year particularly in quarters with soft revenue comps, notably Q2 and Q3. We believe our variable compensation is an important element of not only our flexible cost structure, but our human capital philosophy in which employees are engaged and participate in both the ups and downs of the business. Now turning to our outlook and guidance. We expect second quarter 2021 revenue to be in the range of $1,190 billion to $1,210 billion, which represents 34% revenue growth at the midpoint. We expect Q2 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.29 to $1.35 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 188 million shares. In closing we're entering the year with the order momentum, a solid backlog position and strong operational execution. We are pleased with the trajectory of our business and expect to achieve mid to high teens earnings growth for the full fiscal year. With that I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A. Yes, Rick, This is Neil. I think you've hit on it right. Q4 was a very favorable -- if you're looking sequentially -- Q4 was a very favorable gross margin quarter for us as we really significantly ramped production after the COVID disruptions of Q2 and Q3. And I think just the nature of us responding to immediate customer demand for urgent delivery, kind of shifted the mix in a favorable direction in the fourth quarter. I think what we saw in the first quarter was the return to more normalized mix. It aligns with kind of the quarters leading it up to Q4 as well as slightly lower volume. And I think that that comment is basically true across both the Communications Group as well as EISG. There's nothing really specific in either one of the two businesses. Yes, and, Jim, your second question was kind of forward-looking as are related to OpEx. And I made some comments in my prepared remarks. Certainly I think our underlying investment levels are stable and are likely to be stable, going forward. But we do expect some short-term increases over the course of the next couple of quarters -- well, not the only impact, by far the biggest driver of that increase is our variable pay program. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks last quarter, Q2 expenses are expected to be seasonally higher than all other quarters this year. The principal drivers the bounce back of variable compensation relative to last year. That variable compensation is a function of both organic revenue growth and operating margin and in quarters where we have soft revenue comps and therefore higher revenue growth like we will see in Q2 and in Q3 of this year. Our variable compensation is going to be materially higher. So, as you saw we guided very strong revenue growth of 34% in Q2 and expect the sequential increases results in our variable compensation program of more than $30 million relative to Q1. And since all of our non-executive employees are participants in that variable pay program, that increase is split roughly equally between cost of sales, R&D, and SG&A. Specifically impacting the OpEx lines that you asked about. But again, important to note that the underlying investment level is stable and once we get past Q3, our variable pay and our expense levels are going to return to more normalized levels. Just in terms of the relative size of software, we've said previously that software is approximately 20% of total revenues. And as the Satish has mentioned, it continues to outgrow the broader business, growing double digits again this quarter. So that mix is increasing slowly over time and we expect that it will continue to do so as we continue this migration towards more complete solutions with higher software content. Certainly, over the long run, we see increasing software content as a driver of gross margin. I think you've seen that over the past couple of years as we've added software to our portfolio, as well as taking other actions to drive our gross margins northward. You know, the, the mix shift, it's not dramatic. It's slow and steady over time. So, hard for me to draw a direct link between a mixed shift over the next couple of quarters and immediate EPS increases, there's a lot of things that are going to go into -- they're going to play a role in determining that level over the course of the next several quarters. But generally speaking, yes, our software growth is absolutely contributing to our gross margin improvement over time. The only thing I mentioned earlier is that, our Q4 gross margins in last year were extraordinarily favorable. Right? Not only do we have the highest revenue quarter we'd had by a pretty significant margin, we had significantly higher gross margins than we'd ever had previously. So, we are going to have a tough year-over-your comp in the fourth quarter that is going to factor into that ultimate equation as well. Yes. If you could slow down just a touch. That would help. Go ahead, I'm sorry. Thanks, Adam. Yes, the only thing I was going to add is that the optimal level of cash -- I would agree with Ron, we have we have more cash than we currently need. But the optimal level of cash is a lot of things that go into that and it fluctuates over time. And we're looking to put that cash to work either through value creating M&A or looking for opportunities to return it in a favorable fashion, like we did in the Q4 of last year. So, we'll continue to continue to do that. Yes, what we said what we said before was that it was 5% on the half, obviously skewed towards Q1. We've just told you Q1 was 6%, so Q2 is in the 3% to 4%-ish range."

Keysight reported strong fourth quarter results, which exceeded the high end of our guidance and drove a strong finish to the year. Before we get into the quarter, I want to highlight our exceptional performance for fiscal year, which illustrates continued progress we're making in transforming the Company to a software-centric solutions provider. We set new records for orders, which grew 12% to $6 billion, a new record for revenue, which was up 10%, and a new record for earnings per share, which increased 22%, all the while returning capital through $849 million in share repurchases or 89% of free cash flow. In addition, we continue to invest in next-generation technologies for long-term differentiation and see a high level of engagement and activity with our customers around their future needs. Today, I'll focus my comments on three key headlines. First, we delivered an all-time record revenue and earnings per share in the fourth quarter ahead of expectations enabled by outstanding execution by Keysight teams who successfully navigated supply chain, geopolitical and macro dynamics. Second, we achieved record orders of $1.6 billion with steady bookings throughout the quarter and a book-to-bill of 1.09. While our customers' multiyear road maps remain unchanged, they are exercising more caution given the macro backdrop, which we anticipate will moderate demand in the near term. Third, as we enter fiscal '23, we remain confident in our ability to outperform the market based on the differentiation of our solutions, our strong R&D customer value proposition and the robust backlog position we have entering the year. And as we look longer term, the secular innovation trends in our end markets remain strong. Now let's take a deeper look at the strength of the fourth quarter. Record orders of $1.6 billion grew 9% on a core basis. Record revenue grew 15% on a core basis, with solid growth across all regions as Keysight team successfully navigated challenging dynamics. This resulted in record quarterly earnings of $2.14 per share. The strength and resiliency of our business model is due to our strategic efforts to diversify our industry exposure. This has been best exemplified in the growth of our Electronic Industrial Solutions Group and our ability to leverage our industry-leading first-to-market solutions to enable expansion across the broader communications ecosystem. EISG achieved its ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit order and revenue growth. Auto, semiconductor solutions and general electronics all achieved record quarterly revenue. For the year, both orders and revenues set new records as we capitalize on continued investments across all three EISG markets. In automotive, we're pleased with the continued adoption of our solutions portfolio as orders grew double digits for the seventh consecutive quarter and exceeded $500 million this year. Automotive OEMs and their suppliers continue to focus on strategic new mobility investments, which drove key wins for Keysight. In addition, automotive-focused semiconductor companies continue to add capabilities to support EV and AV applications, which we view as a favorable long-term dynamic. We recently announced the Scienlab DC Emulator, which enables customers to accurately characterize high-voltage, high-power electric vehicle battery performance under varying real-world charging conditions. And Keysight's PathWave Lab's operation software won 2022 AutoTech Breakthrough Award for overall electric vehicle technology. In support of AV applications, silicon designers are exploring adoption of commercial standards such as MIPI for automotive and other surround sensor applications, including cameras and in-vehicle infotainment displays. We are now expanding our leading compliance test solutions to offer advanced verification and diagnostic capabilities for automotive designers. Turning to our semiconductor solutions business. Q4 was the tenth consecutive quarter of double-digit order book and a record revenue quarter. We saw sustained demand for our wafer test solutions and precision positioning capabilities, which enable the realization of advanced process nodes. In addition, Keysight has continued to partner with industry leaders, Synopsys and Ansys, on RF and millimeter wave integrated circuit design flows built for today's wireless communication requirements, including 5G and 6G system-on-chips. Keysight received a Partner of the Year Award from TSMC for joint development design flows in RF and millimeter wave nodes. In general electronics, record orders grew double digits this quarter as demand remains strong and broad-based across industrial IoT and digital health as well as education and advanced research markets. Turning to Communication Solutions Group. The business delivered strong orders and record revenue. Annual orders and revenue were all-time highs despite geopolitical headwinds and delays in U.S. Defense budget appropriations. Commercial communications revenue grew 10% and 11% for the year, with growth across all regions. Investments across communications ecosystem continued throughout the year with sustained spending in next-generation wireless and wireline technologies. Ongoing investments in 5G standards, new spectrum growing deployments around the world and steady evolution from 400 gig to 800 gig to terabit Ethernet drove growth. We ended a record year for 5G orders as Keysight's market-leading solutions continue to provide industry with new capabilities needed for development of next-generation devices as well as wireless and wireline networks. Examples that highlight our portfolio's alignment with key industry priority include a recent partnership with IBM to integrate our Open RAN capabilities into their cloud automation tools to accelerate network deployments. We also completed the validation of our first 5G location-based service use case from Global Certification Forum by combining the testing of 5G new radio and global navigation satellite system technologies into a single platform. Lastly, in collaboration with key silicon and data center partners, we enabled the industry's first 1.6 terabit transmission and data center interconnect, leveraging our high-speed digital solutions. Aerospace, defense and government business revenue grew 4% for the quarter and 3% for the year, setting a new record while navigating geopolitical headwinds. Steady investments in spectrum operations, cybersecurity and space and satellite drove demand. 5G continued to expand in aerospace and defense end markets, and we saw increasing investment in advanced research. Proposed increases in investment in the U.S. and allied countries for modernization of defense capabilities and new satellite and space applications position us well for future opportunities. As an integral part of our solution strategy, software and services order and revenue growth this year continued to outpace Keysight overall, which has driven our annual recurring revenue to approximately $1.2 billion. Software and services again represented just over 1/3 of Keysight's total revenue for the year. Keysight's focus on customer success and innovation is driving our development of first-to-market, high-value solutions. Our achievements over the years exemplify Keysight's collaborative culture and our talented workforce, and we are honored that Keysight has placed tenth on the Fortune's Best Workplaces in Technology list for 2022. We believe our differentiated culture gives us a unique ability to recruit and develop capable talent and will be our sustaining competitive advantage. In conclusion, I would like to thank our employees for all their contributions, commitment and strong track record of execution. In the midst of an uncertain economic environment, we remain confident in the resilience of our business, the strength of our balance sheet and the flexibility of our operating model. Now, I'll turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail.\nNeil Dougherty: Thank you, Satish, and hello, everyone. We delivered an outstanding fourth quarter of 2022 with record revenue of $1.443 billion, which was above the high end of our guidance range and grew 11% or 15% on a core basis. Our strategies to navigate the ongoing supply constraints continue to be effective. While the supply chain situation improved within the quarter, it continues to moderate our near-term revenue expectations. Record orders of $1.570 billion increased 5% or 9% on a core basis, and we entered fiscal year 2023 with over $2.5 billion in backlog. Looking at our operational results for Q4, we reported gross margin of 64%, which, as expected, was down 80 basis points sequentially due to inflationary pressures and increased shipments of lower-end instruments, enabled by the improving supply chain. Operating expenses of $494 million were well managed, and we generated operating margin of 30%. Net income was a record $386 million, and we achieved $2.14 in earnings per share, which was $0.14 above the high end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 180 million shares. Foreign exchange impact on our earnings was negligible, thanks to a full natural hedge provided by our global footprint, which was then supplemented by our financial hedging program. Moving to the performance of our segments. The Communications Solutions Group achieved record revenue of $992 million, up 8% or 11% on a core basis. CSG delivered gross margin of 66% and operating margin of 29%. Commercial communications generated revenue of $681 million in the fourth quarter, up 10% driven by strength across the 5G ecosystem, increasing O-RAN adoption and investment in 800 gigabit and 1.6 terabit R&D. Aerospace, defense and government achieved record revenue of $311 million, up 4%, driven by double-digit growth in Asia Pacific and Europe. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group achieved record revenue of $451 million, up 20% or 25% on a core basis, driven by strength across all markets. EISG reported gross margin of 60% and operating margin of 32%. Turning to our full year financial performance. Keysight delivered outstanding results in 2022 despite ongoing supply constraints, foreign exchange headwinds and incremental trade restrictions. FY '22 revenue totaled $5.4 billion, up 10% year-over-year or 12% on a core basis. Gross margin was flat at 65%, holding steady in the face of significant inflation. We invested $813 million in R&D, while operating margin improved 140 basis points to 29%. FY '22 non-GAAP net income was $1.4 billion or $7.63 per share, up 22%. Moving on to balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our fourth quarter with more than $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generating cash flow from operations of $398 million and free cash flow of $340 million. Total free cash flow for the year was $959 million, representing 18% of revenue and 69% of non-GAAP net income. Share repurchases this quarter totaled approximately 800,000 shares at an average price per share of $158.77 for a total consideration of $126 million. This brings our total share repurchases for the year to approximately 5.4 million shares at an average share price of $156.09 for a total consideration of $849 million or 89% of free cash flow. Now turning to our outlook and guidance. We exit the year with record backlog and confidence in Keysight's ability to continue executing through near-term uncertainties. As a result, we expect first quarter 2023 revenue to be in the range of $1.360 billion to $1.380 billion and Q1 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.81 to $1.87 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 180 million shares. A few modeling reminders as we enter the year. Our annual compensation cycle is administered in Q1. And in this current inflationary environment, we expect our second consecutive year of wage increases above our historic average. We are targeting FY '23 R&D investment at approximately 16% of revenue. Annual interest expense is expected to be approximately $80 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $250 million, and we are modeling a 12% non-GAAP effective tax rate for FY '23. In closing, we recognize the uncertainty of the current macro environment, and we'll continue to be disciplined. Keysight's highly flexible cost structure, track record of execution, diverse end markets and long-term secular growth drivers give us confidence in our ability to outperform the market. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.\nJason Kary: Thank you, Neil. That concludes our formal remarks. Dante, could you please give the instructions for the Q&A?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee.\nAngela Zhang: This is Angela Zhang on for Samik Chatterjee. Congrats on the strong quarter and outlook. My first question is sort of related to what you mentioned briefly in the prepared remarks on sort of macro slowdown and perhaps some pullbacks. I'd like to dig in a little more there. Given that we've seen commentary from other companies indicating that there's a pullback in telco CapEx, are you seeing any impact on their R&D budget? And then I have a follow-up.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Angela. Yes, we're very pleased with the quarter. And in consideration of this environment, pretty strong results and also a strong finish to the year. And as I stated, we saw a steady level of spend from a demand perspective through the quarter. All our regions from a sales perspective grew. So it was broad-based. And going into a little bit on the end market color, I would say 5G continues to remain strong. We grew our 5G orders double-digit, strength in R&D. And also with the inflections that we're seeing in deployments around some parts of the world, even some of the manufacturing spend there remains strong for us this quarter. And we did see pockets of weakness in the broad component ecosystem, and that was an area we obviously watch carefully, and that is related to the smartphone demand. And if you look at the cloud and data center markets in wireline, while some of the cloud -- direct cloud spend from cloud providers was pushed out -- service providers was pushed out, the broad spend to adopt 400 gig and 800 gig continues to remain strong. So they focus on R&D, and new innovations remain strong. Moving on to aerospace and defense business, obviously, it was still a strong quarter for us, but we did not see the typical year-end surge that we would expect given the budget appropriations process. And then moving to EISG end markets, all of the markets remain strong, right? Automotive, we had strong double-digit growth as continued investments and inflection from EV and AV are playing out. Semiconductor is an area we watch carefully. But because of our exposure into the wafer stage equipment process and new node -- specifically new nodes, that remains strong. And lastly, the general electronics business, which typically gets -- part of its spend from PMI continued to remain strong from a demand perspective. So I would say we're doing well, and the customer activity with our customers and engagements remain strong and quite pleased with the -- with our quarter in this environment.\nAngela Zhang: Great. And then just for my follow-up, you posted 10% revenue growth this year. And I know your long-term guide is sort of mid-single-digit revenue growth. Just what are you thinking sort of broad strokes for fiscal '23 revenue growth where you -- did you see a pull forward with supply easing? And so could there be an air pocket in fiscal '23? Or do you still expect to sort of perhaps trend above your typical long-term range?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. We remain confident, Angela, with what we see so far. Obviously, it's an uncertain environment. So, we're guiding one quarter at a time. You see the confidence reflected in our Q1 guide, which we feel good about. And as we look forward, we'll look at the demand environment, and we'll keep you updated as we go.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS. Your line is now open.\nChris Snyder: I just kind of want to follow up on those comments on the market demand commentary. I mean orders were -- I think you said steady each month of the quarter and up 9% year-on-year. So what should we make of the commentary that maybe customers are being a bit more cautious because, Satish, you just kind of ramp through all the different subsegments and businesses. And it seems like everything is going quite strong. Should we take this as maybe an indicator that fiscal Q1 orders are easing a bit? And ultimately, does this push the growth profile back to that 4% to 6% normalized range? Or should it sink below that?\nMark Wallace: Chris, this is Mark. I'll take that and add a little bit more detail here. So as Satish said, our order level was steady throughout the quarter. So, we're watching this, right, because if customers are taking more time to make decisions, you would look for orders to slow down. They did not. As a matter of fact, October was very strong. It was a record October for us in terms of orders. So that's good. You've heard us talk about before the addition of new customers. We've added about 450 this quarter again for nearly 2,000 new customers across the whole year. So that creates more diversity and durability to our business, and I see that paying off. Our top 20 customers in the quarter were up strong double digits as well. So, all of that continues to translate to the fact that we did not see an impact to our business because of the customers taking more time. And I think it also has to do with the fact that we are so biased toward R&D and design optimization. And as we've seen through other waves in the recent term where market slowed, the advanced technology development continues. So that's what we see, but we look around and we do see some macro uncertainty. And from my seat, what I see in terms of order or in terms of customer activities is very active customers. Our six-month funnel continues to grow, but customers are taking more time to make ultimate CapEx decisions.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. And this is Neil. I just give you a little bit maybe more quantification of the situation going into Q1. So while we don't guide orders, I would point out that we have a bit of a difficult compare here in the first quarter. A year ago, in Q1, that was the first time in Keysight's history that we'd ever posted order growth moving from the end of Q4 into the first quarter of the new fiscal year. So we've got a tough compare from that perspective. In addition, as you all know, the U.S. dollar began to strengthen pretty significantly in the back half of this year. We estimate the FX headwind in our first quarter to be a full five percentage points. And so we've got a five-point FX headwind. And we estimate another two to three points of headwind from the recent increase in China trade restrictions as well as the loss of our Russia business, which happened in the second quarter of last year. So those things combined give us a seven- to eight-point headwind just coming out of the gate here as we enter the first quarter.\nChris Snyder: Appreciate that. And on the commentary that customers are taking longer to order, maybe they're ordering slower, how do you separate kind of the supply chain element of that from the demand element? Because if supply chains are generally moving in the right direction, I think that maybe customers will not kind of order with the same lead times or urgency that we saw last year.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Chris, I think you're right. I think as the supply chain continues to ease and the delivery duration that it takes for us to fulfill an order continues to pull in, you would expect some level of normalization as well. And we -- the reason we also put out the demand environment is moderating is we're starting to also see some of our customers who earnings -- whose earnings has fallen also put additional scrutiny on spend, right? And so that takes a little bit more time to close the deal as they go through their process. So those are some factors. Neil, I don't know if you want to -- I know you've commented on the normalization before.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. I guess the only other point that we make around that level is, if you look at our last three years, we've averaged a book-to-bill over the last three years of 1.09 driven first by COVID, obviously, then by the supply chain disruption that's happened over the last, say, 18 months. And so we've known for some time that, that book-to-bill had to normalize. And as our lead times come in, we would expect that normalization to occur. And so, as I think about it -- and again, we're not guiding orders, but a move of our book-to-bill back to a more normal level, something approaching one is not something that's going to impact our ability to continue to grow revenue.\nOperator: Our next line of questions comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini of SIG. Your line is now open.\nMehdi Hosseini: Two follow-ups. I want to go back to CapEx to 250. Should I assume that capital intensity will remain around 3% in fiscal year '23?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. So I mean one of the things that's happening with our CapEx is our capital purchases in this fiscal year were definitely impacted by the broader supply chain environment. And so we guided at the beginning of the year -- I'm talking about fiscal '22 now -- to CapEx that was close to $250 million, and we significantly underspent that from a cash flow perspective. But what you can't see is that our commits were very much in line with our original expectations. It just took longer for things to be delivered. And so, what we're seeing as we go into next year is a pretty dramatic scaling back of new capital purchases, but with a little bit of a cash flow overhang as we go into next year. And so that's what's going to carry our capital purchases up to that $250 million level in fiscal '23.\nMehdi Hosseini: So, I shouldn't use your CapEx guide to come up with some revenue guide or revenue growth expectation for fiscal '23? There is some cash flow as per the CapEx, right?\nNeil Dougherty: That's right.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay. And then, I want to go back to China. The APAC region as a percentage of revenue has remained in the low 40% over the past several years, including the headwind from Huawei. Should I assume that you're growing outside of China so much should extend that you're able to offset increased restriction on shipment to China? Is it just a mix within the APAC region that makes China kind of neutralized?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I think maybe as we have spoken before, we have a broad-based business in China. And despite the ongoing geopolitical situation, we have a demonstrated ability to pivot and address customers in that region. And given the focus there on technology development, I think we're seeing good demand in the region, but we're also seeing multinational companies that are creating -- that are moving out of China in some ways and into rest of Asia Pac and other parts of the world, including onshoring moves into North America, and we're successfully capturing some of that spend as well.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay. So the fact that the supply chain is moving out sort of China, that's positive. Now if I may, just a quick follow-up. So you do have more than 50% exposure to your customers' R&D budget. On top of that, there is a structural changes happening with the supply chain that is also positive. And those two factors on aggregate could offset some of the cyclicality nature or production-related sensibility or volatility. Is that the right way to think about this?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: I think that's what's playing out right now for us, yes.\nOperator: Our next line of questions comes from the line of Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nMatthew Niknam: Two, if I could. First on backlog. So you mentioned you ended the year at about $2.55 billion. I think our math would suggest something about $100 million higher, just relative to the 2.5 you mentioned last quarter. I'm just wondering if there's any order cancellations to be aware of or if there's an FX component affecting this? And then secondly, on the China trade restrictions, I think you'd called out a two to three percentage point headwind from those restrictions. I'm just wondering, is that incremental in fiscal 1Q? And is this primarily an EISG? Or could it show up elsewhere?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. So this is Neil. I'll take the backlog question and then let Mark address the China question. But yes, so you're -- I mean, obviously, our orders within the quarter outpaced revenue by a little bit more than $100 million. So we do continue to add to the backlog as we've gone throughout the year.\nMark Wallace: Yes. And Matt, the specific China trade situation that went into effect on October 7. So there wasn't much effect in our Q4. We will see some effect in our first quarter, but the 1% to 2% is projecting out over a run rate of the business for the entire year based on other situations. The other thing just to note is that we have not seen any changes in our cancellations. It's been running at a historically low level for the last four quarters, and that was the case again in Q4.\nOperator: Our next line of questions comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nAaron Rakers: Congrats on good execution in the quarter. I just want to at a high level go back to kind of the defensibility of the model, if I can. Can you remind us where the mix of the business stands today between R&D exposed versus, let's say, manufacturing exposed? And I guess on that same kind of thought process is that, where do you stand as far as the monetization effect of the software strategy? Where do we think that progresses to over the next year, whatever time frame you want to think about?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you for the question. I think at the highest level, we're at approximately 60% R&D today, 30% manufacturing and 10% deployments. So that's the sort of mix of the business. Clearly, we believe R&D secular, you look at some of the areas in R&D that we're focused on, that involve next-generation innovations such as with 5G and then 6G and automotive and digital health, so on and so forth. And it really gives us this diversity of applications that is -- gives us a resilience in this environment for sure. With regard to the software strategy, it, again, goes congruent with our with our go-to-market approach because we're here to enable innovations to happen faster. And the way we do that is by offering more software-centric solutions. So as we deploy more solutions to our customers, increasingly, that is in the form of growing software mix. And that goes, again, synergistic with our services strategy. So you look at our software and services revenue this year will end at 3% of the total mix and our ARR, or annual recurring revenue, has reached a new high of $1.2 billion. And we'll continue to invest to grow those portions of the business and increase our resilience and durability over time as well.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. And then as a quick follow-up, if I can. Just curious, when we think about the progression of backlog, and we appreciate that your backlog is only looking out on a forward six-month basis. And Neil, just curious, how should we think about what a normalized backlog level looks like?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. I mean given some of the dynamics that Satish just talked about, increasing software services, recurring revenue, we have seen growth in our deferred revenue over the same three-year period of time as well as our migration towards systems rather than tools, I think, will drive our ultimate backlog level when things normalize to be significantly higher than it was, say, pre-COVID in the 2018, 2019 time frame. And so I think we'll have to see how that plays out over time. I think again, we built -- you can do the math. We built well north of $1 billion of backlog over the course of the last three years as we've had this book-to-bill that I've mentioned of 1.09. And as our lead times come in, we're going to expect ordering patterns to adjust and lead times to pull in. I've said previously that there's probably four to five weeks' worth of kind of abnormal backlog as a result of a four- to five-week extension of lead times kind of on average would be a way to think about it.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: We're still in a supply challenge environment. While it's improving, supply is the constraining factor right now.\nOperator: Our next line of questions comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citi. Your line is now open.\nJim Suva: It's very noteworthy and impressive about your software and services, which I think is about 34%. Is it -- can you help us understand, like, reasonable growth as a percent of totality going forward? Because I would imagine it's very hard to ever get over 50%. Or are you looking at a point where it starts to level off around 35%? Or is that way too low, 40%? Where can this kind of feasibility go for software and services as you kind of look at adding these incremental benefits to your sales process?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Jim, I think as a strategy, as a company from -- in 2015, we've been focused on the software-centric solution strategy and really focused on our customers' most demanding and challenging problems that they have and solving this better than anyone else. And as we have continued to do that, our strategy has taken the form of not just prudency in sales, but our focus on this life cycle value creation for our customers, but also value capture for Keysight. And that's the journey we've been on. Some of the more newer solutions such as in Open RAN that we've talked about where we are seeing considerable traction, software alone is nearing 40%, 50% of the total sale value, and with a lot bigger portion of it being in the recurring category as well. So, we feel good about the continued traction we're seeing for our solutions. And so we continue to deploy the solution strategy over time, we will enter into new end market verticals. And as you've seen some examples I put out this latest earnings announcement, we've also had some successes in the automotive sector with deploying software and in the semiconductor as well with our design offerings. Mark may make some comments on the sales side.\nMark Wallace: Yes. Thanks, Satish. And Jim, what I would ask is the go-to-market, you mentioned that, and that is an important element of this. We are attaching upfront attached services and software. We're at about 60% for services today. I want to see that grow. So that's another stream of advancement. The other thing that you can see is we are delivering solutions more and more through updates to our software. If you think about our 5G solutions going from Release 15 to Release 16 and 17, much of that is software updates that creates additional opportunities for up-sell, cross-sell and, of course, recurring revenue as well. So there's -- and there's several elements of our go-to-market that we are deploying now to encourage that recurring growth and expansion of attachment upfront to our total solutions.\nJim Suva: Great. And then my follow-up is on the China. I think I heard two to three points of headwind. Is that for kind of the full fiscal year? Was there any, like, in calendar -- I'm sorry, fiscal Q4, like buying ahead of the rule changes? I'm just trying to kind of triangulate around the magnitude of it. And I assume after fiscal '23, it's kind of all out of the model from the rule changes.\nMark Wallace: Yes. Jim, I think we said one to two points of headwind for the entire fiscal year '23. And again, that's based on what we estimate as the run rate of business that won't be available to us with the new trade restrictions. There will be a little bit more in Q1 as we look at some of the backlog, but that's the run rate. And then there was another -- I think Neil mentioned another point of headwind with -- from Russia.\nOperator: Our next line of questions comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nMeta Marshall: In the past, you guys have talked about kind of the 5G peak was going to be much lower than kind of investors were expecting, but you kind of talked about a '23, '24 time period for the 5G peak. I just wanted to kind of get current thoughts on that and just how initiatives like ORAN or just some of the other initiatives are maybe extending that. And then maybe a second, you gave some context that you're seeing some loosening in supply chain. But just kind of what is current thinking? Is it still just a small amount of parts that you're kind of waiting to release? But just when do you see more general availability of those parts and just kind of a tightening between supply and demand?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you, Meta. I think on the 5G front, I think as we have always stated, there are multiple catalysts. I think about 18 months ago, I said the first catalyst was the C-band deployments in the U.S. That's played out as we had hoped, and we have captured a lot of that spend. We are pleased with some action that's happening in Asia and India, parts of India that have made commitments to roll out 5G. So that's, again, opportunity for us that's playing out right now. But the second and the third part to this is the millimeter wave opportunity. There's still some complex challenges with millimeter wave that customers are trying to solve. That continues to be a longer-term R&D opportunity for us as that deployment has continued to push out anyway -- scale deployments anyway. And lastly, as 5G is deployed, operators are looking to further monetize by adding the SA versions and new applications such as Open RAN continue to be gain traction across the global ecosystem. And so, the opportunity that we have in R&D continues to grow, and we're well positioned with the comprehensive offerings we have to address it. I also want to point out that we have a very diversified business. Yes, 5G gets a lot of attention, but we have secular trends in wireline evolutions, which we're well positioned to capitalize on based on the acquisitions of Ixia that we have made, and we continue to see traction there. Not to mention the newer additions to our go-to-market with automotive and with next-generation semiconductor nodes. So we run a diversified business, and I think that's a source of greater stability for us and over time. And the second part of the supply chain question that you asked is, at the beginning of last year, we took a series of actions to basically redesign our products to second source components, and we had a -- we've talked about it on earnings calls. And all those actions have really enabled us to do better than we expected every quarter. But as we think about the supply chain, I speak with a number of our semiconductor supply chain partners, and they're all putting actions in place to obviously increase capacity, but it still continues to be a constrained environment. We're not back to this pre-COVID sort of supply environment yet and might take all of '23 to get there from our best information right now.\nOperator: Our next line of questions comes from the line of David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Sure. You talked about some of the headwinds to revenue in the first quarter, but one tailwind not mentioned is pricing. And just sort of wondering how significant is pricing today versus more normal levels. I mean you're giving a couple of points tailwind from that. And then what type of volume growth is really embedded into first quarter's guidance?\nNeil Dougherty: What was the last part of the question? I'm sorry, David, I missed just that last part.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: The type of volume growth is embedded in the first quarter guidance.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. I mean I think the pricing question -- obviously, we've had -- we've been doing our best to keep pace with inflation. We've had multiple rounds of price increases over the course of the last 12 to 18 months, and those are embedded in the backlog. Although I think you can see based on the fact that we have maintained margins over the course of fiscal '22, it's flat at 65%, which frankly, I think in this inflationary environment was a very strong result that we're basically keeping pace on a margin basis with what we're seeing in terms of increases. And so -- and right now, while on the one side, yes, we have these increases that are embedded in our backlog and will continue to yield dividends and revenue, it's not like the inflationary elements have stopped in the cost structure as well. I referenced, for example, that we are going to be doing our salary administration for next year here in our fiscal first quarter. And this will be our second consecutive year with salary increases that are materially above our historic averages. As to the volume question, given the nature of our business where we're selling instruments that literally cost, in some cases, hundreds of dollars and, in other cases, cost $1 million, that's a very difficult question to answer. There's such a high deviation of mix that -- it's really hard to get to a meaningful answer on that question.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Sure. And as a follow-up, another tailwind here is autos, right? I think last quarter, you mentioned that it's basically doubled over the last two years. This quarter, you mentioned $500 million in orders. So it's nearing close to 10% of your orders in this fiscal year. Do you feel like the trend there is kind of I don't want to say, not cyclical -- not subject to sort of macroeconomic condition, but certainly has a strong secular element to it.\nMark Wallace: David, this is Mark. I'll answer that. The growth we're seeing is coming from next generation mobility. There's some continuing R&D on the electronics side that's more conventional, but the growth in new mobility is sustaining. It is secular. And it doesn't just stop at the vehicle. It goes out into the charging infrastructure, into the underlying battery technologies. And we've seen what's happened here in the last year with different countries and different regulations pushing this further toward adoption. The adoption in Europe is very strong and growing fast, in other regions as well. And our position in the market is very strong, helping our customers design and deploy this next-generation technology from the batteries to the charging infrastructure and then add, on top of that, all the connectivity and communications and protocols, as we talked about in the prepared statement. So, this is really a great intersection of multiple strengths for us, and it has long-term secular growth drivers behind them.\nOperator: Our next line of question comes from the line of Rob Mason with Baird. Your line is now open.\nRob Mason: Neil, I wanted to just clarify, you mentioned that R&D I thought would be roughly 16% of revenue this year. I just want to make sure that's correct because that's about one point more than it was this past year in '22. And just I'm curious how that steps up. And what does an exit rate look like if that's the case?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. So you're right. Obviously, our 16% or 16% plus has been our long-term target. We under spent that here in FY '22. I think a big function of that was the revenue outperformance within the year. If you remember, this time last year, we guided you to 6% revenue growth on the year, and we actually grew 12% on a core basis. And so, our R&D plans for the year were much more aligned with that lower level of revenue growth. So, I think as we go -- we certainly continue to see a large amount of opportunity for us to continue to invest in the future growth of our business, a lot of pull from our customers to do R&D work. And so, our intent is to revamp back towards 16% of revenue. Obviously, the salary administration here in the first quarter is going to help to move us in that direction. We may not get to 16% here in the first quarter, but looking at an exit rate that's at 16% or even potentially a little bit above by the time you get out to the fourth quarter is not out of the question.\nRob Mason: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then to the extent the supply chain does still remain somewhat tight through the year, how are you thinking about working capital? And any ability or -- to pull that down as you go through the year, what are you thinking about working capital contribution for the year?\nNeil Dougherty: Well, I certainly think over the longer term that as the supply chain normalizes, there will be an opportunity for us to reduce some of the working capital that's built up over the course of the last year. We see it in terms of inventory, at least inventory via the prices that we're paying for parts. We see it money tied up in terms of commitments to buy future inventory where we paid in advance for future delivery -- has been a use of working capital that, frankly, is new over the course of the last 12 months. And then frankly, the supply chain situation has significantly impacted the linearity of our revenue within the quarter. You can imagine when you move from more of a just-in-time environment where you're just building and shipping and building and shipping. We're doing a lot more build to a certain stage, wait for parts, finish and ship. And so, our revenue is tended to be more back-end loaded, which results in us carrying more receivables at the end of the quarter than we would if we were shipping in a more linear fashion. So again, I think it's a function of how does supply chain normalize and when does that eventually happen? That is -- you need a little bit of a crystal ball to answer that question. But when it does happen, we would see -- we would expect to see an ability to reduce working capital.\nOperator: That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back to Jason Kary for any closing remarks.\nJason Kary: Thank you, Dante, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. As he mentioned, that concludes the call, and we wish you all a good evening and look forward to seeing you soon.\nOperator: This concludes our conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Mark Wallace",
            "content": "Chris, this is Mark. I'll take that and add a little bit more detail here. So as Satish said, our order level was steady throughout the quarter. So, we're watching this, right, because if customers are taking more time to make decisions, you would look for orders to slow down. They did not. As a matter of fact, October was very strong. It was a record October for us in terms of orders. So that's good. You've heard us talk about before the addition of new customers. We've added about 450 this quarter again for nearly 2,000 new customers across the whole year. So that creates more diversity and durability to our business, and I see that paying off. Our top 20 customers in the quarter were up strong double digits as well. So, all of that continues to translate to the fact that we did not see an impact to our business because of the customers taking more time. And I think it also has to do with the fact that we are so biased toward R&D and design optimization. And as we've seen through other waves in the recent term where market slowed, the advanced technology development continues. So that's what we see, but we look around and we do see some macro uncertainty. And from my seat, what I see in terms of order or in terms of customer activities is very active customers. Our six-month funnel continues to grow, but customers are taking more time to make ultimate CapEx decisions. Yes. And Matt, the specific China trade situation that went into effect on October 7. So there wasn't much effect in our Q4. We will see some effect in our first quarter, but the 1% to 2% is projecting out over a run rate of the business for the entire year based on other situations. The other thing just to note is that we have not seen any changes in our cancellations. It's been running at a historically low level for the last four quarters, and that was the case again in Q4. Yes. Thanks, Satish. And Jim, what I would ask is the go-to-market, you mentioned that, and that is an important element of this. We are attaching upfront attached services and software. We're at about 60% for services today. I want to see that grow. So that's another stream of advancement. The other thing that you can see is we are delivering solutions more and more through updates to our software. If you think about our 5G solutions going from Release 15 to Release 16 and 17, much of that is software updates that creates additional opportunities for up-sell, cross-sell and, of course, recurring revenue as well. So there's -- and there's several elements of our go-to-market that we are deploying now to encourage that recurring growth and expansion of attachment upfront to our total solutions. Yes. Jim, I think we said one to two points of headwind for the entire fiscal year '23. And again, that's based on what we estimate as the run rate of business that won't be available to us with the new trade restrictions. There will be a little bit more in Q1 as we look at some of the backlog, but that's the run rate. And then there was another -- I think Neil mentioned another point of headwind with -- from Russia. David, this is Mark. I'll answer that. The growth we're seeing is coming from next generation mobility. There's some continuing R&D on the electronics side that's more conventional, but the growth in new mobility is sustaining. It is secular. And it doesn't just stop at the vehicle.

            "name": "Neil Dougherty",
            "content": "Thank you, Satish, and hello, everyone. We delivered an outstanding fourth quarter of 2022 with record revenue of $1.443 billion, which was above the high end of our guidance range and grew 11% or 15% on a core basis. Our strategies to navigate the ongoing supply constraints continue to be effective. While the supply chain situation improved within the quarter, it continues to moderate our near-term revenue expectations. Record orders of $1.570 billion increased 5% or 9% on a core basis, and we entered fiscal year 2023 with over $2.5 billion in backlog. Looking at our operational results for Q4, we reported gross margin of 64%, which, as expected, was down 80 basis points sequentially due to inflationary pressures and increased shipments of lower-end instruments, enabled by the improving supply chain. Operating expenses of $494 million were well managed, and we generated operating margin of 30%. Net income was a record $386 million, and we achieved $2.14 in earnings per share, which was $0.14 above the high end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 180 million shares. Foreign exchange impact on our earnings was negligible, thanks to a full natural hedge provided by our global footprint, which was then supplemented by our financial hedging program. Moving to the performance of our segments. The Communications Solutions Group achieved record revenue of $992 million, up 8% or 11% on a core basis. CSG delivered gross margin of 66% and operating margin of 29%. Commercial communications generated revenue of $681 million in the fourth quarter, up 10% driven by strength across the 5G ecosystem, increasing O-RAN adoption and investment in 800 gigabit and 1.6 terabit R&D. Aerospace, defense and government achieved record revenue of $311 million, up 4%, driven by double-digit growth in Asia Pacific and Europe. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group achieved record revenue of $451 million, up 20% or 25% on a core basis, driven by strength across all markets. EISG reported gross margin of 60% and operating margin of 32%. Turning to our full year financial performance. Keysight delivered outstanding results in 2022 despite ongoing supply constraints, foreign exchange headwinds and incremental trade restrictions. FY '22 revenue totaled $5.4 billion, up 10% year-over-year or 12% on a core basis. Gross margin was flat at 65%, holding steady in the face of significant inflation. We invested $813 million in R&D, while operating margin improved 140 basis points to 29%. FY '22 non-GAAP net income was $1.4 billion or $7.63 per share, up 22%. Moving on to balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our fourth quarter with more than $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generating cash flow from operations of $398 million and free cash flow of $340 million. Total free cash flow for the year was $959 million, representing 18% of revenue and 69% of non-GAAP net income. Share repurchases this quarter totaled approximately 800,000 shares at an average price per share of $158.77 for a total consideration of $126 million. This brings our total share repurchases for the year to approximately 5.4 million shares at an average share price of $156.09 for a total consideration of $849 million or 89% of free cash flow. Now turning to our outlook and guidance. We exit the year with record backlog and confidence in Keysight's ability to continue executing through near-term uncertainties. As a result, we expect first quarter 2023 revenue to be in the range of $1.360 billion to $1.380 billion and Q1 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.81 to $1.87 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 180 million shares. A few modeling reminders as we enter the year. Our annual compensation cycle is administered in Q1. And in this current inflationary environment, we expect our second consecutive year of wage increases above our historic average. We are targeting FY '23 R&D investment at approximately 16% of revenue. Annual interest expense is expected to be approximately $80 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $250 million, and we are modeling a 12% non-GAAP effective tax rate for FY '23. In closing, we recognize the uncertainty of the current macro environment, and we'll continue to be disciplined. Keysight's highly flexible cost structure, track record of execution, diverse end markets and long-term secular growth drivers give us confidence in our ability to outperform the market. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A. Yes. And this is Neil. I just give you a little bit maybe more quantification of the situation going into Q1. So while we don't guide orders, I would point out that we have a bit of a difficult compare here in the first quarter. A year ago, in Q1, that was the first time in Keysight's history that we'd ever posted order growth moving from the end of Q4 into the first quarter of the new fiscal year. So we've got a tough compare from that perspective. In addition, as you all know, the U.S. dollar began to strengthen pretty significantly in the back half of this year. We estimate the FX headwind in our first quarter to be a full five percentage points. And so we've got a five-point FX headwind. And we estimate another two to three points of headwind from the recent increase in China trade restrictions as well as the loss of our Russia business, which happened in the second quarter of last year. So those things combined give us a seven- to eight-point headwind just coming out of the gate here as we enter the first quarter. Yes. I guess the only other point that we make around that level is, if you look at our last three years, we've averaged a book-to-bill over the last three years of 1.09 driven first by COVID, obviously, then by the supply chain disruption that's happened over the last, say, 18 months. And so we've known for some time that, that book-to-bill had to normalize. And as our lead times come in, we would expect that normalization to occur. And so, as I think about it -- and again, we're not guiding orders, but a move of our book-to-bill back to a more normal level, something approaching one is not something that's going to impact our ability to continue to grow revenue. Yes. So I mean one of the things that's happening with our CapEx is our capital purchases in this fiscal year were definitely impacted by the broader supply chain environment. And so we guided at the beginning of the year -- I'm talking about fiscal '22 now -- to CapEx that was close to $250 million, and we significantly underspent that from a cash flow perspective. But what you can't see is that our commits were very much in line with our original expectations. It just took longer for things to be delivered. And so, what we're seeing as we go into next year is a pretty dramatic scaling back of new capital purchases, but with a little bit of a cash flow overhang as we go into next year. And so that's what's going to carry our capital purchases up to that $250 million level in fiscal '23. That's right. Yes. So this is Neil. I'll take the backlog question and then let Mark address the China question. But yes, so you're -- I mean, obviously, our orders within the quarter outpaced revenue by a little bit more than $100 million. So we do continue to add to the backlog as we've gone throughout the year. Yes. I mean given some of the dynamics that Satish just talked about, increasing software services, recurring revenue, we have seen growth in our deferred revenue over the same three-year period of time as well as our migration towards systems rather than tools, I think, will drive our ultimate backlog level when things normalize to be significantly higher than it was, say, pre-COVID in the 2018, 2019 time frame. And so I think we'll have to see how that plays out over time. I think again, we built -- you can do the math. We built well north of $1 billion of backlog over the course of the last three years as we've had this book-to-bill that I've mentioned of 1.09. And as our lead times come in, we're going to expect ordering patterns to adjust and lead times to pull in. I've said previously that there's probably four to five weeks' worth of kind of abnormal backlog as a result of a four- to five-week extension of lead times kind of on average would be a way to think about it. What was the last part of the question? I'm sorry, David, I missed just that last part. Yes. I mean I think the pricing question -- obviously, we've had -- we've been doing our best to keep pace with inflation. We've had multiple rounds of price increases over the course of the last 12 to 18 months, and those are embedded in the backlog. Although I think you can see based on the fact that we have maintained margins over the course of fiscal '22, it's flat at 65%, which frankly, I think in this inflationary environment was a very strong result that we're basically keeping pace on a margin basis with what we're seeing in terms of increases. And so -- and right now, while on the one side, yes, we have these increases that are embedded in our backlog and will continue to yield dividends and revenue, it's not like the inflationary elements have stopped in the cost structure as well. I referenced, for example, that we are going to be doing our salary administration for next year here in our fiscal first quarter. And this will be our second consecutive year with salary increases that are materially above our historic averages. As to the volume question, given the nature of our business where we're selling instruments that literally cost, in some cases, hundreds of dollars and, in other cases, cost $1 million, that's a very difficult question to answer. There's such a high deviation of mix that -- it's really hard to get to a meaningful answer on that question. Yes. So you're right. Obviously, our 16% or 16% plus has been our long-term target. We under spent that here in FY '22. I think a big function of that was the revenue outperformance within the year. If you remember, this time last year, we guided you to 6% revenue growth on the year, and we actually grew 12% on a core basis. And so, our R&D plans for the year were much more aligned with that lower level of revenue growth. So, I think as we go -- we certainly continue to see a large amount of opportunity for us to continue to invest in the future growth of our business, a lot of pull from our customers to do R&D work. And so, our intent is to revamp back towards 16% of revenue. Obviously, the salary administration here in the first quarter is going to help to move us in that direction. We may not get to 16% here in the first quarter, but looking at an exit rate that's at 16% or even potentially a little bit above by the time you get out to the fourth quarter is not out of the question. Well, I certainly think over the longer term that as the supply chain normalizes, there will be an opportunity for us to reduce some of the working capital that's built up over the course of the last year.

            "name": "Satish Dhanasekaran",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. Keysight reported strong fourth quarter results, which exceeded the high end of our guidance and drove a strong finish to the year. Before we get into the quarter, I want to highlight our exceptional performance for fiscal year, which illustrates continued progress we're making in transforming the Company to a software-centric solutions provider. We set new records for orders, which grew 12% to $6 billion, a new record for revenue, which was up 10%, and a new record for earnings per share, which increased 22%, all the while returning capital through $849 million in share repurchases or 89% of free cash flow. In addition, we continue to invest in next-generation technologies for long-term differentiation and see a high level of engagement and activity with our customers around their future needs. Today, I'll focus my comments on three key headlines. First, we delivered an all-time record revenue and earnings per share in the fourth quarter ahead of expectations enabled by outstanding execution by Keysight teams who successfully navigated supply chain, geopolitical and macro dynamics. Second, we achieved record orders of $1.6 billion with steady bookings throughout the quarter and a book-to-bill of 1.09. While our customers' multiyear road maps remain unchanged, they are exercising more caution given the macro backdrop, which we anticipate will moderate demand in the near term. Third, as we enter fiscal '23, we remain confident in our ability to outperform the market based on the differentiation of our solutions, our strong R&D customer value proposition and the robust backlog position we have entering the year. And as we look longer term, the secular innovation trends in our end markets remain strong. Now let's take a deeper look at the strength of the fourth quarter. Record orders of $1.6 billion grew 9% on a core basis. Record revenue grew 15% on a core basis, with solid growth across all regions as Keysight team successfully navigated challenging dynamics. This resulted in record quarterly earnings of $2.14 per share. The strength and resiliency of our business model is due to our strategic efforts to diversify our industry exposure. This has been best exemplified in the growth of our Electronic Industrial Solutions Group and our ability to leverage our industry-leading first-to-market solutions to enable expansion across the broader communications ecosystem. EISG achieved its ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit order and revenue growth. Auto, semiconductor solutions and general electronics all achieved record quarterly revenue. For the year, both orders and revenues set new records as we capitalize on continued investments across all three EISG markets. In automotive, we're pleased with the continued adoption of our solutions portfolio as orders grew double digits for the seventh consecutive quarter and exceeded $500 million this year. Automotive OEMs and their suppliers continue to focus on strategic new mobility investments, which drove key wins for Keysight. In addition, automotive-focused semiconductor companies continue to add capabilities to support EV and AV applications, which we view as a favorable long-term dynamic. We recently announced the Scienlab DC Emulator, which enables customers to accurately characterize high-voltage, high-power electric vehicle battery performance under varying real-world charging conditions. And Keysight's PathWave Lab's operation software won 2022 AutoTech Breakthrough Award for overall electric vehicle technology. In support of AV applications, silicon designers are exploring adoption of commercial standards such as MIPI for automotive and other surround sensor applications, including cameras and in-vehicle infotainment displays. We are now expanding our leading compliance test solutions to offer advanced verification and diagnostic capabilities for automotive designers. Turning to our semiconductor solutions business. Q4 was the tenth consecutive quarter of double-digit order book and a record revenue quarter. We saw sustained demand for our wafer test solutions and precision positioning capabilities, which enable the realization of advanced process nodes. In addition, Keysight has continued to partner with industry leaders, Synopsys and Ansys, on RF and millimeter wave integrated circuit design flows built for today's wireless communication requirements, including 5G and 6G system-on-chips. Keysight received a Partner of the Year Award from TSMC for joint development design flows in RF and millimeter wave nodes. In general electronics, record orders grew double digits this quarter as demand remains strong and broad-based across industrial IoT and digital health as well as education and advanced research markets. Turning to Communication Solutions Group. The business delivered strong orders and record revenue. Annual orders and revenue were all-time highs despite geopolitical headwinds and delays in U.S. Defense budget appropriations. Commercial communications revenue grew 10% and 11% for the year, with growth across all regions. Investments across communications ecosystem continued throughout the year with sustained spending in next-generation wireless and wireline technologies. Ongoing investments in 5G standards, new spectrum growing deployments around the world and steady evolution from 400 gig to 800 gig to terabit Ethernet drove growth. We ended a record year for 5G orders as Keysight's market-leading solutions continue to provide industry with new capabilities needed for development of next-generation devices as well as wireless and wireline networks. Examples that highlight our portfolio's alignment with key industry priority include a recent partnership with IBM to integrate our Open RAN capabilities into their cloud automation tools to accelerate network deployments. We also completed the validation of our first 5G location-based service use case from Global Certification Forum by combining the testing of 5G new radio and global navigation satellite system technologies into a single platform. Lastly, in collaboration with key silicon and data center partners, we enabled the industry's first 1.6 terabit transmission and data center interconnect, leveraging our high-speed digital solutions. Aerospace, defense and government business revenue grew 4% for the quarter and 3% for the year, setting a new record while navigating geopolitical headwinds. Steady investments in spectrum operations, cybersecurity and space and satellite drove demand. 5G continued to expand in aerospace and defense end markets, and we saw increasing investment in advanced research. Proposed increases in investment in the U.S. and allied countries for modernization of defense capabilities and new satellite and space applications position us well for future opportunities. As an integral part of our solution strategy, software and services order and revenue growth this year continued to outpace Keysight overall, which has driven our annual recurring revenue to approximately $1.2 billion. Software and services again represented just over 1/3 of Keysight's total revenue for the year. Keysight's focus on customer success and innovation is driving our development of first-to-market, high-value solutions. Our achievements over the years exemplify Keysight's collaborative culture and our talented workforce, and we are honored that Keysight has placed tenth on the Fortune's Best Workplaces in Technology list for 2022. We believe our differentiated culture gives us a unique ability to recruit and develop capable talent and will be our sustaining competitive advantage. In conclusion, I would like to thank our employees for all their contributions, commitment and strong track record of execution. In the midst of an uncertain economic environment, we remain confident in the resilience of our business, the strength of our balance sheet and the flexibility of our operating model. Now, I'll turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail. Thank you, Angela. Yes, we're very pleased with the quarter. And in consideration of this environment, pretty strong results and also a strong finish to the year. And as I stated, we saw a steady level of spend from a demand perspective through the quarter. All our regions from a sales perspective grew. So it was broad-based. And going into a little bit on the end market color, I would say 5G continues to remain strong. We grew our 5G orders double-digit, strength in R&D. And also with the inflections that we're seeing in deployments around some parts of the world, even some of the manufacturing spend there remains strong for us this quarter. And we did see pockets of weakness in the broad component ecosystem, and that was an area we obviously watch carefully, and that is related to the smartphone demand. And if you look at the cloud and data center markets in wireline, while some of the cloud -- direct cloud spend from cloud providers was pushed out -- service providers was pushed out, the broad spend to adopt 400 gig and 800 gig continues to remain strong. So they focus on R&D, and new innovations remain strong. Moving on to aerospace and defense business, obviously, it was still a strong quarter for us, but we did not see the typical year-end surge that we would expect given the budget appropriations process. And then moving to EISG end markets, all of the markets remain strong, right? Automotive, we had strong double-digit growth as continued investments and inflection from EV and AV are playing out. Semiconductor is an area we watch carefully. But because of our exposure into the wafer stage equipment process and new node -- specifically new nodes, that remains strong. And lastly, the general electronics business, which typically gets -- part of its spend from PMI continued to remain strong from a demand perspective. So I would say we're doing well, and the customer activity with our customers and engagements remain strong and quite pleased with the -- with our quarter in this environment. Yes. We remain confident, Angela, with what we see so far. Obviously, it's an uncertain environment. So, we're guiding one quarter at a time. You see the confidence reflected in our Q1 guide, which we feel good about. And as we look forward, we'll look at the demand environment, and we'll keep you updated as we go. Yes. Chris, I think you're right. I think as the supply chain continues to ease and the delivery duration that it takes for us to fulfill an order continues to pull in, you would expect some level of normalization as well. And we -- the reason we also put out the demand environment is moderating is we're starting to also see some of our customers who earnings -- whose earnings has fallen also put additional scrutiny on spend, right? And so that takes a little bit more time to close the deal as they go through their process. So those are some factors. Neil, I don't know if you want to -- I know you've commented on the normalization before. Yes. I think maybe as we have spoken before, we have a broad-based business in China. And despite the ongoing geopolitical situation, we have a demonstrated ability to pivot and address customers in that region. And given the focus there on technology development, I think we're seeing good demand in the region, but we're also seeing multinational companies that are creating -- that are moving out of China in some ways and into rest of Asia Pac and other parts of the world, including onshoring moves into North America, and we're successfully capturing some of that spend as well. I think that's what's playing out right now for us, yes. Yes. Thank you for the question. I think at the highest level, we're at approximately 60% R&D today, 30% manufacturing and 10% deployments. So that's the sort of mix of the business. Clearly, we believe R&D secular, you look at some of the areas in R&D that we're focused on, that involve next-generation innovations such as with 5G and then 6G and automotive and digital health, so on and so forth. And it really gives us this diversity of applications that is -- gives us a resilience in this environment for sure. With regard to the software strategy, it, again, goes congruent with our with our go-to-market approach because we're here to enable innovations to happen faster. And the way we do that is by offering more software-centric solutions. So as we deploy more solutions to our customers, increasingly, that is in the form of growing software mix. And that goes, again, synergistic with our services strategy. So you look at our software and services revenue this year will end at 3% of the total mix and our ARR, or annual recurring revenue, has reached a new high of $1.2 billion. And we'll continue to invest to grow those portions of the business and increase our resilience and durability over time as well. We're still in a supply challenge environment. While it's improving, supply is the constraining factor right now. Yes. Jim, I think as a strategy, as a company from -- in 2015, we've been focused on the software-centric solution strategy and really focused on our customers' most demanding and challenging problems that they have and solving this better than anyone else. And as we have continued to do that, our strategy has taken the form of not just prudency in sales, but our focus on this life cycle value creation for our customers, but also value capture for Keysight. And that's the journey we've been on. Some of the more newer solutions such as in Open RAN that we've talked about where we are seeing considerable traction, software alone is nearing 40%, 50% of the total sale value, and with a lot bigger portion of it being in the recurring category as well. So, we feel good about the continued traction we're seeing for our solutions. And so we continue to deploy the solution strategy over time, we will enter into new end market verticals. And as you've seen some examples I put out this latest earnings announcement, we've also had some successes in the automotive sector with deploying software and in the semiconductor as well with our design offerings. Mark may make some comments on the sales side. Yes. Thank you, Meta. I think on the 5G front, I think as we have always stated, there are multiple catalysts. I think about 18 months ago, I said the first catalyst was the C-band deployments in the U.S. That's played out as we had hoped, and we have captured a lot of that spend. We are pleased with some action that's happening in Asia and India, parts of India that have made commitments to roll out 5G. So that's, again, opportunity for us that's playing out right now. But the second and the third part to this is the millimeter wave opportunity. There's still some complex challenges with millimeter wave that customers are trying to solve. That continues to be a longer-term R&D opportunity for us as that deployment has continued to push out anyway -- scale deployments anyway. And lastly, as 5G is deployed, operators are looking to further monetize by adding the SA versions and new applications such as Open RAN continue to be gain traction across the global ecosystem. And so, the opportunity that we have in R&D continues to grow, and we're well positioned with the comprehensive offerings we have to address it. I also want to point out that we have a very diversified business. Yes, 5G gets a lot of attention, but we have secular trends in wireline evolutions, which we're well positioned to capitalize on based on the acquisitions of Ixia that we have made, and we continue to see traction there. Not to mention the newer additions to our go-to-market with automotive and with next-generation semiconductor nodes. So we run a diversified business, and I think that's a source of greater stability for us and over time. And the second part of the supply chain question that you asked is, at the beginning of last year, we took a series of actions to basically redesign our products to second source components, and we had a -- we've talked about it on earnings calls. And all those actions have really enabled us to do better than we expected every quarter. But as we think about the supply chain, I speak with a number of our semiconductor supply chain partners, and they're all putting actions in place to obviously increase capacity, but it still continues to be a constrained environment. We're not back to this pre-COVID sort of supply environment yet and might take all of '23 to get there from our best information right now."

Keysight Technologies delivered another exceptional quarter with both revenue and EPS, our earnings per share exceeding the high-end of our guidance. Our outperformance reflects the effectiveness of our strategy, outstanding execution by our teams around the world, and the strength of our operating model. Keysight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deep customer engagements with industry leaders and high-value differentiated solutions continue to drive broad-based demand across key technology megatrends. I will focus my comments today on three key headlines. First, outstanding execution by the Keysight teams around the world resulted in an all-time record revenue and earnings per share as we saw some supply constraints ease as the quarter progressed. Second, we saw strong order growth and sustained demand across all end markets and regions. Third, we are once again raising our full year outlook. We now expect to achieve revenue growth approaching 9% and earnings per share growth of approximately 20% for the full fiscal year. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now take a deeper look at our results for the quarter. Third quarter orders grew 12% to $1.46 billion and outpaced record revenue, which grew 10% to $1.38 billion. Record EPS of $2.01, grew 31%. Orders and revenue growth in both business segments and across all regions is evidence of our ability to deliver value for customers as we manage macro and supply dynamics. Software revenue achieved an all-time high, outpacing total Keysight revenue growth, expanding our recurring revenue profile to further strengthen the durability of our business. Our software-centric solution strategy is a key differentiator in rapidly evolving design, systems emulation and modeling environments. We recently introduced PathWave Advanced Design System 2023 to address growing complexity in ultra-high frequency designs. We also announced that Keysight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Open RAN solutions are moving to cloud-based deployment to support our customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 needs as networks evolve to more software-enabled virtualized architectures. Turning to our business segments. The Communications Solutions Group delivered all-time record revenue and record third quarter orders. Commercial Communications achieved record revenue with growth across all industry segments and regions. Innovation dynamics across the Communications ecosystem remains strong, driving demand Keysight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comprehensive end-to-end portfolio for both the wireless and wireline ecosystems. In wireless, 5G continues to represent an innovation-rich environment for the industry. Our differentiated software-centric solutions enable customers to address the growing complexity of use cases, frequency band combinations, real-world connectivity and mobility challenges. We continue to evolve our 5G platform to meet the requirements of emerging applications and newer versions of the standards. In collaboration with, Intel, Radisys, Vodafone and Wind River, we recently showcased an industry-first demonstration, deploying Keysight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s O-RAN and solutions to help reduce power consumption in a multi-vendor Open RAN network. AI-LINK, a provider of industrial IoT offerings, used Keysight solutions for end-to-end performance validation of cloud-native radio access network infrastructure. In wireline, we continue to see strong demand for 400 gig, 800 gig and photonics applications. We recently collaborated with Nokia to demonstrate the first public 800-gig interoperability test, validating the robustness of ultra-high data rates in telco networks and data center environments for the expected increase in AI, ML network workloads. Record Q3 orders in aerospace, defense and government outpaced revenue, which grew 1% on a core basis versus a strong growth quarter last year. Budget appropriations began to flow as reflected in prime contractor spending in the U.S., while 5G investments continued to grow to address new use cases such as RADAR and 5G coexistence. We also saw strong strength in satellite and space, including new applications for nonterrestrial networks. Over the next several years, we expect this market will benefit from elevated investments in technology modernization. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group delivered double-digit order and revenue growth for the eighth consecutive quarter, with momentum from continued investments in next-generation technologies across automotive, industrial IoT and semiconductor end markets. In automotive, we are pleased with the continued broad adoption of our solutions portfolio, with the business nearly doubling over the past 2 years. Orders grew strong double-digits for the sixth consecutive quarter, and we delivered all-time record revenue. Keysight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s contributions to the advancement of EV and AV technologies, which include vehicle intelligence, connectivity, power and security are fueling momentum with leading car manufacturers and helped us secure wins with giga factories around the world. Keysight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s award-winning Radar Scene Emulator is the only solution on the market to imitate realistic roadway scenarios in a lab environment, and was chosen by a leading U.S. auto manufacturer for testing and validation of autonomous drive systems. This quarter, we completed another tuck-in acquisition in the automotive space, further adding to our software technology and technical staff focused on vehicle-to-everything communications. We continue to invest as we target evolving opportunities in the future of transportation. In general electronics, we achieved double-digit order growth and all-time record revenue as investments continued in digital health, IoT and advanced research. In educational research, Keysight is partnering with global leaders such as Nanyang Technological University in Singapore to advance 6G technology. Together with Sauce Labs, our Eggplant business delivered artificial intelligence-driven testing of enterprise applications. The acceleration in our general electronics business reflects the broad scope of our portfolio of leading technology solutions. Record orders for our semiconductor solutions resulted in ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit order growth driven by capacity expansion of mature foundries to address pent-up demand in the market and investments in advanced processes. Keysight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s PathWave design solutions expands our collaboration with major foundries beyond parametric wafer test into emerging applications like silicon photonics and next-generation design and simulation applications. While we continue to successfully execute our strategy, we recognize the near-term macroeconomic uncertainties. Keysight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sustained performance over time is evidence of the resilience and durability of our business. Our resilience is an outcome of enduring partnerships with market-leading customers with early engagement to develop software-centric solutions that enable them to solve their most critical development challenges and achieve their first-to-market goals. Durability is a product of our flexible operating model designed to quickly respond to variations in demand while investing in critical long-term priorities. These strengths give us confidence that we can navigate uncertainties, and continue to deliver superior results going forward. Of course, all of this is made possible by our talented people. Steadfast execution by our teams, especially in a challenging environment, is proof that our Keysight leadership model delivers results, empowering our inclusive and diverse culture which fosters collaboration, high performance and innovation. We recently released our first diversity, equity and inclusion report as we renewed and strengthened Keysight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s longstanding commitment to DE&I and to being a great place to work for our global workforce of more than 14,000. With that, I will turn the call over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook.\nNeil Dougherty: Thank you, Satish and hello everyone. We delivered strong third quarter results, successfully navigating ongoing supply chain and other headwinds. Third quarter 2022 revenue of $1.376 billion was $26 million above the high end of our guidance range, and grew 10% or 13% on a core basis. We generated $1.461 billion in orders, up 12% or 14% on a core basis, and we ended the quarter with $2.5 billion in backlog. Turning to our operational results for Q3, we reported gross margin of 65%, holding steady in the face of significant inflation and currency headwinds. Operating expenses were $480 million, resulting in an operating margin of 30%. We used a number of strategies to effectively navigate supply chain challenges, including product redesign, alternate sourcing and increased supplier and customer engagement. We achieved net income of $363 million and delivered $2.01 in earnings per share, which was $0.21 above the high end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 181 million shares. Despite significant currency headwinds on the top line, we saw negligible FX impact to earnings due to the meaningful natural hedge provided by our global footprint that has been supplemented by our financial hedging program. Moving to the performance of our segments, our Communications Solutions Group generated record revenue of $970 million, up 11% or 13% on a core basis. CSG delivered gross margin of 67% and record operating margin of 30%. Within CSG, commercial communications generated record revenue of $694 million, up 17% or 19% on a core basis, driven by 5G, O-RAN, 400 gigabit, 800 gigabit and high-speed digital applications. Aerospace and defense and government revenue of $276 million was down 2% and up 1% on a core basis. Our backlog for this end market remains strong, and we continue to expect increasing defense budgets in the U.S., Europe and Japan to provide support for higher spending going forward. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated third quarter revenue of $406 million, up 10% or 13% on a core basis, driven by strong revenue growth across all end markets and regions. EISG reported gross margin of 61% and operating margin of 31%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the third quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generated cash flow from operations of $224 million and free cash flow of $192 million or 14% of revenue. Share repurchases this quarter totaled 1.6 million shares at an average price per share of $139.46 for a total consideration of $228 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately 4.6 million shares for a total consideration of $723 million. Now turning to our outlook and guidance. Demand remains strong for Keysight solutions. Our funnel is near historic high levels, and we exit the quarter with a record backlog. We now expect full year revenue growth to approach 9% or 11% on a core basis with EPS in the range of $7.43 and to $7.49, representing growth of 20% at the midpoint. Fourth quarter 2022 revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.38 billion to $1.4 billion, with earnings per share in the range of $1.94 to $2, based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 180 million shares. In closing, Keysight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resilient business, consistent execution and flexible cost structure give us confidence in our ability to capitalize on the long-term secular growth trends and deliver above-market profitable growth in 2023 and beyond. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.\nJason Kary: Thanks, Satish and Neil, for your comments. Amber, would you please give the instructions for the Q&A?\nOperator:  Our first question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citi. Jim, your line is now open.\nJim Suva: Thank you and congratulations to you and your entire team and company. My question is\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Jim.\nJim Suva: Yes. Automotive traditionally hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been a big focus area for Keysight. You provided a little bit of commentary on it, but it appears that the car of the future and all the cars that are rolling out have a much bigger need for \u00e2\u0080\u0093 whether it be EV, battery calibration, sensors positioning. How much is automotive for you? What has kind of been growing? And importantly, is there like long-term visibility? Are you in that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in the production side of things also, or just only in the R&D traditionally, I think about you more as R&D, but it seems like you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re kind of a little bit more into production or long life on automotive? But if you could pontificate on automotive sector, a little bit, that would be great. Thank you.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes, sure, Jim. As you noted, this is one of the new expansion opportunities that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re incredibly excited about, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re continuing to build momentum. And as you saw emerging from the pandemic, this big acceleration into EV and AV has just gotten started. And from a manufacturing perspective, yes, we have some exposure to it, but it is this proliferation of electronics content that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s causing automakers to ramp up production as supply becomes lesser and lesser of an issue over time. So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all about testing their EV capabilities in the manufacturing environment. So we have some exposure to that. We are very excited by this big trend we see that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to play out over the next 10 years where auto makers are going to increasingly invest in organic R&D capabilities needed to differentiate their platform over others. And that involves software and hardware, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great fit for the broad array of tools that we offer to every electrical engineer in the planet that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re now selling into the automakers. But equally, the growing emphasis we have put on \u00e2\u0080\u0093 growing our footprint in EV. As an example, this quarter, we had some design wins with some giga factories that are coming up just getting started in the Radar Scene Emulator solution, which really allows you to take a car, turn on all the sensors and really see how we behave in the real world, very unique solution offering. And we had a design win with a major North American car manufacturer. So just getting started, very excited about the opportunity and strong double-digit growth in orders this quarter.\nJim Suva: Thank you so much for details and clarification and congratulations.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Jim.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, guys. This is Nick on for Matt. Congrats on the quarter. Just a quick question and a follow-up. First, on supply chain, I am just curious if you could give us an update in terms of what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing on the ground right now and maybe how that compares to like a quarter ago or a year ago? And then just as a follow-up, how are you thinking about your long-term targets at this point? I mean looking at order growth and revenue growth, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re clearly surpassing that. So maybe like when we could expect updates on those?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Maybe I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get started, Neil might want to add some comments here. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll say on the supply chain front, I did reference that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very pleased with the execution. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been now three or four quarters since we put the program in place to build out our capabilities to second source, extend our partnerships with suppliers tighter and ongoingly engaged with our customers on lead time reduction activities. So those have progressed very nicely. And as the quarter progressed, we saw some of the constraints get better as the quarter progressed, which resulted in the upside that we were able to generate in revenue, and delivered a very strong record revenue this quarter. I would say, on the macro supply situation, it still remains challenging. It is a tale of two worlds. On one hand, you have improved visibility and improved supply for general-purpose electronics parts, but high-precision electronics, analog components still appear to have constraints associated with them. But nevertheless, we are very pleased with our execution, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also confident about our guide, which is why we have actually taken up the guide for Q4, and also for the full year to be now 9%. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s with regard to the supply situation. With regard to your second question on the long-term guide on targets, yes, I mean, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also very pleased with the progression \u00e2\u0080\u0093 ongoing progression that we see quarter-after-quarter towards those long-term targets we set, both for growth and profitability. And that was goals that we set for 2023. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re obviously executing very well towards those. And as we go into the fall, we will be having our 3-year strategic plan, and we look forward to updating you on any revised targets right after.\nUnidentified Analyst: Alright. Thank you and congrats, again.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Morgan \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Meta, apologies, your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, team. This is Dave on for Meta. Congrats on the quarter. You mentioned strength within the commercial communications group. And I was just wondering if there are certain categories within that group that are driving the growth. With some of the delays the ecosystem is seeing on O-RAN, are there areas where customers are asking you to be of greater assistance?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I think our commercial communications portfolio is a diversified one that services both the wireless and wireline ecosystems, saw broad strength across both this quarter \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and again, continued strength for the last few years driven by 5G on the wireless side and a number of technology evolutions like 400 gig, 800 gig on the wireline side. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just hand it off to Mark to make some comments on the details for this particular quarter.\nMark Wallace: Sure. Thanks, Satish. As Satish said, Dave, the 5G rollout and demand continues to be very strong. And our bias toward R&D solutions is an area of investment for all of our customers. We saw double-digit demand and order growth across all regions. One of the drivers is the adoption and upgrades around Release 16. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing that across the board. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing adoption now with some of the certification business in the test labs. We added more than 90 new 5G customers again during Q3. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing continued growth of O-RAN where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been expanding our opportunities from device manufacturers to operators to test labs and etcetera. So wireless side, the demand remains strong and broad. And as Satish said, on the wireline side and the data center side, we continue to see strong investments in the quarter for 400G manufacturing plus continued even ramping investments around 800 gig R&D and on both the physical layer and the protocol space. So robust demand. Our differentiation for many, many years, continues to expand our ability to contribute to these customers around the world.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Snyder with UBS. Chris, your line is now open.\nChris Snyder: Thank you. I have a question on the backlog, which is obviously running well above historical or even normalized levels. Is it fair to assume that pricing in the backlog is above the pricing that has been realized in revenues over the last couple of quarters? And what does that mean for forward price cost?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. It is \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I mean it is true that we have been undergoing a series of price increases as we attempt to kind of keep place with the inflation that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing on the cost side of the equation. And it is also true, as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked about in the past that it can take time for those price increases to actually be realized within revenue given the backlog, given the funnel, given the outstanding quotes that exist within the marketplace. And so it is certainly true that we have price increases that are built into our backlog. I think the second, beg your question is a little bit harder to answer because we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know exactly what is forthcoming on the inflation side, right? Whether that continues, whether it starts to wane, but we do expect to start to realize additional benefits from price increases that have already been enacted.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very pleased with the 65% gross margin performance of the business in the backdrop of inflationary environment that Neil referenced.\nChris Snyder: Thank you for that. I think on the last earnings call, you guys said that the guidance assumed further backlog build in 2H. Obviously, we got a little bit more backlog built here in the fiscal third quarter. I guess, is the assumption that we will be further backlog build in Q4? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just asking because it sounds like from the prepared remarks that some of the supply constraints have been easing.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. Yes, that is fair to say. I mean if you look at the look at the order number that we put up last year, $14.91 in Q4 of last year, we are expecting orders to continue to grow. We have a strong funnel here entering the quarter. And so by definition, that implies additional backlog build in the quarter.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: And the demand environment continues to remain strong, and across our end markets and across all regions. So we continue to build a backlog, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a high-quality backlog where we have touch points with customers and \u00e2\u0080\u0093 who have real needs. And so we will be working really hard to get that converted to revenue as we look into the next 6 months.\nChris Snyder: If I could just squeeze \u00e2\u0080\u0093 just a follow-up with that, Satish, very quickly, is there anything specific that is just driving the outsized strength in the demand backdrop? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just asking what should we be looking for or waiting for to kind of try to determine when demand is going to normalize back to the mid-single digit or even kind of high single-digit growth level?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re quite pleased with the portfolio, the differentiation, the focus on the R&D customer. The areas that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re investing to build solutions for, continue to remain a high priority for our customers. But we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also cognizant of the macro environment and the evolving macro, and watching for it. As an example, one of the areas we look for is in our industrial business, which is linked to PMI. But that business had a very strong quarter yet again. But Mark may be able to make some forward-looking comments on the funnel.\nMark Wallace: Yes. Well, Chris, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been broad-based, and it certainly has \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you saw the growth come across all the end markets across all the regions. Our top customers, top 20 were up double-digit. We added more than 400 new customers in total during the quarter. Our indirect business and the channel was strong. So that shows the reach that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting into new customers. And as Neil mentioned, our 6-month funnel is at or near an all-time high. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re watching it very carefully. Some customers are being a bit more cautious in their spend, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not reflected in our numbers, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not reflected in what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing is overall demand going forward.\nChris Snyder: Thank you, guys. Congrats on another great quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SFG. Mehdi, your line is now open.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. This is for the entire team. Keysight has been known for having exposure to both R&D budgets as well as commercial deployment. Would it make sense to change that thought process, and actually qualitatively or quantitatively talk about secular demand drivers like satellite communication, millimeter wave, infrastructure investment, electric vehicle and so forth? So this way, we could better understand the underlying demand drivers. Any thoughts would be appreciated. And I have a follow-up.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you, Mehdi. I think the way we think about our business is we look at the new emerging technologies where customers are looking to innovate, and not just for a year or 2 years, but they are looking at a multiyear roadmap. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our focus, solving their more complex challenges, such as the ones you described in space and satellite, in commercial communications with both on the wireless and wireline side with evolving needs for capacity, which drives millimeter wave consumption, EV and AV, all of these are innovation-rich areas. We are making a unique contribution to enable our customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 time to market. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the focus for us, and we will look to provide more insight as we move forward on these areas. Thanks for the input.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. I think we all understand how Keysight is differentiated and how well you have executed, especially with all the supply chain disruption over the past 2 years. And as much as Neil has been talking about the normalization of the backlog, it continues to grow, which reflects your core strength. I guess we are all trying to figure out what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earning power and sustainability of that earning, $8 going to $10 and then to $12. I think the thought process of the past that 5G would pick is off the table. And I guess I am trying to find a better way to highlight the opportunities as well as quantifying the earning power.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. No, I think you are spot on, right. You look at the backlog build, $2.5 billion roughly as we exit this quarter and then we have a whole quarter in front of us to exit the fiscal year. So, we fully expect that the backlog will continue to grow, which gives us increased stability. And as the supply situation improves, that just converts into earnings power for the company. The other area that I am very pleased with is the gross margin performance of the business in the backdrop of these inflationary pressures we are seeing, which, over time, as we have thought about the value we bring and continue to innovate with software and services, we have more upside to continue to grow that margin profile over time. And so we are not done at 65%, which should give us further room for growth. And then when we look at the next-generation innovation drivers that we are engaged with our customers right now, we feel pretty confident about extending that runway of growth as well.\nMehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you and congrats.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Mehdi.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Mark, your line is now open.\nMark Delaney: Yes. Good afternoon and thanks very much for taking the question. I was hoping to better understand what you are seeing from customers in the semiconductor end markets in the near-term. I think some semiconductor companies have been seeing some cyclical weakness and perhaps cutting back on CapEx plans. Are you seeing anything related to that in your business? And to put that over the intermediate to longer term, you have had the CHIPS Act signed. And I am curious, are you seeing any improved long-term outlook for your business going into the semiconductor end market that you would attribute to the CHIPS Act.\nMark Wallace: Sure. Mark, this is Mark. I will answer that. So, our business in semi remains very strong, robust demand, record orders in . And what we are seeing, and we have said this before is we are seeing continued investments in tow areas, right. One is in the advanced processes and the other is in the mature technologies, and both remained strong during the quarter. The other exciting part is we are starting to see the investments in the United States in new fabs. We have started to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we captured the first initial spend. You saw earlier this month, or maybe this last week, the U.S. Congress just passed the CHIPS package that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all in front of us. That expansion is going to help additional business, fuel additional growth to boost manufacturing in the U.S. And our R&D investments, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just capacity expansion. We are also participating in parametric test as well as R&D test in these advanced processes from EUV to 5-nanometer, 3-nanometer. So, while some end market demand has slowed, there is still supply chain constraints in the semiconductor market. And the longer-term secular growth drivers are still strong driven by end markets like high-performance computing, automotive, we talked about and new mobility and silicon photonics where we have a leadership position feeding into high-speed data centers and so forth is an area we are very excited about as well.\nMark Delaney: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Adam, your line is now open.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hi, good afternoon guys. Congrats on your first $2-plus EPS quarter. Just one on satellite and space, on satellite and space, how does that opportunity compare to some of the larger revenue buckets today, such as 5G and auto?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an area where historically, we were in the component test of the satellite ecosystem. That has been an area of strength for us and where we are highly differentiated and some of the unique metrology components do get into for \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to calibrate some of the more complex measurements in that space. What we are seeing now as we look forward is new applications like non-terrestrial networks with the advent of 5G, and this proliferation of different satellite form factors and communication with ground stations, right. So, we are getting into emulating the whole environment so that we are designing better for the crowded satellite and space environment that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ensuing. But we are very pleased with the uptick we are seeing in the business for the entire portfolio because the number of customers that are in this industry also is expanding beyond the few big ones we used to have in the past. So, pleased with the growth in the business. It will continue to be a driver for our aerospace and defense business moving forward.\nAdam Thalhimer: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Mason with Baird. Rob, your line is now open.\nRob Mason: Yes. Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if you could give us an update around your PathWave rollout and just where you think you are in that process? When you introduced PathWave, it was going to be a multiyear effort to roll in your legacy applications. You are introducing new applications under the PathWave umbrella as well. How should we think about where you are at least on the legacy side in terms of converting those over? You talked about software outgrowing the overall company average as well. And just how to PathWave play into that?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I think if you look at the PathWave effort that we have put in place for a few years now, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really focused around building the organizational capabilities needed because the future of our industry is going to be software-centric. And so we have built capabilities, such as cloud that has enabled us to launch the O-RAN solution where we are now able to test virtualized network infrastructure. And the only way you do it is you have to have your assets on the cloud, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a critical component of how we deliver value through PathWave. The PathWave design franchise that we have had continues to grow. We have been able to convert majority of the customer base into recurring subscription-based contracts, and we are moving that franchise from just being able to simulate circuits to simulate circuits in complex environments. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a new area of emphasis that will continue to grow. And on our base instruments, it still remains a focus for us to add more capabilities, connect them to the cloud so that we make our customers more productive in their labs, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the focus for us moving forward. Bottom line is we are at 20% of our mix, roughly software. And the focus for us is to continue to grow that, and we will continue to invest in more software capabilities to do it. Mark, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if you had any other\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\nRob Mason: Thank you. If I could ask one follow-up, just unrelated around the aerospace and defense government business, the orders continue to be pretty strong there. But how do you see the ability to get, I guess convert more of those orders to revenue here over the next quarter or two quarters, or is it still more of a supply chain issue now that the budgets are flowing \u00e2\u0080\u0093 budget showing up in orders, or are you getting the ability to ship?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. I mean it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the conversion of orders to revenue is definitely a supply chain issue. I mean as we indicated in our prepared remarks, we are starting to see the flow-through of the budget was appropriated in late spring. And so we are optimistic as we look forward into Q4, and even into Q1 that that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to continue to drive growth. We are also seeing increased defense budgets in Europe and Japan, which is also additive. But as you start to think about converting that over, we are still very much supply constrained across the portfolio. And while we have seen some improvement in certain aspects of the supply chain within the quarter, we are still in that constrained environment. So, yes.\nMark Wallace: And Rob, this is Mark. I will just add that the previous  is another driver of growth, which is the intersection of many different segments or technology. We are talking about non-terrestrial network. We are talking about 5G deployment within aerospace defense. And then on top of that, you have the continuing long-term investment in defense modernization with funding beginning to flow from the U.S. government Department of Defense, and then Western Europe coming on very strong. So, there is a number of growth drivers on the front end, and that will continue for us moving forward.\nRob Mason: Understand. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America. David, your line is now open.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Thank you for taking my question. The U.S. CHIPS Act also included about $1.5 billion dedicated to O-RAN, and there was sort of similar funding in the UK government as well. So, I just wanted to check in, any indication sort of the level of orders to-date for Keysight in the O-RAN space? How meaningful is that? And what do you think the impact of this kind of public funding that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to start flowing there will be?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I think in the broader context, you look at the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really changed significantly since the beginning of the year is the geopolitical environment, and it is going to drive more up in government investments for organic research across the globe. And for us, when we talked about drivers for the 5G business, we said near-term, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about the deployments. Medium-term, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about the millimeter wave and higher speed capabilities. And longer term, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about these new applications that are going to come online. And I think O-RAN has been one of those. We started to invest in that early. We are engaged in the O-RAN ecosystem. In fact we had the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we hosted the O-RAN consortium in our facility in Santa Rosa in this quarter to continue to drive the standardization around this nascent ecosystem. So, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an emerging opportunity, very exciting. Again, the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 some of the strengths of the company with software continue to play into it. Now, with regard to immediate impact of public funding, your direct question, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really hard for us to assess that, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely favorable as we think about where we invest and how we monetize.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Thank you. And then a quick follow-up here, you cited gross margin performance a couple of times. Just to help us think about pricing. Should we think about historical Keysight pricing kind of in a low-single digit range, and that you have moved up into a mid-single digit range. Is that kind of the order of magnitude around pricing? Thank you.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. I mean I think when we think about pricing in the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start over the longer term kind of outside of this recent inflationary environment. Our goal is always to capture the value that we are bringing into the marketplace. So, we have \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and regularly assess our prices relative to the competition and the value that we are bringing into the marketplace and adjust them accordingly. I think in this inflationary environment, there has become little bit of a cost element as not just our suppliers, but our competitors and people across the broad ecosystem have been increasing prices in response to that inflation environment. So, I think you are correct in assuming that our pricing increases have moved northward over the course of, say, the last 12 months to 18 months in response to that inflationary environment.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. There are currently no further questions in queue.  There are no further questions in queue, so that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jason Kary for any closing comments.\nJason Kary: Thank you, Amber and thank you everyone for joining us today. We appreciate the opportunity to provide you with an update and look forward to speaking with many of you later this quarter. So, thank you and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all for today.\nOperator: This concludes our conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Sure. Thanks, Satish. As Satish said, Dave, the 5G rollout and demand continues to be very strong. And our bias toward R&D solutions is an area of investment for all of our customers. We saw double-digit demand and order growth across all regions. One of the drivers is the adoption and upgrades around Release 16. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re seeing that across the board. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re seeing adoption now with some of the certification business in the test labs. We added more than 90 new 5G customers again during Q3. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re seeing continued growth of O-RAN where wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve been expanding our opportunities from device manufacturers to operators to test labs and etcetera. So wireless side, the demand remains strong and broad. And as Satish said, on the wireline side and the data center side, we continue to see strong investments in the quarter for 400G manufacturing plus continued even ramping investments around 800 gig R&D and on both the physical layer and the protocol space. So robust demand. Our differentiation for many, many years, continues to expand our ability to contribute to these customers around the world. Yes. Well, Chris, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve said that ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s been broad-based, and it certainly has a\u0302\u0080\u0093 you saw the growth come across all the end markets across all the regions.

            "name": "Neil Dougherty",
            "content": "Thank you, Satish and hello everyone. We delivered strong third quarter results, successfully navigating ongoing supply chain and other headwinds. Third quarter 2022 revenue of $1.376 billion was $26 million above the high end of our guidance range, and grew 10% or 13% on a core basis. We generated $1.461 billion in orders, up 12% or 14% on a core basis, and we ended the quarter with $2.5 billion in backlog. Turning to our operational results for Q3, we reported gross margin of 65%, holding steady in the face of significant inflation and currency headwinds. Operating expenses were $480 million, resulting in an operating margin of 30%. We used a number of strategies to effectively navigate supply chain challenges, including product redesign, alternate sourcing and increased supplier and customer engagement. We achieved net income of $363 million and delivered $2.01 in earnings per share, which was $0.21 above the high end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 181 million shares. Despite significant currency headwinds on the top line, we saw negligible FX impact to earnings due to the meaningful natural hedge provided by our global footprint that has been supplemented by our financial hedging program. Moving to the performance of our segments, our Communications Solutions Group generated record revenue of $970 million, up 11% or 13% on a core basis. CSG delivered gross margin of 67% and record operating margin of 30%. Within CSG, commercial communications generated record revenue of $694 million, up 17% or 19% on a core basis, driven by 5G, O-RAN, 400 gigabit, 800 gigabit and high-speed digital applications. Aerospace and defense and government revenue of $276 million was down 2% and up 1% on a core basis. Our backlog for this end market remains strong, and we continue to expect increasing defense budgets in the U.S., Europe and Japan to provide support for higher spending going forward. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated third quarter revenue of $406 million, up 10% or 13% on a core basis, driven by strong revenue growth across all end markets and regions. EISG reported gross margin of 61% and operating margin of 31%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the third quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generated cash flow from operations of $224 million and free cash flow of $192 million or 14% of revenue. Share repurchases this quarter totaled 1.6 million shares at an average price per share of $139.46 for a total consideration of $228 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately 4.6 million shares for a total consideration of $723 million. Now turning to our outlook and guidance. Demand remains strong for Keysight solutions. Our funnel is near historic high levels, and we exit the quarter with a record backlog. We now expect full year revenue growth to approach 9% or 11% on a core basis with EPS in the range of $7.43 and to $7.49, representing growth of 20% at the midpoint. Fourth quarter 2022 revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.38 billion to $1.4 billion, with earnings per share in the range of $1.94 to $2, based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 180 million shares. In closing, Keysighta\u0302\u0080\u0099s resilient business, consistent execution and flexible cost structure give us confidence in our ability to capitalize on the long-term secular growth trends and deliver above-market profitable growth in 2023 and beyond. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A. Yes. It is a\u0302\u0080\u0093 I mean it is true that we have been undergoing a series of price increases as we attempt to kind of keep place with the inflation that wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re seeing on the cost side of the equation. And it is also true, as wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve talked about in the past that it can take time for those price increases to actually be realized within revenue given the backlog, given the funnel, given the outstanding quotes that exist within the marketplace. And so it is certainly true that we have price increases that are built into our backlog. I think the second, beg your question is a little bit harder to answer because we dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t know exactly what is forthcoming on the inflation side, right? Whether that continues, whether it starts to wane, but we do expect to start to realize additional benefits from price increases that have already been enacted. Yes. Yes, that is fair to say. I mean if you look at the look at the order number that we put up last year, $14.91 in Q4 of last year, we are expecting orders to continue to grow. We have a strong funnel here entering the quarter. And so by definition, that implies additional backlog build in the quarter. Yes. I mean ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s a\u0302\u0080\u0093 the conversion of orders to revenue is definitely a supply chain issue. I mean as we indicated in our prepared remarks, we are starting to see the flow-through of the budget was appropriated in late spring.

            "content": "Thank you, Jason. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Keysight Technologies delivered another exceptional quarter with both revenue and EPS, our earnings per share exceeding the high-end of our guidance. Our outperformance reflects the effectiveness of our strategy, outstanding execution by our teams around the world, and the strength of our operating model. Keysighta\u0302\u0080\u0099s deep customer engagements with industry leaders and high-value differentiated solutions continue to drive broad-based demand across key technology megatrends. I will focus my comments today on three key headlines. First, outstanding execution by the Keysight teams around the world resulted in an all-time record revenue and earnings per share as we saw some supply constraints ease as the quarter progressed. Second, we saw strong order growth and sustained demand across all end markets and regions. Third, we are once again raising our full year outlook. We now expect to achieve revenue growth approaching 9% and earnings per share growth of approximately 20% for the full fiscal year. Leta\u0302\u0080\u0099s now take a deeper look at our results for the quarter. Third quarter orders grew 12% to $1.46 billion and outpaced record revenue, which grew 10% to $1.38 billion. Record EPS of $2.01, grew 31%. Orders and revenue growth in both business segments and across all regions is evidence of our ability to deliver value for customers as we manage macro and supply dynamics. Software revenue achieved an all-time high, outpacing total Keysight revenue growth, expanding our recurring revenue profile to further strengthen the durability of our business. Our software-centric solution strategy is a key differentiator in rapidly evolving design, systems emulation and modeling environments. We recently introduced PathWave Advanced Design System 2023 to address growing complexity in ultra-high frequency designs. We also announced that Keysighta\u0302\u0080\u0099s Open RAN solutions are moving to cloud-based deployment to support our customersa\u0302\u0080\u0099 needs as networks evolve to more software-enabled virtualized architectures. Turning to our business segments. The Communications Solutions Group delivered all-time record revenue and record third quarter orders. Commercial Communications achieved record revenue with growth across all industry segments and regions. Innovation dynamics across the Communications ecosystem remains strong, driving demand Keysighta\u0302\u0080\u0099s comprehensive end-to-end portfolio for both the wireless and wireline ecosystems. In wireless, 5G continues to represent an innovation-rich environment for the industry. Our differentiated software-centric solutions enable customers to address the growing complexity of use cases, frequency band combinations, real-world connectivity and mobility challenges. We continue to evolve our 5G platform to meet the requirements of emerging applications and newer versions of the standards. In collaboration with, Intel, Radisys, Vodafone and Wind River, we recently showcased an industry-first demonstration, deploying Keysighta\u0302\u0080\u0099s O-RAN and solutions to help reduce power consumption in a multi-vendor Open RAN network. AI-LINK, a provider of industrial IoT offerings, used Keysight solutions for end-to-end performance validation of cloud-native radio access network infrastructure. In wireline, we continue to see strong demand for 400 gig, 800 gig and photonics applications. We recently collaborated with Nokia to demonstrate the first public 800-gig interoperability test, validating the robustness of ultra-high data rates in telco networks and data center environments for the expected increase in AI, ML network workloads. Record Q3 orders in aerospace, defense and government outpaced revenue, which grew 1% on a core basis versus a strong growth quarter last year. Budget appropriations began to flow as reflected in prime contractor spending in the U.S., while 5G investments continued to grow to address new use cases such as RADAR and 5G coexistence. We also saw strong strength in satellite and space, including new applications for nonterrestrial networks. Over the next several years, we expect this market will benefit from elevated investments in technology modernization. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group delivered double-digit order and revenue growth for the eighth consecutive quarter, with momentum from continued investments in next-generation technologies across automotive, industrial IoT and semiconductor end markets. In automotive, we are pleased with the continued broad adoption of our solutions portfolio, with the business nearly doubling over the past 2 years. Orders grew strong double-digits for the sixth consecutive quarter, and we delivered all-time record revenue. Keysighta\u0302\u0080\u0099s contributions to the advancement of EV and AV technologies, which include vehicle intelligence, connectivity, power and security are fueling momentum with leading car manufacturers and helped us secure wins with giga factories around the world. Keysighta\u0302\u0080\u0099s award-winning Radar Scene Emulator is the only solution on the market to imitate realistic roadway scenarios in a lab environment, and was chosen by a leading U.S. auto manufacturer for testing and validation of autonomous drive systems. This quarter, we completed another tuck-in acquisition in the automotive space, further adding to our software technology and technical staff focused on vehicle-to-everything communications. We continue to invest as we target evolving opportunities in the future of transportation. In general electronics, we achieved double-digit order growth and all-time record revenue as investments continued in digital health, IoT and advanced research. In educational research, Keysight is partnering with global leaders such as Nanyang Technological University in Singapore to advance 6G technology. Together with Sauce Labs, our Eggplant business delivered artificial intelligence-driven testing of enterprise applications. The acceleration in our general electronics business reflects the broad scope of our portfolio of leading technology solutions. Record orders for our semiconductor solutions resulted in ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit order growth driven by capacity expansion of mature foundries to address pent-up demand in the market and investments in advanced processes. Keysighta\u0302\u0080\u0099s PathWave design solutions expands our collaboration with major foundries beyond parametric wafer test into emerging applications like silicon photonics and next-generation design and simulation applications. While we continue to successfully execute our strategy, we recognize the near-term macroeconomic uncertainties. Keysighta\u0302\u0080\u0099s sustained performance over time is evidence of the resilience and durability of our business. Our resilience is an outcome of enduring partnerships with market-leading customers with early engagement to develop software-centric solutions that enable them to solve their most critical development challenges and achieve their first-to-market goals. Durability is a product of our flexible operating model designed to quickly respond to variations in demand while investing in critical long-term priorities. These strengths give us confidence that we can navigate uncertainties, and continue to deliver superior results going forward. Of course, all of this is made possible by our talented people. Steadfast execution by our teams, especially in a challenging environment, is proof that our Keysight leadership model delivers results, empowering our inclusive and diverse culture which fosters collaboration, high performance and innovation. We recently released our first diversity, equity and inclusion report as we renewed and strengthened Keysighta\u0302\u0080\u0099s longstanding commitment to DE&I and to being a great place to work for our global workforce of more than 14,000. With that, I will turn the call over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook. Thank you, Jim. Yes, sure, Jim. As you noted, this is one of the new expansion opportunities that wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re incredibly excited about, and wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re continuing to build momentum. And as you saw emerging from the pandemic, this big acceleration into EV and AV has just gotten started. And from a manufacturing perspective, yes, we have some exposure to it, but it is this proliferation of electronics content thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s causing automakers to ramp up production as supply becomes lesser and lesser of an issue over time. So ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s all about testing their EV capabilities in the manufacturing environment. So we have some exposure to that. We are very excited by this big trend we see thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s going to play out over the next 10 years where auto makers are going to increasingly invest in organic R&D capabilities needed to differentiate their platform over others. And that involves software and hardware, and ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s a great fit for the broad array of tools that we offer to every electrical engineer in the planet that wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re now selling into the automakers. But equally, the growing emphasis we have put on a\u0302\u0080\u0093 growing our footprint in EV. As an example, this quarter, we had some design wins with some giga factories that are coming up just getting started in the Radar Scene Emulator solution, which really allows you to take a car, turn on all the sensors and really see how we behave in the real world, very unique solution offering. And we had a design win with a major North American car manufacturer. So just getting started, very excited about the opportunity and strong double-digit growth in orders this quarter. Thank you, Jim. Maybe Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ll get started, Neil might want to add some comments here. Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ll say on the supply chain front, I did reference that wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re very pleased with the execution. Ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s been now three or four quarters since we put the program in place to build out our capabilities to second source, extend our partnerships with suppliers tighter and ongoingly engaged with our customers on lead time reduction activities. So those have progressed very nicely. And as the quarter progressed, we saw some of the constraints get better as the quarter progressed, which resulted in the upside that we were able to generate in revenue, and delivered a very strong record revenue this quarter. I would say, on the macro supply situation, it still remains challenging. It is a tale of two worlds. On one hand, you have improved visibility and improved supply for general-purpose electronics parts, but high-precision electronics, analog components still appear to have constraints associated with them. But nevertheless, we are very pleased with our execution, and wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re also confident about our guide, which is why we have actually taken up the guide for Q4, and also for the full year to be now 9%. So thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s with regard to the supply situation. With regard to your second question on the long-term guide on targets, yes, I mean, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re also very pleased with the progression a\u0302\u0080\u0093 ongoing progression that we see quarter-after-quarter towards those long-term targets we set, both for growth and profitability. And that was goals that we set for 2023. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re obviously executing very well towards those. And as we go into the fall, we will be having our 3-year strategic plan, and we look forward to updating you on any revised targets right after. Yes. I think our commercial communications portfolio is a diversified one that services both the wireless and wireline ecosystems, saw broad strength across both this quarter a\u0302\u0080\u0093 and again, continued strength for the last few years driven by 5G on the wireless side and a number of technology evolutions like 400 gig, 800 gig on the wireline side. Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ll just hand it off to Mark to make some comments on the details for this particular quarter. And wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re very pleased with the 65% gross margin performance of the business in the backdrop of inflationary environment that Neil referenced. And the demand environment continues to remain strong, and across our end markets and across all regions. So we continue to build a backlog, but ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s a high-quality backlog where we have touch points with customers and a\u0302\u0080\u0093 who have real needs. And so we will be working really hard to get that converted to revenue as we look into the next 6 months. Yes. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re quite pleased with the portfolio, the differentiation, the focus on the R&D customer. The areas that wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re investing to build solutions for, continue to remain a high priority for our customers. But wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re also cognizant of the macro environment and the evolving macro, and watching for it. As an example, one of the areas we look for is in our industrial business, which is linked to PMI. But that business had a very strong quarter yet again. But Mark may be able to make some forward-looking comments on the funnel. Yes. Thank you, Mehdi. I think the way we think about our business is we look at the new emerging technologies where customers are looking to innovate, and not just for a year or 2 years, but they are looking at a multiyear roadmap. Thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s our focus, solving their more complex challenges, such as the ones you described in space and satellite, in commercial communications with both on the wireless and wireline side with evolving needs for capacity, which drives millimeter wave consumption, EV and AV, all of these are innovation-rich areas. We are making a unique contribution to enable our customersa\u0302\u0080\u0099 time to market. Thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s the focus for us, and we will look to provide more insight as we move forward on these areas. Thanks for the input. Yes. No, I think you are spot on, right. You look at the backlog build, $2.5 billion roughly as we exit this quarter and then we have a whole quarter in front of us to exit the fiscal year. So, we fully expect that the backlog will continue to grow, which gives us increased stability. And as the supply situation improves, that just converts into earnings power for the company. The other area that I am very pleased with is the gross margin performance of the business in the backdrop of these inflationary pressures we are seeing, which, over time, as we have thought about the value we bring and continue to innovate with software and services, we have more upside to continue to grow that margin profile over time. And so we are not done at 65%, which should give us further room for growth. And then when we look at the next-generation innovation drivers that we are engaged with our customers right now, we feel pretty confident about extending that runway of growth as well. Thank you, Mehdi. Yes. I think ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s an area where historically, we were in the component test of the satellite ecosystem. That has been an area of strength for us and where we are highly differentiated and some of the unique metrology components do get into for a\u0302\u0080\u0093 to calibrate some of the more complex measurements in that space. What we are seeing now as we look forward is new applications like non-terrestrial networks with the advent of 5G, and this proliferation of different satellite form factors and communication with ground stations, right. So, we are getting into emulating the whole environment so that we are designing better for the crowded satellite and space environment thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s ensuing. But we are very pleased with the uptick we are seeing in the business for the entire portfolio because the number of customers that are in this industry also is expanding beyond the few big ones we used to have in the past. So, pleased with the growth in the business. It will continue to be a driver for our aerospace and defense business moving forward. Yes. I think if you look at the PathWave effort that we have put in place for a few years now, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s really focused around building the organizational capabilities needed because the future of our industry is going to be software-centric. And so we have built capabilities, such as cloud that has enabled us to launch the O-RAN solution where we are now able to test virtualized network infrastructure. And the only way you do it is you have to have your assets on the cloud, and thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s a critical component of how we deliver value through PathWave. The PathWave design franchise that we have had continues to grow. We have been able to convert majority of the customer base into recurring subscription-based contracts, and we are moving that franchise from just being able to simulate circuits to simulate circuits in complex environments. And thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s a new area of emphasis that will continue to grow. And on our base instruments, it still remains a focus for us to add more capabilities, connect them to the cloud so that we make our customers more productive in their labs, and thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s the focus for us moving forward. Bottom line is we are at 20% of our mix, roughly software. And the focus for us is to continue to grow that, and we will continue to invest in more software capabilities to do it. Mark, I dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t know if you had any othera\u0302\u0080\u00a6 Yes. I think in the broader context, you look at the a\u0302\u0080\u0093 whata\u0302\u0080\u0099s really changed significantly since the beginning of the year is the geopolitical environment, and it is going to drive more up in government investments for organic research across the globe. And for us, when we talked about drivers for the 5G business, we said near-term, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s about the deployments. Medium-term, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s about the millimeter wave and higher speed capabilities. And longer term, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s about these new applications that are going to come online. And I think O-RAN has been one of those. We started to invest in that early. We are engaged in the O-RAN ecosystem. In fact we had the a\u0302\u0080\u0093 we hosted the O-RAN consortium in our facility in Santa Rosa in this quarter to continue to drive the standardization around this nascent ecosystem. So, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s an emerging opportunity, very exciting. Again, the a\u0302\u0080\u0093 some of the strengths of the company with software continue to play into it. Now, with regard to immediate impact of public funding, your direct question, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s really hard for us to assess that, but ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s definitely favorable as we think about where we invest and how we monetize."

Welcome to the second quarter 2022 earnings call and my first as the CEO of Keysight. I am humbled and honored to be Keysight's CEO and excited about the future. I would like to thank Ron Nersesian for his visionary leadership of the Company, which has provided us a solid foundation to build on. Over the last decade, I've had the honor of working closely with Ron and benefited greatly from his experience in many different roles I've held since joining the Company 16 years ago. This is a great time to be at Keysight as we remain focused on our core purpose of accelerating innovation to connect and secure the world. Keysight delivered exceptional results in quarter two, driven by strong execution and broad-based demand across the business. The team focused on innovating and solving customers' design and test challenges while successfully navigating the ongoing supply chain and geopolitical challenges. I will focus my comments today on 3 key headlines. First, we delivered record quarter two orders, capitalizing on the robust end-market demand for Keysight's high-value differentiated solutions. Our focus on delivering first-to-market solutions is enabling us to uncover new emerging applications, adding to our momentum. Second, we achieved record revenue, strong operating margin performance, resulting in record earnings per share, which grew 27%, demonstrating the durability and resilience of our business. Third, we are raising our outlook for the year based on our strong performance in the first half and continued momentum. We now expect to achieve revenue growth approaching 8% and earnings per share growth in the range of 14% to 15% for the fiscal year. Let's now take a deeper look at our results for the quarter. Second quarter orders grew 9% to $1.46 billion and outpaced revenue, which grew 11% to a new record of $1.35 billion and was $41 million above the high end of our guidance. We achieved gross margins of 65%, operating margin of 29% and record EPS of $1.83, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.14. Also with the ongoing equity market volatility, we again capitalized on the opportunity to accelerate share repurchases. These results are a reflection of our strong portfolio and our global team's application of the Keysight leadership model, which enables us to deliver consistent value to all stakeholders. We delivered these results despite many headwinds, including geopolitical challenges, inflationary pressures and continued supply chain disruptions. We continue to advance our software-centric solution strategy as the rapid pace of technology accelerates, our customers across end markets are seeking deeper engagements earlier in the design cycle and are adopting our software solutions. The capabilities of our PathWave software platform facilitate continuous stream of releases that matches the innovation cadence of our customers. This enables us to secure enterprise agreements with market leaders for high-value R&D solutions. Orders for software and value-added services like KeysightCare again grew double digits as we continued to grow recurring revenue this quarter. Turning to our business segments. Communications Solutions Group delivered record second quarter orders and an all-time record revenue. Within CSG, commercial communications achieved all-time record orders and revenue with double-digit order growth for the third consecutive quarter. Ongoing innovation and investments in our end markets spanning both, the wireless and wireline segments remained strong, driven by adoption of 5G, 400 gig, 800 gig and terabit and optical technologies. In wireless, the increase in the number of 5G device types continues to drive test and certification requirements. With our leading solutions portfolio, we expect to benefit from the continued investment in the evolution of 5G standards, including stand-alone 5G, Release 16 and beyond. In quarter two, Keysight announced collaborations with leading companies such as NTT DOCOMO, Telefonica and Analog Devices to enable a wide range of 5G applications, including O-RAN, which continues to gain momentum. In wireline, we're enabling the digital transformation, driven by cloud computing and telecom stack virtualization through our end-to-end solutions. We recently launched the industry's first 800-gig solution to enable data center design workflows for ultra-high data rates and energy efficiency. Aerospace, defense and government achieved record Q2 revenue, driven by double-digit growth in Americas and strength in signal monitoring, cyber and space and satellite solutions as well as 5G and 6G applications. Complex scenario emulations continue to drive the need for modeling and digital twin solutions with increasing software content. Our leading network analyzer platform and phased array test solutions enable increasingly complex satellite communication design and test requirements. Increasing defense budgets in the U.S. and Europe are expected to provide support for higher spend going forward. CSG is well positioned to capitalize on growth by enabling innovation in our end markets through our broad and synergistic portfolio, including wireline, wireless, cybersecurity, satellite and space solutions. The Electronics Industrial Solutions Group delivered double-digit order and revenue growth for the seventh consecutive quarter, driven by automotive and semiconductor solutions. In automotive, all-time record revenue was driven by strong demand for our expanding portfolio of EV and AV applications. Keysight is capitalizing on strategic investments in the automotive and energy space, providing industry-first solutions that support new capabilities and use cases, such as our recently launched protocol test solution for in-vehicle networking. During the quarter, we secured EV wins with major OEMs across all regions. In addition, we're excited by the recognition of our new Radar Scene Emulator solution, including the 2022 Tech.AD Europe award. We saw strong demand for our semiconductor solutions, which delivered double-digit order and revenue growth. Investments in advanced semiconductor technologies, along with capacity expansion for existing nodes, remain robust. Over the next 3 to 5 years, we see solid customer R&D roadmaps for ICs for a broader set of applications. As an example, in Q2, we sold our first on-wafer silicon photonics parametric test solution to a major semiconductor fab to develop and manufacture next-generation data center transceivers. We believe this trend represents long-term opportunities for Keysight's R&D solutions portfolio. Our general electronics business achieved all-time record revenue as investments continued in manufacturing and device development for consumer and industrial IoT, digital health and advanced research. We're seeing active investments globally in fundamental research in terahertz and quantum technologies. For example, we recently announced a collaboration with National Research Foundation of Singapore's quantum engineering program to accelerate research and development and education in quantum technologies. The strength of our general electronics business reflects the broad nature of applications for our solutions. Before I wrap, I'd like to acknowledge and thank our more than 14,000 employees worldwide for their commitment to our customers around the globe and for their passion in delivering market-leading solutions. I'm proud to share that Keysight was recently named as one of Fortune 100's best companies to work for in 2022. This is a recognition of our inclusive and diverse culture exhibiting value for collaboration, high performance and innovation. Our culture also places high value on corporate social responsibility. We recently released our 2021 CSR report, highlighting our progress in environmental, social and governance efforts worldwide and announcing new goals to track through '22 and into '23. I believe Keysight has a bright future ahead. I look forward to working with the team to execute our strategy and continue to deliver greater value for our customers, shareholders and employees. With that, I'll turn the call over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook. Neil?\nNeil Dougherty: Thank you, Satish, and hello, everyone. Our performance this quarter once again demonstrated the resilience of our business. We delivered on our commitments and exceeded expectations as we powered through multiple challenges and new headwinds in the quarter. In the second quarter of 2022, we delivered revenue of $1,351 million, which was above the high end of our guidance range and grew 11% or 12% on a core basis. We generated $1,458 million in orders, up 9% or 11% on a core basis. During the quarter, we suspended our operations in Russia and canceled our entire backlog of Russian orders. Core growth adjusted for Russia was 13%. Demand again outpaced supply, and we ended the quarter with over $2.4 billion in backlog. Turning to our operational results for Q2. We reported gross margin of 65% and operating expenses of $489 million, resulting in an operating margin of 29%. The strength of our results highlights the resiliency of our business and our team's ability to execute despite significant supply, cost and currency headwinds within the quarter. We achieved net income of $334 million and delivered $1.83 in earnings per share, which was above the high end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 183 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated record revenue of $963 million, up 10% or 11% on a core basis. CSG delivered gross margin of 66% and operating margin of 28%. Within CSG, commercial communications generated revenue of $672 million, up 11% with double-digit revenue growth in the Americas, driven by strong demand for 5G device and component development as well as network test, O-RAN and terabit R&D. Aerospace, defense and government revenue of $291 million grew 7%. Our backlog for this end market remains strong, and we reported solid growth in the Americas and Europe. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated second quarter revenue of $388 million, up 13% or 15% on a core basis, driven by strong revenue growth in automotive and semiconductor. EISG reported gross margin of 62% and operating margin of 30%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the second quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generating cash flow from operations of $298 million and free cash flow of $245 million or 18% of revenue. Share repurchases this quarter totaled 1.9 million shares at an average price per share of $153.78, for a total consideration of $289 million. Year-to-date, we have purchased approximately 3 million shares for a total consideration of $495 million. Now, turning to our outlook and guidance. The demand environment remains strong for Keysight solutions. As in recent quarters, our revenues continue to be constrained by tight supply conditions. However, we have demonstrated our ability to effectively navigate through this environment, and we remain confident in our ability to execute and deliver on our commitments. We expect third quarter 2022 revenue to be in the range of $1,330 million to $1,350 million and Q3 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.74 to $1.80, based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 181 million shares. We now expect full year revenue growth to approach 8%, which given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar now includes a 2-point year-over-year headwind from currency. We're also raising our earnings growth expectation to 14% to 15%. Despite quarter-to-quarter dynamics being difficult to predict, we have confidence in our raised expectations for the year. In closing, we have a strong track record of execution. Our backlog is at an all-time high, and we are well positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities across our diverse set of end markets. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.\nJason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Tia, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A?\nOperator:  The first question is from the line of David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America. Please go ahead, sir.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Good afternoon. Wondering if you have seen an uptick in any supplier decommitments over the last few months. Obviously, China shutdowns have impacted a lot of electronic manufacturing, component suppliers and so forth. Wondering if you have seen any of that show up in your operations.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Hi, David. Thanks for the question. As you saw from our results this quarter, we had a very strong quarter from a revenue perspective. We're very pleased with the strong execution progress of the team. And the five-point program we've been running around strengthening our relationships with suppliers, finding alternate sourcing, being nimble in this environment has really paid rich dividends, along with some of the other initiatives we have. And while the supplier environment remains, in our view, pretty challenging, but we have found a way to find more upside. I would say that the demand from our customers is robust. And our customers want the products as quickly as we can make them, and we're shipping them as quickly as we can. So, the supply situation does remain challenging to the point you made, but we've been able to find a way around it. Thank you.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: And as a quick follow-up to that, have your own lead times, the time to -- expected to ship the product, have those actually started to decline, or are they stabilizing at elevated levels? Thank you.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. Obviously, we saw in a situation where -- this is Neil, by the way, where demand is outpacing supply. And so, we have not at this started to pull lead times back down. I would call our lead times generally stable. I'd say, they're slightly creeping north at this point with demand continuing to outpace supply. But by and large, on average, we see a lot of stability in lead times currently with the goal to work them down over time as the supply chain situation ultimately starts to loosen.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank.\nMatt Niknam: So first, on the fiscal 3Q revenue guide. Maybe, Neil, if you could talk about what's driving the expected sequential decline in revenues. And then maybe how you're thinking about core constant currency trends relative to any FX headwinds that are embedded in next quarter's guide. And then just secondly, on Europe and Asia Pac, I'm just wondering if you've seen any change in customer demand or buying patterns, given the Russia-Ukraine conflict that may be impacting Europe or even in Asia Pac, given the sort of the reemergence of lockdowns in China in recent months. Thanks.\nNeil Dougherty: I'll take the first part of that, the question about the guide. As we've already stated, our revenue situation is still highly constrained by the supply environment. And we had significant outperformance in Q2 as we navigated the tight supply environment and did better than we expected. And so, -- but what you can read into that is that a significant portion of our Q2 outperformance was shipment of orders that we had originally or going into the quarter had scheduled to be in Q3. And so, that's great news, and we're pleased with that. But that -- on a quarter-over-quarter basis, that can be a significant impact. I would say that the guidance reflects our best estimate as we see it at this point in time. This quarter-to-quarter perturbations can be very difficult to call in this environment. We certainly have the backlog to do better if -- depending on how incoming supply works. And I think the point that we want everybody to focus on is that we are taking up the full year guidance significantly from 6% to 7% growth to approaching 8%. And that 8% growth, as you noted, has kind of new and significant FX headwinds. We saw a very significant strengthening of the dollar within our fiscal second quarter. We now have a 2-point year-over-year headwind in the second half that we're baking into account. And on the full year basis, we have a 1.5-point relative of FX. Just from November, when we put out the 6% to 7% guide to where we are today, saying approaching 8%, there's a new 1.5% FX headwind baked into that. And so, we feel very good about the situation as it currently sits and are pleased to be raising estimates for the year.\nMark Wallace: And Matt, hi. This is Mark. I'll address your second question on the kind of customer dynamics in Europe and Asia. So, in Asia Pac, we had double-digit order growth again as well as in China, where, as you noted, we had the COVID protocol restrictions and lockdowns. And it\u2019s really a continuation of our ability to dynamically pivot and work with customers while both, in a face-to-face as well as a virtual remote nature. So, it's a testament to the broad strength and demand of our business across multiple industries and segments. In Asia, in particular, we saw strong continued demand and growth in automotive and semi, 400 gig, 800 gig, terabit, all of those things. So, very stable there. In Europe, we did see an impact, obviously, from the Russia cancellations. So, we had double-digit order growth in all regions except for Europe. But again, the demand continues. We saw a robust demand for our semiconductor solutions, again, automotive, our commercial comms across the European region. So, the broad interactions and dynamics with our customers so far remain pretty much unchanged.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.\nMark Delaney: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking the questions. And Satish, nice to be speaking to you in your new role. I was hoping to start first on the auto business. You mentioned some strong growth there on your prepared remarks today. Maybe you could talk about how big that is now relative to the Company overall. And given some of the drivers, like autonomy and electric vehicles, how big do you think the auto business for Keysight could become in the coming years?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you. I think, the auto business is very exciting for us for more than one reason, I would say. First, very strong quarter, obviously, building on many quarters where we've seen a very strong uptick in the business, primarily driven by this decade-plus long trends of electrification, autonomous driving. And we're actually feeding a number of these engineering labs with our tools and capabilities and solutions designed for this end market. We're engaging with the OEMs globally. We've had some successes, as I reported, in this quarter. And we're also working with the entire ecosystem with the Tier 1, Tier 2 suppliers, the semiconductor houses that feed the auto and the test labs that are just growing across the world. So, it's a growing ecosystem. We're expanding our portfolio into EV, particularly around battery test, charging test, in-vehicle network testing as an example. And in AV, we're very excited by the new solution that we have offered for autonomous drive emulation, which is enabling in-loop, real-time, synchronized sensor evaluations, and this is a build on our 5G platform and capability. So, we're very pleased with the progress we're making, and we know that we have a long runway ahead with automotive.\nMark Delaney: That's very helpful. Thanks. And my follow-up question was on the EPS guidance. If I look at the midpoint of the 3Q guidance and also the midpoint of the full year EPS guidance, it would imply that fourth quarter EPS at the midpoint would be something like $1.89. And that would imply that the growth rate would be slowing from mid-teens year-on-year through the first three quarters on average to more like mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. So, I was hoping you could better contextualize the implied fourth quarter EPS guidance for us. And is there anything in terms of supply chain cost or mix that's perhaps impacting the rate of EPS growth in the fourth quarter? Thanks.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. So, I think you need to take a close look at our Q4 performance in FY21, which was a bit of an outlier at 31% operating margin, a full almost 4 points higher than the prior -- the sequential quarters leading up to that. And so, I think as you -- and the other -- one of the big drivers within the fourth quarter of last year, if you look at it, we had a sequential decrease in R&D investment that was quite substantial going from Q3 to Q4. And that is atypical. And so, we would expect increasing investments on a sequential basis as we move from Q2 to Q3 and then again as we move from Q3 to Q4 as we invest in the future and the future growth of our business. And so, again, we remain optimistic about our business. And some of these quarter-to-quarter perturbations can be difficult to call, but we are raising our both, revenue and EPS guidance for the year quite substantially and are focused on executing.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan.\nSamik Chatterjee: Satish, congratulations on your first earnings call in the CEO role. I guess, in your prepared remarks, you did mention the higher defense budgets, and if I could start with that. I mean, when should we be realistically expecting the higher defense spending budgets to start impacting sort of your order trends? What is the typical sort of time line that you see -- have seen in the past in terms of when you start to see the flow-through of that into your order trends? And I have a quick follow-up.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Samik. Of course, aerospace and defense business has been historically, as we have talked about, a GDP-plus business for us. It's very broad with 50% of the business tied to the U.S. or North America. And we're excited by the number of new areas that we're applying our technology to, space and satellite being one of them. And 5G and 6G adoption into this sector is a new opportunity for us. So, independent of the budgets, we're pleased with the traction we're making in applying our technology to offer new solutions. The budget is obviously a huge stability. I think the fact that you have bipartisan support for the defense budget growth in RDT&E line item for this year and then subsequent growth also projected for 2023, we view as a favorable sign. I think these geopolitical tensions tend to provide more stability not only in the U.S., but we're also expecting a similar uptick in Europe, and therefore, technology spend. But as we know, this business is an average over the long term, and we have been doing better than GDP, and our intent is to continue to do that and offer new solutions. With regard to the quote activity, I'll let Mark make a few comments.\nMark Wallace: Yes. Samik, this is Mark. I think just to add to Satish, the budget in the U.S. was approved. It was increased. And as we've been watching our customers, both the direct government and the prime contractors, we expect some of that funding to start flowing to new program starts here in our second half. So, we look forward to that. And as you probably know, as many of the programs nowadays are multiyear, this will flow into the fiscal year '23 and beyond. And you've been following what's going on in Western Europe as well with increased spend from the NATO nations, we'll see how that flows through. We expect that to be favorable as well. And then, I think the last thing I'll just mention is there are other aspects of this industry segment that are representing new growth opportunities for us around space. Commercial space in particular is a very hot area for us we continue to focus on. And then, the continuing modernization that we've been talking about for many quarters or years is a long-term trend that we're very excited about. We see a strong funnel of opportunities going into the future.\nSamik Chatterjee: And for my follow-up, I guess this is more for Neil. But Neil, I mean, your 8% revenue growth guide for the year implies about a $150 million sort of half-on-half revenue performance, which is very similar to what we saw last year. I'm just wondering what you're capturing there in terms of improvements in the sort of supply environment in general versus your own capacity increases. And where would there be sort of more modest or sort of upside potential if supply of components are better? Just trying to understand sort of what's embedded because it seems very typical of -- compared to last year that your guidance is.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. So, in prior quarters, we've talked about an expectation or thinking that we would see some material improvement in the supply chain situation in the second half of this year. To this point, we have not seen that. And in fact, I think if you look broader across the tech industry, there's an argument that things got incrementally worse in Q2, are more challenging, driven by the Russia-Ukraine conflict as well as the COVID shutdowns in China, even though those COVID shutdowns don't impact us directly. I think for us, we look at the items that we can control, our own capacity both for finished goods as well as for the subcomponents that come out of our fab and technology centers that feed our instrumentation. We look at our relationships with our suppliers, some of the engineering efforts that we have to quantify -- or to qualify new parts or secondary sources to open up new sources of supply. Those things are paying dividends for us and have contributed to the revenue performance that we've been able to deliver. And so, -- but as we look forward, and you asked specifically about the guide for the second half, we are still very much supply chain-constrained. And so, what that really bakes in is kind of our direct line of sight to delivery of the piece parts that we need to get products out the door and into the hands of our customers. It's a situation that's being very actively managed, but I think we're doing a good job of getting product into the hands of our customers on a time line that is acceptable to them.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Samik, this is Satish. Just to add on to what Neil mentioned. We have a very solid backlog position, over $2.4 billion. The demand continues to outpace supply. We know the challenges out there, but we feel very confident, and we're very prudent in our guide to ensure that we execute flawlessly. And we are continuing to be nimble and agile. And as Neil mentioned and I mentioned earlier, to execute to our commitments, we take it very seriously.\nOperator: The next question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.\nMeta Marshall: A couple of questions for me. One, OpEx. Despite the revenue, the OpEx kind of came in about as expected. And so, I just wanted to see how you guys are managing, either T&E coming back or just inflationary pressures on OpEx, and where you're kind of finding some of those efficiencies. And then, as a follow-up, you guys mentioned the new win in silicon photonics test. Obviously, it seems like a good long-term opportunity. Just time to ramp and whether you've already seen interest from other customers as you've kind of made progress in that? Thanks.\nNeil Dougherty: I'll take the first part of that, and then we'll let Satish or Mark address the silicon photonics part of the question. So, yes, with regard to the OpEx spending and the return of T&E and facilities costs, we didn't -- honest answer is, we did not see a lot of that in Q2, right? The Omicron spike, if you will, was kind of right in the middle of our second quarter, and we did not see any meaningful kind of return to -- of travel, entertainment and return to office. We have recently, more at the beginning of Q3, started to bring our employees back to our physical sites in . We are starting to see travel and entertainment not return to normal, but starting to reramp here more of a -- as more of a third quarter event. As regard to inflation, we're seeing cost of inflation in a number of different places across the P&L. And I think our action -- or our challenges with managing that is to capitalize on the differentiation that exists in our portfolio and look to monetize that where we can and continue to bring differentiated high software content solutions to the marketplace so that we can continue to manage that. I think if you look at the margin performance of the business, we're doing a good job to date managing those inflationary increases across the P&L.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Meta, I think if you look at the entire customer base of Keysight, the amount of inputs that we're getting for strong collaborations is at a record high. Customers deeper engagement with us, and they are -- very often are engaging us much earlier in the design cycle. So, we are very well positioned, given the strength of our relationships to be able to act on some of your inputs where it matches our strategy and continue to progress it. If I look at the semiconductor activity all the way from new silicon wafer starts to the cloud, there is a tremendous amount of designs that are occurring both from traditional players moving up the stack and from system players that want to verticalize and own the IP and well positioned to be working with all these customers across the wireless, wireline and even the fab to progress some of their strategies and enable them to be successful. And we're very pleased. I mean, the silicon photonic solution is very unique, it's an industry first, and we're very pleased with the design win we're getting because with each of these wins is a deeper collaboration to understand where the future is going and define it. Silicon photonics is one of the technologies that is seen as a possible solution to the high-throughput demands of a data center and cloud environment. So, it's another area where Keysight is opening up a new franchise, which will continue to position us for future growth.\nMeta Marshall: Perfect. Congrats, guys. Thanks.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS. You may proceed.\nChris Snyder: Thank you. I wanted to ask about the backlog. I think the prepared remarks disclosed it to be $2.4 billion, which is roughly 45% of the current year revenue guide, and obviously, well above where it's been historically. So, based on guidance and the commentary around supply chain, it certainly does not sound like this backlog will be released to any capacity this year. So, I guess, my question is, how should we think about the cadence of this backlog release? Any color on the good duration or impact? Like, will we see it come through or will it just be kind of tapered in over many, many quarters? Any color there is helpful.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. Well, first, you're absolutely right. We do not expect that we're going to reduce backlog at all this year. In fact, we would estimate in the current supply environment, which we expect to be challenging through the remainder of our fiscal year that we're going to continue to add to backlog. I think, how the backlog eventually winds its way from where -- from its current elevated levels to a more normalized level is really a function of how the broader supply chain situation resolves itself, right? And it's only educated guesses at this point because the honest answer is we don't know what that's going to look like. But I'm not expecting that there's going to be a step-function improvement across the supply chain that allows us to flush backlog over a one- or two-quarter period. I think it's going to be much more a function of us slowly bringing our quote and lead times on products down and slowly working that -- the backlog down to more normalized levels.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: And we also view this as a favorable long-term trend for our business to enter a given quarter and having higher confidence in -- with the backlog. And as we think about the growing solutions that we're engaging with customers -- and these are deeper, longer-term relationships and they tend to give us very good visibility into our business. And we're pretty bullish by the growth prospects across the wireless, the wireline ecosystem, our industrial business. We have multiple vectors of growth around these big mega trends that is driving some of this backlog as well.\nChris Snyder: I appreciate that. So, then, for my next one, maybe I'll turn back and follow up on earlier commentary around the auto business. I understand from a high level, the Company is levered into really all the great secular trends in auto, whether it's battery R&D, charging infrastructure and autonomous. But I guess my question is, what's the biggest driver of this business? And is there anything we can track or monitor to just benchmark where growth could be here, whether that's like industry battery R&D spend, EV model proliferation? Just any help on how to think about -- like just kind of conceptualize the growth potential?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I think at the simplistic level, we're tethered to the R&D spend that's occurring. And if you look at it, the entire ecosystem is spending to continually innovate on range autonomous capabilities. And it's a long-term driver. And if you look at the organic R&D investments being made by automakers, it's only poised to increase with time. So, I think that would be the closest external dynamic I would point to. I would also say, if you look back even a few years ago, the number of in-house labs to  and own generation of R&D from automakers was fairly sketchy, but we're starting to see more investment there across the world as more and more cars have more of these EV features driven by the bigger ESG goals and environment concerns around the world.\nMark Wallace: Hey Chris, this is Mark. I'll just add one thing to what Satish just said, and that's -- it makes it harder to track for you and for everyone. But there's so many different elements of what's happening with this transformation within the whole mobility space, whether it's the electrification of the drivetrain; the connectivity to the external network or communications within the vehicle, which we just announced some solutions to, to the charging infrastructure, which is being funded heavily by multiple nations as part of this transformation, to the millimeter wave and high-frequency technology around the sensors. It's just remarkable, the computational capabilities. And that's why this is such an important space to us is it intersects with all these areas of strength. And we continue to innovate with the industry leaders around all of the global ecosystems, as we said earlier. So, it's a long, long runway with all kinds of different elements of innovation.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.\nMehdi Hosseini: I have two follow-ups. I apologize if some of the questions have already been raised, since I joined the call late. One on the pricing dynamic, and I'm not asking for any quantitative color, but perhaps maybe you can explain to me on a qualitative basis. You are relatively more vertically integrated, and you have relatively more relationship with the strategic mission-critical customers. Are these two -- perhaps assuming lower input costs and higher relevancy to these mission-critical application, have they enabled you to extract more economics from your customers? And I have a follow-up.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Mehdi, thank you for the question. Absolutely. I mean, you look at our focus around offering total solutions to customers, this has been our strategy since then, and that is really separating ourself. Our strategy is very clear. We look at some of the most tougher challenges in the industry that we serve, and we offer solutions. And by definition, it has higher software content. And over time, we've layered in services, which allows us to work with customers through their life cycle needs. All of that is favorable to our ability to continue to grow margins in the business and help offset some of the inflationary pricing pressures that we face.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay. So, perhaps that's already reflected in your free cash flow margin that has been double digit. And I'm asking or raising this topic since the stock has been under pressure, and you've also been very active in buyback. Is there anything else with capital return that you're thinking of contemplating that would better reflect a company's ability to extract more economics and have a rather stable free cash flow? Like, would you favor paying more cash dividend rather than a buyback? And then, as a quick follow-up, has FX been dialed into your guide?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Mehdi. I think as you heard, multiple end-market exposures we have. And as you stated, towards many critical -- mission-critical applications, we're really bullish on the long-term opportunity at Keysight to create value. And so, congruent with that, we continue to be committed to this disciplined, balanced approach for capital allocation. First priority is obviously to invest for organic growth and differentiation, and we're seeing a lot of opportunities as we engage with our customers. Second, we are disciplined with M&A and -- but we're continuing to look for opportunities. We have a strong funnel, but we remain patient to make sure that it fits our hurdle as we have done in the past. And of course, it has to make sense for our strategy. And lastly, where we see opportunities, like the current situation, we believe that we will be more aggressive and take advantage of the return of capital through share buybacks as we have done this quarter. And we'll continue to remain on it. We have $600 million of previously authorized share buyback that we can still deploy, and we'll continue to deploy it as we see opportunities at these levels.\nNeil Dougherty: And then, the second part of your question was have we accounted for FX in the guide. To the extent that FX has moved to date, yes, that's all baked into our guide. I had mentioned that it's about a 2 percentage-point headwind on a year-over-year basis in the second half. And relative to when we put out our original full year guide of 6% to 7% growth, there's an additional 1.5 points of unfavorable currency. So, we're raising from 6% to 7% all the  8%,  but there's an additional unfavorable 1.5 points of currency baked into that, again, based on rates as at today.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup.\nJim Suva: I just have one question and that is, could you let us know a little bit about the software and services, specifically with some of these growing newer end markets like automotive and power? Is the attach rate and opportunity similar with the past? Less or more than what the past is for these newer end markets, again, services and software? Thank you.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Jim. As we stated, as we are starting to go beyond the core products and that engineering teams use, which is lab instruments into more solutions, they have a higher weighted average of software and then greater ability to monetize through services. So, we're still very early innings in deploying those things. The latest ADE offering that we have, we're building it on top of our 5G platform, which is rich with software. But also as we expand into the application layer, as we bring more real-world challenges in the auto industry into the lab, we'll continue to see the opportunity be bigger over time, and we're investing to realize that.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Rob Mason with Baird.\nRob Mason: Satish, I'll just add my congratulations to your new role as well. My question was around the general electronics business. You did mention all-time record revenue there. And I was curious how the order rate performed in that piece of the business as well. I'm not sure I caught that. And then, just maybe related as well. Historically, kind of thought of the general electronics piece of the business as more PMI-sensitive. But, as you were describing that business, there seems like there's a lot of newer applications there. And I'm just curious if that's broadened out, how you're viewing that historical perspective, at least from perhaps a macroeconomic view to that part of the business.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. It's a great question. I'll have Mark answer the first part of it as to how we're doing with orders. But I'll say you're right. I mean, as we have -- when we started the company and when we thought about general electronics business had a bigger correlation to manufacturing customer base. And over time, we've been adding more R&D applications and focus to the team as it has been able to bring in some newer end-market applications, such as digital health and IoT. And it continues to move up the value chain with our customers. So, over time, we would expect it to continue to be more in that direction. Another area of focus for that group is also around advanced research. As I noted, we had some announcements with the Singapore -- with a university in Singapore around quantum. We also had a major win in terahertz research associated with that business. So, we continue to ensure that we're seeking more value-added, sustainable, durable opportunities in that business, but that business historically has had a little bit more manufacturing exposure than the rest. So, I'll just hand over to Mark to speak about...\nMark Wallace: Sure. Thanks, Satish. Yes. Rob, we saw some moderating order growth during the quarter, mainly because of some softness in education. With some of the delays to the government spending and some of the other priorities that have come upon the funding, we did see some softness there. But we saw a lot of new customers in growth from R&D solutions for digital healthcare. We've added nearly 500 new customers again in the quarter, which helps to diversify our base and represents this broad base of industries across multiple segments and so forth. We saw strong demand continue across Asia with several new wins around the R&D solutions. And as Satish just mentioned, there have been some real bright spots around advanced research with our university. So, GDP markets are affected more or less with some of the activities in the geopolitical situation, which I think translates to some of the moderating growth we saw. But all in all, we see a continued demand for some of our advanced R&D solutions.\nRob Mason: Sure. That's great color. Just as a quick follow-up, maybe for Neil. The -- is there anything, Neil, that you would call out that we should be monitoring around our margin assumptions as you convert some of the backlog just, again, taking your commentary around rising inflation, just how your -- how we should look at the price-cost dynamic within your backlog?\nNeil Dougherty: I mean, the backlog -- the biggest issue there is the backlog does create a little bit of a delay between the time at which we might impact a price increase and the time at which that price increase would be recognized in revenue, whereas it seems like on the input cost side, the cost increases are much more real time, particularly if you want to secure delivery of product. And so, that mismatch is something we're very actively managing, but it can cause some quarter-to-quarter perturbations if the timing gets off. But I think, generally speaking, we're doing a good job of managing in this inflationary environment and protecting margins.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis.\nAdam Thalhimer: Good afternoon. Great quarter, guys. Quick one on M&A. On M&A, have you seen any softening in seller expectations?\nNeil Dougherty: Not a lot yet. Obviously, we've seen the market pullbacks, but seller expectations still seem to be kind of linked to prior valuations. So, we're watching that closely and very actively managing our funnel, staying disciplined with regard to our return hurdles and hoping that we get the opportunity to act on some of these targets. But right now, there does seem to be a little bit of a mismatch there.\nAdam Thalhimer: Got it. And then, sorry, if you\u2019ve fleshed this out, but what was the Russia impact, Neil?\nNeil Dougherty: We -- it's about 2 points. So, core order growth within the quarter was 11. Adjusted for Russia, it was 13. We canceled low-$20 million kind of backlog for Russia. It has historically been a 1% business for us.\nOperator: There are no additional questions at this time. I will now pass it back to the management team for any closing remarks.\nJason Kary: Well, thank you, Tia, and thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with many of you at the upcoming conferences, and wish you a great day.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Mark Wallace",
            "content": "And Matt, hi. This is Mark. I'll address your second question on the kind of customer dynamics in Europe and Asia. So, in Asia Pac, we had double-digit order growth again as well as in China, where, as you noted, we had the COVID protocol restrictions and lockdowns. And it's really a continuation of our ability to dynamically pivot and work with customers while both, in a face-to-face as well as a virtual remote nature. So, it's a testament to the broad strength and demand of our business across multiple industries and segments. In Asia, in particular, we saw strong continued demand and growth in automotive and semi, 400 gig, 800 gig, terabit, all of those things. So, very stable there. In Europe, we did see an impact, obviously, from the Russia cancellations. So, we had double-digit order growth in all regions except for Europe. But again, the demand continues. We saw a robust demand for our semiconductor solutions, again, automotive, our commercial comms across the European region. So, the broad interactions and dynamics with our customers so far remain pretty much unchanged. Yes. Samik, this is Mark. I think just to add to Satish, the budget in the U.S. was approved. It was increased. And as we've been watching our customers, both the direct government and the prime contractors, we expect some of that funding to start flowing to new program starts here in our second half.

Thanks, Satish. Yes. Rob, we saw some moderating order growth during the quarter, mainly because of some softness in education. With some of the delays to the government spending and some of the other priorities that have come upon the funding, we did see some softness there. But we saw a lot of new customers in growth from R&D solutions for digital healthcare. We've added nearly 500 new customers again in the quarter, which helps to diversify our base and represents this broad base of industries across multiple segments and so forth. We saw strong demand continue across Asia with several new wins around the R&D solutions. And as Satish just mentioned, there have been some real bright spots around advanced research with our university. So, GDP markets are affected more or less with some of the activities in the geopolitical situation, which I think translates to some of the moderating growth we saw. But all in all, we see a continued demand for some of our advanced R&D solutions."

            "content": "Thank you, Satish, and hello, everyone. Our performance this quarter once again demonstrated the resilience of our business. We delivered on our commitments and exceeded expectations as we powered through multiple challenges and new headwinds in the quarter. In the second quarter of 2022, we delivered revenue of $1,351 million, which was above the high end of our guidance range and grew 11% or 12% on a core basis. We generated $1,458 million in orders, up 9% or 11% on a core basis. During the quarter, we suspended our operations in Russia and canceled our entire backlog of Russian orders. Core growth adjusted for Russia was 13%. Demand again outpaced supply, and we ended the quarter with over $2.4 billion in backlog. Turning to our operational results for Q2. We reported gross margin of 65% and operating expenses of $489 million, resulting in an operating margin of 29%. The strength of our results highlights the resiliency of our business and our team's ability to execute despite significant supply, cost and currency headwinds within the quarter. We achieved net income of $334 million and delivered $1.83 in earnings per share, which was above the high end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 183 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated record revenue of $963 million, up 10% or 11% on a core basis. CSG delivered gross margin of 66% and operating margin of 28%. Within CSG, commercial communications generated revenue of $672 million, up 11% with double-digit revenue growth in the Americas, driven by strong demand for 5G device and component development as well as network test, O-RAN and terabit R&D. Aerospace, defense and government revenue of $291 million grew 7%. Our backlog for this end market remains strong, and we reported solid growth in the Americas and Europe. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated second quarter revenue of $388 million, up 13% or 15% on a core basis, driven by strong revenue growth in automotive and semiconductor. EISG reported gross margin of 62% and operating margin of 30%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the second quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generating cash flow from operations of $298 million and free cash flow of $245 million or 18% of revenue. Share repurchases this quarter totaled 1.9 million shares at an average price per share of $153.78, for a total consideration of $289 million. Year-to-date, we have purchased approximately 3 million shares for a total consideration of $495 million. Now, turning to our outlook and guidance. The demand environment remains strong for Keysight solutions. As in recent quarters, our revenues continue to be constrained by tight supply conditions. However, we have demonstrated our ability to effectively navigate through this environment, and we remain confident in our ability to execute and deliver on our commitments. We expect third quarter 2022 revenue to be in the range of $1,330 million to $1,350 million and Q3 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.74 to $1.80, based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 181 million shares. We now expect full year revenue growth to approach 8%, which given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar now includes a 2-point year-over-year headwind from currency. We're also raising our earnings growth expectation to 14% to 15%. Despite quarter-to-quarter dynamics being difficult to predict, we have confidence in our raised expectations for the year. In closing, we have a strong track record of execution. Our backlog is at an all-time high, and we are well positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities across our diverse set of end markets. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A. Yes. Obviously, we saw in a situation where -- this is Neil, by the way, where demand is outpacing supply. And so, we have not at this started to pull lead times back down. I would call our lead times generally stable. I'd say, they're slightly creeping north at this point with demand continuing to outpace supply. But by and large, on average, we see a lot of stability in lead times currently with the goal to work them down over time as the supply chain situation ultimately starts to loosen. I'll take the first part of that, the question about the guide. As we've already stated, our revenue situation is still highly constrained by the supply environment. And we had significant outperformance in Q2 as we navigated the tight supply environment and did better than we expected. And so, -- but what you can read into that is that a significant portion of our Q2 outperformance was shipment of orders that we had originally or going into the quarter had scheduled to be in Q3. And so, that's great news, and we're pleased with that. But that -- on a quarter-over-quarter basis, that can be a significant impact. I would say that the guidance reflects our best estimate as we see it at this point in time. This quarter-to-quarter perturbations can be very difficult to call in this environment. We certainly have the backlog to do better if -- depending on how incoming supply works. And I think the point that we want everybody to focus on is that we are taking up the full year guidance significantly from 6% to 7% growth to approaching 8%. And that 8% growth, as you noted, has kind of new and significant FX headwinds. We saw a very significant strengthening of the dollar within our fiscal second quarter. We now have a 2-point year-over-year headwind in the second half that we're baking into account. And on the full year basis, we have a 1.5-point relative of FX. Just from November, when we put out the 6% to 7% guide to where we are today, saying approaching 8%, there's a new 1.5% FX headwind baked into that. And so, we feel very good about the situation as it currently sits and are pleased to be raising estimates for the year. Yes. So, I think you need to take a close look at our Q4 performance in FY21, which was a bit of an outlier at 31% operating margin, a full almost 4 points higher than the prior -- the sequential quarters leading up to that. And so, I think as you -- and the other -- one of the big drivers within the fourth quarter of last year, if you look at it, we had a sequential decrease in R&D investment that was quite substantial going from Q3 to Q4. And that is atypical. And so, we would expect increasing investments on a sequential basis as we move from Q2 to Q3 and then again as we move from Q3 to Q4 as we invest in the future and the future growth of our business. And so, again, we remain optimistic about our business. And some of these quarter-to-quarter perturbations can be difficult to call, but we are raising our both, revenue and EPS guidance for the year quite substantially and are focused on executing. Yes. So, in prior quarters, we've talked about an expectation or thinking that we would see some material improvement in the supply chain situation in the second half of this year. To this point, we have not seen that. And in fact, I think if you look broader across the tech industry, there's an argument that things got incrementally worse in Q2, are more challenging, driven by the Russia-Ukraine conflict as well as the COVID shutdowns in China, even though those COVID shutdowns don't impact us directly. I think for us, we look at the items that we can control, our own capacity both for finished goods as well as for the subcomponents that come out of our fab and technology centers that feed our instrumentation. We look at our relationships with our suppliers, some of the engineering efforts that we have to quantify -- or to qualify new parts or secondary sources to open up new sources of supply. Those things are paying dividends for us and have contributed to the revenue performance that we've been able to deliver. And so, -- but as we look forward, and you asked specifically about the guide for the second half, we are still very much supply chain-constrained. And so, what that really bakes in is kind of our direct line of sight to delivery of the piece parts that we need to get products out the door and into the hands of our customers. It's a situation that's being very actively managed, but I think we're doing a good job of getting product into the hands of our customers on a time line that is acceptable to them. I'll take the first part of that, and then we'll let Satish or Mark address the silicon photonics part of the question. So, yes, with regard to the OpEx spending and the return of T&E and facilities costs, we didn't -- honest answer is, we did not see a lot of that in Q2, right? The Omicron spike, if you will, was kind of right in the middle of our second quarter, and we did not see any meaningful kind of return to -- of travel, entertainment and return to office. We have recently, more at the beginning of Q3, started to bring our employees back to our physical sites in . We are starting to see travel and entertainment not return to normal, but starting to reramp here more of a -- as more of a third quarter event. As regard to inflation, we're seeing cost of inflation in a number of different places across the P&L. And I think our action -- or our challenges with managing that is to capitalize on the differentiation that exists in our portfolio and look to monetize that where we can and continue to bring differentiated high software content solutions to the marketplace so that we can continue to manage that. I think if you look at the margin performance of the business, we're doing a good job to date managing those inflationary increases across the P&L. Yes. Well, first, you're absolutely right. We do not expect that we're going to reduce backlog at all this year. In fact, we would estimate in the current supply environment, which we expect to be challenging through the remainder of our fiscal year that we're going to continue to add to backlog. I think, how the backlog eventually winds its way from where -- from its current elevated levels to a more normalized level is really a function of how the broader supply chain situation resolves itself, right? And it's only educated guesses at this point because the honest answer is we don't know what that's going to look like. But I'm not expecting that there's going to be a step-function improvement across the supply chain that allows us to flush backlog over a one- or two-quarter period. I think it's going to be much more a function of us slowly bringing our quote and lead times on products down and slowly working that -- the backlog down to more normalized levels. And then, the second part of your question was have we accounted for FX in the guide. To the extent that FX has moved to date, yes, that's all baked into our guide. I had mentioned that it's about a 2 percentage-point headwind on a year-over-year basis in the second half. And relative to when we put out our original full year guide of 6% to 7% growth, there's an additional 1.5 points of unfavorable currency. So, we're raising from 6% to 7% all the  8%,  but there's an additional unfavorable 1.5 points of currency baked into that, again, based on rates as at today. I mean, the backlog -- the biggest issue there is the backlog does create a little bit of a delay between the time at which we might impact a price increase and the time at which that price increase would be recognized in revenue, whereas it seems like on the input cost side, the cost increases are much more real time, particularly if you want to secure delivery of product. And so, that mismatch is something we're very actively managing, but it can cause some quarter-to-quarter perturbations if the timing gets off. But I think, generally speaking, we're doing a good job of managing in this inflationary environment and protecting margins. Not a lot yet. Obviously, we've seen the market pullbacks, but seller expectations still seem to be kind of linked to prior valuations. So, we're watching that closely and very actively managing our funnel, staying disciplined with regard to our return hurdles and hoping that we get the opportunity to act on some of these targets. But right now, there does seem to be a little bit of a mismatch there. We -- it's about 2 points. So, core order growth within the quarter was 11. Adjusted for Russia, it was 13. We canceled low-$20 million kind of backlog for Russia. It has historically been a 1% business for us."

            "name": "Satish Dhanasekaran",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. Welcome to the second quarter 2022 earnings call and my first as the CEO of Keysight. I am humbled and honored to be Keysight's CEO and excited about the future. I would like to thank Ron Nersesian for his visionary leadership of the Company, which has provided us a solid foundation to build on. Over the last decade, I've had the honor of working closely with Ron and benefited greatly from his experience in many different roles I've held since joining the Company 16 years ago. This is a great time to be at Keysight as we remain focused on our core purpose of accelerating innovation to connect and secure the world. Keysight delivered exceptional results in quarter two, driven by strong execution and broad-based demand across the business. The team focused on innovating and solving customers' design and test challenges while successfully navigating the ongoing supply chain and geopolitical challenges. I will focus my comments today on 3 key headlines. First, we delivered record quarter two orders, capitalizing on the robust end-market demand for Keysight's high-value differentiated solutions. Our focus on delivering first-to-market solutions is enabling us to uncover new emerging applications, adding to our momentum. Second, we achieved record revenue, strong operating margin performance, resulting in record earnings per share, which grew 27%, demonstrating the durability and resilience of our business. Third, we are raising our outlook for the year based on our strong performance in the first half and continued momentum. We now expect to achieve revenue growth approaching 8% and earnings per share growth in the range of 14% to 15% for the fiscal year. Let's now take a deeper look at our results for the quarter. Second quarter orders grew 9% to $1.46 billion and outpaced revenue, which grew 11% to a new record of $1.35 billion and was $41 million above the high end of our guidance. We achieved gross margins of 65%, operating margin of 29% and record EPS of $1.83, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.14. Also with the ongoing equity market volatility, we again capitalized on the opportunity to accelerate share repurchases. These results are a reflection of our strong portfolio and our global team's application of the Keysight leadership model, which enables us to deliver consistent value to all stakeholders. We delivered these results despite many headwinds, including geopolitical challenges, inflationary pressures and continued supply chain disruptions. We continue to advance our software-centric solution strategy as the rapid pace of technology accelerates, our customers across end markets are seeking deeper engagements earlier in the design cycle and are adopting our software solutions. The capabilities of our PathWave software platform facilitate continuous stream of releases that matches the innovation cadence of our customers. This enables us to secure enterprise agreements with market leaders for high-value R&D solutions. Orders for software and value-added services like KeysightCare again grew double digits as we continued to grow recurring revenue this quarter. Turning to our business segments. Communications Solutions Group delivered record second quarter orders and an all-time record revenue. Within CSG, commercial communications achieved all-time record orders and revenue with double-digit order growth for the third consecutive quarter. Ongoing innovation and investments in our end markets spanning both, the wireless and wireline segments remained strong, driven by adoption of 5G, 400 gig, 800 gig and terabit and optical technologies. In wireless, the increase in the number of 5G device types continues to drive test and certification requirements. With our leading solutions portfolio, we expect to benefit from the continued investment in the evolution of 5G standards, including stand-alone 5G, Release 16 and beyond. In quarter two, Keysight announced collaborations with leading companies such as NTT DOCOMO, Telefonica and Analog Devices to enable a wide range of 5G applications, including O-RAN, which continues to gain momentum. In wireline, we're enabling the digital transformation, driven by cloud computing and telecom stack virtualization through our end-to-end solutions. We recently launched the industry's first 800-gig solution to enable data center design workflows for ultra-high data rates and energy efficiency. Aerospace, defense and government achieved record Q2 revenue, driven by double-digit growth in Americas and strength in signal monitoring, cyber and space and satellite solutions as well as 5G and 6G applications. Complex scenario emulations continue to drive the need for modeling and digital twin solutions with increasing software content. Our leading network analyzer platform and phased array test solutions enable increasingly complex satellite communication design and test requirements. Increasing defense budgets in the U.S. and Europe are expected to provide support for higher spend going forward. CSG is well positioned to capitalize on growth by enabling innovation in our end markets through our broad and synergistic portfolio, including wireline, wireless, cybersecurity, satellite and space solutions. The Electronics Industrial Solutions Group delivered double-digit order and revenue growth for the seventh consecutive quarter, driven by automotive and semiconductor solutions. In automotive, all-time record revenue was driven by strong demand for our expanding portfolio of EV and AV applications. Keysight is capitalizing on strategic investments in the automotive and energy space, providing industry-first solutions that support new capabilities and use cases, such as our recently launched protocol test solution for in-vehicle networking. During the quarter, we secured EV wins with major OEMs across all regions. In addition, we're excited by the recognition of our new Radar Scene Emulator solution, including the 2022 Tech.AD Europe award. We saw strong demand for our semiconductor solutions, which delivered double-digit order and revenue growth. Investments in advanced semiconductor technologies, along with capacity expansion for existing nodes, remain robust. Over the next 3 to 5 years, we see solid customer R&D roadmaps for ICs for a broader set of applications. As an example, in Q2, we sold our first on-wafer silicon photonics parametric test solution to a major semiconductor fab to develop and manufacture next-generation data center transceivers. We believe this trend represents long-term opportunities for Keysight's R&D solutions portfolio. Our general electronics business achieved all-time record revenue as investments continued in manufacturing and device development for consumer and industrial IoT, digital health and advanced research. We're seeing active investments globally in fundamental research in terahertz and quantum technologies. For example, we recently announced a collaboration with National Research Foundation of Singapore's quantum engineering program to accelerate research and development and education in quantum technologies. The strength of our general electronics business reflects the broad nature of applications for our solutions. Before I wrap, I'd like to acknowledge and thank our more than 14,000 employees worldwide for their commitment to our customers around the globe and for their passion in delivering market-leading solutions. I'm proud to share that Keysight was recently named as one of Fortune 100's best companies to work for in 2022. This is a recognition of our inclusive and diverse culture exhibiting value for collaboration, high performance and innovation. Our culture also places high value on corporate social responsibility. We recently released our 2021 CSR report, highlighting our progress in environmental, social and governance efforts worldwide and announcing new goals to track through '22 and into '23. I believe Keysight has a bright future ahead. I look forward to working with the team to execute our strategy and continue to deliver greater value for our customers, shareholders and employees. With that, I'll turn the call over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook. Neil? Yes. Hi, David. Thanks for the question. As you saw from our results this quarter, we had a very strong quarter from a revenue perspective. We're very pleased with the strong execution progress of the team. And the five-point program we've been running around strengthening our relationships with suppliers, finding alternate sourcing, being nimble in this environment has really paid rich dividends, along with some of the other initiatives we have. And while the supplier environment remains, in our view, pretty challenging, but we have found a way to find more upside. I would say that the demand from our customers is robust. And our customers want the products as quickly as we can make them, and we're shipping them as quickly as we can. So, the supply situation does remain challenging to the point you made, but we've been able to find a way around it. Thank you. Yes. Thank you. I think, the auto business is very exciting for us for more than one reason, I would say. First, very strong quarter, obviously, building on many quarters where we've seen a very strong uptick in the business, primarily driven by this decade-plus long trends of electrification, autonomous driving. And we're actually feeding a number of these engineering labs with our tools and capabilities and solutions designed for this end market. We're engaging with the OEMs globally. We've had some successes, as I reported, in this quarter. And we're also working with the entire ecosystem with the Tier 1, Tier 2 suppliers, the semiconductor houses that feed the auto and the test labs that are just growing across the world. So, it's a growing ecosystem. We're expanding our portfolio into EV, particularly around battery test, charging test, in-vehicle network testing as an example. And in AV, we're very excited by the new solution that we have offered for autonomous drive emulation, which is enabling in-loop, real-time, synchronized sensor evaluations, and this is a build on our 5G platform and capability. So, we're very pleased with the progress we're making, and we know that we have a long runway ahead with automotive. Thank you, Samik. Of course, aerospace and defense business has been historically, as we have talked about, a GDP-plus business for us. It's very broad with 50% of the business tied to the U.S. or North America. And we're excited by the number of new areas that we're applying our technology to, space and satellite being one of them. And 5G and 6G adoption into this sector is a new opportunity for us. So, independent of the budgets, we're pleased with the traction we're making in applying our technology to offer new solutions. The budget is obviously a huge stability. I think the fact that you have bipartisan support for the defense budget growth in RDT&E line item for this year and then subsequent growth also projected for 2023, we view as a favorable sign. I think these geopolitical tensions tend to provide more stability not only in the U.S., but we're also expecting a similar uptick in Europe, and therefore, technology spend. But as we know, this business is an average over the long term, and we have been doing better than GDP, and our intent is to continue to do that and offer new solutions. With regard to the quote activity, I'll let Mark make a few comments. Yes. Samik, this is Satish. Just to add on to what Neil mentioned. We have a very solid backlog position, over $2.4 billion. The demand continues to outpace supply. We know the challenges out there, but we feel very confident, and we're very prudent in our guide to ensure that we execute flawlessly. And we are continuing to be nimble and agile. And as Neil mentioned and I mentioned earlier, to execute to our commitments, we take it very seriously. Yes. Meta, I think if you look at the entire customer base of Keysight, the amount of inputs that we're getting for strong collaborations is at a record high. Customers deeper engagement with us, and they are -- very often are engaging us much earlier in the design cycle. So, we are very well positioned, given the strength of our relationships to be able to act on some of your inputs where it matches our strategy and continue to progress it. If I look at the semiconductor activity all the way from new silicon wafer starts to the cloud, there is a tremendous amount of designs that are occurring both from traditional players moving up the stack and from system players that want to verticalize and own the IP and well positioned to be working with all these customers across the wireless, wireline and even the fab to progress some of their strategies and enable them to be successful. And we're very pleased. I mean, the silicon photonic solution is very unique, it's an industry first, and we're very pleased with the design win we're getting because with each of these wins is a deeper collaboration to understand where the future is going and define it. Silicon photonics is one of the technologies that is seen as a possible solution to the high-throughput demands of a data center and cloud environment. So, it's another area where Keysight is opening up a new franchise, which will continue to position us for future growth. Thank you. And we also view this as a favorable long-term trend for our business to enter a given quarter and having higher confidence in -- with the backlog. And as we think about the growing solutions that we're engaging with customers -- and these are deeper, longer-term relationships and they tend to give us very good visibility into our business. And we're pretty bullish by the growth prospects across the wireless, the wireline ecosystem, our industrial business. We have multiple vectors of growth around these big mega trends that is driving some of this backlog as well. Yes. I think at the simplistic level, we're tethered to the R&D spend that's occurring. And if you look at it, the entire ecosystem is spending to continually innovate on range autonomous capabilities. And it's a long-term driver. And if you look at the organic R&D investments being made by automakers, it's only poised to increase with time. So, I think that would be the closest external dynamic I would point to. I would also say, if you look back even a few years ago, the number of in-house labs to  and own generation of R&D from automakers was fairly sketchy, but we're starting to see more investment there across the world as more and more cars have more of these EV features driven by the bigger ESG goals and environment concerns around the world. Yes. Mehdi, thank you for the question. Absolutely. I mean, you look at our focus around offering total solutions to customers, this has been our strategy since then, and that is really separating ourself. Our strategy is very clear. We look at some of the most tougher challenges in the industry that we serve, and we offer solutions. And by definition, it has higher software content. And over time, we've layered in services, which allows us to work with customers through their life cycle needs. All of that is favorable to our ability to continue to grow margins in the business and help offset some of the inflationary pricing pressures that we face. Thank you, Mehdi. I think as you heard, multiple end-market exposures we have. And as you stated, towards many critical -- mission-critical applications, we're really bullish on the long-term opportunity at Keysight to create value. And so, congruent with that, we continue to be committed to this disciplined, balanced approach for capital allocation. First priority is obviously to invest for organic growth and differentiation, and we're seeing a lot of opportunities as we engage with our customers. Second, we are disciplined with M&A and -- but we're continuing to look for opportunities. We have a strong funnel, but we remain patient to make sure that it fits our hurdle as we have done in the past. And of course, it has to make sense for our strategy. And lastly, where we see opportunities, like the current situation, we believe that we will be more aggressive and take advantage of the return of capital through share buybacks as we have done this quarter. And we'll continue to remain on it. We have $600 million of previously authorized share buyback that we can still deploy, and we'll continue to deploy it as we see opportunities at these levels. Thank you, Jim. As we stated, as we are starting to go beyond the core products and that engineering teams use, which is lab instruments into more solutions, they have a higher weighted average of software and then greater ability to monetize through services. So, we're still very early innings in deploying those things. The latest ADE offering that we have, we're building it on top of our 5G platform, which is rich with software. But also as we expand into the application layer, as we bring more real-world challenges in the auto industry into the lab, we'll continue to see the opportunity be bigger over time, and we're investing to realize that. Yes. It's a great question. I'll have Mark answer the first part of it as to how we're doing with orders. But I'll say you're right. I mean, as we have -- when we started the company and when we thought about general electronics business had a bigger correlation to manufacturing customer base. And over time, we've been adding more R&D applications and focus to the team as it has been able to bring in some newer end-market applications, such as digital health and IoT. And it continues to move up the value chain with our customers. So, over time, we would expect it to continue to be more in that direction. Another area of focus for that group is also around advanced research. As I noted, we had some announcements with the Singapore -- with a university in Singapore around quantum. We also had a major win in terahertz research associated with that business. So, we continue to ensure that we're seeking more value-added, sustainable, durable opportunities in that business, but that business historically has had a little bit more manufacturing exposure than the rest. So, I'll just hand over to Mark to speak about..."

First quarter results are evidence that our broad-based portfolio of differentiated solutions is aligned with the market's most important design and test challenges. We are enabling our customers to address rapidly evolving technologies and market opportunities.  Today, I'll focus my comments on 3 key headlines. First, we continue to see sustained robust demand with record orders again exceeding our expectations. Growth in the quarter was broad-based and balanced across our diverse set of end markets and across all regions. Orders grew 22% year-over-year and were 31% higher than the first quarter of 2020, just prior to the initial impact of the COVID pandemic.  Second, record first quarter revenue and earnings per share exceeded the high end of our guidance despite ongoing supply constraints. Our results and exceptional execution by the Keysight team continue to demonstrate the durability and resilience of our business.  And third, Keysight solutions are aligned with the long-term secular trends fueled by ongoing innovation across multiple markets. Our investments in growth initiatives and supply chain resiliency are paying off. We continue to expect to deliver 6% to 7% revenue growth for the year, and given the stronger-than-guided first quarter earnings, to achieve 12% earnings growth. We are confident in the strength of the company we built and our ability to drive above-market profitable growth over the long term.  Accordingly, with the recent equity market volatility, we capitalized on the opportunity to create value for shareholders by accelerating our share repurchases in the past 2 quarters.  Now let's take a deeper look into our first quarter results. We delivered another quarter of record orders, which grew 22% to $1.5 billion. This outpaced record first quarter revenue, which grew 6% to $1.25 billion. We achieved gross margin of 66%, operating margin of 28% and EPS of $1.65, all of which were first quarter records. Although supply constraints continue to moderate revenue, Keysight's consistent execution and focus on growth initiatives across the 5G ecosystem, automotive and software position us well to capitalize on a robust demand environment.  The Electronics Industrial Solutions Group delivered double-digit order and revenue growth for the sixth consecutive quarter. Record orders were driven by strong demand for automotive and semiconductor solutions as well as broad general electronic applications. Our differentiated solutions position us well to win in the fast-expanding automotive market, where we achieved all-time record orders and record first quarter revenue. Orders grew well over 50% in the quarter and exceeded 50% growth over the past year.  Manufacturing capacity continued to expand to meet pent-up demand, and the EV and AV technology investment accelerated. This happened particularly in Europe and China, where EV market share of total car sales in 2021 increased to 19% and 15%, respectively. Demand remains strong from leading manufacturers for both EV and AV production test solutions, power semiconductors, automotive electronics and RF and millimeter wave wireless test.  Keysight continues to engage with global industry leaders such as BMW, Sony Semiconductor Solutions and Proventia to enable next-generation technologies across the automotive R&D and production workflows. Strong demand for our semiconductor solutions drove double-digit order and revenue growth and resulted in record orders and record first quarter revenue. Investments remain high in advanced semiconductor technologies and capacity expansion to serve a broad set of applications, including silicon-rich smartphones, high-performance computing, IoT and autos.  In general electronics, we achieved record orders with double-digit growth across all regions driven by investment in manufacturing and device development for consumer and industrial IoT, digital health, connectivity and remote monitoring.  Turning to the Communications Solutions Group. We delivered record first quarter orders and revenue with double-digit order growth across all regions. Commercial communications orders achieved the second-highest quarter on record with double-digit order and revenue growth in the Americas and Europe.  We see continued strength in 400G and 800G Ethernet solutions for enterprise and service provider customers as well as increasing demand for terabit communication solutions. Driven by the ongoing investment in data center and cloud applications, orders for Keysight's differentiated, high-performance, real-time oscilloscopes grew triple digits this quarter. Keysight's leadership in 5G Release 16 applications, broad test case coverage and our strategic role in O-RAN are enabling our expansion across the broad communications ecosystem.  Our 5G customer base is growing as deployments begin to scale, and we are enabling disruptive technologies with key industry players, such as Qualcomm to demonstrate 3.5-gigabit uplink data throughput, Chunghwa Telecom in Taiwan to accelerate verification of O-RAN connectivity, KT Corporation in South Korea to verify advanced 5G new radio features and LG Electronics to demonstrate 6G radio frequencies. Investments remain strong in 5G wireless R&D and manufacturing as well as networking as market expansion transitions to devices, network equipment and the aerospace, defense vertical.  In aerospace, defense and government, double-digit order growth was driven by demand for signal monitoring, cyber, space and satellite as well as 5G and 6G applications. Demand was particularly strong in Asia Pacific and Europe. As design, test and measurement solutions grow in complexity, software and services are an increasingly more important differentiator for Keysight. Combined, they represented more than 1/3 of total revenue this quarter, increasing recurring revenue and contributing to the resiliency and predictability of our business.  In summary, demand remains strong for Keysight's software-centric portfolio of differentiated solutions across all of our end markets and regions. Since the pandemic began in 2020, Keysight has been focused on supporting our customers and delivering on our commitments. We have implemented new sourcing strategies and increased partner engagement to improve supply chain flexibility, diversification and resilience. While fully focused on our near-term priorities, we continue to work towards a long-term sustainable vision for the company and for the communities in which we operate.  The Keysight leadership model drives us to deliver business value through ethical, environmentally sustainable and socially responsible operations. Corporate social responsibility is an enabling value of the KLM, and we are proud to have been included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the third year in a row.  Keysight's inclusion exemplifies the company's continued commitment to building a better planet. This includes ambitious targets that support several UN Sustainable Development Goals, such as our commitment to achieve net-zero emissions in our company operations by fiscal year 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement goal of 2050. As we accelerate innovation to connect and secure the world, we are better positioned than ever to deliver value to our customers, shareholders and employees.  Now I will turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail.\nNeil Dougherty: Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. Q1 was a great start to fiscal 2022, and our full year outlook exemplifies Keysight's ability to deliver on our commitments.  In the first quarter of 2022, we delivered revenue of $1.250 billion, which was above the high end of our guidance range and grew 6% or 7% on a core basis. As expected, supply chain constraints continue to temper revenue results. We delivered a record $1.495 billion in orders, up 22% or 23% on a core basis. We ended the quarter with over $2.3 billion in backlog.  Turning to our operational results for Q1. We reported gross margin of 66% and operating expenses of $473 million, resulting in an operating margin of 28%. We achieved net income of $305 million and delivered $1.65 in earnings per share, which was above the high end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 184 million shares.  Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated record revenue of $878 million, up 3% on both the reported and core basis. CSG delivered record gross margin of 67% and operating margin of 27%. In Q1, commercial communications generated revenue of $584 million, up 5%, with double-digit revenue growth in the Americas and Europe driven by continued investments in 5G, O-RAN adoption, 400-gigabit, 800-gigabit and terabit R&D and wireline applications. Aerospace, defense and government revenue of $294 million was flat versus a strong prior year compare.  Solid growth in Asia Pacific was offset by supply chain constraints that impacted revenue in the Americas and Europe. This was our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit order growth in aerospace, defense and government, and the funnel remains strong for this end market.  The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated first quarter revenue of $372 million, up 13% or 15% on a core basis, driven by strong revenue growth in semiconductor and automotive. EISG reported gross margin of 63% and operating margin of 31%.  Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our first quarter with $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generated cash flow from operations of $224 million and free cash flow of $182 million or 15% of revenue. Under the new share repurchase authorization announced in November of last year, we have acquired 1.13 million shares in the quarter at an average price of $182.19 for a total consideration of $206 million.  Now turning to our outlook and guidance. Demand remains strong for Keysight Solutions. However, supply constraints continue to moderate shipments. We expect second quarter 2022 revenue to be in the range of $1.290 billion to $1.310 billion and Q2 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.63 to $1.69 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 183 million shares. Assuming a loosening of the supply situation in the second half, we continue to expect full year revenue growth to be in the range of 6% to 7% while delivering 12% earnings growth. The raised EPS growth expectation reflects ours higher-than-expected Q1 earnings.  In closing, the demand environment remains strong across our end markets and regions. With a record backlog position and a strong track record of operational excellence, we are confident in our ability to meet our customer commitments and continue to deliver profitable above-market growth going forward.  With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.\nJason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Elliott, will you please go ahead and give the instructions for the Q&A?\nOperator: . And the first question comes from the line of Tim Long from Barclays.\nTimothy Long: I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the 5G end market maybe as it cuts across your business. Could you talk about kind of the revenue order momentum there and maybe touch on some of the newer areas? I think you mentioned O-RAN, but could you talk O-RAN private networks millimeter waves, some of the newer areas that are contributing to growth there?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Tim, this is Satish. We have another strong quarter in our commercial communications business driven by 5G and all the wireline evolutions. Specific to 5G, I think as I've stated before, we see near-term and medium-term catalysts that remain intact. If you look at it more near term, I would say, the ongoing global deployments that are scaling continue to drive demand in both R&D and manufacturing offerings. Specific to R&D, the Release 16 is really aimed at some of these new use cases with industrial applications and private networks in particular. Longer term, we remain bullish about millimeter wave and its adoption. But in the medium term, the applications such as O-RAN are really growing the ecosystem of opportunities for us. in We just added over 100 new customers into our 5G platform in the most recent quarter. So very strong growth in the 5G applications for sure across both R&D and manufacturing and deployments and across the globe. So broad strength.\nTimothy Long: Okay. I'm sorry, if I could just follow up. It sounds like you've already had a few 6G announcements. Can you talk a little bit about kind of the cadence of when you think that rollout start to impact this business? Is this still a few years out? Or are you starting to see some real traction with some of the larger players in the industry?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. We're still -- if you look at it from a standards perspective, we're still in Release 16. Release 17 is just getting started, and you've got Release 18 being planned. So there's still considerable time to go with 5G evolution. That will continue for quite some time. But the industry is also looking at what's the next wave of innovations, 6G on the wireless side. On the wireline side, terabit Ethernet is definitely an area where there's a lot of advanced research happening both on the wireless and wireline side. And Keysight, given our strong strategy of focus on building out the workflow for the communication cycle system, we're engaged in those advanced research discussions with multiple consortiums around the globe. And we've already started to get some early research business, which positions us for continued leadership over time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan.\nSamik Chatterjee: I guess I'm just trying to get some help in understanding the divergence here between the order growth and the revenue outlook. This is, I think, the fourth quarter where you've expanded orders by more than 20% year-on-year. And when we look at the revenue outlook, obviously, that's materially below that. How should we think about it? Sort of is there more of unwind into the revenue or some realization of revenue or supply chain eases? Or is that -- is the order strength driven by a lot of early ordering or sort of long-dated orders?  And in particular, if I can just ask one follow-up there. If -- how are we thinking about the same divergence between ADG and UC remaining flat for the last couple of quarters versus what you talked about in terms of strong order increase?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. So this is Neil. So I think, first of all, I would say that the order growth, we believe, is indicative of the highly -- or the very strong demand environment we're seeing across the wide range of end markets, right? Within EISG, the semi auto market is very strong. The surge in manufacturing driving strength in general electronics. In the communications side, we're seeing great strength in 5G, as Satish just talked about, but also 400 gigabit, 800 gigabit on the networking side as well. And so very strong demand, and I think that's reflected in the order strength and in the growth you're seeing in orders. On the revenue side, obviously, we continue to work through significant supply chain challenges. Our revenue is significantly constrained by the supply environment, and we're working through that. We have said on prior calls that we have seen lead times to our customers extend by about a month, and that month extension has really happened over the course of the last 2 years, really from the onset of COVID back in the spring of 2020. And I think the good news is that our customers have responded to that and are placing orders with Keysight a bit earlier so that they can still get product delivery on a time line that meets their needs. And I think we're doing a good job getting product into the hands of our customers on those time lines. I think if you turn the lens forward, what you're going to see as the supply chain situation starts to improve, and we hope to see that beginning in the second half. But certainly, we expect to see some supply chain constraints through 2023, that our lead times will slowly start to migrate back in over a number of quarters. And similarly, our customers will once again readjust their ordering patterns to, again, align them with their own need for delivery. Why don't I turn it back to Mark for some more comments on the demand side.\nMark Wallace: Yes. Thanks, Neil. I think you covered it well. I just would add that -- reiterating the demand remains strong. It was very strong in Q1, very broad. We saw some earlier orders placed in distribution as an example, where the channel inventories are low because of the demand that we've seen there. So that's to be expected. We also saw some early orders from semiconductor, which is typical. They have longer-term horizons, and we work with them in that fashion. But the headline is our strong double-digit order growth. It was not an outcome of advanced purchases. And on the plus side, as Neil mentioned, we are now working with customers much earlier than we may have done in the past. We've always had deep relationships. But the outcome is we're getting better visibility to their forecast and their forward-looking plans, which I think will sustain for the long term.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley.\nMeta Marshall: Maybe following up on Samik's question. Just in terms of supply chain, would you say that conditions largely stayed the same in fiscal Q1 over fiscal Q4? Or was there any kind of material tightening that you saw kind of in any of the categories? Just trying to get a sense of whether it remains constrained or whether you started to see some improvement or worsening. And then maybe second question. Obviously, we've seen some valuation rerating on the software side of stocks. And so just wondering if anything becomes more attractive from an M&A environment just as some of these valuations reset.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. So this is Neil again. So first of all, with regard to the supply chain situation, I think it's safe to say that we didn't see things materially get better within the quarter. I don't think they got worse. I would call it largely the same. I think we continue to look forward to some relaxation in the second half, and that's still our expectation. But we did not see any acceleration or early signs that that's happening. It's still our expectation, but largely unchanged within the quarter on the supply chain side.\nRonald Nersesian: And Meta, this is Ron. With regard to software valuations, obviously, you're exactly correct. The IPE software companies, we've seen the valuations come down. But realistically, when we talk to companies and they've seen -- when they see a pullback, they still view their old share price as the price that the company should get a premium to. It normally takes about a year. It depends company by company before they would go ahead and sell at a lesser value. But we're highly engaged at looking at opportunities, looking at things that make sense. And we have a very active funnel right now, including software.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs.\nMark Delaney: I was hoping you could comment a little bit more on the P&L outlook for next quarter. Revenue guidance is up sequentially. EPS is relatively flattish quarter-on-quarter. So maybe you can bridge us from some higher revenue. And what's leading to the more flat quarter-on-quarter EPS?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. So I'll take that one as well. So as we look forward into the second quarter, we do see, as you look at scheduled shipments, some unfavorable mix on a sequential basis as well as kind of continuing impact from other inflationary elements, most notably expediting fees and other things are continuing to impact gross margins. And I think the other thing is we are continuing to ramp kind of back into our targeted levels of R&D. We were actually sub-15% in Q4, approaching 16% here in Q1 as we look to kind of mid-16% of revenue is more the level. So I'd expect some further increase in that rate of investment in the R&D side of things as well, which is what's leading to the more or less flattish EPS.\nMark Delaney: That's helpful. And for my follow-up question was on the comms segment. The company is focused and done a very good job broadening out the exposure into various ways, right, in terms of the type of tests you're doing but also the various parts of the industry. And 400 and 800, you guys have been going for some time. So maybe you can level set us on how big 400 and 800G is and how much data center is contributing to that comms segment at this point.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I'll take this. I think you're right. I mean our strategy to really connect the workflow across the communications ecosystem continues to play out, and our execution remains very strong. At the heart of it, we've been focused on connecting the workflow between the wireless and the wireline parts of the ecosystem. And we see that all of the data that comes through the networks through 5G, as an example, have to ultimately flow into a data center or cloud. And so as we follow that trial end-to-end, we see significant upgrades happening across the entire communications design flow. And we're participating in a number of those technology trends associated with not only the speed because you referenced with 400, 800 and terabit but also the underlying infrastructure that's changing with the memories, the server technologies and the edge compute as well. And we're also very pleased with the number of new chipset starts, the design starts that are occurring across the entire industry today. And all of this is contributing to strength, and we saw that reflected in our commercial communications business, where we maintain a good balance between the 5G growth and also the wireline evolutions growth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citigroup.\nJames Suva: Congratulations. I just have one question. There's been a lot of news about new building of semiconductor equipment factories and a lot more of like automobiles being more electronics. Given the large long supply chain, I'm just kind of curious, are those big orders already coming into your company? Or since they have to pour concrete and walls, would those be much more long-dated and not even in your orders at this point? Because it seems like those are long-term multiyear products -- projects that will actually extend much more beyond the typical horizon where people may think that we're kind of at the peak of orders right now, which I potentially could disagree with.\nMark Wallace: Yes. Jim, this is Mark. I'll take that. And you're exactly right. The strength that we're seeing today and have been seeing for the last many quarters is around new process technology development and mature technology scaling. But what you're referring to is the global expansion of new fabs in North America, in the United States, in parts of Asia and across Europe. These are multiyear, multibillion-dollar investments that the semiconductor leaders are making, and the vast majority of those investments are well in front of us.\nNeil Dougherty: I'd just remind -- and then I'd just remind everybody of our order acceptance policy. We generally don't put an order on the books unless it's shippable within a 6-month period of time. And so those orders for those longer things -- well, in some cases, those customers are giving us visibility to their needs for these future factories and fabs that are going into place. They are not reflected in orders as of today.\nMark Wallace: Yes. I'll just follow up just to emphasize that. We are talking to all of the semiconductor players and we are working through the planning and preparation for the future. But as Neil said, what we booked today is really based on demand that we can see going out 6 months.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder from UBS.\nChristopher Snyder: I guess my first question is kind of bigger picture. Clearly, the industry is in the middle of a very strong period of demand. The orders were up against sequentially here, the slight negative seasonality. So I guess my question is kind of what pushes the industry back down towards that normalized 3% to 5% growth that Keysight has called out in the past? And is it fair to think that the industry kind of collectively can achieve outsized growth until 5G peaks?\nMark Wallace: So Chris, this is Mark. I'll take a stab at that. I think the success that we've achieved and the level of order growth is tied into a lot about what Satish has been talking about, which is connecting our customers' workflows, even goes back to the previous question as it pertains to the growth in semiconductor being fed into demands from multiple different industries all bringing more electronic content together. So that has this compounding effect. I certainly think that as we get to the maturity with some of these technologies, the capacities will meet certain levels so we can see some of that begin to -- the growth begin to turn more to more long-term models that we've been seeing. But as we do so, we look forward to the next generation. And as also we mentioned earlier, the early research that's occurring around 6G and the participation that we have given our leadership position in the market gives us opportunities to continue to drive this high secular growth that we've been delivering for several quarters.\nRonald Nersesian: And the -- Chris, the 3% to 5% that you're talking about that's for the market, we have clearly done a pretty good job of growing faster than the market quarter after quarter, and we intend to do so going forward. But look at the convergence in semiconductors and how more and more functions are being integrated into semiconductors and everything, whether you're talking about IoT or any of these other apps that we talk about, that demand we're going to see for a long period of time. Look at automotive. We're not talking about things that will grow for a year or 2. Even though we talk about 19% and 15% of the total market being effectively EV in Europe and Asia, I mean, that's going to go up close to 100%. And then we have the Americas, too, which is behind. 5G has a ton of runway. And then following that, where we're starting to see early investments in talking is 6G that will follow it. On top of that, you put quantum. So the use of high-performance electronics is not rolling over, and we don't see that at all in any short- or medium-term situation. And whatever the market growth rate, Keysight's aspirations, goals and results have always been to outgrow the market.\nChristopher Snyder: Yes. No, I appreciate that. It just feels like so many of the drivers here are secular. That's what I was trying to kind of figure out what pushes this back down to mid-single-digit growth. And you kind of touched on my follow-up. The company has significantly outgrew the market and taken a lot of share ever really since you spun out, but it feels like it's kind of accelerated here. Is there anything that could cause that to compress?\nRonald Nersesian: If we were at 65%, 70% share, you could say, \"Oh, will it start to flatten out?\" We're at roughly 25% market share in total. We have so much headroom. I mean the market is 4x the size of Keysight, and we're gaining share. We're investing as much as that's needed. We're investing more than anyone else in the industry. We're investing earlier in the cycles for new developments, and we have the credibility with these players to be the chosen partner. And now that we've expanded beyond hardware to hardware to software and services, we provide complete solutions which makes our customers' lives easier. And we help them accelerate their innovation time line. So I'm very bullish on this, and I know the whole team is also.\nChristopher Snyder: If I just -- really quickly on that last point, has the -- the industry has accelerated towards software. Do you think that has been a driver of maybe accelerate share gains for Keysight just given your capacity to invest in whether it's organic or M&A relative to a lot of your smaller competitors?\nRonald Nersesian: No. I think there is opportunity for us to grow software, and we are. And we've seen that since we launched the company more than double that business, and there's a lot more headroom there. But we see it in a lot of the technologies that are also down in the physical layer where you need both. You need the ability to acquire the signal in a very high-fidelity way at very, very high performance when we're talking millimeter wave and up to terabit, plus you need the analysis capability that's in firmware and then software. And these are complex problems. You need service and support from people that are qualified to put this all together. And Keysight has all of that. And that's been a real, real advantage for us, and we continue to see that as we continue to expand our investments and our programs in each of these areas.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Niknam from Deutsche Bank.\nMatthew Niknam: Just two, if I could. First, on the U.S. Maybe if you can talk about what drove the sequential downtick in U.S. -- or Americas revenue this quarter. I think you'd called out the softness in aerospace, defense. Just curious if that was more tied to supply chain or demand-related. And then we think CSG, gross margins are actually improved about 120 bps sequentially, even though revenues actually were down sequentially. And I think last quarter, you had messaged some initial expectations that there would be more of a negative mix shift in this fiscal quarter. So I'm just wondering maybe what drove some of the outperformance there.\nRonald Nersesian: Yes. Thanks, Matt. I think if you really want to figure out what's going on in the marketplace, orders is the best indicator. And I know some companies don't report orders with as much detail, but we want to give you as much insight as we can. So if you look at the revenue numbers. Sales may not be commensurate with what's going on in the market. In the Americas, for instance, we were up 23%. Now if per chance, because we're not shipping everything and we're building backlog, which is an incredible position at almost $2.4 billion, that just means we're going to produce a lot more profit later when we clear that out. But the market performance is very strong. And as we continue to improve the supply chain, you'll see the revenue get a chance to work that backlog out over time.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes, with regards to the gross margin, you're right, we had a higher software mix this quarter as we continue to progress our strategy of software-centric solutions. And from the aerospace and defense perspective, while the defense budget has been cut in the Americas -- in the U.S., we are waiting on the consortiums through the appropriations process that's currently underway, which is expected to occur somewhere between March and April time frame. That should allow for increased program spend for rest of the year and the following year. But if you look at just the aerospace and defense order growth, to the point that Ron made, continues to grow strongly and our multiyear programs remain intact.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer from Thompson, Davis.\nAdam Thalhimer: Congrats on another strong quarter. First question, I wanted to ask about just at a high level, what kind of inflation are you seeing? And then how is the pricing environment? How does the -- how does that paradigm work for Keysight?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. So sorry, turn on my microphone, it would help. We are seeing inflation across a number of different areas within the supply chain -- or within the cost structure. I think as we noted last quarter, certainly, labor is one of those. We had our largest salary increase cycle in the fall in our 7-year history as an independent company. Certainly, in certain aspects of the supply chain, we are seeing various levels of price increases. Freight and logistics, clearly an area where we're seeing costs go up. Even those companies that maybe aren't raising prices as aggressively are sometimes paying or charging for expedited shipments or to get your spot in line. And so we're seeing it in a number of different places. And I think as far as our own pricing, I think we're constantly trying to balance our competitive situation with what we're seeing on the cost side and working to maintain margins as much as possible. And I think we've done a good job of doing that so far and would expect to going forward.\nRonald Nersesian: When we -- if you take a look at this when we launched the company, we were at roughly 56% gross margin, and now we're talking 66% from software, from our hardware differentiation, from leadership positions in 5G, which gives us the opportunity to do a little bit of value pricing. And we're going to continue to work to drive that higher.\nAdam Thalhimer: And then, Ron, just real quickly, you mentioned that orders came in above expectations. Can you give a little color as to what was stronger?\nMark Wallace: Yes. Adam, this is Mark. The strengths, as we said before, are really broad-based. All regions were double-digit order growth. 2 of the 4 regions -- or 2 of the 3 regions were record high. We saw double-digit order growth across all of the end segments as well. We added just over 500 new customers to Keysight during the quarter. We've done that every quarter, adding hundreds of new customers across all the different end markets around all the geographies. That's really important to us. That helps us diversify our business and grow our base, and our business to the base is up very strong double digits as well.  So we are really working hard, as I mentioned before, to align our plans with our market-leading customers where we've done very well. And we're also adding new customers and growing the long tail of small- and medium-sized businesses as well. So very, very broad strengths around all the regions and all the end segments.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Ridley-Lane from Bank of America.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: As supply chain issues ease, how much of a margin benefit could there be? I imagine in addition to the higher freight costs and so on you're carrying now, there's also some manufacturing inefficiencies just related to the component shortages.\nNeil Dougherty: It's not obvious to me that there's going to be a margin benefit other than volume that comes from a relaxation of the supply chain environment. I think our factories are continuing to run pretty efficiently. I think we'll need to take a wait-and-see approach, but it's not obvious to me that it's going to be a big margin benefit other than the benefits of volume.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Got it. And are there any data points you can give us around sort of the internal initiatives you've got, new sourcing partners, other things that you're doing to remove some of the supply chain bottlenecks? And just to check, it doesn't sound like Omicron had much of an impact to you incrementally in the quarter?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. So no incremental impact. Obviously, the constraints in the supply chain are broad, and I think you're hearing this across multiple industries as well, and we feel that. But with regard to the actions that we're taking to maximize, those include internal value engineering activities to find multiple sources for products, looking for alternate sourcing from the open markets. We have strong collaborations with a number of our strategic silicon or semiconductor suppliers and our customers, too. So when we look at the end-markets demand for Keysight products around 5G, automotive and semiconductor, we have strong engagements with customers and our supply chain so that we're able to coordinate this. And at this point, as Neil mentioned earlier, that we're able to meet our customers' needs a very high percentage of the time. So we're very confident on our ability to process this backlog and convert it into revenue in future quarters. And pending upside from any improvement in the supply chain, we could further accelerate.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Rob Mason from Baird.\nRobert Mason: I just wanted to ask about the automotive market. A number of comments around how strong that has been for you and the long runway that exists there. Question is, how do you view that market's growth rate over the next few years? And then since it is that the EV and ADAS elements of that market are newer for test and measurement -- high-end test and measurement, I'm curious how you think about your mix evolving into that market between R&D and production test or manufacturing tests.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. So I'd say that when we look at the automotive market, as Ron referenced in his script that we see a real inflection in adoption of EV and then a subsequent simultaneous adoption for AV as well, really driving the needs of the automotive market. At a simplistic level, we see a number of new lab activities that are starting in R&D across the globe, where automotive customers traditionally outsourced a lot of the R&D work, but they are now starting to build new facilities for research and development, hiring of electrical engineering talent, hiring of software talent is increasing, and that's really reflected in our R&D business that continues to grow strongly. We see this continuing to be a secular growth driver for us. With regard to the manufacturing expansion, as you saw the number of EV starts to increase, our manufacturing business in this market also continues to grow. So at this point, I would say the opportunities for us -- for Keysight is to expand with a number of new lab starts as the hiring of electrical engineers growth in the automotive market will continue to grow.  But we also have the opportunity to increase our solutions content in display. And some of the acquisitions that we have made enables us to play strongly into the battery test and charging arena. And so we're positioning ourselves there, along with the C-V2X stack that we've invested in with our 5G portfolio that allows us to get into this marketplace. In the most recent quarter, we've basically announced at CES the radar scene emulator solution, which again, got a lot of active interest from our customers. So automotive continues to be the area of investment for us. And it's really hard to predict the growth rate, but we're quite pleased with the very strong results we're seeing so far. I'll just hand it off to Mark to make some comments on the funnel.\nMark Wallace: Yes. I was going to mention the radar scene emulator. You got that Satish. The funnel is very strong. It's growing. We're seeing a lot of customers look out to Keysight for both EV and AV expertise. You think about all of the changes that are occurring within the customer base as well as the new entrants coming in, dealing with millimeter wave, dealing with high-power semiconductors, charging infrastructure, all of this stuff that we are providing leading solutions to. So that funnel is growing substantially. The other indicator that I think is very positive is the adoption of our services, which again is another indicator that customers are looking for help in innovating and getting these tough jobs done. So we're attaching a lot more services to our solutions, especially in the EV and the AV space.\nOperator: That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to turn the conference back to Jason Kary for any closing comments.\nJason Kary: Thanks, Elliott. Now I'll turn it over to Ron to wrap this up for today. Thank you for joining.\nRonald Nersesian: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As you can probably tell, we are very pleased with what our team has done to produce consistently excellent results. But I would also love to add that we are very optimistic for Keysight not only in the short term but with the position that we are in for long-term shareholder value creation. Thank you very much, and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes our conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Neil. I think you covered it well. I just would add that -- reiterating the demand remains strong. It was very strong in Q1, very broad. We saw some earlier orders placed in distribution as an example, where the channel inventories are low because of the demand that we've seen there. So that's to be expected. We also saw some early orders from semiconductor, which is typical. They have longer-term horizons, and we work with them in that fashion. But the headline is our strong double-digit order growth. It was not an outcome of advanced purchases. And on the plus side, as Neil mentioned, we are now working with customers much earlier than we may have done in the past. We've always had deep relationships. But the outcome is we're getting better visibility to their forecast and their forward-looking plans, which I think will sustain for the long term. Yes. Jim, this is Mark. I'll take that. And you're exactly right. The strength that we're seeing today and have been seeing for the last many quarters is around new process technology development and mature technology scaling. But what you're referring to is the global expansion of new fabs in North America, in the United States, in parts of Asia and across Europe. These are multiyear, multibillion-dollar investments that the semiconductor leaders are making, and the vast majority of those investments are well in front of us. Yes. I'll just follow up just to emphasize that. We are talking to all of the semiconductor players and we are working through the planning and preparation for the future. But as Neil said, what we booked today is really based on demand that we can see going out 6 months. So Chris, this is Mark. I'll take a stab at that. I think the success that we've achieved and the level of order growth is tied into a lot about what Satish has been talking about, which is connecting our customers' workflows, even goes back to the previous question as it pertains to the growth in semiconductor being fed into demands from multiple different industries all bringing more electronic content together. So that has this compounding effect. I certainly think that as we get to the maturity with some of these technologies, the capacities will meet certain levels so we can see some of that begin to -- the growth begin to turn more to more long-term models that we've been seeing. But as we do so, we look forward to the next generation. And as also we mentioned earlier, the early research that's occurring around 6G and the participation that we have given our leadership position in the market gives us opportunities to continue to drive this high secular growth that we've been delivering for several quarters. Yes. Adam, this is Mark. The strengths, as we said before, are really broad-based. All regions were double-digit order growth. 2 of the 4 regions -- or 2 of the 3 regions were record high. We saw double-digit order growth across all of the end segments as well. We added just over 500 new customers to Keysight during the quarter. We've done that every quarter, adding hundreds of new customers across all the different end markets around all the geographies. That's really important to us. That helps us diversify our business and grow our base, and our business to the base is up very strong double digits as well.  So we are really working hard, as I mentioned before, to align our plans with our market-leading customers where we've done very well. And we're also adding new customers and growing the long tail of small- and medium-sized businesses as well. So very, very broad strengths around all the regions and all the end segments. Yes. I was going to mention the radar scene emulator. You got that Satish. The funnel is very strong. It's growing. We're seeing a lot of customers look out to Keysight for both EV and AV expertise. You think about all of the changes that are occurring within the customer base as well as the new entrants coming in, dealing with millimeter wave, dealing with high-power semiconductors, charging infrastructure, all of this stuff that we are providing leading solutions to. So that funnel is growing substantially.

            "name": "Satish Dhanasekaran",
            "content": "Yes. Tim, this is Satish. We have another strong quarter in our commercial communications business driven by 5G and all the wireline evolutions. Specific to 5G, I think as I've stated before, we see near-term and medium-term catalysts that remain intact. If you look at it more near term, I would say, the ongoing global deployments that are scaling continue to drive demand in both R&D and manufacturing offerings. Specific to R&D, the Release 16 is really aimed at some of these new use cases with industrial applications and private networks in particular. Longer term, we remain bullish about millimeter wave and its adoption. But in the medium term, the applications such as O-RAN are really growing the ecosystem of opportunities for us. in We just added over 100 new customers into our 5G platform in the most recent quarter. So very strong growth in the 5G applications for sure across both R&D and manufacturing and deployments and across the globe. So broad strength. Yes. We're still -- if you look at it from a standards perspective, we're still in Release 16. Release 17 is just getting started, and you've got Release 18 being planned. So there's still considerable time to go with 5G evolution. That will continue for quite some time. But the industry is also looking at what's the next wave of innovations, 6G on the wireless side. On the wireline side, terabit Ethernet is definitely an area where there's a lot of advanced research happening both on the wireless and wireline side. And Keysight, given our strong strategy of focus on building out the workflow for the communication cycle system, we're engaged in those advanced research discussions with multiple consortiums around the globe. And we've already started to get some early research business, which positions us for continued leadership over time. Yes. I'll take this. I think you're right. I mean our strategy to really connect the workflow across the communications ecosystem continues to play out, and our execution remains very strong. At the heart of it, we've been focused on connecting the workflow between the wireless and the wireline parts of the ecosystem. And we see that all of the data that comes through the networks through 5G, as an example, have to ultimately flow into a data center or cloud. And so as we follow that trial end-to-end, we see significant upgrades happening across the entire communications design flow. And we're participating in a number of those technology trends associated with not only the speed because you referenced with 400, 800 and terabit but also the underlying infrastructure that's changing with the memories, the server technologies and the edge compute as well. And we're also very pleased with the number of new chipset starts, the design starts that are occurring across the entire industry today. And all of this is contributing to strength, and we saw that reflected in our commercial communications business, where we maintain a good balance between the 5G growth and also the wireline evolutions growth. Yes, with regards to the gross margin, you're right, we had a higher software mix this quarter as we continue to progress our strategy of software-centric solutions. And from the aerospace and defense perspective, while the defense budget has been cut in the Americas -- in the U.S., we are waiting on the consortiums through the appropriations process that's currently underway, which is expected to occur somewhere between March and April time frame. That should allow for increased program spend for rest of the year and the following year. But if you look at just the aerospace and defense order growth, to the point that Ron made, continues to grow strongly and our multiyear programs remain intact. Yes. So no incremental impact. Obviously, the constraints in the supply chain are broad, and I think you're hearing this across multiple industries as well, and we feel that. But with regard to the actions that we're taking to maximize, those include internal value engineering activities to find multiple sources for products, looking for alternate sourcing from the open markets. We have strong collaborations with a number of our strategic silicon or semiconductor suppliers and our customers, too. So when we look at the end-markets demand for Keysight products around 5G, automotive and semiconductor, we have strong engagements with customers and our supply chain so that we're able to coordinate this. And at this point, as Neil mentioned earlier, that we're able to meet our customers' needs a very high percentage of the time. So we're very confident on our ability to process this backlog and convert it into revenue in future quarters. And pending upside from any improvement in the supply chain, we could further accelerate. Yes. So I'd say that when we look at the automotive market, as Ron referenced in his script that we see a real inflection in adoption of EV and then a subsequent simultaneous adoption for AV as well, really driving the needs of the automotive market.

            "name": "Ronald Nersesian",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. Keysight delivered a strong start to the year. First quarter results are evidence that our broad-based portfolio of differentiated solutions is aligned with the market's most important design and test challenges. We are enabling our customers to address rapidly evolving technologies and market opportunities.  Today, I'll focus my comments on 3 key headlines. First, we continue to see sustained robust demand with record orders again exceeding our expectations. Growth in the quarter was broad-based and balanced across our diverse set of end markets and across all regions. Orders grew 22% year-over-year and were 31% higher than the first quarter of 2020, just prior to the initial impact of the COVID pandemic.  Second, record first quarter revenue and earnings per share exceeded the high end of our guidance despite ongoing supply constraints. Our results and exceptional execution by the Keysight team continue to demonstrate the durability and resilience of our business.  And third, Keysight solutions are aligned with the long-term secular trends fueled by ongoing innovation across multiple markets. Our investments in growth initiatives and supply chain resiliency are paying off. We continue to expect to deliver 6% to 7% revenue growth for the year, and given the stronger-than-guided first quarter earnings, to achieve 12% earnings growth. We are confident in the strength of the company we built and our ability to drive above-market profitable growth over the long term.  Accordingly, with the recent equity market volatility, we capitalized on the opportunity to create value for shareholders by accelerating our share repurchases in the past 2 quarters.  Now let's take a deeper look into our first quarter results. We delivered another quarter of record orders, which grew 22% to $1.5 billion. This outpaced record first quarter revenue, which grew 6% to $1.25 billion. We achieved gross margin of 66%, operating margin of 28% and EPS of $1.65, all of which were first quarter records. Although supply constraints continue to moderate revenue, Keysight's consistent execution and focus on growth initiatives across the 5G ecosystem, automotive and software position us well to capitalize on a robust demand environment.  The Electronics Industrial Solutions Group delivered double-digit order and revenue growth for the sixth consecutive quarter. Record orders were driven by strong demand for automotive and semiconductor solutions as well as broad general electronic applications. Our differentiated solutions position us well to win in the fast-expanding automotive market, where we achieved all-time record orders and record first quarter revenue. Orders grew well over 50% in the quarter and exceeded 50% growth over the past year.  Manufacturing capacity continued to expand to meet pent-up demand, and the EV and AV technology investment accelerated. This happened particularly in Europe and China, where EV market share of total car sales in 2021 increased to 19% and 15%, respectively. Demand remains strong from leading manufacturers for both EV and AV production test solutions, power semiconductors, automotive electronics and RF and millimeter wave wireless test.  Keysight continues to engage with global industry leaders such as BMW, Sony Semiconductor Solutions and Proventia to enable next-generation technologies across the automotive R&D and production workflows. Strong demand for our semiconductor solutions drove double-digit order and revenue growth and resulted in record orders and record first quarter revenue. Investments remain high in advanced semiconductor technologies and capacity expansion to serve a broad set of applications, including silicon-rich smartphones, high-performance computing, IoT and autos.  In general electronics, we achieved record orders with double-digit growth across all regions driven by investment in manufacturing and device development for consumer and industrial IoT, digital health, connectivity and remote monitoring.  Turning to the Communications Solutions Group. We delivered record first quarter orders and revenue with double-digit order growth across all regions. Commercial communications orders achieved the second-highest quarter on record with double-digit order and revenue growth in the Americas and Europe.  We see continued strength in 400G and 800G Ethernet solutions for enterprise and service provider customers as well as increasing demand for terabit communication solutions. Driven by the ongoing investment in data center and cloud applications, orders for Keysight's differentiated, high-performance, real-time oscilloscopes grew triple digits this quarter. Keysight's leadership in 5G Release 16 applications, broad test case coverage and our strategic role in O-RAN are enabling our expansion across the broad communications ecosystem.  Our 5G customer base is growing as deployments begin to scale, and we are enabling disruptive technologies with key industry players, such as Qualcomm to demonstrate 3.5-gigabit uplink data throughput, Chunghwa Telecom in Taiwan to accelerate verification of O-RAN connectivity, KT Corporation in South Korea to verify advanced 5G new radio features and LG Electronics to demonstrate 6G radio frequencies. Investments remain strong in 5G wireless R&D and manufacturing as well as networking as market expansion transitions to devices, network equipment and the aerospace, defense vertical.  In aerospace, defense and government, double-digit order growth was driven by demand for signal monitoring, cyber, space and satellite as well as 5G and 6G applications. Demand was particularly strong in Asia Pacific and Europe. As design, test and measurement solutions grow in complexity, software and services are an increasingly more important differentiator for Keysight. Combined, they represented more than 1/3 of total revenue this quarter, increasing recurring revenue and contributing to the resiliency and predictability of our business.  In summary, demand remains strong for Keysight's software-centric portfolio of differentiated solutions across all of our end markets and regions. Since the pandemic began in 2020, Keysight has been focused on supporting our customers and delivering on our commitments. We have implemented new sourcing strategies and increased partner engagement to improve supply chain flexibility, diversification and resilience. While fully focused on our near-term priorities, we continue to work towards a long-term sustainable vision for the company and for the communities in which we operate.  The Keysight leadership model drives us to deliver business value through ethical, environmentally sustainable and socially responsible operations. Corporate social responsibility is an enabling value of the KLM, and we are proud to have been included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the third year in a row.  Keysight's inclusion exemplifies the company's continued commitment to building a better planet. This includes ambitious targets that support several UN Sustainable Development Goals, such as our commitment to achieve net-zero emissions in our company operations by fiscal year 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement goal of 2050. As we accelerate innovation to connect and secure the world, we are better positioned than ever to deliver value to our customers, shareholders and employees.  Now I will turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail. And Meta, this is Ron. With regard to software valuations, obviously, you're exactly correct. The IPE software companies, we've seen the valuations come down. But realistically, when we talk to companies and they've seen -- when they see a pullback, they still view their old share price as the price that the company should get a premium to. It normally takes about a year. It depends company by company before they would go ahead and sell at a lesser value. But we're highly engaged at looking at opportunities, looking at things that make sense. And we have a very active funnel right now, including software. And the -- Chris, the 3% to 5% that you're talking about that's for the market, we have clearly done a pretty good job of growing faster than the market quarter after quarter, and we intend to do so going forward. But look at the convergence in semiconductors and how more and more functions are being integrated into semiconductors and everything, whether you're talking about IoT or any of these other apps that we talk about, that demand we're going to see for a long period of time. Look at automotive. We're not talking about things that will grow for a year or 2. Even though we talk about 19% and 15% of the total market being effectively EV in Europe and Asia, I mean, that's going to go up close to 100%. And then we have the Americas, too, which is behind. 5G has a ton of runway. And then following that, where we're starting to see early investments in talking is 6G that will follow it. On top of that, you put quantum. So the use of high-performance electronics is not rolling over, and we don't see that at all in any short- or medium-term situation. And whatever the market growth rate, Keysight's aspirations, goals and results have always been to outgrow the market. If we were at 65%, 70% share, you could say, \"Oh, will it start to flatten out?\" We're at roughly 25% market share in total. We have so much headroom. I mean the market is 4x the size of Keysight, and we're gaining share. We're investing as much as that's needed. We're investing more than anyone else in the industry. We're investing earlier in the cycles for new developments, and we have the credibility with these players to be the chosen partner. And now that we've expanded beyond hardware to hardware to software and services, we provide complete solutions which makes our customers' lives easier. And we help them accelerate their innovation time line. So I'm very bullish on this, and I know the whole team is also. No. I think there is opportunity for us to grow software, and we are. And we've seen that since we launched the company more than double that business, and there's a lot more headroom there. But we see it in a lot of the technologies that are also down in the physical layer where you need both. You need the ability to acquire the signal in a very high-fidelity way at very, very high performance when we're talking millimeter wave and up to terabit, plus you need the analysis capability that's in firmware and then software. And these are complex problems. You need service and support from people that are qualified to put this all together. And Keysight has all of that. And that's been a real, real advantage for us, and we continue to see that as we continue to expand our investments and our programs in each of these areas. Yes. Thanks, Matt. I think if you really want to figure out what's going on in the marketplace, orders is the best indicator. And I know some companies don't report orders with as much detail, but we want to give you as much insight as we can. So if you look at the revenue numbers. Sales may not be commensurate with what's going on in the market. In the Americas, for instance, we were up 23%. Now if per chance, because we're not shipping everything and we're building backlog, which is an incredible position at almost $2.4 billion, that just means we're going to produce a lot more profit later when we clear that out. But the market performance is very strong. And as we continue to improve the supply chain, you'll see the revenue get a chance to work that backlog out over time. When we -- if you take a look at this when we launched the company, we were at roughly 56% gross margin, and now we're talking 66% from software, from our hardware differentiation, from leadership positions in 5G, which gives us the opportunity to do a little bit of value pricing. And we're going to continue to work to drive that higher. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As you can probably tell, we are very pleased with what our team has done to produce consistently excellent results. But I would also love to add that we are very optimistic for Keysight not only in the short term but with the position that we are in for long-term shareholder value creation. Thank you very much, and have a great day."

            "name": "Neil Dougherty",
            "content": "Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. Q1 was a great start to fiscal 2022, and our full year outlook exemplifies Keysight's ability to deliver on our commitments.  In the first quarter of 2022, we delivered revenue of $1.250 billion, which was above the high end of our guidance range and grew 6% or 7% on a core basis. As expected, supply chain constraints continue to temper revenue results. We delivered a record $1.495 billion in orders, up 22% or 23% on a core basis. We ended the quarter with over $2.3 billion in backlog.  Turning to our operational results for Q1. We reported gross margin of 66% and operating expenses of $473 million, resulting in an operating margin of 28%. We achieved net income of $305 million and delivered $1.65 in earnings per share, which was above the high end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 184 million shares.  Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated record revenue of $878 million, up 3% on both the reported and core basis. CSG delivered record gross margin of 67% and operating margin of 27%. In Q1, commercial communications generated revenue of $584 million, up 5%, with double-digit revenue growth in the Americas and Europe driven by continued investments in 5G, O-RAN adoption, 400-gigabit, 800-gigabit and terabit R&D and wireline applications. Aerospace, defense and government revenue of $294 million was flat versus a strong prior year compare.  Solid growth in Asia Pacific was offset by supply chain constraints that impacted revenue in the Americas and Europe. This was our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit order growth in aerospace, defense and government, and the funnel remains strong for this end market.  The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated first quarter revenue of $372 million, up 13% or 15% on a core basis, driven by strong revenue growth in semiconductor and automotive. EISG reported gross margin of 63% and operating margin of 31%.  Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our first quarter with $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generated cash flow from operations of $224 million and free cash flow of $182 million or 15% of revenue. Under the new share repurchase authorization announced in November of last year, we have acquired 1.13 million shares in the quarter at an average price of $182.19 for a total consideration of $206 million.  Now turning to our outlook and guidance. Demand remains strong for Keysight Solutions. However, supply constraints continue to moderate shipments. We expect second quarter 2022 revenue to be in the range of $1.290 billion to $1.310 billion and Q2 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.63 to $1.69 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 183 million shares. Assuming a loosening of the supply situation in the second half, we continue to expect full year revenue growth to be in the range of 6% to 7% while delivering 12% earnings growth. The raised EPS growth expectation reflects ours higher-than-expected Q1 earnings.  In closing, the demand environment remains strong across our end markets and regions. With a record backlog position and a strong track record of operational excellence, we are confident in our ability to meet our customer commitments and continue to deliver profitable above-market growth going forward.  With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A. Yes. So this is Neil. So I think, first of all, I would say that the order growth, we believe, is indicative of the highly -- or the very strong demand environment we're seeing across the wide range of end markets, right? Within EISG, the semi auto market is very strong. The surge in manufacturing driving strength in general electronics. In the communications side, we're seeing great strength in 5G, as Satish just talked about, but also 400 gigabit, 800 gigabit on the networking side as well. And so very strong demand, and I think that's reflected in the order strength and in the growth you're seeing in orders. On the revenue side, obviously, we continue to work through significant supply chain challenges. Our revenue is significantly constrained by the supply environment, and we're working through that. We have said on prior calls that we have seen lead times to our customers extend by about a month, and that month extension has really happened over the course of the last 2 years, really from the onset of COVID back in the spring of 2020. And I think the good news is that our customers have responded to that and are placing orders with Keysight a bit earlier so that they can still get product delivery on a time line that meets their needs. And I think we're doing a good job getting product into the hands of our customers on those time lines. I think if you turn the lens forward, what you're going to see as the supply chain situation starts to improve, and we hope to see that beginning in the second half. But certainly, we expect to see some supply chain constraints through 2023, that our lead times will slowly start to migrate back in over a number of quarters. And similarly, our customers will once again readjust their ordering patterns to, again, align them with their own need for delivery. Why don't I turn it back to Mark for some more comments on the demand side. Yes. So this is Neil again. So first of all, with regard to the supply chain situation, I think it's safe to say that we didn't see things materially get better within the quarter. I don't think they got worse. I would call it largely the same. I think we continue to look forward to some relaxation in the second half, and that's still our expectation. But we did not see any acceleration or early signs that that's happening. It's still our expectation, but largely unchanged within the quarter on the supply chain side. Yes. So I'll take that one as well. So as we look forward into the second quarter, we do see, as you look at scheduled shipments, some unfavorable mix on a sequential basis as well as kind of continuing impact from other inflationary elements, most notably expediting fees and other things are continuing to impact gross margins. And I think the other thing is we are continuing to ramp kind of back into our targeted levels of R&D. We were actually sub-15% in Q4, approaching 16% here in Q1 as we look to kind of mid-16% of revenue is more the level. So I'd expect some further increase in that rate of investment in the R&D side of things as well, which is what's leading to the more or less flattish EPS. I'd just remind -- and then I'd just remind everybody of our order acceptance policy. We generally don't put an order on the books unless it's shippable within a 6-month period of time. And so those orders for those longer things -- well, in some cases, those customers are giving us visibility to their needs for these future factories and fabs that are going into place. They are not reflected in orders as of today. Yes. So sorry, turn on my microphone, it would help. We are seeing inflation across a number of different areas within the supply chain -- or within the cost structure. I think as we noted last quarter, certainly, labor is one of those. We had our largest salary increase cycle in the fall in our 7-year history as an independent company. Certainly, in certain aspects of the supply chain, we are seeing various levels of price increases. Freight and logistics, clearly an area where we're seeing costs go up. Even those companies that maybe aren't raising prices as aggressively are sometimes paying or charging for expedited shipments or to get your spot in line. And so we're seeing it in a number of different places. And I think as far as our own pricing, I think we're constantly trying to balance our competitive situation with what we're seeing on the cost side and working to maintain margins as much as possible. And I think we've done a good job of doing that so far and would expect to going forward. It's not obvious to me that there's going to be a margin benefit other than volume that comes from a relaxation of the supply chain environment. I think our factories are continuing to run pretty efficiently. I think we'll need to take a wait-and-see approach, but it's not obvious to me that it's going to be a big margin benefit other than the benefits of volume."

My name is Sarah, and I'll be your lead operator today. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded today, Monday, November 20th, 2023 at 1:30 P.M. Pacific Time. I would now like to hand the call over to Jason Kary, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJason Kary: Thank you, and welcome everyone to Keysight's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Fiscal Year 2023. Joining me are Keysight's President and CEO, Satish Dhanasekaran; and our CFO, Neil Dougherty. In the Q&A session, we'll be joined by Chief Customer Officer, Mark Wallace. The press release and information that supplement today's discussion are on our website at investor.keysight.com under the financial information and quarterly reports. Today's comments will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. We will also make reference to core growth, which excludes the impact of currency movements and acquisitions or divestitures completed within the last 12 months. The most directly-comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations are on our website and all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. We will make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company on today's call. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. We assume no obligation to update them and encourage you to review our recent SEC filings for a more complete view of these risks and other factors. Lastly, management is scheduled to participate in upcoming investor conferences hosted by Wells Fargo and UBS. And now I will turn the call over to Satish.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. My comments today will focus on three key headlines. First, Keysight reported solid fourth quarter results and finished the year with record revenue, gross margins and operating margin, in what remains a challenging macro environment. Fourth quarter revenue and earnings per share exceeded the high end of our guidance, as orders came in slightly ahead of expectations. For the full year, revenue grew 2% on a core basis and earnings per share increased 9%, while we generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow. Second, our customer engagement on next-generation technology teams remain strong and we continue to action opportunities, across a broad and diverse set of end markets. Despite the mixed demand environment, as end markets normalize from post-COVID supply demand imbalances over the last two years. Third, we're investing both organically and inorganically, to expand our addressable markets and differentiated solutions portfolio, which took other step forward this quarter with the addition of ESI. We remain confident in the long-term secular growth drivers of our business and our ability to address our customers' most challenging and diverse innovation needs. Now let's begin with a brief overview of Keysight's fourth quarter and full year performance. We're pleased with our results and execution. Fourth quarter orders were $1.3 billion, and we delivered $1.3 billion in revenue and $1.99 in earnings per share. We also generated $340 million in free cash flow and repurchased $426 million of our shares this quarter. Full year results were strong in a year of normalizing demand. Orders of $5.2 billion were in line with our original expectations of approximately $1.3 billion per quarter this year. We delivered an all-time high of $5.5 billion in revenue and achieved record profitability with gross margins of 66% and operating margins of 30% and $8.33 in earnings per share. Moving to our markets. Overall, the demand dynamics within the quarter, were consistent with our expectations. Aerospace, Defense and Government demand increased, commercial communications was steady and as anticipated, broader manufacturing-related spending in the electronics industrial markets was incrementally softer. Turning to our business segments. Communications Solutions Group revenue declined 10%. Aerospace, Defense and Government grew, while Commercial Communication markets are rebalancing off of last year's record highs. On a sequential basis, orders grew across both markets. In Aerospace, Defense and Government, revenue grew 4% to an all-time high, we saw healthy order demand from the US and European primes, as well as direct government customers, driven by investments in Defense modernization, space and satellite applications. Keysight's Leading Threat Emulation solutions capabilities drove order growth in the US, including a large US Department of Defense win for electromagnetic spectrum operation applications. We also saw demand from European primes for our Radar and phased array antenna solutions to support their delivery goals in 2024 and beyond. The breadth and the depth of our solutions portfolio enable new customer engagements and business in satellite communications 5G and 6G and advanced quantum research, including a large order from a premier research institute contributing to the record quarter. In Commercial Communications, revenue declined 17%, reflecting ongoing customer spending constraints, as inventories in their markets normalize. Sequentially, we saw stability in wireless orders and incremental strength in demand for network and data center applications. Demand for our wireline solutions was driven by AI ML and data center expansion, as hyperscalers build infrastructure to handle increasing network and compute workloads. We expect this trend to continue into the next year and beyond. Enterprise customer business was stable with ongoing investments in network monitoring, driven by increasing data traffic and cybersecurity compliance needs. In Wireless, the progression of standards is driving steady R&D investments in new capabilities and devices, as well as Open RAN and Release 17 features. Our R&D engagements with customers continue to expand. This quarter, we enable MediaTek to validate non-terrestrial network connectivity. In addition, Keysight was awarded two key UK government grants in partnership with universities and leading telecom operators to support Open RAN design, testing and deployment in Europe. Turning to Electronic Industrial Solutions Group. As expected, Q4 orders and revenue were both down compared to record levels of last year. It is important to note that the EISG has shown significantly about long-term expectations with revenue increasing by 30% in 2021, 14% in 2022 and an additional 10% in 2023. This growth was driven by both our Differentiated Solutions portfolio and an outsized demand from post-COVID recovery and supply constraints. In the second half of this year, we began to see a normalization from these size as well as ongoing cautious customer spending. In semiconductor, capital spending for wafer capacity contracted in the quarter, as foundry customers pushed out their new fab investment time lines. We continue to see strong customer engagement for Keysight's proprietary interferometer systems and differentiated R&D solutions for silicon photonics and power semiconductors, reflecting the industry's medium to long-term recovery and growth expectations. In automotive, customer investment in R&D for battery and charging infrastructure continues and is being fueled by increasing competition, regional legislative deadlines and government funding, particularly in Europe and Asia. The funnel of EV opportunities remain strong, while the timing and size of these systems engagements are expected to vary from a quarter-to-quarter. In General Electronics, we saw steady demand for our solutions in advanced research, industrial automation and digital health. However, and more broadly, manufacturing capacity normalization and cautious spending continued to weigh in on consumer electronics and manufacturing portions of the market. We're watching Global PMI and other macroeconomic indicators to gauge the timing of the market recovery. As an integral part of our solution strategy, software and services revenue growth this year continue to outpace Keysight overall. The recurring portion of software and services grew 9% this year, driving total annual recurring revenue to approximately $1.3 billion or 23% of total revenue, an increase of 200 basis points, year-over-year. In early November, ahead of schedule, we announced our acquisition of a controlling block of shares of ESI Group. The addition of ESI, further increases our software and annual recurring revenue expands our addressable markets and strengthens our strategy of moving upstream into earlier stages of our customers' design cycles. We continue to invest prudently to capitalize on our long-term growth opportunities. In parallel, we remain disciplined and are taking additional targeted cost actions to streamline operations and ensure strong financial performance. In wrapping up my first full year, as the CEO of Keysight, I'd like to thank our employees for their outstanding contributions, commitment and strong track record of execution in these tough market conditions. The strength of Keysight's differentiated solutions, the diversity of our end markets and the durability of our business model, all position us well for continued market outperformance, as we enter the new fiscal year. With that, I'll turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook.\nNeil Dougherty: Thank you, Satish, and hello, everyone. Fourth quarter revenue of $1.311 billion was just above the high end of our guidance range and down 9% or 10%, on a core basis. Orders of $1.327 billion declined 16% on both a reported and core basis. Similar to the third quarter, demand in China was muted and accounted for roughly 1/3 of the year-over-year order decline. We ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in backlog. Looking at our operational results for Q4, we reported gross margin of 65%, an increase of 130 basis points, year-over-year and operating expenses of $474 million, resulting in operating margin of 29%. We achieved net income of $352 million and delivered earnings of $1.99 per share. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 177 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated revenue of $891 million, down 10% on a reported and core basis. Commercial Communications revenue of $568 million, declined 17%, while Aerospace, Defense and Government revenue of $323 million was up 4%, driven by increasing defense budgets and investments in technology modernization. Altogether, CSG delivered gross margin of 68% and operating margin of 29%. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated revenue of $420 million, down 7%, as reported or 8% on a core basis. EISG reported gross margin of 61% and operating margin of 30%. Turning to our full year financial performance. Keysight delivered strong results, despite demand and foreign exchange headwinds. Full year 2023 revenue grew 1% as reported or 2% on a core basis to a record $5.464 billion. Gross margin of 66% expanded 80 basis points. We invested $842 million in R&D, while operating margin improved 90 basis points to 30%. The flexibility of our cost structure and actions that we've taken to further reduce costs, drove FY'23 net income to a record $1.5 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $8.33, which was up 9%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the fourth quarter with $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generating cash flow from operations of $378 million and free cash flow of $340 million. Total free cash flow for the year was $1.212 billion, representing 22% of revenue and 81% of non-GAAP net income. Share repurchases this quarter totaled 3,270, 000 shares, at an average price per share of approximately $130. For a total consideration of $426 million. This brings our total share repurchases for the year to 4.9 million shares, at an average share price of approximately $143 for a total consideration of $702 million or 58% of free cash flow. Now turning to our outlook. Looking forward to fiscal year '24, we expect the demand environment in the first half to remain mixed, and we'll be closely watching for signs of recovery in the second half. Going forward, we will report results including ESI, which is expected to be slightly dilutive to earnings on the full year. Given the timing of annual contract renewals, ESI typically recognizes 40% to 45% of their full year revenue in Keysight's fiscal first quarter, with the balance recognized relatively evenly over the remainder of the year. Also, due to GAAP accounting rules, ESI earnings recognition will be proportional to our shareholding, until all shares are acquired. With the normalization of backlog over the past year, our Q1 guidance is based on, one, existing backlog that is scheduled to ship this quarter; two, our view of incoming Q1 orders and three, our ability to turn a portion of those incoming orders into revenue within the quarter. We now expect first quarter revenue to be in the range of $1.235 billion to $1.255 billion and Q1 earnings per share in the range of $1.53 to $1.59 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 176 million shares. This guidance includes approximately $60 million in ESI revenue and an EPS impact of approximately $0.05 from ESI net income. Now I would like to highlight a few modeling items for FY'24. As I just mentioned, we are modeling a significant sequential decrease in ESI revenue in Q2 and over the same period, we expect a low single-digit increase in core Keysight revenue. Excluding ESI, FY'24 operating expenses are expected to be flat to slightly down year-over-year, reflecting the structural flexibility of our business model and the cost actions we have initiated. With the addition of ESI, we expect FY'24 R&D investment to be 17% of revenue. Annual interest expense is expected to be approximately $80 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $150 million and we are modeling a 17% non-GAAP effective tax rate for FY'24. In closing, Keysight's flexible cost structure, track record for execution, diverse end markets and long-term secular growth drivers give us confidence in our ability to outperform, even in challenging market conditions. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.\nJason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Sarah, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A?\nOperator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thank you. Maybe first question, you guys talked about kind of an over-performance of EISG or how well that business had done over the last couple of years. Just trying to get a sense of, is there a period, where you think kind of represents, the run rate of that business just as we think of the growth of that business going forward? And then -- maybe just the second question, just on the Communications business. You guys have mentioned kind of seeing stabilization in that business. So I just wanted to kind of clarify that none of the weakness that you are seeing has kind of spread to more of the lab testing that it's largely kind of stayed on the production side. Thank you.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Meta. Absolutely. The EISG business, as we have said, the long-term market growth rates 4% to 6% and our goal is to beat it. And the business, obviously, has been performing significantly above that for a prolonged period of time. And that's really a function of the differentiated positions, we have, almost unique positions in some -- with some customers across these end markets that they serve. And it's also been a focus for us to continue to diversify the company. And with regard to the Commercial comps business, we saw sequential order improvement between Q4 relative to Q3. And again, that's stability in Wireless, continued stability now for a few quarters in Wireless, especially with 5G. And again, that is a function of the R&D holding up much better, and we're still awaiting a recovery in manufacturing. And then we saw some signs of recovery in our wired part of the ecosystem, again, driven by, what appears to be a sustained push to invest in AI ML/data center infrastructure by the cloud/hyperscalers.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thank you.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess for my first one, so just to clarify the comments around seasonality that you had, particularly now including the acquisition. I think what you're, I guess, guiding to is a sequential decline into the April quarter and that is the trough in terms of revenues. And when you think about the sort of back half of the year, how do you think about seasonality from 2Q onwards? Should we be thinking about sort of the typical seasonal increases that you see? Just any clarification in terms of, if I put in those comments correctly? And I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. So I do think you interpreted the comments correctly. I think as we move from Q1 to Q2, we do expect a low single-digit increase in core Keysight. But ESI, as we mentioned, because of the timing of their contract renewals, recognized as a disproportionate portion of their revenue in Keysight's first quarter, 40% to 45% with the balance 55% to 60%, spread roughly evenly over the subsequent three quarters. So there is a significant drop off on the ESI side of things, just given the timing of those contractual renewals. I think, obviously, we're taking this one quarter at a time, given the normalization that we're seeing in the marketplace. I do think that over time, we expect the seasonality of the Keysight business to return more towards historic norms, than what we've seen over the last couple of years, as a result of the supply chain disruptions, but we'll have to wait and see how that develops as we move forward.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. And just in terms of the -- how to think about margins for this year, just a lot of puts and takes. I know you had some comments earlier about, I think last quarter, it was about sort of a 10% revenue decline is where we should expect 200 to 250 basis points of margin deterioration in the operating margin side, but you now have the acquisition, which is probably a bit diluted, but you also have taken cost actions. So can you just give us an updated framework on how to think about margins for the year, particularly given all the puts and takes? Thank you.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. So we've shared the same essentially, model describing kind of demand normalization here, really since our spin. And that's a model that says, if our revenues are down 10%, that we would expect operating margins to be down 300 to 400 basis points in that scenario. That's obviously pre any acquisition activity. So when you think about layering in ESI, obviously, it's a public company, you can look at their results. At this point, we only own half the shares. It's going to take us a while to get to full ownership. So I think you can layer in ESI in the short run, much as they were -- as they were running as an independent company. And once we get to full ownership, we'll be able to really set our minds on cost reduction within that space, synergy realization.\nSamik Chatterjee: Good. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Mason with Baird. Please proceed.\nRobert Mason: Yes, good afternoon. Last quarter, we talked about a surge in some of these longer-dated orders year-to-date. I'm just curious as you wrapped up the year where the total sum of those came in relative to last year? And then do you have any perspective on how those would start to be converted to revenue? Are those 2024 revenue events? Or are we looking more out into 2025?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. So first of all, as we said last quarter, they were about 8% of orders to date, and that's where they finished. So Q4 was on par with the first three quarters of the year, and that compared to we're like 2% as a historic run rate. The majority of that revenue will be in '24, although there is a portion, a sizable portion that pushes out into '25.\nRobert Mason: And is -- just for clarification, is that likely to show up in the EISG segment or in the CSG segment?\nNeil Dougherty: It's a mix. I think earlier in the year, those orders skewed towards EISG, not surprising with the strength in Aerospace, Defense and Government fiscal year-end. In the fourth quarter, they were more skewed towards Aerospace, Defense end market. So it really is a mix.\nRobert Mason: Very good. And just as a final question, if I could. Just do you have any sense as to what a reasonable time line should be to come complete the entirety of the ESI acquisition, the squeeze-out process?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. It really depends on what happens during this tender offer process, which again, we expect to complete the tender in the calendar first quarter. I think if we do that, then we'll move immediately and that goes as expected, we'll move immediately to a squeeze out that I think would have us complete mid-year. There are scenarios, where if less than the required number of people get to tender, where it will take us a little bit longer to meet the appropriate thresholds to essentially do the squeeze-out process.\nRobert Mason: Very good. Thank you.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. I want to go back to the prior question on kind of the longer backlog metric. I think last quarter, you talked about that being $200 million. Is that -- I know you said 8% of orders, but is that still that -- roughly that number, which should be on top of the $2.3 billion or so total backlog you came out of exiting this last quarter?\nNeil Dougherty: Well, the numbers are included in the backlog, right? And so if you take our order rate for the year about 8%. So you get to somewhere around $400 million of longer-dated backlog, orders with longer-dated backlog that we took within the year. Obviously, some of that -- if we took a 10-month order in Q1, it would have shipped here at the tail end of '23, but you can that view that most of that $400 million is sitting in our backlog, as we enter fiscal '24.\nAaron Rakers: And to be clear, that will, typically, your backlog was a six-month forward number. It sounds like a majority of that would be recognized in the back half of the fiscal year. That's a fair assessment?\nNeil Dougherty: I'm just thinking, as we've received those orders all throughout the year. And so again, there is -- there are a couple of large-scale projects that pushed out into '25, where we'll get kind of lump sum revenue recognition. It probably has a back half skew though for the portion that's in '24, I would say there's a back half skew for sure.\nAaron Rakers: Okay. Perfect. And then the real quick follow-up is, could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing on Wireline with regard to AI? Just maybe flesh out exactly where you're involved? Because it seems like that is -- clearly, as we move towards possibly Ethernet and 800 gig, it seems like that would be inflecting. I'm just curious to how Keysight's involved in that?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you. I think as we talked about, our Commercial Comms business is diversified with exposure into both Wireless and Wireline parts of the ecosystem. For the Wireline parts of the ecosystem, we're obviously tethered to computing, networking, being the core end markets. And what we're starting to see is some signs to the compute markets are starting to stabilize after a period of inventory digestion that was underway. But equally, there is some incremental spend that's occurring driven by cloud and hyperscalers, who are pretty serious about upgrading that infrastructure. And so that's manifesting itself in manufacturing test for our transceiver test business. It's also manifesting itself in increased spend that we saw this quarter for 800 gig and also terabit Ethernet solutions. And so we're quite pleased with the sequential uptick we've seen. Again, one quarter doesn't make a trend, but I think we're encouraged by the progression that we've seen on the Wireline side.\nAaron Rakers: Thank you, guys.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Snyder with UBS. Please proceed.\nChristopher Snyder: Thank you. So orders came in up about 7% sequentially. I think it was the best order quarter number for fiscal '23. And I understand there's seasonality involved, but can you maybe just talk about, where orders have improved versus three to six months ago, versus maybe where you've seen continued softening in orders versus three to six months ago? And then specifically for the AI ML and the data center infrastructure, could you size how big that AI ML related businesses today, whether it's on orders or revenue? Thank you.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes, maybe at the highest level, I would just say, we got a sequential improvement, I would say, in orders from our Aerospace, Defense business, which was strong. Obviously, the year-end is typically what we expect. We saw that for Commercial Communications, sequential growth, stability in Wireless/5G and a sequential uptick in our Wired part of the ecosystem. And what we anticipated also was, we would see some softness in the EISG business, particularly with Asia and China, and we did experience that. Now again, to put it in context, the EISG business is just later in undergoing this demand normalization. And so that was what we had sort of forecasted, and so it behaved as we expected. With regard to the Wireline Ecosystem, I just go back to our long-term growth rate expectations for the Communications business in general and say that we see a business that is diversified, where multiple technology waves are overlapping. And that gives us inherent stability and resilience, and we're pleased by some of the progression we're seeing in the AI ML spend, because we've been working with customers on this for some time now. And we expect that as more of the network traffic is driven by applications that are coming out for AI ML, this will become a bigger part of our business. I'll just maybe hand it off to Mark to make some comments on orders.\nMark Wallace: Yes. Thanks, Satish. Chris, I'll just add a few color comments to what Satish did here. And then it really begins with all of our customers, still remaining very active in their R&D projects. And we see that in our funnel in terms of new funnel intake, which has been very positive. And our ability to convert that remains high, although as we've said for the last several quarters, some of this long-dated backlog and then customers taking a bit more time to make these decisions as have been a factor as well. I'm also seeing stabilization in the indirect businesses, some of the inventories in our distributors normalize, and I'm very pleased with our e-commerce business, which continues to be strongly adopted. We saw about a doubling of business through that -- through that channel. And in total, we continue to add new customers, more than 2,000 during the course of the last year, and about 300 of those came through e-commerce. So there's some positive elements of what we've seen in the fourth quarter.\nChristopher Snyder: I appreciate that. And then for my follow-up, I guess maybe more of a modeling question. For the revenue, Q1 revenue guide, the $1.245 billion at the midpoint, does that include $60 million from ESI implying about $1.285 billion at the midpoint for organic Keysight. It seems to be a pretty sharp fall off versus the 1327 orders we just got. Thank you.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. $1.185 billion, not $1.285 billion, but your math is correct. $1.245 billion, less $60 million gets you to $1.185 billion for Core Keysight. And what we've typically seen is on the order side is a high single-digit sequential decline as we move from Q4 into Q1. And I think given the normalization, that we're currently seeing, particularly in EISG, we expect a sequential decline this year to be a little bit larger than historical average. And so that's -- and again, with orders and revenue converging, that's how you can think about getting to that $1.185 billion for Core Keysight.\nChristopher Snyder: Thank you.\nNeil Dougherty: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nMark Delaney: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. A question on Commercial Comms. And do you think the company can get back to the historical highs in the Commercial Comms segment, in terms of revenue from a resumption in 5G alone? Or do you think you would need some contribution from things like 800 gig and 6G in order to get there?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you, Mark. Absolutely, we are confident in the long-term outlook for the business, I outlined at Investor Day several overlapping themes of technology waves that are playing out across end markets. And our view remains solid with that. In fact, as we engage with customers even through this time, where the spend has been lower, customers are intensely focused on higher priority R&D programs. And so that strategic view has not changed for us. Obviously, there is this current demand normalization that's occurring after fiscal '21 and '22, where we had outsized order growth in the business. And so post normalization, we remain confident in our ability to continue to grow the business, because of these multiple ways of technology across both wired and wireless ecosystem.\nMark Delaney: That's helpful. And other question on the competitive landscape with one of your competitors having recently been acquired. Have you seen any change in any opportunities in terms of new business wins or any changes on the competitive front that you would point out? Thanks.\nMark Wallace: Yes. No, we remain active in all of the markets that we serve. The automotive market, in particular, continues to be quite robust with many customers investing in long-term EV projects, which we continue to engage with. So no, we've not seen any change since any recent announcements.\nMark Delaney: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Please proceed.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Congrats on the strong Q4. Can you give a little more color into what is going on in China and whether you're seeing any green shoots there?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you. I'll have Mark make some comments, but thank you. We're pleased with the execution and the operational performance of the business in fiscal '23. Our engagements in China with customers remain strong, but I'll have Mark make some comments by end market.\nMark Wallace: Yes. Our business in China remains very diverse. We did see softer demand in Q4 and in the second half. And actually, our business in China held up relatively strong in the first half, especially from the EISG standpoint. But there is incremental weakness in manufacturing and in semiconductor, and we expect that to continue for the next couple of quarters. Where I see the activity is around the areas that, we have remained focused on high-speed digital, optical, auto and EV and AE and opportunities for mature semiconductor technologies continue there as well. I also think we've de-risked quite a bit of the trade impact that we've been experiencing for the last several years. We'll watch that carefully. It's been fairly status quo, I would say, for the last couple of quarters. And if we do see some moderation to the demand normalization on the manufacturing side, I think we'll be very well positioned when that happens.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. Thank you, Mark.\nMark Wallace: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Atif Malik with Citi. Please proceed.\nAtif Malik: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. The first one for Satish, you guys are seeing stability in 5G market maybe restocking in China smartphones. And it sounds like you're optimistic about second half of next year. Is it possible for you to provide us a few milestones on the next 5G standards and maybe earlier rollout of 60 that we should be looking forward to for next year?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you. I think at the highest level, the things, that I watch for are the continued progression, the smartphone industry is making in inventory reductions, right, that's been talked about for chips and final device form factors. So that's one thing we watch. Obviously, when we think about the 5G standards progression, what we're seeing so far is increased interest from customers in Open RAN, even in our 5G business this year, Mark and team have added new customers to our already strong mix of installed base customers. So our leadership position continues to remain strong and we're continuing to remain differentiated with our portfolio, which is very broad and cares to the need of the entire ecosystem. The area that has also gained a lot of importance, as we went through the last year, has been the non-terrestrial networks so the satellite cases with 5G. And we're also seeing some interesting new use cases associated with Release 17 and the research interest across the globe to build organic IP in what comes beyond 5G has already kicked off and Keysight continues to play an early role in partnering with these customers. So when we look at our investment priorities. Yes, we're investing in R&D, but and we're focused on that -- focusing that investment around these next-generation themes, which will continue to enable us to be strong and grow the business over the long run at the rates that we've put out at the Investor Day.\nAtif Malik: Great. And then a follow-up for Neil. Neil, you talked about orders down high single-digits, in the January quarter because of EISG being down more than historical average. And you're pointing to an April quarter revenue trough because of ESI seasonality. Should we be thinking about orders recovering in the April quarter or coming down with that revenue decline?\nNeil Dougherty: On Core Keysight, we would typically see a sequential increase, as you move from Q1 to Q2. I think we'll need to wait for some time to pass, but to give you a sense of how that increase is going to compare to historic norms. But typically, you would see a Q1 to Q2 increase. And I think based on everything we see at this point, that's what we expect.\nAtif Malik: Great. Thank you.\nNeil Dougherty: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nMatthew Niknam: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. I have one follow-up to a prior question and one other one for Neil. In terms of the follow-up. So we're talking about a softer than seasonal outlook for Core Keys, stripping out that 60-ish million from ESI in fiscal 1Q. Is that primarily EISG i.e. are their expectations for more relative stability to sustain in comms and some of the strength to persist in ADG? So more just sort of unpacking that outlook for fiscal 1Q, across the segments? And then maybe for Neil, you're talking about CapEx of about $150 million. I think at the Analyst Day, it was around a $225 million mark for fiscal '24. I'm just wondering what's changed?\nMark Wallace: Yes. So on the first question regarding the seasonality, I think you have it mostly right. I think we're experiencing incremental softness in EISG and then a lot of that is in China and Asia. And that's what we're attributing to the slightly expected higher seasonal decrease for Q1. And then the second.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. On the CapEx, I mean, obviously, the business has been softer this year than we expected. And so when you think about investments in capacity and those types of things, we have either canceled in many cases or delayed other programs in response to the current macro environment, which is resulting in the reduced expectations for CapEx going forward.\nMatthew Niknam: Great. Thank you, both.\nNeil Dougherty: In '24. You're welcome. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tim Long with Barclays. Please proceed.\nTim Long: Thank you. Two, if I could. First, on the Wireline side, could you talk a little bit more specifically about optical kind of what you're seeing there? Where are we in cycle, it's been a little bit more challenged with some of the companies in the ecosystem. So if you could just talk about what you're kind of seeing on the physical test side, as well as Ixia. And then, just the second one on the Defense Automation business. It seems to be continuing rolling along really strong. Could you talk a little bit about sustainability of that kind of defense line, over the next multiple quarters? Thank you.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you. Sure. I'd say we've always believed that strategically, having both the physical and protocol and having a leadership position across both is an advantage, and we'll see that play out at this point, especially as the challenges migrate between SerDes and the Optical side and the Electrical side and our ability to connect the dots for our customers is an advantage for us, and we're able to monetize the advantage. I would say 400 gig Ethernet still continues to be the predominant investment standard with customers shifting priority to 800 terabit and beyond, from a research perspective or development perspective, and we're able to engage across that entire life cycle. Which has caused the sequential uptick we see. And we also see some of that. I'll have Mark make some comments on the funnel of opportunities as we look ahead. On the Defense side of the business, again, not only in the US but across the globe, the increased spending in technology investments in Aerospace and Defense is a trend that's playing out. In the US, I would say the prime contractors have been referencing growth in backlog and growth in orders. And I think all of that, we've seen a stronger uptick, I should say, in the Aerospace Defense business, in the most recent quarter. But equally, that bodes well for 2024. Obviously, we watch the Defense budget getting passed because that's an important milestone for that business. But I think given the bipartisan support that exists, we can be reasonably confident about the outlook for Aerospace and Defense in fiscal '24. I'll have Mark make some comments.\nMark Wallace: Yes. There's not much to add. Satish has covered it well. But what we've seen is this pattern of R&D and manufacturing on the wireline side. And we saw an uptick in 800 gigabit manufacturing spend for optical transceivers, feeding into network build-out and data center upgrades. So we saw a sequential improvement and the funnel would support that continuing. We saw AI server and GPU infrastructure testing also on the physical side. So there's some demand growth there. And as you pointed out, our broader portfolio in protocol solutions was reflected in some of our network visibility growth, particularly from enterprise customers. So these are all strengths that we were able to capture during Q4.\nTim Long: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Good evening. Thank you. So just really quick question on the margins. If I'm understanding sort of the seasonality comments on the ESI Group, that actually should be very modest, but it should be a tailwind to margins in the first quarter? So I completely understand the revenue guidance, but is there anything onetime that's implied in the first quarter margin?\nNeil Dougherty: You should be able to bridge from the Q4 results that we just put up to the Q1 guide, even if you adjust for the ESI, really with two bridging items. The first is the increase in the tax rate from 12% to 17%. And the second is the implied reduction in revenue, right, which we just talked about, goes from $1,311 million to $1,185 million so about $125 million reduction in revenue should be sufficient to bridge the delta.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Okay. And then for the full year, I know there were several project push-outs in semiconductors and other areas, maybe more broadly in China. But could you size sort of the full year impact of orders in fiscal '23, from those kind of project push-outs. And then look, it's always uncertain, but if the construction time line has stayed intact, should we expect sort of a similar magnitude to show up in fiscal '24?\nNeil Dougherty: I'm not sure I follow your question. If people are pushing out and we have confidence that they're ultimately going to take delivery of product, generally speaking, we leave those orders on the books.\nMark Wallace: Are you speaking about semi specifically with fabs? Is that?\nDavid Ridley-Lane: It was revenue and so if it was an order that tied to a semi fab, where the construction itself got pushed, that status orders, and you would just recognize the revenue later.\nNeil Dougherty: So you're talking about where deliveries got pushed out of three out of '23 and '24 and beyond?\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Yes.\nMark Wallace: Yes. So on semi specifically, I think there's two factors. One is the forward-looking demand, some of that has been pushed out because of delays in the fabs. And then the second part is delays of backlog. And I think you characterized it right going into late '24 and early '25.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Thank you very much.\nNeil Dougherty: Thank you.\nMark Wallace: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. That concludes our Q&A session for today. I would like to now turn the call back to Jason Kary for any closing remarks.\nJason Kary: Thank you, Sarah, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Just to wrap up the call, I'll turn it over to Satish, and over to you.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Jason. I want to thank all our shareholders for your support of Keysight. And I want to let you know, we remain incredibly confident in our future, and we're continuing to invest for growth around next-generation technology teams, which have strong customer validation. While doing so, we're also prudent in our spending and maintaining a strong discipline from an operating perspective in factoring in the current environment. And finally, we're also very confident in the free cash flow position of the business, and you've seen us in the most recent quarter, buy back over 100% of our free cash flow in our own shares, given the valuation at this time. Thank you very much and hope you have a good rest of your day.\nOperator: That concludes our conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Mark Wallace",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Satish. Chris, I'll just add a few color comments to what Satish did here. And then it really begins with all of our customers, still remaining very active in their R&D projects. And we see that in our funnel in terms of new funnel intake, which has been very positive. And our ability to convert that remains high, although as we've said for the last several quarters, some of this long-dated backlog and then customers taking a bit more time to make these decisions as have been a factor as well. I'm also seeing stabilization in the indirect businesses, some of the inventories in our distributors normalize, and I'm very pleased with our e-commerce business, which continues to be strongly adopted. We saw about a doubling of business through that -- through that channel. And in total, we continue to add new customers, more than 2,000 during the course of the last year, and about 300 of those came through e-commerce. So there's some positive elements of what we've seen in the fourth quarter. Yes. No, we remain active in all of the markets that we serve. The automotive market, in particular, continues to be quite robust with many customers investing in long-term EV projects, which we continue to engage with. So no, we've not seen any change since any recent announcements. Yes. Our business in China remains very diverse. We did see softer demand in Q4 and in the second half. And actually, our business in China held up relatively strong in the first half, especially from the EISG standpoint. But there is incremental weakness in manufacturing and in semiconductor, and we expect that to continue for the next couple of quarters. Where I see the activity is around the areas that, we have remained focused on high-speed digital, optical, auto and EV and AE and opportunities for mature semiconductor technologies continue there as well. I also think we've de-risked quite a bit of the trade impact that we've been experiencing for the last several years. We'll watch that carefully. It's been fairly status quo, I would say, for the last couple of quarters. And if we do see some moderation to the demand normalization on the manufacturing side, I think we'll be very well positioned when that happens. Yes. Yes. So on the first question regarding the seasonality, I think you have it mostly right. I think we're experiencing incremental softness in EISG and then a lot of that is in China and Asia. And that's what we're attributing to the slightly expected higher seasonal decrease for Q1. And then the second. Yes. There's not much to add. Satish has covered it well. But what we've seen is this pattern of R&D and manufacturing on the wireline side. And we saw an uptick in 800 gigabit manufacturing spend for optical transceivers, feeding into network build-out and data center upgrades.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Neil Dougherty",
            "content": "Thank you, Satish, and hello, everyone. Fourth quarter revenue of $1.311 billion was just above the high end of our guidance range and down 9% or 10%, on a core basis. Orders of $1.327 billion declined 16% on both a reported and core basis. Similar to the third quarter, demand in China was muted and accounted for roughly 1/3 of the year-over-year order decline. We ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in backlog. Looking at our operational results for Q4, we reported gross margin of 65%, an increase of 130 basis points, year-over-year and operating expenses of $474 million, resulting in operating margin of 29%. We achieved net income of $352 million and delivered earnings of $1.99 per share. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 177 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated revenue of $891 million, down 10% on a reported and core basis. Commercial Communications revenue of $568 million, declined 17%, while Aerospace, Defense and Government revenue of $323 million was up 4%, driven by increasing defense budgets and investments in technology modernization. Altogether, CSG delivered gross margin of 68% and operating margin of 29%. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated revenue of $420 million, down 7%, as reported or 8% on a core basis. EISG reported gross margin of 61% and operating margin of 30%. Turning to our full year financial performance. Keysight delivered strong results, despite demand and foreign exchange headwinds. Full year 2023 revenue grew 1% as reported or 2% on a core basis to a record $5.464 billion. Gross margin of 66% expanded 80 basis points. We invested $842 million in R&D, while operating margin improved 90 basis points to 30%. The flexibility of our cost structure and actions that we've taken to further reduce costs, drove FY'23 net income to a record $1.5 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $8.33, which was up 9%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the fourth quarter with $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generating cash flow from operations of $378 million and free cash flow of $340 million. Total free cash flow for the year was $1.212 billion, representing 22% of revenue and 81% of non-GAAP net income. Share repurchases this quarter totaled 3,270, 000 shares, at an average price per share of approximately $130. For a total consideration of $426 million. This brings our total share repurchases for the year to 4.9 million shares, at an average share price of approximately $143 for a total consideration of $702 million or 58% of free cash flow. Now turning to our outlook. Looking forward to fiscal year '24, we expect the demand environment in the first half to remain mixed, and we'll be closely watching for signs of recovery in the second half. Going forward, we will report results including ESI, which is expected to be slightly dilutive to earnings on the full year. Given the timing of annual contract renewals, ESI typically recognizes 40% to 45% of their full year revenue in Keysight's fiscal first quarter, with the balance recognized relatively evenly over the remainder of the year. Also, due to GAAP accounting rules, ESI earnings recognition will be proportional to our shareholding, until all shares are acquired. With the normalization of backlog over the past year, our Q1 guidance is based on, one, existing backlog that is scheduled to ship this quarter; two, our view of incoming Q1 orders and three, our ability to turn a portion of those incoming orders into revenue within the quarter. We now expect first quarter revenue to be in the range of $1.235 billion to $1.255 billion and Q1 earnings per share in the range of $1.53 to $1.59 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 176 million shares. This guidance includes approximately $60 million in ESI revenue and an EPS impact of approximately $0.05 from ESI net income. Now I would like to highlight a few modeling items for FY'24. As I just mentioned, we are modeling a significant sequential decrease in ESI revenue in Q2 and over the same period, we expect a low single-digit increase in core Keysight revenue. Excluding ESI, FY'24 operating expenses are expected to be flat to slightly down year-over-year, reflecting the structural flexibility of our business model and the cost actions we have initiated. With the addition of ESI, we expect FY'24 R&D investment to be 17% of revenue. Annual interest expense is expected to be approximately $80 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $150 million and we are modeling a 17% non-GAAP effective tax rate for FY'24. In closing, Keysight's flexible cost structure, track record for execution, diverse end markets and long-term secular growth drivers give us confidence in our ability to outperform, even in challenging market conditions. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A. Yes. So I do think you interpreted the comments correctly. I think as we move from Q1 to Q2, we do expect a low single-digit increase in core Keysight. But ESI, as we mentioned, because of the timing of their contract renewals, recognized as a disproportionate portion of their revenue in Keysight's first quarter, 40% to 45% with the balance 55% to 60%, spread roughly evenly over the subsequent three quarters. So there is a significant drop off on the ESI side of things, just given the timing of those contractual renewals. I think, obviously, we're taking this one quarter at a time, given the normalization that we're seeing in the marketplace. I do think that over time, we expect the seasonality of the Keysight business to return more towards historic norms, than what we've seen over the last couple of years, as a result of the supply chain disruptions, but we'll have to wait and see how that develops as we move forward. Yes. So we've shared the same essentially, model describing kind of demand normalization here, really since our spin. And that's a model that says, if our revenues are down 10%, that we would expect operating margins to be down 300 to 400 basis points in that scenario. That's obviously pre any acquisition activity. So when you think about layering in ESI, obviously, it's a public company, you can look at their results. At this point, we only own half the shares. It's going to take us a while to get to full ownership. So I think you can layer in ESI in the short run, much as they were -- as they were running as an independent company. And once we get to full ownership, we'll be able to really set our minds on cost reduction within that space, synergy realization. Yes. So first of all, as we said last quarter, they were about 8% of orders to date, and that's where they finished. So Q4 was on par with the first three quarters of the year, and that compared to we're like 2% as a historic run rate. The majority of that revenue will be in '24, although there is a portion, a sizable portion that pushes out into '25. It's a mix. I think earlier in the year, those orders skewed towards EISG, not surprising with the strength in Aerospace, Defense and Government fiscal year-end. In the fourth quarter, they were more skewed towards Aerospace, Defense end market. So it really is a mix. Yes. It really depends on what happens during this tender offer process, which again, we expect to complete the tender in the calendar first quarter. I think if we do that, then we'll move immediately and that goes as expected, we'll move immediately to a squeeze out that I think would have us complete mid-year. There are scenarios, where if less than the required number of people get to tender, where it will take us a little bit longer to meet the appropriate thresholds to essentially do the squeeze-out process. Well, the numbers are included in the backlog, right? And so if you take our order rate for the year about 8%. So you get to somewhere around $400 million of longer-dated backlog, orders with longer-dated backlog that we took within the year. Obviously, some of that -- if we took a 10-month order in Q1, it would have shipped here at the tail end of '23, but you can that view that most of that $400 million is sitting in our backlog, as we enter fiscal '24. I'm just thinking, as we've received those orders all throughout the year. And so again, there is -- there are a couple of large-scale projects that pushed out into '25, where we'll get kind of lump sum revenue recognition. It probably has a back half skew though for the portion that's in '24, I would say there's a back half skew for sure. Yes. $1.185 billion, not $1.285 billion, but your math is correct. $1.245 billion, less $60 million gets you to $1.185 billion for Core Keysight. And what we've typically seen is on the order side is a high single-digit sequential decline as we move from Q4 into Q1. And I think given the normalization, that we're currently seeing, particularly in EISG, we expect a sequential decline this year to be a little bit larger than historical average. And so that's -- and again, with orders and revenue converging, that's how you can think about getting to that $1.185 billion for Core Keysight. Thank you. On Core Keysight, we would typically see a sequential increase, as you move from Q1 to Q2. I think we'll need to wait for some time to pass, but to give you a sense of how that increase is going to compare to historic norms. But typically, you would see a Q1 to Q2 increase. And I think based on everything we see at this point, that's what we expect. Thank you. Yes. On the CapEx, I mean, obviously, the business has been softer this year than we expected. And so when you think about investments in capacity and those types of things, we have either canceled in many cases or delayed other programs in response to the current macro environment, which is resulting in the reduced expectations for CapEx going forward. In '24. You're welcome. Thank you. You should be able to bridge from the Q4 results that we just put up to the Q1 guide, even if you adjust for the ESI, really with two bridging items. The first is the increase in the tax rate from 12% to 17%. And the second is the implied reduction in revenue, right, which we just talked about, goes from $1,311 million to $1,185 million so about $125 million reduction in revenue should be sufficient to bridge the delta. I'm not sure I follow your question. If people are pushing out and we have confidence that they're ultimately going to take delivery of product, generally speaking, we leave those orders on the books. So you're talking about where deliveries got pushed out of three out of '23 and '24 and beyond? Thank you."

            "name": "Satish Dhanasekaran",
            "content": "Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. My comments today will focus on three key headlines. First, Keysight reported solid fourth quarter results and finished the year with record revenue, gross margins and operating margin, in what remains a challenging macro environment. Fourth quarter revenue and earnings per share exceeded the high end of our guidance, as orders came in slightly ahead of expectations. For the full year, revenue grew 2% on a core basis and earnings per share increased 9%, while we generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow. Second, our customer engagement on next-generation technology teams remain strong and we continue to action opportunities, across a broad and diverse set of end markets. Despite the mixed demand environment, as end markets normalize from post-COVID supply demand imbalances over the last two years. Third, we're investing both organically and inorganically, to expand our addressable markets and differentiated solutions portfolio, which took other step forward this quarter with the addition of ESI. We remain confident in the long-term secular growth drivers of our business and our ability to address our customers' most challenging and diverse innovation needs. Now let's begin with a brief overview of Keysight's fourth quarter and full year performance. We're pleased with our results and execution. Fourth quarter orders were $1.3 billion, and we delivered $1.3 billion in revenue and $1.99 in earnings per share. We also generated $340 million in free cash flow and repurchased $426 million of our shares this quarter. Full year results were strong in a year of normalizing demand. Orders of $5.2 billion were in line with our original expectations of approximately $1.3 billion per quarter this year. We delivered an all-time high of $5.5 billion in revenue and achieved record profitability with gross margins of 66% and operating margins of 30% and $8.33 in earnings per share. Moving to our markets. Overall, the demand dynamics within the quarter, were consistent with our expectations. Aerospace, Defense and Government demand increased, commercial communications was steady and as anticipated, broader manufacturing-related spending in the electronics industrial markets was incrementally softer. Turning to our business segments. Communications Solutions Group revenue declined 10%. Aerospace, Defense and Government grew, while Commercial Communication markets are rebalancing off of last year's record highs. On a sequential basis, orders grew across both markets. In Aerospace, Defense and Government, revenue grew 4% to an all-time high, we saw healthy order demand from the US and European primes, as well as direct government customers, driven by investments in Defense modernization, space and satellite applications. Keysight's Leading Threat Emulation solutions capabilities drove order growth in the US, including a large US Department of Defense win for electromagnetic spectrum operation applications. We also saw demand from European primes for our Radar and phased array antenna solutions to support their delivery goals in 2024 and beyond. The breadth and the depth of our solutions portfolio enable new customer engagements and business in satellite communications 5G and 6G and advanced quantum research, including a large order from a premier research institute contributing to the record quarter. In Commercial Communications, revenue declined 17%, reflecting ongoing customer spending constraints, as inventories in their markets normalize. Sequentially, we saw stability in wireless orders and incremental strength in demand for network and data center applications. Demand for our wireline solutions was driven by AI ML and data center expansion, as hyperscalers build infrastructure to handle increasing network and compute workloads. We expect this trend to continue into the next year and beyond. Enterprise customer business was stable with ongoing investments in network monitoring, driven by increasing data traffic and cybersecurity compliance needs. In Wireless, the progression of standards is driving steady R&D investments in new capabilities and devices, as well as Open RAN and Release 17 features. Our R&D engagements with customers continue to expand. This quarter, we enable MediaTek to validate non-terrestrial network connectivity. In addition, Keysight was awarded two key UK government grants in partnership with universities and leading telecom operators to support Open RAN design, testing and deployment in Europe. Turning to Electronic Industrial Solutions Group. As expected, Q4 orders and revenue were both down compared to record levels of last year. It is important to note that the EISG has shown significantly about long-term expectations with revenue increasing by 30% in 2021, 14% in 2022 and an additional 10% in 2023. This growth was driven by both our Differentiated Solutions portfolio and an outsized demand from post-COVID recovery and supply constraints. In the second half of this year, we began to see a normalization from these size as well as ongoing cautious customer spending. In semiconductor, capital spending for wafer capacity contracted in the quarter, as foundry customers pushed out their new fab investment time lines. We continue to see strong customer engagement for Keysight's proprietary interferometer systems and differentiated R&D solutions for silicon photonics and power semiconductors, reflecting the industry's medium to long-term recovery and growth expectations. In automotive, customer investment in R&D for battery and charging infrastructure continues and is being fueled by increasing competition, regional legislative deadlines and government funding, particularly in Europe and Asia. The funnel of EV opportunities remain strong, while the timing and size of these systems engagements are expected to vary from a quarter-to-quarter. In General Electronics, we saw steady demand for our solutions in advanced research, industrial automation and digital health. However, and more broadly, manufacturing capacity normalization and cautious spending continued to weigh in on consumer electronics and manufacturing portions of the market. We're watching Global PMI and other macroeconomic indicators to gauge the timing of the market recovery. As an integral part of our solution strategy, software and services revenue growth this year continue to outpace Keysight overall. The recurring portion of software and services grew 9% this year, driving total annual recurring revenue to approximately $1.3 billion or 23% of total revenue, an increase of 200 basis points, year-over-year. In early November, ahead of schedule, we announced our acquisition of a controlling block of shares of ESI Group. The addition of ESI, further increases our software and annual recurring revenue expands our addressable markets and strengthens our strategy of moving upstream into earlier stages of our customers' design cycles. We continue to invest prudently to capitalize on our long-term growth opportunities. In parallel, we remain disciplined and are taking additional targeted cost actions to streamline operations and ensure strong financial performance. In wrapping up my first full year, as the CEO of Keysight, I'd like to thank our employees for their outstanding contributions, commitment and strong track record of execution in these tough market conditions. The strength of Keysight's differentiated solutions, the diversity of our end markets and the durability of our business model, all position us well for continued market outperformance, as we enter the new fiscal year. With that, I'll turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook. Thank you, Meta. Absolutely. The EISG business, as we have said, the long-term market growth rates 4% to 6% and our goal is to beat it. And the business, obviously, has been performing significantly above that for a prolonged period of time. And that's really a function of the differentiated positions, we have, almost unique positions in some -- with some customers across these end markets that they serve. And it's also been a focus for us to continue to diversify the company. And with regard to the Commercial comps business, we saw sequential order improvement between Q4 relative to Q3. And again, that's stability in Wireless, continued stability now for a few quarters in Wireless, especially with 5G. And again, that is a function of the R&D holding up much better, and we're still awaiting a recovery in manufacturing. And then we saw some signs of recovery in our wired part of the ecosystem, again, driven by, what appears to be a sustained push to invest in AI ML/data center infrastructure by the cloud/hyperscalers. Thank you. Thank you. Yes. Thank you. I think as we talked about, our Commercial Comms business is diversified with exposure into both Wireless and Wireline parts of the ecosystem. For the Wireline parts of the ecosystem, we're obviously tethered to computing, networking, being the core end markets. And what we're starting to see is some signs to the compute markets are starting to stabilize after a period of inventory digestion that was underway. But equally, there is some incremental spend that's occurring driven by cloud and hyperscalers, who are pretty serious about upgrading that infrastructure. And so that's manifesting itself in manufacturing test for our transceiver test business. It's also manifesting itself in increased spend that we saw this quarter for 800 gig and also terabit Ethernet solutions. And so we're quite pleased with the sequential uptick we've seen. Again, one quarter doesn't make a trend, but I think we're encouraged by the progression that we've seen on the Wireline side. Thank you. Yes, maybe at the highest level, I would just say, we got a sequential improvement, I would say, in orders from our Aerospace, Defense business, which was strong. Obviously, the year-end is typically what we expect. We saw that for Commercial Communications, sequential growth, stability in Wireless/5G and a sequential uptick in our Wired part of the ecosystem. And what we anticipated also was, we would see some softness in the EISG business, particularly with Asia and China, and we did experience that. Now again, to put it in context, the EISG business is just later in undergoing this demand normalization. And so that was what we had sort of forecasted, and so it behaved as we expected. With regard to the Wireline Ecosystem, I just go back to our long-term growth rate expectations for the Communications business in general and say that we see a business that is diversified, where multiple technology waves are overlapping. And that gives us inherent stability and resilience, and we're pleased by some of the progression we're seeing in the AI ML spend, because we've been working with customers on this for some time now. And we expect that as more of the network traffic is driven by applications that are coming out for AI ML, this will become a bigger part of our business. I'll just maybe hand it off to Mark to make some comments on orders. Yes. Thank you, Mark. Absolutely, we are confident in the long-term outlook for the business, I outlined at Investor Day several overlapping themes of technology waves that are playing out across end markets. And our view remains solid with that. In fact, as we engage with customers even through this time, where the spend has been lower, customers are intensely focused on higher priority R&D programs. And so that strategic view has not changed for us. Obviously, there is this current demand normalization that's occurring after fiscal '21 and '22, where we had outsized order growth in the business. And so post normalization, we remain confident in our ability to continue to grow the business, because of these multiple ways of technology across both wired and wireless ecosystem. Yes. Thank you. I'll have Mark make some comments, but thank you. We're pleased with the execution and the operational performance of the business in fiscal '23. Our engagements in China with customers remain strong, but I'll have Mark make some comments by end market. Yes. Thank you. I think at the highest level, the things, that I watch for are the continued progression, the smartphone industry is making in inventory reductions, right, that's been talked about for chips and final device form factors. So that's one thing we watch. Obviously, when we think about the 5G standards progression, what we're seeing so far is increased interest from customers in Open RAN, even in our 5G business this year, Mark and team have added new customers to our already strong mix of installed base customers. So our leadership position continues to remain strong and we're continuing to remain differentiated with our portfolio, which is very broad and cares to the need of the entire ecosystem. The area that has also gained a lot of importance, as we went through the last year, has been the non-terrestrial networks so the satellite cases with 5G. And we're also seeing some interesting new use cases associated with Release 17 and the research interest across the globe to build organic IP in what comes beyond 5G has already kicked off and Keysight continues to play an early role in partnering with these customers. So when we look at our investment priorities. Yes, we're investing in R&D, but and we're focused on that -- focusing that investment around these next-generation themes, which will continue to enable us to be strong and grow the business over the long run at the rates that we've put out at the Investor Day. Yes. Thank you. Sure. I'd say we've always believed that strategically, having both the physical and protocol and having a leadership position across both is an advantage, and we'll see that play out at this point, especially as the challenges migrate between SerDes and the Optical side and the Electrical side and our ability to connect the dots for our customers is an advantage for us, and we're able to monetize the advantage. I would say 400 gig Ethernet still continues to be the predominant investment standard with customers shifting priority to 800 terabit and beyond, from a research perspective or development perspective, and we're able to engage across that entire life cycle. Which has caused the sequential uptick we see. And we also see some of that. I'll have Mark make some comments on the funnel of opportunities as we look ahead. On the Defense side of the business, again, not only in the US but across the globe, the increased spending in technology investments in Aerospace and Defense is a trend that's playing out. In the US, I would say the prime contractors have been referencing growth in backlog and growth in orders. And I think all of that, we've seen a stronger uptick, I should say, in the Aerospace Defense business, in the most recent quarter. But equally, that bodes well for 2024. Obviously, we watch the Defense budget getting passed because that's an important milestone for that business. But I think given the bipartisan support that exists, we can be reasonably confident about the outlook for Aerospace and Defense in fiscal '24. I'll have Mark make some comments. Thank you, Jason. I want to thank all our shareholders for your support of Keysight. And I want to let you know, we remain incredibly confident in our future, and we're continuing to invest for growth around next-generation technology teams, which have strong customer validation. While doing so, we're also prudent in our spending and maintaining a strong discipline from an operating perspective in factoring in the current environment. And finally, we're also very confident in the free cash flow position of the business, and you've seen us in the most recent quarter, buy back over 100% of our free cash flow in our own shares, given the valuation at this time. Thank you very much and hope you have a good rest of your day."

My name is Cole, and I'll be your lead operator today. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded today, Thursday, August 17, 2023 at 1:30 P.M. Pacific Time. I would now like to hand the call over to Jason Kary, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Kary.\nJason Kary: Thank you, and welcome everyone to Keysight's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Fiscal Year 2023. Joining me are Keysight's President and CEO, Satish Dhanasekaran; and our CFO, Neil Dougherty. In the Q&A session, we'll be joined by Chief Customer Officer, Mark Wallace.

Lastly, management is scheduled to participate in upcoming investor conferences hosted by Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, and Citi. And now, I will turn the call over to Satish.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Keysight reported solid results in the third quarter, demonstrating the strength of our portfolio and the resilience of our financial model. We are executing on our strategy and delivering on our commitments to customers and shareholders in a challenging macro-environment. My comments today will focus on three key headlines. First, we delivered another quarter of strong financial performance demonstrating Keysight's diversified portfolio, strong execution, and operating discipline. Third quarter revenue was in-line with our expectations, while record earnings per share exceeded our guidance range. Second, while orders came in at the low end of our expectations, we saw positive and steady customer R&D spending and continued stability in commercial communications. Growth in aerospace, defense and government and growth in our automotive EV and AV solutions, partially offsetting incremental softness in EISG and Asia, primarily related to semiconductor and other manufacturing. This backdrop has tempered our near-term expectations for orders and revenue. We've factored this dynamic into our outlook for Q4, while now expecting full-year EPS growth of 7%. Third, despite the near-term challenges, Keysight's diversified business, differentiated solutions, and durable operating model give us confidence in our ability to capitalize on the long-term secular growth trends of our markets, as well as outperform in a variety of market conditions. Now let's take a deeper look at our third quarter results. While orders declined 15%, revenue of $1.38 billion was up 1% on a core basis and a record for the third quarter. Our differentiation and strong execution resulted in gross margin of 66% and record operating margin of 31%. We delivered $2.19 in earnings per share, which was an all-time high. Turning to the demand environment, we continue to see steady investment in strategic R&D programs in commercial communications, aerospace, defense and government and automotive EV solutions. In fact, over the past year, we've seen a meaningful growth in large long-term customer commitments related to strategic programs, particularly in automotive and ADG. We view this as an important validation of our strategy, it puts us in a strong position in key emerging technologies and positions us well for future growth. Demand was incrementally weaker in Asia this quarter as customers deferred manufacturing-related spending in semiconductor, general electronics, and automotive markets in many cases well into next year. Taken together, the increase in our customer strategic program investment combined with soft near-term demand environment is moderating revenue in the fourth quarter, which Neil will discuss in more detail. Turning to our business segments. Electronic Industrial Solutions Group revenue grew 14% to another quarterly record and the 12 consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. The strong financial performance was driven by double-digit growth across all markets and regions. EISG orders in the third quarter trended lower, particularly in semiconductor and manufacturing. Our customer engagements remain high as they're planned for, and continue to invest in key long-term strategic initiatives. In semiconductor, despite a near-term pullback in capital spending for wafer capacity, the industry is marching forward and planning for a strong future demand environment. In the near term, customers are prioritizing new applications such as silicon photonics to address the AI demand. As a result, this quarter we did see significant slowdown in our new wafer test solutions, while demand for Keysight's silicon photonics test and proprietary interferometer systems remained high. We expect these dynamics to continue over the next few quarters. In automotive, investments in EV and AV technologies continued to be strong. This quarter we secured a third strategic win with another large European OEM to supply an EV battery test system that includes our PathWave Lab automation software. This program will be implemented in 2025, and we're quite excited to be working with industry leaders and supporting their goals. To address customer needs for wireless tracking, diagnostics and connected vehicle communications, Keysight also announced support for automated RF testing for Autotalks\u2019 C-V2X chipsets on our PathWave Test Executive software platform. In general electronics, the growing collaboration between universities and companies is driving further investment in our solutions for advanced research. We're also expanding on our customer engagement in digital health solutions to support the growing digitalization and connectivity requirements of this industry. Turning to Communications Solutions Group, revenue declined 5%, while the overall stable demand environment continued quarter-to-quarter. Aerospace, defense, and government revenue grew 11% with strong demand from U.S. government and primes. Keysight's differentiated signal generation and threat scenario emulation capabilities led to a large U.S. Air Force contract in Q3. We also won a key contract from leading Canadian prime contractors for electromagnetic spectrum operation applications. In addition, the demand for our radar and defense modernization solutions grew robustly as prime contractors placed orders for systems that support their delivery goals in 2024 and beyond. Government research demand and investment in 5G and 6G continued as well. Commercial Communications revenue declined 12% due to cautious spending by customers and weaker manufacturing activity in smartphone, PC, and component supply chain. Customer engagements remained strong with R&D investments in key technology to support 5G and 6G AI/ML-driven high-speed datacenter networking and satellite communications. Demand for our wireline applications improved sequentially driven by cloud provider and hyperscaler investments as they designed their networks for AI and ML workloads. Enterprise customer and key service provider investment was steady, driven by increased digitization, heavier network loads, and rising cyber security concerns. In wireless, 5G standards are progressing and we saw steady R&D investment in Open RAN, satellite, non-terrestrial networks and 5G RedCap Release 17 capability targeted at industrial and IoT applications. Early 6G engagements continued this quarter. We enabled the University of Stuttgart to advance 6G integrated circuit research with our sub-Terahertz solutions. Keysight also led the agreement between the 6G-SANDBOX consortium and the European Space Agency to further research to integrate terrestrial 5G/6G technologies and satellite networks of the future. This quarter, we continued to strengthen our technology leadership in the industry and enable our customers' innovation. For example, we extended our flagship network analyzer portfolio by introducing industry's first integrated platform with vector component and analysis capabilities for power amplifier and component design applications. We also announced industry's most comprehensive multi-speed ethernet performance platform supporting data center interconnects up to 800 gigabit ethernet that are critical for data-intensive applications such as AI. And lastly, Keysight enabled 3GPP protocol conformance validation for Release 17 non-terrestrial networks and is continuing to partner with new satellite operators like Skylo to accelerate the deployment of satellite networks. Software and services remain an integral part of our solution strategy and again accounted for one third of total company revenue. Overall, software and services revenue grew year-over-year reflecting the continued expansion of our software-centric solutions. We remain confident in the long-term secular growth of software intensive R&D applications, particularly earlier in our customers' development process. In line with this trend and the software system simulation opportunity that I laid out at our March Investor Day, this quarter we announced our intent to acquire ESI Group, a leader in virtual prototyping solutions for the automotive and aerospace markets. The addition of ESI broadens our software capabilities into physical simulation and furthers our strategy of moving upstream into earlier stages of our customers' design cycles Keysight's technology leadership and deep collaboration with industry players remains a significant competitive advantage. Despite current macro uncertainty, we see continued investments in R&D driven by multiple waves of technology innovation and broad-based industrial digitalization and connectivity needs. While continuing to invest in these long-term secular growth trends, we remain disciplined and have driven incremental cost efficiencies throughout the organization this year. Our current guidance expectations are to finish the fiscal year 2023 with 7% EPS growth and 1% revenue growth. We believe this financial performance exemplifies the strength of Keysight's differentiated first-to-market solutions portfolio, our durable and resilient business model, and our winning culture which altogether positions us well for continued market outperformance. With that, I'll turn the call to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook.\nNeil Dougherty: Thank you, Satish, and hello, everyone. We delivered solid financial performance in Q3. Revenue of $1.382 billion was just above the midpoint of our guidance range, flat year-over-year and up 1% on a core basis. Orders of $1.244 billion declined 15% on a reported and core basis. We ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in backlog. Turning to our operational results for Q3. We reported gross margin of 66% and operating expenses of $478 million, resulting in record operating margin of 31%. We achieved net income of $393 million and delivered record earnings at $2.19 per share. Our weighted-average share count for the quarter was 179 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated revenue of $918 million, down 5% on a reported and core basis. Commercial Communications revenue of $611 million declined 12%, while aerospace, defense and government revenue of $307 million was up 11%, driven by increasing defense budgets worldwide and investments in technology modernization. Altogether, CSG delivered gross margin of 68% and record operating margin of 30%. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated record revenue of $464 million, up 14% or 15% on a core basis with double-digit revenue growth in automotive, general electronics, and semiconductor. EISG reported gross margin of 62% and operating margin of 34%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our third quarter with $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generated cash-flow from operations of $241 million and free cash flow of $196 million or 14% of revenue. Share repurchases this quarter totaled approximately 930,000 shares at an average share price of $162 for a total consideration of $151 million. Now with regard to our outlook. Exiting the quarter and as Satish mentioned, the demand environment was mixed with areas of stability and growth partially offsetting pockets of incremental softening. In addition, the composition of our order mix has changed over the past year. Our ability to deliver differentiated solutions and innovate at the pace of our customers has resulted in meaningful growth and strategic long-term customer commitments, which will deliver high-quality revenue over multi year periods. These commitments were approximately 2% of orders in Q3 year-to-date last year and are approximately 8% of orders year-to-date this year. Turning to our fourth quarter guidance, which incorporates these factors, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.290 billion to $1.310 billion. Full-year revenue at the midpoint of our guidance is $5.5 billion, representing 1% growth. We expect Q4 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.83 to $1.89 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 179 million shares. Full year earnings per share at the midpoint of our guidance is $8.19, representing 7% growth. As we look to next year with the capitalization of R&D, the pending increase in the guilty tax-rate on offshore earnings, and efforts by the OECD to establish a global corporate minimum tax rate of 15%, we now estimate that our non-GAAP tax rate beginning in fiscal year 2024 will be in the range of 15% to 17%. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.\nJason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Cole, please give the directions for the Q&A.\nOperator: Of course [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\nSamik Chatterjee: Yeah. Hi, so many thanks for taking my question. Hi, Satish. Can you hear me?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. We can hear you.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Can you hear me? Yes. Hi.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. We can hear you,\nSamik Chatterjee: So, if we can start with EISG where you said demand trends or order trends are stable. Maybe if you can sort of dig into that a bit more because there have been concerns given that the smartphone ecosystem still remains really sort of below average in terms of demand that there could be further weakness there. What are you seeing in terms of wireless versus wireline, particularly interested in understanding if you're seeing any demand uplift from all the uptakes in the AI applications on the wireline side? Just maybe dive into that a bit more. And I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Sure, Samik. Let me just start by saying, the Keysight team executed very well under these conditions, and you see that reflected in the strong quarter and year-to-date performance. Based on our guide we expect to deliver 7% EPS growth for the year, on 1% revenue and we're maintaining solid profitability. So that's sort of the baseline. And then when we looked at the orders, obviously the orders were down 10% year-over-year in Q2, and when you look at our orders right now for the quarter that we reported, were down 15%. A big part of that decline year-over-year came from our Greater China operations which were associated with the slowdown in production, which impacted the EISG business which was actually holding up pretty well till the first half. And we expect that this dynamic to last a few more quarters, again, we think it's transient. And I want to stress that based on all of the customer engagements, including the fabs that we engage with, they continue to believe that this is a temporary situation that is playing out. Now I also want to sort of elevate this to a regional perspective, because it will get at the core of your question. Our Americas business grew this quarter on top of a record Q3 a year ago, and Europe was stable driven by strength in EV and AV. And again, I'll go back next to the segment perspective, commercial communications continued to be stable, and I'll get a little bit into the different segments. Aerospace and Defense grew, and EISG, as I mentioned before, incrementally declined. From a commercial communications perspective, 5G investments in R&D continued to be stable. And what was driving some of that is, yes, we still are yet to see any uptick in the manufacturing business associated with the components and that's correlated with your smartphone -- declines in the smartphone -- in general smartphone volumes. But I think the driver here is the premiumization of the smartphone market, right? And that is really resulting in those customers that have better than expected performance or earnings improvements have actually come back and pulled the trigger on investments with regard to their innovation needs in R&D. And this is again reconfirmation of some of our base-case thinking that the R&D investments are much more robust and our customers don't want to get behind. On the wireline side, the dynamics were influenced by AI as a number of hyperscalers are starting to look at the AI through the lens of AI their investments in data center. We started to see some uptick in investments in 800 gig, again, very preliminary, I don't want to draw too far conclusions, one quarter doesn't make a trend, but the stability two quarters in a row, we're quite encouraged by that given the economics. And I also think the breadth of Keysight's portfolio and the contributions we're making end-to-end to the communications ecosystem is enabling us to outperform. I would say our Network and Security business or Network and Application Security business, which was formerly Ixia business has also been holding up pretty well through the year and I believe we're continuing to take share. I'll wait for the second part of your question.\nSamik Chatterjee: Yes, please. Thank you. Thanks for that. For -- relatively sort of again thinking in relation to orders and if orders -- sort of your thoughts on what orders -- what we need to see in terms of orders going into next year for Keysight to be able to get back to the long-term growth outlook that you have on the revenue side, particularly in relation to, I think, historically, your orders and revenues have been pretty tightly correlated. So how you're thinking about what you need in terms of orders? And maybe one thing to clarify is, I didn't really fully comprehend the implication of what Neil is mentioning in terms of more long-term strategic orders from your customers. Is that necessarily a divergence between sort of what you would see on order trends versus that translating into revenue next year? Any thoughts on that, please?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Well, I'll just make some high-level comments. First is, the successes we are having in this environment is a function of execution, but also a function of the breadth of the company and all the different end markets we serve. Obviously, we don't control the macro, but we're able to figure out where there is strengths and we're able to maximize, such as in aerospace, defense and automotive with AV and EV, which is going through a bit of an uptick in the market and we're able to capitalize on that and outperform. I'll just let Neil speak about the guide and the comments he made about our system integration business and associated revenue implications there.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. Hi, Thanks, Samik. Yes, so as you think about orders, obviously, through the first quarters of this year, we've been able to run revenues at a level that was materially higher than the incoming order rate as we work through some of the backlog that we built up over the COVID period of time and then the supply-chain disruptions of the last 12 to 18 months. And as we look-forward, we've seen this degradation in the demand environment this quarter that is going to put some pressure on orders as we move into Q4 and likely into Q1. And so, our ability to continue to drive revenue based on backlog is becoming incrementally challenging, right? We've burnt about $300 million -- burnt through about $300 million of backlog so far this year, that's the rate at which revenues have outpaced orders. And then I talk about this change in mix towards longer-dated system, so it is a small portion of our business, which we haven't talked about much because it's been consistently less than 5% where we're working on larger-scale strategic programs that are delivered over an extended period of time to our customers. And we view it as very positive that our customers are continuing to invest in those kinds of projects, that portion of our business was roughly 2% of orders through three quarters last year, it's about 8% of orders through three quarters this year. And what that essentially means is an addition to the $300 million we -- a backlog we burnt, we've taken another $200 million of short-dated backlog and turned it into long-dated backlog. And so, as you think about our guidance for Q4, it's essentially built on the scheduled backlog that we have set to deliver into the -- into next quarter, and our own view of orders for the coming quarter and our ability to turn a portion of those orders into revenue within Q4.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Samik, I think just to add to what Neil said, this $200 million that Neil referenced roughly, these are high-quality customers making long-range commitments, further validating our strategy with them. And these are -- you can think of them as large aerospace defense companies that are looking towards -- looking to us to provide more comprehensive solutions and systems. And in the automotive application, especially with regard to EV and AV, we're offering total solutions, including power management and software for workflow automation and all of those take time for us to complete those projects in tandem with their bring-ups of their gigafactory. So they're highly coordinated, highly strategic to the customers. And I view this as giving us a further penetration with new applications supporting our long-term growth rate.\nSamik Chatterjee: Got it. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Samik.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is now open.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. And two for me. Just as a follow-up to your commentary to the prior question. I just wanted to get a better understanding, especially in terms of backlog normalization, it's good to hear of strategic orders longer-term and the inherent business is also driven by some of the R&D projects. And in that context, should we assume that backlog normalization is into full gear? And then your backlog could remain in a level that would start with a two-zip code? And I'm not asking for order guide, but I just want to better understand how you see the post-COVID normalization of backlog is trending against some of the pluses and minuses in various parts of the business. And I have a follow-up.\nNeil Dougherty: Yeah, Mehdi, I think that's largely correct, right. I've talked over the past year about the fact that we felt like we had built -- excuse me $400 million to $500 million what I call abnormal backlog. And as I just stated, we burnt through $300 million of that through three quarters of this year and then we've essentially converted another $200 million of essentially short-dated turns backlog into backlog for these long-dated programs. So I view that we've materially worked through that abnormal backlog at this point and I don't think it's unrealistic to assume that in this environment our kind of normalized backlog level will have a two handle on it.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: I also thank Mehdi to the point I think you're alluding to is software and services, we continue to be stronger even in this environment for us, again reflecting the strength of our customer relationships. And so the deferred balance is also a factor that is elevated that leads to the two zip-code calculation you have.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay, great. And my follow-up has to do with the semi-mix. I think you mentioned that the semi-bookings or new orders were weak in the quarter. Is that due to the delayed ramp of tape-outs for 3 nanometers? And if that's the case, should we assume a rebound in semi-related orders as we start with the new fiscal year, fiscal year 2024?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes, Mehdi, I think what you've probably seen public announcements from major fabs around pulling back of wafer capacity, so some of the investments associated with our parametric test systems, which typically feed the fabs have been pulled back, especially around legacy technologies and memory applications. So as that rebounds, you can expect that capacity to rebound. Again, this is an area where we have good customer visibility given long-standing relationships that we have had. But it's also a tale of two words because the same customer base is focused with us relentlessly about the advanced node development, about new application areas such as silicon photonics which in today's world translates to AI. And we also have another business that we've talked about in the past around making interferometer systems for two nanometer sort of technologies. And there, there is no change in demand because we are working with customers on enabling this technology. So, yeah, there is a pullback in the near term. But again, I want to stress this is temporary and transient.\nMehdi Hosseini: I just want to understand would increase 3-nanometer tape-out next year have a positive impact for your semi-business?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: I'll have Mark Wallace take that.\nMark Wallace: Yeah. Hi, Mehdi. What I can say is that despite the pullback in the short-term, the engagement with our customers on advanced process technologies, including 3-nanometer, 4-nanometer, 2-nanometer have continued. And many of these customers are looking at a variety of aspects of their market as well as managing their financials. A couple of examples, one is we have a customer in the US that has delayed some of the fab build-out because of construction issues. So we expect that to -- we will correct itself in the next couple of quarters. We have another customer, again, working on these advanced node sizes and technologies, who has locations in the US and in Asia, and they're maintaining their total project plan and investment, but spreading the CapEx over several quarters. And there's a lot of those stories. So, it really feels to me like we are going through a phase of pullback. But the answer to your question is, yes, we expect this to positively impact our business in 2024.\nMehdi Hosseini: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. And Neil, I apologize to go back to this. But I want to be clear, what I'm hearing from you guys is that, it sounds like Neil you believe that backlog coming out of this quarter is basically near normalized levels in your opinion. And I guess what I'm really asking is that if I look back over the past couple of years appreciating that there is some variables with COVID and everything else involved. But it looks like seasonally, you typically see a sequential increase in your order growth in fiscal 4Q. I guess, as I look at that, are you expecting sequential or how would you characterize seasonal growth in orders? Or maybe rather discussing on a book-to-bill basis, embedded in your expectation for the fiscal fourth quarter at this point? I apologize for the confusing question, but I'm just trying to understand how you're seeing order growth and backlog.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. No, it's a fair question. So first off, do we believe backlog has normalized, and I'd say the answer to that is largely, yes. We believe backlog has normalized at this point. With regard to incoming order rates and seasonality, you're absolutely correct. We typically see a pretty sizable increase as we move from Q3 to Q4 at the end of our fiscal year and what I would say is, we do expect orders to be up sequentially from Q3 to Q4. But we expect a significantly smaller sequential increase than would be typical based on weakness of the funnel that materialized during the third quarter.\nAaron Rakers: That's fair. So a book-to-bill improvement from this level is basically what you're alluding to?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. I mean, I guess, I would think of it as with backlog having normalized, we would expect orders and revenue to start to converge.\nAaron Rakers: Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess as a quick follow-up, just maybe the opportunity to ask you about the ESI acquisition. How do we think about that as far as the strategic positioning and what expectations or kind of targets we should be thinking about as far as that acquisition folding into the financial story as we move forward?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: So let me take that, and Neil if you have anything to add, you could. First of all, I would say, it's a great strategic fit, one we're very excited about. I think you've heard me describe the system simulation and emulation opportunity as a near adjacency to the work that we do with customers, especially as we have focused the strategy on engaging with customers early and in their R&D workflows. So the addition of ESI really is a great fit there. Financially, it's accretive to our gross margins, it will be when we close the transaction. And we also think it will be accretive to our [SOFR] (ph) percentage by at least two points at the company level. And from a cultural perspective, I think it's very important as well. ESI is a company that's been around for 50 years and has been involved in some of the most complex simulations associated with crash testing and other areas. And I think with the -- by coming into Keysight and what's exciting is the combination of that can now not only provide go-to-market capabilities that can further accelerate growth but also engage with customers in new applications in aerospace, defense and other end-markets leveraging the deep technology expertise of ESI. So very excited by this transaction as we announced it. Thank you.\nAaron Rakers: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Thank you. Wondering if the shift to the longer-term orders is that driven by things that you're doing internally or is this just a function of the demand that you're seeing from these large aerospace and defense and auto OEMs?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I think some of it is the implementation of our solutions approach to what was otherwise markets that we had maybe sort of purely through the lens of products historically. I think of aerospace, defense, David, as an industry, where we largely sold instrumentation tools. And over the past few years, we've put focused effort to adding more value to the customer base by integrating the instruments, but also layering on software and creating more services opportunities. So some of it is a function of the go-to-market push that we've had, but also equally the acceleration in demand we see in specific areas such as automotive. And I'll have Mark maybe give you a couple of more examples to make a drill.\nMark Wallace: Well, it might be just better -- just to lay it out, because it's hard to imagine these. But these are very strategic, very complex engagements with customers. So if we think about an EV or a battery test lab, you're talking about multiple racks of equipment for testing cells and modules and packs, there's battery cyclers, there's low voltage interfaces for communication, there's a chiller to cool the batteries, then there's environmental chambers, their safety aspects, fixturing software, project management, installation, site prepping very, very complex business. And then the other thing that's really exciting for us is, this gets us deeper into the customer's business. As we announced in Q2 we won two new OEM sites, in Q2, we won another one in Q3. And over that last three months, we have now through the deeper visibility engagement across the R&D labs have uncovered many other opportunities within those customers and across the ecosystem. So it also has an additive effect in terms of finding new opportunities to contribute. So that's a typical example of why it takes longer.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Thank you. Thank you for that. And then just on the fourth-quarter guidance, I think the kind of implied incremental margin is quite high. Is there something unusual about the margins in the fourth quarter this year?\nNeil Dougherty: No, I mean, I think, obviously as I've got the Q4 numbers in front of me. We typically see some uptick in OpEx as we move from Q3 to Q4, various factors. But I'd start with the fact that in Q3, significant portions of population on summer holiday, spending less money as a result, and as they come back here into the fourth quarter, we tend to see a pickup. We do expect a little bit of a sequential decline in gross margin and a lot of that driven by the implied volume reduction as well as kind of how we're getting to the numbers.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Got it, okay. Thank you very much.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nMatthew Niknam: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the question. So, A, I guess, I wanted to just figure out relative to the order level we're at now, I know it sounds like we're going to get a maybe lower than seasonal bump in fiscal 4Q. But it sounded as though this may persist for a couple of quarters, at least based on current visibility. And so, what I'm wondering is, if we sort of stay at this $1.25 billion $1.3 billion range and we work through excess backlog, is it -- and I don't want to jump the gun on fiscal 2024. But what I'm effectively getting at is, I don't think it's hard to see a pathway to maybe more negative or slightly negative growth next year. So I just want to make sure that -- if that maybe sounds reasonable. And then just maybe, secondly, as we think about the EPS growth outlook, obviously you're facing a pretty sizable headwind it seems like from tax rate. And so, I'm curious just if there's any color you can add in terms of the margin structure and your ability to maybe effectively flux some of the margin upside that you've showcased in the past around COVID in the times of topline pressure. So, long-winded question, but any color you can provide would be helpful. Thanks.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. So, obviously, we'll give you more color on FY 2024 here in three months. But obviously, we spent a fair amount of time thinking through it ourselves. And as you noted and as I've noted, through the first three quarters of FY 2023, we were able to drive revenue at a level that was significantly above the incoming order rate. As a result, we're going to have some difficult revenue comps as we enter 2024. As I'm thinking about the transition from Q4 into Q1, at least right now, I'm thinking about kind of the typical seasonal decline that we would see on the revenue line as we move from one period to the next. And then I think as we look forward beyond that right now, we don't see a catalyst right now that is going to drive a significant market recovery in the first half of the year. But I think we're looking to a recovery in the second half of the year because as Satish has said, we believe that much of what's impacting our markets at this point is temporary in nature, right? Our commercial communications customers are going to work through their inventory challenges, the major investments that we're seeing in fab capacity they've been delayed, but they're still moving forward and that includes investment for the insurance of supply for 2 and 3-nanometer, silicon photonics, silicon carbide, all of that stuff is moving forward. And on the technology side, their R&D investments continue, right? We're going to see additional standards releases for 5G, continued investments in 6G research, AI, quantum, AV, EV, all of that stuff is moving forward. With regard to EPS outlook again, tough, tough, tough revenue comps, but we're a disciplined organization, the flexible business model you've seen that in the results that we published year-to-date. I think going forward the challenge for us is to maintain balance, right? We're optimistic about the long-term, we're going to continue with the investments that are going to enable us to fully participate in the recovery when it happens, while at the same time relying on our discipline to drive EPS growth. We're certainly working to offset whatever tax impacts we can, but as you noted, the tax impacts are significant.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Just I want to also add that, you've seen us -- Matt, you've seen us stay disciplined and I think at the beginning of the year I did reference that we will be accelerating some of the synergy work that we were starting to plan for anyway and we've executed on that very well. And you can see year-to-date, our OpEx has been flat, even accounting for a lot of the inflation environments. So as we invest in these next-generation technologies that have high customer validation and we know will position the company to outperform over the medium-to-long term, we're also remaining prudent and disciplined towards the macro situation in the short term.\nMatthew Niknam: That's great. Thank you, both.\nOperator: Thank you, Matthew. Our next question is from Chris Snyder with UBS. Your line is now open.\nChris Snyder: Thank you. So, I very much appreciate that the softer orders and the backlog burn is leading to the softer sequential revenue from Q3 to Q4. But I wanted to ask about the sequential margins. It seems like the guide puts margins maybe in the mid-28, so down 250, 300 or so basis points year-on-year -- sorry, sequentially. So looking at 80% sequential decremental, it seems very steep. Can you just maybe talk through why that margin fall off is so sharp sequentially? Thank you.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. I mean, I'm not showing a quite as strong on my -- as I'm looking at my pages, you might want to -- with more time you might find it's not as steep as you're calculating at the moment. And I think I've highlighted the factors, we are expecting our gross margins to be down sequentially, Q3 to Q4, again volume dropping a significant portion of that. We did have -- in our Q3 numbers, we did have about $0.03 of kind of one-time effect spread across OpEx and gross margin, mostly related to some favorable one-time impacts with our health care plans. That's not expected to repeat. And then, again, we're looking at typical sequential increases in OpEx as we move from Q3 to Q4.\nChris Snyder: I appreciate that. Thank you. And then I appreciate the guide on the tax next year for the non-GAAP 15% to 17%. I just wanted to -- I guess maybe a housekeeping one. Is there any change in the cash tax rate when we think about 2024 versus 2023? Thank you.\nNeil Dougherty: It's a little bit too early to tell, that's why I still have a range, I'll expect to tighten up that range on rate here in three months. Outside of even the things that I listed, one of the things that could impact cash taxes is this move towards the corporate [indiscernible] tax which will go into effect for us next fiscal year. So, right now, too early to tell. I'll make some comments in a quarter, I'll be better able to address that.\nChris Snyder: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Your line is now open.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hey, good afternoon, guys. The revenue guidance for Q4 of minus 10% at the midpoint, do you see both segments down? Can you just help us on how that plays out between the segments?\nNeil Dougherty: Just give me one second here. Yes. We certainly see -- I mean, we certainly see declines across both segments, which obviously for EISG, which has grown revenues pretty significantly through all three -- through the first three quarters of the year is a significant change. But we do see revenues down similar levels across both segments.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay, helpful. And then in aerospace and defense, can you talk at all about the outlook there? It's been a well-timed acceleration offsetting some weakness in communication. Just wondering if the aerospace and defense can stay as strong.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I think the -- if you look at the security environment around the world, there is no doubt that the defense budgets are getting bipartisan priorities in the US. Look at Japan, it also put out doubling of defense spend in the next five years. Europe raising defense spend and security spend as well. So I think this is a business, as we've always said, harder to call on a quarterly basis, but very easy to look at the long-term trend. And our goal is to continue to outperform it. So we expect Q4 to be seasonally strong generally with the end-of-the-year sort of budgets that come open.\nAdam Thalhimer: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thanks. Maybe first question for me, you guys have talked about a lot of new kind of extension areas that you're seeing traction, and particularly on the AI side. With the flat OpEx that you've noted, just wanted to get a sense of how you're making sure of kind of touch base with some other new customers that might be entering into this space or how you're finding better leverage through channels. And then as a second question, just as a reminder on the Communications Group, can you just kind of lay out what you would consider as kind of rough percentages of kind of maintenance standard, so 4G you're kind of existing 5G versus kind of the next-Gen portfolio. Thanks.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I would say we're preserving our R&D investments, so we can outperform the market -- continue to outperform the market as it rebounds in the medium-term to long-term, which we fully expect it to. With regard to AI, a lot of our customers are launching AI projects in their own way, whether it's in silicon or in the networking side. And so, there is a considerable channel leverage there for AI. Clearly, the move to 800-gig ethernet that I referenced with higher interface capacity, higher bandwidth, lower power per bit, all of this are plays to our strength and our leadership there is helping us pick up some orders and set ourselves up as this business scales that we expect it to. With regard to the comms segment, and commercial communications, three dynamics, right? I would say deployments are continuing to scale. Second, globally and as that scales the business there grows. Second one, it's really the standards progression, I would think of Release 17 new use cases are driving customer need. And then the research activities around the world around, I call it beyond 5G because it's too easy to -- too early to call it 6G yet because there's the standard. But beyond 5G that exploration is proliferating and I think it fits our strategy to address the R&D customer.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nMark Delaney: Yes. Thank you for taking the questions. Follow-up question as it relates to 800-G ethernet and some of the AI activity you're seeing. You mentioned some orders already on that front, but you described it is still in the relatively early phases. Do you have a sense of when 800-G orders related to AI or are there reasons 800-G may become more meaningful?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I think it's hard to put a timing there, but we've seen this sort of overlapping waves of technology really be the basis of our strategy, Mark. And having that exposure to both wireless and wireline is a core strength for the company and we're seeing that play out, even today, the diversity of applications that we pursue. I would say that the 800-gig ethernet abilities -- ability to be first-to-market have that capability is definitely helping us now win some early engagements which should set us up well as that industry scales. As the hyperscalers are coming out of the economic situation in their business and as they're starting to upgrade, they are looking at 800-gig ethernet for some of those technical reasons I just mentioned.\nMark Delaney: That's helpful, Satish. Thank you. And then on the ESI acquisition you made some comments already that were helpful, including the gross margin accretion. I apologize if I missed this. But can you talk a little bit more in terms of what it may mean in terms of EPS contribution when it's integrated and how is that progressing over time? Thank you.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. Obviously, this is Neil. We do expect that there's some complexities of doing a public deal in France, it takes a little bit longer than typical to get the deal fully closed, and for us to then, therefore, begin to start realizing the G&A synergies that we typically rely heavily on to drive EPS. But I think first and foremost, this is a business that we feel like we can grow pretty aggressively with obviously strong software-like margins, we can via the significant breadth and reach of our sales force to get them access to new market participants and then heavily leverage our G&A, our highly offshored low-cost G&A infrastructure to drive significant margin expansion for the business and ultimately drive EPS growth.\nMark Delaney: Got it. Thank you.\nNeil Dougherty: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rob Mason with Baird. Your line is now open.\nRob Mason: Yes, good evening. I wanted to go back to the conversation around these more strategic longer-dated orders. I'm not sure that I still fully understand what the ship schedule or revenue recognition timing would look like on those. And I'm just curious, as well as those have been booked into orders. Have you widened or changed the order booking policy around kind of shippable in next six months around those timing?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I would say -- yes. Thank you. I would say, again, this is a very small part of our business historically, so we've never had to speak about it. As a function of the lower order levels today, the presentation appears higher. But I'd -- so no change to our order acceptance policy, other than these are complex systems which requires a start work today by inventory and staff people to deliver to our customers. So they are on the books for the right reasons. They're high-quality deals that we feel good about.\nNeil Dougherty: Generally uncancelable without significant penalty would be the last part of that I would make. And from a delivery schedule, you could think of them certainly beyond six months or they'd be within the standard, but you can think of it as in the case of a lot of the aerospace defense kind of 12 months, some of the auto ones are 18 months or more because they tend to be even longer types of programs for us to deliver. So as we mentioned in the prepared comments, some of these deals are scheduled for revenue recognition out in 2025 upon delivery of the complete project to the customer.\nRob Mason: Understood. And just as a follow-up. Satish, the -- certainly ESI Group, certainly makes sense from the standpoint of moving upstream and staying very close to R&D and into simulation. But I'm just curious how do you think about the opportunity set beyond kind of core electrical engineering customer base, this is around more physical test. Do you start to -- it was ESI unique in that regard or do you start to look more broadly at things outside of electrical engineering test?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yeah, Definitely, the -- when we look at the entire system simulation emulation opportunities, what you really need is the ability to simulate very complex interactions or physical electrical and software capabilities. So again placed to the system strength that the company has, so having these assets in the company will allow us to identify new use cases and serve them differentially which I think puts us in a very unique spot given our entire portfolio and test now mirror it with the strengthening portfolio and design. I think we see this as a very unique positioning for the company, one that aligns with our software-centric transformation that we've been on. I also think that being a European asset, obviously a French asset has been in France, there is more opportunity with our US base of customers to really focus this go-to-market motion and accelerate growth and create greater value.\nMark Wallace: I would just add one thing to the exciting part is the alignment to the verticals, automotive, aerospace, defense, it's broadening our footprint and broadening our value to these important customers.\nRob Mason: Very good.\nOperator: Our next question is from Atif Malik with Citi Research. Your line is now open.\nAdrienne Colby: Hi, it's Adrienne Colby for Atif Malik. Thank you for the question. I wanted to ask a clarifying question on orders, you had commented that the 15% decline in overall orders was heavily influenced by China. Just hoping you could clarify what you saw in the Americas and Europe if you were seeing improvements in the rate of year-over-year declines there?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I think I've mentioned -- Adrienne, hi, a good question. Our Americas business grew quarter-over-quarter -- in Q3, and Europe was stable.\nAdrienne Colby: And sorry, was that sequentially or year-over-year?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Year-over-year.\nAdrienne Colby: Thank you. And then I just wanted to ask with regards to the long-term strategic multiyear engagements, you've been speaking about. Can you comment on how much of the growth in orders is a factor of up-selling or expanding some of the existing agreements versus new agreements? Just trying to get a sense of the number of customers that are falling into this category, if that's growing.\nMark Wallace: Yes, Adrienne. I think it's a combination, as I mentioned before, these strategic first-time wins with the automotive OEMs into themselves are long-dated and enlarged. And through the process, we work with the customers to up-sell and cross-sell capabilities and then get more visibility across other parts of the groups as they're oftentimes organized or across the ecosystem as well. So I think the way to think about it in its simple terms is these longer-term programs are about as strategic as we can get with our customers. So it opens up new opportunities to sell, including software and other aspects of delivering value services, et cetera. So we're excited about it and we're looking forward to continuing to deliver through these vehicles.\nAdrienne Colby: Thank you.\nNeil Dougherty: Thank you, Adrienne.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the call back to Jason Kary for any closing comments.\nJason Kary: Hey, thanks, Cole. And thanks everyone for joining us. I'm going to turn it over to Satish for a few closing comments and then we'll wrap up the call.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes, thank you very much. I know we discussed quite a bit today, but I want to leave you with some -- few important takeaways. First, we're executing very well, maximizing our performance in the near-term and we're tracking to deliver 7% EPS growth with 1% revenue growth this year. Solid profitability in the business and you should take that away. Second, we have strong differentiated portfolio that's aligned with multiple end markets and customer priorities and this will continue to enable us to outperform, both in the near-term and will go stronger as market conditions change. You see the differentiation in our portfolio reflected in our ability to maintain strong gross margins in our business in these conditions. Third, we have a strong balance sheet, strong cash position, and we remain confident in our free cash flow generation capabilities in the business, and we will continue to maintain the balanced capital allocation approach that we described at Investor Day. Fourth, we have a proven operating model with a highly flexible cost structure, and which has been proven before and will continue to play out as we had projected as well. Fifth, we have a seasoned management team here that has experience in the business for decades, and will continue to remain proactive and balanced in navigating this environment and you've seen us do this already this year. Finally, I want to remind everyone that we remain incredibly confident and excited about the favorable long-term secular trends that are underpinnings of our growth strategy. This is around the next-generation technology waves, new addressable customers and industries, and R&D investment wave across multiple end-markets. We are focused on positioning the company to grow and emerge from this environment, stronger. Thank you very much for joining us today. I'll hand this back to Jason.\nJason Kary: Thank you. Satish. And that concludes our comments today. Have a great day.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect your line.",

            "name": "Mark Wallace",
            "content": "Yeah. Hi, Mehdi. What I can say is that despite the pullback in the short-term, the engagement with our customers on advanced process technologies, including 3-nanometer, 4-nanometer, 2-nanometer have continued. And many of these customers are looking at a variety of aspects of their market as well as managing their financials. A couple of examples, one is we have a customer in the US that has delayed some of the fab build-out because of construction issues. So we expect that to -- we will correct itself in the next couple of quarters. We have another customer, again, working on these advanced node sizes and technologies, who has locations in the US and in Asia, and they're maintaining their total project plan and investment, but spreading the CapEx over several quarters. And there's a lot of those stories. So, it really feels to me like we are going through a phase of pullback. But the answer to your question is, yes, we expect this to positively impact our business in 2024. Well, it might be just better -- just to lay it out, because it's hard to imagine these. But these are very strategic, very complex engagements with customers. So if we think about an EV or a battery test lab, you're talking about multiple racks of equipment for testing cells and modules and packs, there's battery cyclers, there's low voltage interfaces for communication, there's a chiller to cool the batteries, then there's environmental chambers, their safety aspects, fixturing software, project management, installation, site prepping very, very complex business.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Neil Dougherty",
            "content": "Thank you, Satish, and hello, everyone. We delivered solid financial performance in Q3. Revenue of $1.382 billion was just above the midpoint of our guidance range, flat year-over-year and up 1% on a core basis. Orders of $1.244 billion declined 15% on a reported and core basis. We ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in backlog. Turning to our operational results for Q3. We reported gross margin of 66% and operating expenses of $478 million, resulting in record operating margin of 31%. We achieved net income of $393 million and delivered record earnings at $2.19 per share. Our weighted-average share count for the quarter was 179 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated revenue of $918 million, down 5% on a reported and core basis. Commercial Communications revenue of $611 million declined 12%, while aerospace, defense and government revenue of $307 million was up 11%, driven by increasing defense budgets worldwide and investments in technology modernization. Altogether, CSG delivered gross margin of 68% and record operating margin of 30%. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated record revenue of $464 million, up 14% or 15% on a core basis with double-digit revenue growth in automotive, general electronics, and semiconductor. EISG reported gross margin of 62% and operating margin of 34%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our third quarter with $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generated cash-flow from operations of $241 million and free cash flow of $196 million or 14% of revenue. Share repurchases this quarter totaled approximately 930,000 shares at an average share price of $162 for a total consideration of $151 million. Now with regard to our outlook. Exiting the quarter and as Satish mentioned, the demand environment was mixed with areas of stability and growth partially offsetting pockets of incremental softening. In addition, the composition of our order mix has changed over the past year. Our ability to deliver differentiated solutions and innovate at the pace of our customers has resulted in meaningful growth and strategic long-term customer commitments, which will deliver high-quality revenue over multi year periods. These commitments were approximately 2% of orders in Q3 year-to-date last year and are approximately 8% of orders year-to-date this year. Turning to our fourth quarter guidance, which incorporates these factors, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.290 billion to $1.310 billion. Full-year revenue at the midpoint of our guidance is $5.5 billion, representing 1% growth. We expect Q4 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.83 to $1.89 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 179 million shares. Full year earnings per share at the midpoint of our guidance is $8.19, representing 7% growth. As we look to next year with the capitalization of R&D, the pending increase in the guilty tax-rate on offshore earnings, and efforts by the OECD to establish a global corporate minimum tax rate of 15%, we now estimate that our non-GAAP tax rate beginning in fiscal year 2024 will be in the range of 15% to 17%. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A. Yes. Hi, Thanks, Samik. Yes, so as you think about orders, obviously, through the first quarters of this year, we've been able to run revenues at a level that was materially higher than the incoming order rate as we work through some of the backlog that we built up over the COVID period of time and then the supply-chain disruptions of the last 12 to 18 months. And as we look-forward, we've seen this degradation in the demand environment this quarter that is going to put some pressure on orders as we move into Q4 and likely into Q1. And so, our ability to continue to drive revenue based on backlog is becoming incrementally challenging, right? We've burnt about $300 million -- burnt through about $300 million of backlog so far this year, that's the rate at which revenues have outpaced orders. And then I talk about this change in mix towards longer-dated system, so it is a small portion of our business, which we haven't talked about much because it's been consistently less than 5% where we're working on larger-scale strategic programs that are delivered over an extended period of time to our customers. And we view it as very positive that our customers are continuing to invest in those kinds of projects, that portion of our business was roughly 2% of orders through three quarters last year, it's about 8% of orders through three quarters this year. And what that essentially means is an addition to the $300 million we -- a backlog we burnt, we've taken another $200 million of short-dated backlog and turned it into long-dated backlog. And so, as you think about our guidance for Q4, it's essentially built on the scheduled backlog that we have set to deliver into the -- into next quarter, and our own view of orders for the coming quarter and our ability to turn a portion of those orders into revenue within Q4. Yeah, Mehdi, I think that's largely correct, right. I've talked over the past year about the fact that we felt like we had built -- excuse me $400 million to $500 million what I call abnormal backlog. And as I just stated, we burnt through $300 million of that through three quarters of this year and then we've essentially converted another $200 million of essentially short-dated turns backlog into backlog for these long-dated programs. So I view that we've materially worked through that abnormal backlog at this point and I don't think it's unrealistic to assume that in this environment our kind of normalized backlog level will have a two handle on it. Yes. No, it's a fair question. So first off, do we believe backlog has normalized, and I'd say the answer to that is largely, yes. We believe backlog has normalized at this point. With regard to incoming order rates and seasonality, you're absolutely correct. We typically see a pretty sizable increase as we move from Q3 to Q4 at the end of our fiscal year and what I would say is, we do expect orders to be up sequentially from Q3 to Q4. But we expect a significantly smaller sequential increase than would be typical based on weakness of the funnel that materialized during the third quarter. Yes. I mean, I guess, I would think of it as with backlog having normalized, we would expect orders and revenue to start to converge. No, I mean, I think, obviously as I've got the Q4 numbers in front of me. We typically see some uptick in OpEx as we move from Q3 to Q4, various factors. But I'd start with the fact that in Q3, significant portions of population on summer holiday, spending less money as a result, and as they come back here into the fourth quarter, we tend to see a pickup. We do expect a little bit of a sequential decline in gross margin and a lot of that driven by the implied volume reduction as well as kind of how we're getting to the numbers. Yes. So, obviously, we'll give you more color on FY 2024 here in three months. But obviously, we spent a fair amount of time thinking through it ourselves. And as you noted and as I've noted, through the first three quarters of FY 2023, we were able to drive revenue at a level that was significantly above the incoming order rate. As a result, we're going to have some difficult revenue comps as we enter 2024. As I'm thinking about the transition from Q4 into Q1, at least right now, I'm thinking about kind of the typical seasonal decline that we would see on the revenue line as we move from one period to the next. And then I think as we look forward beyond that right now, we don't see a catalyst right now that is going to drive a significant market recovery in the first half of the year. But I think we're looking to a recovery in the second half of the year because as Satish has said, we believe that much of what's impacting our markets at this point is temporary in nature, right? Our commercial communications customers are going to work through their inventory challenges, the major investments that we're seeing in fab capacity they've been delayed, but they're still moving forward and that includes investment for the insurance of supply for 2 and 3-nanometer, silicon photonics, silicon carbide, all of that stuff is moving forward. And on the technology side, their R&D investments continue, right? We're going to see additional standards releases for 5G, continued investments in 6G research, AI, quantum, AV, EV, all of that stuff is moving forward. With regard to EPS outlook again, tough, tough, tough revenue comps, but we're a disciplined organization, the flexible business model you've seen that in the results that we published year-to-date. I think going forward the challenge for us is to maintain balance, right? We're optimistic about the long-term, we're going to continue with the investments that are going to enable us to fully participate in the recovery when it happens, while at the same time relying on our discipline to drive EPS growth. We're certainly working to offset whatever tax impacts we can, but as you noted, the tax impacts are significant. Yes. I mean, I'm not showing a quite as strong on my -- as I'm looking at my pages, you might want to -- with more time you might find it's not as steep as you're calculating at the moment. And I think I've highlighted the factors, we are expecting our gross margins to be down sequentially, Q3 to Q4, again volume dropping a significant portion of that. We did have -- in our Q3 numbers, we did have about $0.03 of kind of one-time effect spread across OpEx and gross margin, mostly related to some favorable one-time impacts with our health care plans. That's not expected to repeat. And then, again, we're looking at typical sequential increases in OpEx as we move from Q3 to Q4. It's a little bit too early to tell, that's why I still have a range, I'll expect to tighten up that range on rate here in three months. Outside of even the things that I listed, one of the things that could impact cash taxes is this move towards the corporate [indiscernible] tax which will go into effect for us next fiscal year. So, right now, too early to tell. I'll make some comments in a quarter, I'll be better able to address that. Just give me one second here. Yes. We certainly see -- I mean, we certainly see declines across both segments, which obviously for EISG, which has grown revenues pretty significantly through all three -- through the first three quarters of the year is a significant change. But we do see revenues down similar levels across both segments. Yes. Obviously, this is Neil. We do expect that there's some complexities of doing a public deal in France, it takes a little bit longer than typical to get the deal fully closed, and for us to then, therefore, begin to start realizing the G&A synergies that we typically rely heavily on to drive EPS. But I think first and foremost, this is a business that we feel like we can grow pretty aggressively with obviously strong software-like margins, we can via the significant breadth and reach of our sales force to get them access to new market participants and then heavily leverage our G&A, our highly offshored low-cost G&A infrastructure to drive significant margin expansion for the business and ultimately drive EPS growth. Thank you. Generally uncancelable without significant penalty would be the last part of that I would make. And from a delivery schedule, you could think of them certainly beyond six months or they'd be within the standard, but you can think of it as in the case of a lot of the aerospace defense kind of 12 months, some of the auto ones are 18 months or more because they tend to be even longer types of programs for us to deliver. So as we mentioned in the prepared comments, some of these deals are scheduled for revenue recognition out in 2025 upon delivery of the complete project to the customer. Thank you, Adrienne."

            "name": "Satish Dhanasekaran",
            "content": "Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Keysight reported solid results in the third quarter, demonstrating the strength of our portfolio and the resilience of our financial model. We are executing on our strategy and delivering on our commitments to customers and shareholders in a challenging macro-environment. My comments today will focus on three key headlines. First, we delivered another quarter of strong financial performance demonstrating Keysight's diversified portfolio, strong execution, and operating discipline. Third quarter revenue was in-line with our expectations, while record earnings per share exceeded our guidance range. Second, while orders came in at the low end of our expectations, we saw positive and steady customer R&D spending and continued stability in commercial communications. Growth in aerospace, defense and government and growth in our automotive EV and AV solutions, partially offsetting incremental softness in EISG and Asia, primarily related to semiconductor and other manufacturing. This backdrop has tempered our near-term expectations for orders and revenue. We've factored this dynamic into our outlook for Q4, while now expecting full-year EPS growth of 7%. Third, despite the near-term challenges, Keysight's diversified business, differentiated solutions, and durable operating model give us confidence in our ability to capitalize on the long-term secular growth trends of our markets, as well as outperform in a variety of market conditions. Now let's take a deeper look at our third quarter results. While orders declined 15%, revenue of $1.38 billion was up 1% on a core basis and a record for the third quarter. Our differentiation and strong execution resulted in gross margin of 66% and record operating margin of 31%. We delivered $2.19 in earnings per share, which was an all-time high. Turning to the demand environment, we continue to see steady investment in strategic R&D programs in commercial communications, aerospace, defense and government and automotive EV solutions. In fact, over the past year, we've seen a meaningful growth in large long-term customer commitments related to strategic programs, particularly in automotive and ADG. We view this as an important validation of our strategy, it puts us in a strong position in key emerging technologies and positions us well for future growth. Demand was incrementally weaker in Asia this quarter as customers deferred manufacturing-related spending in semiconductor, general electronics, and automotive markets in many cases well into next year. Taken together, the increase in our customer strategic program investment combined with soft near-term demand environment is moderating revenue in the fourth quarter, which Neil will discuss in more detail. Turning to our business segments. Electronic Industrial Solutions Group revenue grew 14% to another quarterly record and the 12 consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. The strong financial performance was driven by double-digit growth across all markets and regions. EISG orders in the third quarter trended lower, particularly in semiconductor and manufacturing. Our customer engagements remain high as they're planned for, and continue to invest in key long-term strategic initiatives. In semiconductor, despite a near-term pullback in capital spending for wafer capacity, the industry is marching forward and planning for a strong future demand environment. In the near term, customers are prioritizing new applications such as silicon photonics to address the AI demand. As a result, this quarter we did see significant slowdown in our new wafer test solutions, while demand for Keysight's silicon photonics test and proprietary interferometer systems remained high. We expect these dynamics to continue over the next few quarters. In automotive, investments in EV and AV technologies continued to be strong. This quarter we secured a third strategic win with another large European OEM to supply an EV battery test system that includes our PathWave Lab automation software. This program will be implemented in 2025, and we're quite excited to be working with industry leaders and supporting their goals. To address customer needs for wireless tracking, diagnostics and connected vehicle communications, Keysight also announced support for automated RF testing for Autotalks' C-V2X chipsets on our PathWave Test Executive software platform. In general electronics, the growing collaboration between universities and companies is driving further investment in our solutions for advanced research. We're also expanding on our customer engagement in digital health solutions to support the growing digitalization and connectivity requirements of this industry. Turning to Communications Solutions Group, revenue declined 5%, while the overall stable demand environment continued quarter-to-quarter. Aerospace, defense, and government revenue grew 11% with strong demand from U.S. government and primes. Keysight's differentiated signal generation and threat scenario emulation capabilities led to a large U.S. Air Force contract in Q3. We also won a key contract from leading Canadian prime contractors for electromagnetic spectrum operation applications. In addition, the demand for our radar and defense modernization solutions grew robustly as prime contractors placed orders for systems that support their delivery goals in 2024 and beyond. Government research demand and investment in 5G and 6G continued as well. Commercial Communications revenue declined 12% due to cautious spending by customers and weaker manufacturing activity in smartphone, PC, and component supply chain. Customer engagements remained strong with R&D investments in key technology to support 5G and 6G AI/ML-driven high-speed datacenter networking and satellite communications. Demand for our wireline applications improved sequentially driven by cloud provider and hyperscaler investments as they designed their networks for AI and ML workloads. Enterprise customer and key service provider investment was steady, driven by increased digitization, heavier network loads, and rising cyber security concerns. In wireless, 5G standards are progressing and we saw steady R&D investment in Open RAN, satellite, non-terrestrial networks and 5G RedCap Release 17 capability targeted at industrial and IoT applications. Early 6G engagements continued this quarter. We enabled the University of Stuttgart to advance 6G integrated circuit research with our sub-Terahertz solutions. Keysight also led the agreement between the 6G-SANDBOX consortium and the European Space Agency to further research to integrate terrestrial 5G/6G technologies and satellite networks of the future. This quarter, we continued to strengthen our technology leadership in the industry and enable our customers' innovation. For example, we extended our flagship network analyzer portfolio by introducing industry's first integrated platform with vector component and analysis capabilities for power amplifier and component design applications. We also announced industry's most comprehensive multi-speed ethernet performance platform supporting data center interconnects up to 800 gigabit ethernet that are critical for data-intensive applications such as AI. And lastly, Keysight enabled 3GPP protocol conformance validation for Release 17 non-terrestrial networks and is continuing to partner with new satellite operators like Skylo to accelerate the deployment of satellite networks. Software and services remain an integral part of our solution strategy and again accounted for one third of total company revenue. Overall, software and services revenue grew year-over-year reflecting the continued expansion of our software-centric solutions. We remain confident in the long-term secular growth of software intensive R&D applications, particularly earlier in our customers' development process. In line with this trend and the software system simulation opportunity that I laid out at our March Investor Day, this quarter we announced our intent to acquire ESI Group, a leader in virtual prototyping solutions for the automotive and aerospace markets. The addition of ESI broadens our software capabilities into physical simulation and furthers our strategy of moving upstream into earlier stages of our customers' design cycles Keysight's technology leadership and deep collaboration with industry players remains a significant competitive advantage. Despite current macro uncertainty, we see continued investments in R&D driven by multiple waves of technology innovation and broad-based industrial digitalization and connectivity needs. While continuing to invest in these long-term secular growth trends, we remain disciplined and have driven incremental cost efficiencies throughout the organization this year. Our current guidance expectations are to finish the fiscal year 2023 with 7% EPS growth and 1% revenue growth. We believe this financial performance exemplifies the strength of Keysight's differentiated first-to-market solutions portfolio, our durable and resilient business model, and our winning culture which altogether positions us well for continued market outperformance. With that, I'll turn the call to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook. Yes. We can hear you. Yes. We can hear you, Sure, Samik. Let me just start by saying, the Keysight team executed very well under these conditions, and you see that reflected in the strong quarter and year-to-date performance. Based on our guide we expect to deliver 7% EPS growth for the year, on 1% revenue and we're maintaining solid profitability. So that's sort of the baseline. And then when we looked at the orders, obviously the orders were down 10% year-over-year in Q2, and when you look at our orders right now for the quarter that we reported, were down 15%. A big part of that decline year-over-year came from our Greater China operations which were associated with the slowdown in production, which impacted the EISG business which was actually holding up pretty well till the first half. And we expect that this dynamic to last a few more quarters, again, we think it's transient. And I want to stress that based on all of the customer engagements, including the fabs that we engage with, they continue to believe that this is a temporary situation that is playing out. Now I also want to sort of elevate this to a regional perspective, because it will get at the core of your question. Our Americas business grew this quarter on top of a record Q3 a year ago, and Europe was stable driven by strength in EV and AV. And again, I'll go back next to the segment perspective, commercial communications continued to be stable, and I'll get a little bit into the different segments. Aerospace and Defense grew, and EISG, as I mentioned before, incrementally declined. From a commercial communications perspective, 5G investments in R&D continued to be stable. And what was driving some of that is, yes, we still are yet to see any uptick in the manufacturing business associated with the components and that's correlated with your smartphone -- declines in the smartphone -- in general smartphone volumes. But I think the driver here is the premiumization of the smartphone market, right? And that is really resulting in those customers that have better than expected performance or earnings improvements have actually come back and pulled the trigger on investments with regard to their innovation needs in R&D. And this is again reconfirmation of some of our base-case thinking that the R&D investments are much more robust and our customers don't want to get behind. On the wireline side, the dynamics were influenced by AI as a number of hyperscalers are starting to look at the AI through the lens of AI their investments in data center. We started to see some uptick in investments in 800 gig, again, very preliminary, I don't want to draw too far conclusions, one quarter doesn't make a trend, but the stability two quarters in a row, we're quite encouraged by that given the economics. And I also think the breadth of Keysight's portfolio and the contributions we're making end-to-end to the communications ecosystem is enabling us to outperform. I would say our Network and Security business or Network and Application Security business, which was formerly Ixia business has also been holding up pretty well through the year and I believe we're continuing to take share. I'll wait for the second part of your question. Well, I'll just make some high-level comments. First is, the successes we are having in this environment is a function of execution, but also a function of the breadth of the company and all the different end markets we serve. Obviously, we don't control the macro, but we're able to figure out where there is strengths and we're able to maximize, such as in aerospace, defense and automotive with AV and EV, which is going through a bit of an uptick in the market and we're able to capitalize on that and outperform. I'll just let Neil speak about the guide and the comments he made about our system integration business and associated revenue implications there. Yes. Samik, I think just to add to what Neil said, this $200 million that Neil referenced roughly, these are high-quality customers making long-range commitments, further validating our strategy with them. And these are -- you can think of them as large aerospace defense companies that are looking towards -- looking to us to provide more comprehensive solutions and systems. And in the automotive application, especially with regard to EV and AV, we're offering total solutions, including power management and software for workflow automation and all of those take time for us to complete those projects in tandem with their bring-ups of their gigafactory. So they're highly coordinated, highly strategic to the customers. And I view this as giving us a further penetration with new applications supporting our long-term growth rate. Thank you, Samik. I also thank Mehdi to the point I think you're alluding to is software and services, we continue to be stronger even in this environment for us, again reflecting the strength of our customer relationships. And so the deferred balance is also a factor that is elevated that leads to the two zip-code calculation you have. Yes, Mehdi, I think what you've probably seen public announcements from major fabs around pulling back of wafer capacity, so some of the investments associated with our parametric test systems, which typically feed the fabs have been pulled back, especially around legacy technologies and memory applications. So as that rebounds, you can expect that capacity to rebound. Again, this is an area where we have good customer visibility given long-standing relationships that we have had. But it's also a tale of two words because the same customer base is focused with us relentlessly about the advanced node development, about new application areas such as silicon photonics which in today's world translates to AI. And we also have another business that we've talked about in the past around making interferometer systems for two nanometer sort of technologies. And there, there is no change in demand because we are working with customers on enabling this technology. So, yeah, there is a pullback in the near term. But again, I want to stress this is temporary and transient. I'll have Mark Wallace take that. So let me take that, and Neil if you have anything to add, you could. First of all, I would say, it's a great strategic fit, one we're very excited about. I think you've heard me describe the system simulation and emulation opportunity as a near adjacency to the work that we do with customers, especially as we have focused the strategy on engaging with customers early and in their R&D workflows. So the addition of ESI really is a great fit there. Financially, it's accretive to our gross margins, it will be when we close the transaction. And we also think it will be accretive to our [SOFR] (ph) percentage by at least two points at the company level. And from a cultural perspective, I think it's very important as well. ESI is a company that's been around for 50 years and has been involved in some of the most complex simulations associated with crash testing and other areas. And I think with the -- by coming into Keysight and what's exciting is the combination of that can now not only provide go-to-market capabilities that can further accelerate growth but also engage with customers in new applications in aerospace, defense and other end-markets leveraging the deep technology expertise of ESI. So very excited by this transaction as we announced it. Thank you. Yes. I think some of it is the implementation of our solutions approach to what was otherwise markets that we had maybe sort of purely through the lens of products historically. I think of aerospace, defense, David, as an industry, where we largely sold instrumentation tools. And over the past few years, we've put focused effort to adding more value to the customer base by integrating the instruments, but also layering on software and creating more services opportunities. So some of it is a function of the go-to-market push that we've had, but also equally the acceleration in demand we see in specific areas such as automotive. And I'll have Mark maybe give you a couple of more examples to make a drill. Thank you. Just I want to also add that, you've seen us -- Matt, you've seen us stay disciplined and I think at the beginning of the year I did reference that we will be accelerating some of the synergy work that we were starting to plan for anyway and we've executed on that very well. And you can see year-to-date, our OpEx has been flat, even accounting for a lot of the inflation environments. So as we invest in these next-generation technologies that have high customer validation and we know will position the company to outperform over the medium-to-long term, we're also remaining prudent and disciplined towards the macro situation in the short term. Yes. I think the -- if you look at the security environment around the world, there is no doubt that the defense budgets are getting bipartisan priorities in the US. Look at Japan, it also put out doubling of defense spend in the next five years. Europe raising defense spend and security spend as well. So I think this is a business, as we've always said, harder to call on a quarterly basis, but very easy to look at the long-term trend. And our goal is to continue to outperform it. So we expect Q4 to be seasonally strong generally with the end-of-the-year sort of budgets that come open. Yes. I would say we're preserving our R&D investments, so we can outperform the market -- continue to outperform the market as it rebounds in the medium-term to long-term, which we fully expect it to. With regard to AI, a lot of our customers are launching AI projects in their own way, whether it's in silicon or in the networking side. And so, there is a considerable channel leverage there for AI. Clearly, the move to 800-gig ethernet that I referenced with higher interface capacity, higher bandwidth, lower power per bit, all of this are plays to our strength and our leadership there is helping us pick up some orders and set ourselves up as this business scales that we expect it to. With regard to the comms segment, and commercial communications, three dynamics, right? I would say deployments are continuing to scale. Second, globally and as that scales the business there grows. Second one, it's really the standards progression, I would think of Release 17 new use cases are driving customer need. And then the research activities around the world around, I call it beyond 5G because it's too easy to -- too early to call it 6G yet because there's the standard. But beyond 5G that exploration is proliferating and I think it fits our strategy to address the R&D customer. Yes. I think it's hard to put a timing there, but we've seen this sort of overlapping waves of technology really be the basis of our strategy, Mark. And having that exposure to both wireless and wireline is a core strength for the company and we're seeing that play out, even today, the diversity of applications that we pursue. I would say that the 800-gig ethernet abilities -- ability to be first-to-market have that capability is definitely helping us now win some early engagements which should set us up well as that industry scales. As the hyperscalers are coming out of the economic situation in their business and as they're starting to upgrade, they are looking at 800-gig ethernet for some of those technical reasons I just mentioned. Yes. I would say -- yes. Thank you. I would say, again, this is a very small part of our business historically, so we've never had to speak about it. As a function of the lower order levels today, the presentation appears higher. But I'd -- so no change to our order acceptance policy, other than these are complex systems which requires a start work today by inventory and staff people to deliver to our customers. So they are on the books for the right reasons. They're high-quality deals that we feel good about. Yeah, Definitely, the -- when we look at the entire system simulation emulation opportunities, what you really need is the ability to simulate very complex interactions or physical electrical and software capabilities. So again placed to the system strength that the company has, so having these assets in the company will allow us to identify new use cases and serve them differentially which I think puts us in a very unique spot given our entire portfolio and test now mirror it with the strengthening portfolio and design. I think we see this as a very unique positioning for the company, one that aligns with our software-centric transformation that we've been on. I also think that being a European asset, obviously a French asset has been in France, there is more opportunity with our US base of customers to really focus this go-to-market motion and accelerate growth and create greater value. Yes. I think I've mentioned -- Adrienne, hi, a good question. Our Americas business grew quarter-over-quarter -- in Q3, and Europe was stable. Year-over-year. Yes, thank you very much. I know we discussed quite a bit today, but I want to leave you with some -- few important takeaways. First, we're executing very well, maximizing our performance in the near-term and we're tracking to deliver 7% EPS growth with 1% revenue growth this year. Solid profitability in the business and you should take that away. Second, we have strong differentiated portfolio that's aligned with multiple end markets and customer priorities and this will continue to enable us to outperform, both in the near-term and will go stronger as market conditions change. You see the differentiation in our portfolio reflected in our ability to maintain strong gross margins in our business in these conditions. Third, we have a strong balance sheet, strong cash position, and we remain confident in our free cash flow generation capabilities in the business, and we will continue to maintain the balanced capital allocation approach that we described at Investor Day. Fourth, we have a proven operating model with a highly flexible cost structure, and which has been proven before and will continue to play out as we had projected as well. Fifth, we have a seasoned management team here that has experience in the business for decades, and will continue to remain proactive and balanced in navigating this environment and you've seen us do this already this year. Finally, I want to remind everyone that we remain incredibly confident and excited about the favorable long-term secular trends that are underpinnings of our growth strategy. This is around the next-generation technology waves, new addressable customers and industries, and R&D investment wave across multiple end-markets. We are focused on positioning the company to grow and emerge from this environment, stronger. Thank you very much for joining us today. I'll hand this back to Jason."

And now, I will turn the call over to Satish.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Jason. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Keysight delivered a solid second quarter performance caping of a record first half of the year. Our consistent execution as we navigate near-term macro dynamics reflects the resilience of our diversified business and the differentiation of Keysight solution portfolio. My comments today will focus on three key headlines. First, our strong financial performance in the second quarter demonstrated the depth and the breadth of Keysight solutions and operating discipline. Revenue was at the high-end of our guidance and earnings per share exceeded our guidance range as we delivered record gross margin and record free cash flow. Second, orders in the second quarter were stable and consistent with our expectations. As near term macro dynamics play out, we're capitalizing on growth opportunities across our end markets with particular strength in automotive and global aerospace defense. And third, we remain confident in the long-term secular growth trends in our markets. While the current environment is uncertain, we are continuing to prudently invest for the future to build on our leadership positions and to deliver on the long-term strategy that are laid out at our Investor Day in March. Now, let's take a deeper look at our second quarter results. Orders declined 10% or 8% on a core basis. Record Q2 revenue grew 3% or 5% on a core basis. Operational excellence combined with favorable software and services mix resulted in record gross margins of 67%, operating margin of 30%, record free cash flow of 370 million and earnings per share growth of 16%. Turning to our business segments. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group delivered record Q2 orders, driven by demand in automotive and general electronics, representing 33% of the total company revenue, EISG revenue was an all-time high and grew 17% with strong double-digit growth across all end markets. This was also the eleventh consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth for this business segment, which underscores our broad market reach and diversified portfolio. In automotive, we delivered strong double-digit revenue growth and secure new strategic wins with two large OEMs. Building on our strong position in this market, we introduced further automation and protocol test capabilities for our industry leading EV charging test portfolio allowing customers to accelerate their innovation, improved battery performance, and ease of charging are among the most critical capabilities EV developers are bringing to consumers today. Keysight\u2019s complete solutions allow customers to develop batteries with better range and faster charging time and importantly to efficiently test their interoperability against all global infrastructure standards under real world conditions. General Electronics revenue grew by double-digits to reach an all-time high. We are capitalizing on opportunities across a broad range of applications. For example, in quantum and silicon photonics where we are seeing more advanced research investment. In digital health, where we closed deals with several prominent medical device customers for Keysight\u2019s microwave sensing and imaging solutions, and an industrial automation where customers are developing components and products to connect factory and warehouse environments. Our outperformance in general electronics in a soft demand environment demonstrates the benefit of the broad and diverse set of applications and used cases that we enable. Semiconductor solutions delivered double-digit revenue growth, driven by continued fab investments in new wafer capacity and advanced nodes. Our strong relationships with key customers in wafer test and precision lithography provide us with long range demand visibility, which remains favorable, despite near-term inventory headwinds. We believe the long-term growth drivers remain intact, supported by the government investments in initiatives such as CHIPS Act, and advanced node development for small, more efficient, and multifunctional chipsets. Turning to our Communication Solutions Group, revenue declined 3% against a strong compare of double-digit growth last year. At 45% of company revenue, Commercial Communications revenue declined 7%, which reflects the normalization of demand environment that we referenced last quarter. We saw cautious, but stable spending across the communications ecosystem, particularly in the smartphone and PC computing markets as customers work through post-pandemic, inventory dynamics, and macro uncertainty. At the same time, our customers continue to invest in long range strategic R&D programs. Keysight\u2019s first-to-market solutions are enabling future requirements in 5G, including non-terrestrial networks, release 17 capabilities, Open RAN, AIML driven data center networks, and early 6G research. After a 3-year pause, we saw strong global industry participation at Mobile World Congress and Optical Fiber Conference this year. At these events, we showcased our capabilities with the key industry players to advance new technologies and used cases. This quarter, we enabled Samsung to demonstrate 5G new radio non-terrestrial network used cases and satellite connectivity. In addition, we secured a key win in commercial space to test antennas, transceivers, and telemetry systems. Keysight is also enabling ongoing Open RAN adoption. For example, CableLabs used Keysight's Open RAN architect solutions to achieve key interoperability milestones. Regionally, we saw strength in India with ongoing 5G and Open RAN deployments. Strategic data center R&D activity continues to gain momentum and Keysight secured an early win with a leading customer to implement AIML used cases. Our unique and comprehensive solution stack, which spans the physical protocol and the application layers, is enabling us to capitalize on these new market and technology inflections. We are also continuing to advance early 6G research with industry leaders around the world. In Japan, we engaged with NTT DOCOMO, a new spectrum technologies for sub-Terahertz frequencies. In the UK, in collaboration with National Physical Laboratory and University of Surrey, we enabled connectivity at speeds greater than 100 gigabits per second using Keysight\u2019s 6G testbed. Turning to our aerospace and defense government business, we achieved record second quarter orders and revenue. Double-digit order growth was driven by increasing defense spending worldwide. At 22% of company revenue, ADG revenue was up 7%. Defense modernization spending remains strong in radar and spectrum operations, while investment in space and satellite and ongoing research in 5G and 6G drove growth. We saw strong demand from the U.S. and European primes with spend picking up in next generation programs. We recently announced software based real time spectrum analysis solution allowing satellite network operators to provide users with the highest quality of service. Keysight continues to innovate to meet the needs of this evolving market. Software and services revenue growth across business segments was steady and represented over one-third of company revenue. Value-added solutions are becoming increasingly important in the evolving design, emulation, and test environments. In collaboration with Synopsys and Ansys, we recently announced a 79 gigahertz millimeter wave radio frequency reference flow for TSMC. This allows us to provide mutual customers with the solutions they need to push the boundaries of RF and millimeter wave design into applications for autonomous systems. Technology megatrends and customers innovation workflows are driving an expansion in software opportunities. We expect software and services growth to continue to outpace overall company growth over the next three years. Before I turn it over to Neil, I'd like to highlight some of the things that make me proud to lead this company. A collaborative and innovative culture is one of the strategic enablers for Keysight\u2019s continued value creation and an enduring competitive advantage. We recently published our 2022 corporate social responsibility report, which showcases the progress that we have made against our commitments and we're proud to have significantly surpassed many key impact goals for fiscal year 2022. We also released our 2022 diversity, equity, and inclusion report, which highlights the company's accomplishments in building an inclusive workplace and expanding new STEM partnerships. To sum it up, our market leadership and deep customer relationships are sustainable competitive advantages. We\u2019re guided by our Keysight leadership model and run the company to outperform and to consistently create value under all business conditions. We believe the structural and financial flexibility of our operating model enables us to be resilient in the current macro environment. I would like to thank our employees for exemplifying a high performance winning culture and consistently delivering exceptional value to our customers and shareholders. With that, I will now turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook. \nNeil Dougherty: Thank you, Satish, and hello everyone. We delivered exceptionally strong financial performance in Q2 demonstrating the resilience of our business model. Revenue of $1,390 million was at the high-end of our guidance range and grew 3% or 5% on a core basis. Macroeconomic uncertainty continued to impact demand in the second quarter and orders of $1,319 million declined 10% or 8% on a core basis. We ended the quarter with over $2.4 billion in backlog. Turning to our operational results for Q2, we reported record gross margin of 67% and operating expenses of $504 million, resulting in operating margin of 30%. We achieved net income of $380 million and delivered $2.12 in earnings per share, which was above the high-end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 179 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated revenue of $937 million, down 3% or down 1% on a core basis. Commercial Communications revenue of $627 million was down 7%. Aerospace Defense and Government revenue of $310 million increased 7%, driven by investments in defense modernization. Altogether, CSG delivered record gross margin of 68% and operating margin of 28%. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated second quarter revenue of $453 million, up 17% or 19% on a core basis with double-digit revenue growth in automotive, general electronics, and semiconductor demonstrating the diversity of our markets. EISG reported gross margin of 64% and operating margin of 35%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our second quarter with $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generating cash flow from operations of $423 million and free cash flow of $370 million or 27% of revenue, which includes $107 million in one-time proceeds from the unwind of an interest rate swap. Now, turning to our outlook. In this challenging macro environment, the scenario we laid out last quarter for first half demand levels to persist through the remainder of the fiscal year is playing out. However, given the strength of our operating model and the actions we have taken to date, we now anticipate better earnings performance than previously communicated, with strong mid-single-digit EPS growth expected for the full-year. Turning to our third quarter guidance. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.370 billion to $1.390 billion, and Q3 earnings per share to be in the range of $2.00 to $2.06 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 179 million shares. Despite ongoing uncertainty, Keysight's durable and resilient financial model positions us well to outperform in the current economic environment. Over the longer-term, we remain confident in the underlying demand drivers for our markets and our ability to execute and achieve our new raised long-term targets, as presented at our Investor Day in March. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.\nJason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Elisa, could you please give the instructions for the Q&A?\nOperator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I guess, if I start with the strong operating performance, I think, Neil, you were mentioning in your prepared remarks. Just maybe give us a bit more color there? Obviously, record gross margins, very strong operating margins in the context of sort of how the top line is playing out and how the macro is? What are the drivers behind the gross margin improvement? And overall, how much of this is just, sort of some of the supply pressures easing versus something that you, as you said, you've taken actions and sort of that's driving some of the improvement? If you can lay that out for us in terms of how sustainable that is? And I have a follow-up.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. Samik, it's a great question. And to some extent, it depends on what your compare is over the past couple of quarters. A big driver of the sequential improvement from the last couple of quarters comes from the improvement in the supply chain. And in fact, I would tie it to the reduction in the third-party premiums that had, kind of peaked in the back half of this year and last year and into the first quarter of this year. On a year-over-year basis, it's really far more mix. We had significantly favorable mix relative to the mix that we saw in the same quarter a year ago. As to sustainability, I think obviously, we set a new \u2013 raised a gross margin target for this business of 66% to 67% over the longer-term. I think this is a great proof point in terms of showing our ability to achieve those kinds of levels. I don't necessarily know that we're ready to operate at this level continuously going forward, but we also raised the EPS guidance for the year relative to the scenario we laid out last quarter. And certainly, the operating margin performance \u2013 excuse me, the gross margin performance and the easing of the supply chain constraints and costs are a factor that led to that increased EPS guidance.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: This is Satish here. If I can add to Neil's points, quite pleased with the financial performance in this environment. Obviously, both CSG and EISG showed gross margin improvements. In EISG, a lot of it was linked to volume, but if you look, the business model is solid, right? You look at the software and services, have been steadily outpacing the business \u2013 overall business growth for a long time now, and we expect that trend to continue. And I would say that that gives us confidence, as Neil pointed out, that as we continue to execute our strategy of going up the stack all the way from physical protocol and application layers, we'll continue to have more opportunities moving forward.\nSamik Chatterjee: Got it. And Satish, if I can follow up with you on the demand side for Commercial Communications. You talked about the sort of customer spending patterns last quarter. Have you seen any more sort of broadening out of the weakness? I know some of your peers have talked about even some of the base station testing, et cetera, being a bit weaker. But have you seen any broadening beyond, sort of just the smartphone ecosystem of players and that weakness that you're seeing? And even interested in hearing what you're seeing from your customers in relation to, do you really see, sort of your Commercial Comms hit, sort of hitting a trough already and now starting to sort of stabilize at these levels? Because that's what the numbers are indicating, but interested to hear how you're thinking about it. Thank you.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. So, I think the headline on demand, I think, in orders has been stability, right? I think that's sort of the theme and it holds true even in Commercial Communications where, obviously, we discussed the dynamics of customers working through inventory corrections. Some of them are in a place where they're starting to think about next year's programs. They're starting to think about other programs. But then some of them are still working through the inventory correction situation in their business. So it's really dependent on different customers. But broadly, I would say, if you look at our 5G business, the R&D parts of the opportunity continues to hold up better, and there are different drivers there. And then you referenced the base station side, actually, was also holding up in-line with quarter one. And I think on the networking side, we had slightly down quarter-over-quarter. But all-in-all, it's holding up well at this time. I don't know that I would go as far as calling a trough or calling a bottom, but I \u2013 we remain focused on delivering to our customers' road maps. And we're seeing high engagement with our customers, particularly in comms after the OFC and Mobile World Congress, I think people are starting to think about what the future might bring, and there's tremendous opportunity to innovate and nobody wants to fall behind.\nNeil Dougherty: And if I was just going to add on to that, I mean, just kind of catching on to that theme of stability that Satish mentioned. I think as we look at demand and turn that lens forward, we're thinking about second half demand that's largely in-line with what we saw in the first half, albeit with some seasonality attached to it. Typically, we would see Q3 tick down and Q4 tick up, not just because of the way we manage our sales compensation programs, but also particularly in this scenario, where one of the growth drivers that we're seeing in this market is aerospace defense and the fact that those markets tend to skew up in our fourth quarter.\nSamik Chatterjee: Great. Thank you. Congrats on the execution.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Samik.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna. Your line is now open.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. Going back to backlog, I want to better understand how the normalization, especially post-COVID, is played out? And just for illustration, if I were to look at prior to COVID and look at like 3 years to 5 years of history, the next quarter revenue to prior quarter backlog averaged around 0.9, reflecting the nature of the business which has turned, COVID changed that. Your backlog went-up due to supply chain disruption. And as you look forward post-COVID, should we expect more of a turn business? And I have a follow-up.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I think maybe from a business model standpoint, as you know, we've been driving to increasing solutions, more software and services mix, higher ARR, and that's been part of the strategy for go-to-market and that could alter in a very moderate way, the mix. But at some point, yes, I think as demand gets back in-line, we would expect the supply and demand balance to be restored.\nNeil Dougherty: Sorry, Mehdi. As I think about it from a backlog perspective, I think in terms of the backlog normalization, it's happening much like we laid out last quarter, right, that orders or revenues have outpaced orders in both Q1 and Q2. We expect that largely to continue here through the remainder of the year. And while we may not work through all of what I've, kind of had described as the abnormal backlog, we're going to work through a significant portion of that, if you think of it as kind of $80 million a quarter, kind of a run rate. And you are correct. As the supply chain situation is involved, we are once again becoming more and more reliant on turns business. Not quite back to where we were pre-COVID, but some of that is the fact of the, kind of the structural changes that have occurred in our business over that period of time.\nMehdi Hosseini: Sure. Thank you. And I certainly don't want to take away anything from the demand drivers. And in that context, maybe you could remind us what are the key demand drivers looking forward, like 600 gig Ethernet [nearly] [ph] semiconductor? And to me, those dynamics are very different than the 5G investment cycle that you went through from 2017 through 2019. And then if you could just remind us how the next couple of years could be different than prior upturn?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you, Mehdi. And as you know, we have a diversified portfolio, and we have diversified end market exposure that gives us plenty of opportunity to continue to expand our share position. We still only have 25% market share in our markets, and we have additional new [SAM] [ph] opportunities that I outlined at Investor Day. But if you just look at the high level, you'd say the innovation trends across our end markets continue to accelerate. And I think what we're seeing even during this time is customers are not pulling back on their long-term priorities, especially with regard to keeping their competitiveness going. And so, that is a trend that we expect to continue, and that would bode well for \u2013 in wireless Release 17 and new innovations that are coming up. And heading into 6G, which is on a road map for the industry. And in wireline, clearly, the move to 800 gig terabit Ethernet and multiple optimizations that networks have to go through in the world of AI-ML, I think that's another diversified opportunity for us that we're pretty excited about. And then you go into aerospace defense. I think research spanned across multiple nations of the world continue to remain strong as many nations are investing in organic IP. You look at supply onshoring or reshoring or security around supply chain, that is a demand driver. And when you look at semiconductor, the move \u2013 the road map is pretty secure to actually go through the progression from 7-nanometer to 5 to 3 to 2 and so on and so forth. So, we look at across our end markets, including the General Electronics business with digital health, and I didn't talk about the one that is currently inflecting, which is automotive, with EV and AV. And all these are secular trends. And I think our focus as a company on R&D innovations, enabling customers to go faster, is definitely \u2013 will put us in a good position to capitalize.\nMehdi Hosseini: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder from UBS. Your line is now open.\nChris Snyder: Thank you. So, fiscal Q2 revenue came in below typical seasonality. And obviously, you guys have been talking about the cyclical slowdown, so not a surprise there. But I guess my question is, if the guidance calls for, kind of typical seasonality into the third quarter with top line largely flattish, can we take that or should we take that as a vote of confidence that the market dynamics or demand is not getting worse?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. I mean, as I said, I think we largely think \u2013 albeit at a lower level, we think \u2013 we largely see things as stable here as we move from the first half into the second half, right? I just talked about how on the demand side, we expect second half orders to be on par with the first half, albeit with the seasonality that I mentioned. And I think from a revenue perspective, the same is largely correct. We delivered [13.80] [ph] in Q1, guided to [13.80] [ph] in Q2. We did a little bit better. We've guided to [13.80] [ph] in Q3. And I think if you think about a level of revenue stability at about that level, you're thinking about it the right way.\nChris Snyder: I appreciate that. And kind of taking that and following up on the guide. If my [back to] [ph] the envelope math is correct here, mid-single-digit EPS growth for the year would imply a pretty big decline in Q4, both versus Q3, but also year-on-year. And with top line seemingly at least, kind of stable, it would \u2013 it seems to be calling for a decline in margins. Any reason for that? I don't know if there's ever been a quarter where Q4 EPS came in below Q3. Thank you.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. Well, again, as I said, I think if you think about the top line for Q4, stability would be the term that I'd use to describe that. When it comes to EPS, I think on a year-over-year basis, you're not incorrect at modeling a decline. While Q4 a year ago was not that dissimilar from what we just delivered here in Q2, as we look into the back half of the year, as I said, we might not be able to sustain the gross margin quite as favorably as the mix we just delivered.  And then in addition, we want to see some incremental investments into some of the future technologies that are going to drive our markets as we move forward. So, I do think on a year-over-year basis, you will expect a decline in the fourth quarter.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. And I think just to add to the point, right, it is an uncertain environment that's out there. And I think when we speak with customers, the engagement levels are high. But in terms of them planning for budgets, they're really relying on their underlying business to pick-up. And so there's that dynamic which results in an elongated cycle to close the pipeline, and so that's the case. And our guide, we try to be central weighted. We're not factoring in any macro recovery nor are we factoring in any recovery from China reopening into the guide. And those could be upside, but the macro could get worse too. So, that's the way we see it, and we'll keep you updated.\nChris Snyder: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Thank you for taking the question. Also congrats on the execution in the quarter. A lot of questions that I had were already answered, but I want to go back to kind of the narrative around AI and ML, and maybe you can help just unpack a little bit of the demand insertion that you're seeing? Just maybe help us appreciate where and to what extent Keysight's involved in those opportunities? I'm just kind of curious, so just helping us appreciate a little bit more of the AI narrative and the demand drivers you're seeing?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you. I think AI, it's safe to say that it's been under discussion for quite a long time, and you could say machine-learning algorithms are not that new. But what we're seeing now is a tick up in networks really thinking about the way to train AI models, the way to infer in an AI environment, and that creates some opportunities for us. I think Kailash has referred to that in our presentation at Investor Day as some pilots that we have going on. And fundamentally, you look at it at the high level, you have in a typical search not so traffic in the network. And with AI-ML, you have a lot of east-west traffic. And I think modeling that and being able to train your network to perform is going to become a differentiator. And I think having the full stack in wireless and [ wireline ] allows us to go address opportunities for our customers. How big that could be, I mean, to be determined. But I do know that a lot of our customers are having discussions with us at this time, and we're continuing to invest in this new emerging opportunity.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Thank you. Very helpful. And then as a quick follow-up, I noticed this quarter, you did not repurchase any share. I think that's the first time in a little while. So, Neil, I'm just curious of how you're thinking about very strong free cash flow? How you're thinking about share repurchase, maybe M&A, just overall capital allocation given the strong balance sheet position?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. There have been no changes to our capital allocation priorities. Obviously, we re-laid them out at our Analyst Day in March. We continue to look for opportunities to grow our business via value-accretive M&A. While we didn't purchase any shares during the quarter for a variety of reasons, we've been very active in the buyback markets and would expect that our \u2013 to continue to be least anti-dilutive with our buyback programs and be opportunistic on top of that. And so, we continue to believe there is ample opportunity for us to create value through appropriate capital allocation.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is [Will Brian] [ph] asking a question on the behalf of Mark Delaney. So, first question is, with orders down year-over-year, will easier comps in backlog be enough for the company to grow at that 5% to 7% target that you laid out next year if the macro is still similar to current conditions or would the macro need to improve at all to reach that goal?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. As we said, the macro environment continues to remain highly uncertain, and we're not ready to make a call as to what the environment is going to be 6 months from now when we get to FY 2024. I think what we see right now is largely stability, and as Satish just said, we're not ready to call an upturn, but nor do we have any additional downside baked into what we're seeing currently.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And my second question, I just wonder if you can comment or give some additional color around regional order trends at all? Thank you.\nMark Wallace: Sure, Will. This is Mark. I'll talk about the region trends. So, it begins with the word stability. We talked about that many times already. Q2 orders were steady and predictable and really consistent with our expectations. We saw increased customer demand and increased customer engagements with continuing focus on their R&D programs across all four regions. This was especially shown in the case for aerospace and defense, where we saw strong growth in demand across all of our regions. We saw the demand in automotive continue with some key wins, a couple of key OEM wins, particularly in Europe. And in general, the broad base of customers and the variety of applications that we serve within General Electronics really held up strongly across most regions as well. We did see some pullback, as we saw in Q1, around commercial comms that was centered with some of our larger customers in the Americas. We saw some pullback in short-term demand with semiconductor in Asia. But in general, across all regions, we saw this continuing stability in engagements and order flow as we expected.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. It looks like you guys bring down about 100 million of backlog this quarter and you had been kind of guiding to about $300 million of backlog for the remainder of the year, so it seems like everything is on track there. I guess I just wanted to get an update as to whether, kind of 200 million of additional backlog for the year was a good estimate? And just kind of what segment that's most concentrated on? And then just a second question, just in terms of where you're seeing some of the more cautious spending on comms? Is that legacy standards? Just kind of what projects are being potentially pushed out while, kind of emphasis is still being put on 6G, kind of new releases of 5G? Thanks.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Thank you. Meta, I'll take the second part first and then Neil will speak to the backlog. I think the \u2013 in comms, obviously, the big driver is new innovation, new technology trends. So, we saw strength in Release 17, non-terrestrial networks, all of the same themes that we've been talking about, and some increased investments around the globe around the next-generation technologies. And so, largely in R&D, the trends are holding.  And in production environments, our production test environments is where we're seeing much more weakness in demand as customers are digesting this excess inventory associated with smartphones and PCs and such. And our share position, even though at a lower level, continues to be strong, and we're focused on our portfolio and our portfolio continues to grow, and we'll continue to release new products in alignment with customer needs. With regard to the backlog position, obviously, we have a backlog situation. As Neil mentioned, we have a growing deferred revenue balance with increasing focus we have placed on software services and ARR. And we also, in accordance with where we're seeing the order strength, whether it's automotive or in semiconductor or in aerospace defense, we're also providing more system type of capabilities to our customers, which have longer lead times. Neil will give you more specifics.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. I think on the backlight side, you referenced our comments about expecting to burn somewhere around $300 million of backlog for the year. I mean, that statement was made last quarter when revenues outpaced orders by $80 million, and we talked about how we expected that demand environment to sustain itself for at least the next couple of quarters. And that's, in fact, what's playing out. So, if you think about kind of an $80 million backlog burn per quarter, you get to [320] [ph], and that's largely how we're thinking about it with orders and revenue largely stable into the back half of the year. And the last question you asked is, how does it skew by business? Right now, it's clearly skewing towards CSG.\nMeta Marshall : Okay. Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Your line is now open.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hey guys. Nice quarter. Neil, the working capital was pretty negative in 2022, and it looks like it\u2019s, kind of finally starting to swing positive in Q2. Do you expect that trend to continue in the back half cash from working capital?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. I mean, it's certainly something we're watching carefully. There's a number of factors there. The supply chain situation clearly put pressure on working capital in a number of ways. First of all, inventory purchase commitments, which while things are getting better, we did make significant purchase commitments over the course of the last 4 to 6 quarters during that time frame, so think that's going to keep some pressure. And we also, to be honest, had begun to alter our processes around demos so that we could \u2013 rather than putting new units into demo inventory, we sustain the life of our demo inventory so we could deliver products into the hands of our customers. And so, as we start to normalize that, rotate that demo back out and sell that equipment via our used equipment business, I think we'll be able to bring inventory over time \u2013 down over time. And then I think on the receivables side, what's really going to help us there is, as the supply chain situation continues to improve and we can really start to linearize our revenue delivery within the quarter, that will help. And I think there is room for continued improvement there over time.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. And it was slight, but the CapEx guidance came down a touch. Just wondering what drove that?\nNeil Dougherty: Well, similarly there, you think \u2013 the CapEx that you're seeing there is obviously the cash flow side of things. And again, with the supply chain situation, a lot of what we're seeing on the cash flow side is \u2013 were commitments that were made many months ago and to which we're starting to get delivery. We actually have seen our new commitments actually drop even further than what you've seen on the cash flow side of things as the supply chain situation is resolved. But we do expect CapEx cash flows to be high for the remainder of the year. Higher for the remainder of the year.\nAdam Thalhimer: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nMatt Niknam: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the quarter. I want to go back to gross margins, and maybe if we can talk a little bit about some of the drivers of upside. I think there was reference to product mix, if we can just go back to that and unpack that. And I'm also curious whether there were any software license sales in there that may not recur on a go-forward basis? And then just one follow-up as well on orders, if you could talk about the linearity over the course of the quarter and how that trended by month, if possible? Thanks.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. Let me take the gross margin question, and then we'll have Mark address the orders question. I think on the gross margin side, again, on a year-over-year basis, it's primarily mix. And we do see a fair amount of movement in mix. Mix within the quarter can shift. But if you think about it in this particular situation, obviously, the shift towards higher recurring revenue is helping to the extent that those software revenues are sustained and stable in a period of time where revenues are \u2013 orders and revenue and demand for hardware is generally under pressure. I think that's a favorable shift on mix. And then probably even a bigger impact than that within the quarter is within the product shipments itself, it's skewed towards higher-end systems rather than lower end tools within the quarter is the best way to describe it. And particularly versus a year ago \u2013 versus prior quarters where we maybe have had an unfavorable mix shift towards high levels of [indiscernible] shipments, some of our lower-end products or things that can skew mix the other way. So, that's what we saw within quarter.\nMark Wallace: Yes. And Matt, as far as the order flow within the quarter, I would say it was very typical for a Q2 as the second period and the 6-month performance period, we saw it ramp throughout each of the 3 months. February is a shorter month, fewer selling days. As you get to the end of the performance period with our incentive comp and sales, we do expect a stronger finish, which is exactly what we saw. What I can say though was very consistent was the, kind of elevated level of customer engagement as customers prioritized on different programs that they felt were important going forward, and we saw that really is a stabilizing factor after coming out of Q1. So, we did see a ramp, but I wouldn't read anything more into that other than the natural seasonality of the Q2.\nMatt Niknam: Got it. And just on the gross margins, any sort of abnormal software license sales in there to call out?\nNeil Dougherty: No.\nMatt Niknam : Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Thank you. Good evening. Maybe a little bit of a strategy question. So, as you've grown your automotive and EV battery business, are there some attractive adjacencies there? Would you consider inorganic investments to, kind of round out the offering? Or do you feel that you have, kind of the solutions that you need to keep up the growth there?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I think as we mentioned, automotive has been a fairly new vertical expansion for us, one that we focused on since Keysight was formed, and we have successfully grown that to over $500 million. And we continue to see even more opportunity to expand as there's going to be ongoing innovations in EV and AV, not only in automobiles, but in other sectors as well, with the push for autonomous and electrification even in a broader set of industries. And we're continuing to build the most comprehensive portfolio all the way from design to silicon bring up to simulation, validation, compliance testing and manufacturing with more emphasis on R&D, really. And we're helping create standards, we're also working on finding new methodologies for testing that will be disruptive. And to that extent, we've made a small technology tuck-ins that have enhanced our software content and ability to make contributions to the workflow in this area. And we see, as we think about our M&A, we see a strong pipeline for opportunities and we'll continue to evaluate them against our strategic and financial hurdles, and we'll look to lean in for the right opportunity.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Thank you for that. And then just a quick follow-up. How are your own lead times \u2013 as the supply chain has improved, how are your own lead times relative to pre-COVID history? Where do we stand on that? Thank you.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. So still improving. For a significant part of the portfolio, we're already back. There's another significant chunk that should work its way back to kind of pre-COVID lead times here over the third quarter. And then there will continue to be some outliers beyond that, but we're rapidly moving in the right direction.\nDavid Ridley-Lane : Good to hear. Thank you.\nNeil Dougherty: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the call back to Jason Kary for any closing comments.\nJason Kary: Thanks Elisa, and thanks everyone, for joining us today. That concludes our call, and we look forward to seeing you at some of the upcoming conferences here in the quarter.\nOperator: This concludes our conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Sure, Will. This is Mark. I'll talk about the region trends. So, it begins with the word stability. We talked about that many times already. Q2 orders were steady and predictable and really consistent with our expectations. We saw increased customer demand and increased customer engagements with continuing focus on their R&D programs across all four regions. This was especially shown in the case for aerospace and defense, where we saw strong growth in demand across all of our regions. We saw the demand in automotive continue with some key wins, a couple of key OEM wins, particularly in Europe. And in general, the broad base of customers and the variety of applications that we serve within General Electronics really held up strongly across most regions as well. We did see some pullback, as we saw in Q1, around commercial comms that was centered with some of our larger customers in the Americas. We saw some pullback in short-term demand with semiconductor in Asia. But in general, across all regions, we saw this continuing stability in engagements and order flow as we expected. Yes. And Matt, as far as the order flow within the quarter, I would say it was very typical for a Q2 as the second period and the 6-month performance period, we saw it ramp throughout each of the 3 months. February is a shorter month, fewer selling days. As you get to the end of the performance period with our incentive comp and sales, we do expect a stronger finish, which is exactly what we saw. What I can say though was very consistent was the, kind of elevated level of customer engagement as customers prioritized on different programs that they felt were important going forward, and we saw that really is a stabilizing factor after coming out of Q1. So, we did see a ramp, but I wouldn't read anything more into that other than the natural seasonality of the Q2."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Neil Dougherty",
            "content": "Thank you, Satish, and hello everyone. We delivered exceptionally strong financial performance in Q2 demonstrating the resilience of our business model. Revenue of $1,390 million was at the high-end of our guidance range and grew 3% or 5% on a core basis. Macroeconomic uncertainty continued to impact demand in the second quarter and orders of $1,319 million declined 10% or 8% on a core basis. We ended the quarter with over $2.4 billion in backlog. Turning to our operational results for Q2, we reported record gross margin of 67% and operating expenses of $504 million, resulting in operating margin of 30%. We achieved net income of $380 million and delivered $2.12 in earnings per share, which was above the high-end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 179 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated revenue of $937 million, down 3% or down 1% on a core basis. Commercial Communications revenue of $627 million was down 7%. Aerospace Defense and Government revenue of $310 million increased 7%, driven by investments in defense modernization. Altogether, CSG delivered record gross margin of 68% and operating margin of 28%. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated second quarter revenue of $453 million, up 17% or 19% on a core basis with double-digit revenue growth in automotive, general electronics, and semiconductor demonstrating the diversity of our markets. EISG reported gross margin of 64% and operating margin of 35%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our second quarter with $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generating cash flow from operations of $423 million and free cash flow of $370 million or 27% of revenue, which includes $107 million in one-time proceeds from the unwind of an interest rate swap. Now, turning to our outlook. In this challenging macro environment, the scenario we laid out last quarter for first half demand levels to persist through the remainder of the fiscal year is playing out. However, given the strength of our operating model and the actions we have taken to date, we now anticipate better earnings performance than previously communicated, with strong mid-single-digit EPS growth expected for the full-year. Turning to our third quarter guidance. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.370 billion to $1.390 billion, and Q3 earnings per share to be in the range of $2.00 to $2.06 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 179 million shares. Despite ongoing uncertainty, Keysight's durable and resilient financial model positions us well to outperform in the current economic environment. Over the longer-term, we remain confident in the underlying demand drivers for our markets and our ability to execute and achieve our new raised long-term targets, as presented at our Investor Day in March. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A. Yes. Samik, it's a great question. And to some extent, it depends on what your compare is over the past couple of quarters. A big driver of the sequential improvement from the last couple of quarters comes from the improvement in the supply chain. And in fact, I would tie it to the reduction in the third-party premiums that had, kind of peaked in the back half of this year and last year and into the first quarter of this year. On a year-over-year basis, it's really far more mix. We had significantly favorable mix relative to the mix that we saw in the same quarter a year ago. As to sustainability, I think obviously, we set a new \u2013 raised a gross margin target for this business of 66% to 67% over the longer-term. I think this is a great proof point in terms of showing our ability to achieve those kinds of levels. I don't necessarily know that we're ready to operate at this level continuously going forward, but we also raised the EPS guidance for the year relative to the scenario we laid out last quarter. And certainly, the operating margin performance \u2013 excuse me, the gross margin performance and the easing of the supply chain constraints and costs are a factor that led to that increased EPS guidance. And if I was just going to add on to that, I mean, just kind of catching on to that theme of stability that Satish mentioned. I think as we look at demand and turn that lens forward, we're thinking about second half demand that's largely in-line with what we saw in the first half, albeit with some seasonality attached to it. Typically, we would see Q3 tick down and Q4 tick up, not just because of the way we manage our sales compensation programs, but also particularly in this scenario, where one of the growth drivers that we're seeing in this market is aerospace defense and the fact that those markets tend to skew up in our fourth quarter. Sorry, Mehdi. As I think about it from a backlog perspective, I think in terms of the backlog normalization, it's happening much like we laid out last quarter, right, that orders or revenues have outpaced orders in both Q1 and Q2. We expect that largely to continue here through the remainder of the year. And while we may not work through all of what I've, kind of had described as the abnormal backlog, we're going to work through a significant portion of that, if you think of it as kind of $80 million a quarter, kind of a run rate. And you are correct. As the supply chain situation is involved, we are once again becoming more and more reliant on turns business. Not quite back to where we were pre-COVID, but some of that is the fact of the, kind of the structural changes that have occurred in our business over that period of time. Yes. I mean, as I said, I think we largely think \u2013 albeit at a lower level, we think \u2013 we largely see things as stable here as we move from the first half into the second half, right? I just talked about how on the demand side, we expect second half orders to be on par with the first half, albeit with the seasonality that I mentioned. And I think from a revenue perspective, the same is largely correct. We delivered [13.80] [ph] in Q1, guided to [13.80] [ph] in Q2. We did a little bit better. We've guided to [13.80] [ph] in Q3. And I think if you think about a level of revenue stability at about that level, you're thinking about it the right way. Yes. Well, again, as I said, I think if you think about the top line for Q4, stability would be the term that I'd use to describe that. When it comes to EPS, I think on a year-over-year basis, you're not incorrect at modeling a decline. While Q4 a year ago was not that dissimilar from what we just delivered here in Q2, as we look into the back half of the year, as I said, we might not be able to sustain the gross margin quite as favorably as the mix we just delivered.  And then in addition, we want to see some incremental investments into some of the future technologies that are going to drive our markets as we move forward. So, I do think on a year-over-year basis, you will expect a decline in the fourth quarter. Yes. There have been no changes to our capital allocation priorities. Obviously, we re-laid them out at our Analyst Day in March. We continue to look for opportunities to grow our business via value-accretive M&A. While we didn't purchase any shares during the quarter for a variety of reasons, we've been very active in the buyback markets and would expect that our \u2013 to continue to be least anti-dilutive with our buyback programs and be opportunistic on top of that. And so, we continue to believe there is ample opportunity for us to create value through appropriate capital allocation. Yes. As we said, the macro environment continues to remain highly uncertain, and we're not ready to make a call as to what the environment is going to be 6 months from now when we get to FY 2024. I think what we see right now is largely stability, and as Satish just said, we're not ready to call an upturn, but nor do we have any additional downside baked into what we're seeing currently. Yes. I think on the backlight side, you referenced our comments about expecting to burn somewhere around $300 million of backlog for the year. I mean, that statement was made last quarter when revenues outpaced orders by $80 million, and we talked about how we expected that demand environment to sustain itself for at least the next couple of quarters. And that's, in fact, what's playing out. So, if you think about kind of an $80 million backlog burn per quarter, you get to [320] [ph], and that's largely how we're thinking about it with orders and revenue largely stable into the back half of the year. And the last question you asked is, how does it skew by business? Right now, it's clearly skewing towards CSG. Yes. I mean, it's certainly something we're watching carefully. There's a number of factors there. The supply chain situation clearly put pressure on working capital in a number of ways. First of all, inventory purchase commitments, which while things are getting better, we did make significant purchase commitments over the course of the last 4 to 6 quarters during that time frame, so think that's going to keep some pressure. And we also, to be honest, had begun to alter our processes around demos so that we could \u2013 rather than putting new units into demo inventory, we sustain the life of our demo inventory so we could deliver products into the hands of our customers. And so, as we start to normalize that, rotate that demo back out and sell that equipment via our used equipment business, I think we'll be able to bring inventory over time \u2013 down over time. And then I think on the receivables side, what's really going to help us there is, as the supply chain situation continues to improve and we can really start to linearize our revenue delivery within the quarter, that will help. And I think there is room for continued improvement there over time. Well, similarly there, you think \u2013 the CapEx that you're seeing there is obviously the cash flow side of things. And again, with the supply chain situation, a lot of what we're seeing on the cash flow side is \u2013 were commitments that were made many months ago and to which we're starting to get delivery. We actually have seen our new commitments actually drop even further than what you've seen on the cash flow side of things as the supply chain situation is resolved. But we do expect CapEx cash flows to be high for the remainder of the year. Higher for the remainder of the year. Yes. Let me take the gross margin question, and then we'll have Mark address the orders question. I think on the gross margin side, again, on a year-over-year basis, it's primarily mix. And we do see a fair amount of movement in mix. Mix within the quarter can shift. But if you think about it in this particular situation, obviously, the shift towards higher recurring revenue is helping to the extent that those software revenues are sustained and stable in a period of time where revenues are \u2013 orders and revenue and demand for hardware is generally under pressure. I think that's a favorable shift on mix. And then probably even a bigger impact than that within the quarter is within the product shipments itself, it's skewed towards higher-end systems rather than lower end tools within the quarter is the best way to describe it. And particularly versus a year ago \u2013 versus prior quarters where we maybe have had an unfavorable mix shift towards high levels of [indiscernible] shipments, some of our lower-end products or things that can skew mix the other way. So, that's what we saw within quarter. No. Yes. So still improving. For a significant part of the portfolio, we're already back. There's another significant chunk that should work its way back to kind of pre-COVID lead times here over the third quarter. And then there will continue to be some outliers beyond that, but we're rapidly moving in the right direction. Thank you."

            "name": "Satish Dhanasekaran",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Keysight delivered a solid second quarter performance caping of a record first half of the year. Our consistent execution as we navigate near-term macro dynamics reflects the resilience of our diversified business and the differentiation of Keysight solution portfolio. My comments today will focus on three key headlines. First, our strong financial performance in the second quarter demonstrated the depth and the breadth of Keysight solutions and operating discipline. Revenue was at the high-end of our guidance and earnings per share exceeded our guidance range as we delivered record gross margin and record free cash flow. Second, orders in the second quarter were stable and consistent with our expectations. As near term macro dynamics play out, we're capitalizing on growth opportunities across our end markets with particular strength in automotive and global aerospace defense. And third, we remain confident in the long-term secular growth trends in our markets. While the current environment is uncertain, we are continuing to prudently invest for the future to build on our leadership positions and to deliver on the long-term strategy that are laid out at our Investor Day in March. Now, let's take a deeper look at our second quarter results. Orders declined 10% or 8% on a core basis. Record Q2 revenue grew 3% or 5% on a core basis. Operational excellence combined with favorable software and services mix resulted in record gross margins of 67%, operating margin of 30%, record free cash flow of 370 million and earnings per share growth of 16%. Turning to our business segments. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group delivered record Q2 orders, driven by demand in automotive and general electronics, representing 33% of the total company revenue, EISG revenue was an all-time high and grew 17% with strong double-digit growth across all end markets. This was also the eleventh consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth for this business segment, which underscores our broad market reach and diversified portfolio. In automotive, we delivered strong double-digit revenue growth and secure new strategic wins with two large OEMs. Building on our strong position in this market, we introduced further automation and protocol test capabilities for our industry leading EV charging test portfolio allowing customers to accelerate their innovation, improved battery performance, and ease of charging are among the most critical capabilities EV developers are bringing to consumers today. Keysight's complete solutions allow customers to develop batteries with better range and faster charging time and importantly to efficiently test their interoperability against all global infrastructure standards under real world conditions. General Electronics revenue grew by double-digits to reach an all-time high. We are capitalizing on opportunities across a broad range of applications. For example, in quantum and silicon photonics where we are seeing more advanced research investment. In digital health, where we closed deals with several prominent medical device customers for Keysight's microwave sensing and imaging solutions, and an industrial automation where customers are developing components and products to connect factory and warehouse environments. Our outperformance in general electronics in a soft demand environment demonstrates the benefit of the broad and diverse set of applications and used cases that we enable. Semiconductor solutions delivered double-digit revenue growth, driven by continued fab investments in new wafer capacity and advanced nodes. Our strong relationships with key customers in wafer test and precision lithography provide us with long range demand visibility, which remains favorable, despite near-term inventory headwinds. We believe the long-term growth drivers remain intact, supported by the government investments in initiatives such as CHIPS Act, and advanced node development for small, more efficient, and multifunctional chipsets. Turning to our Communication Solutions Group, revenue declined 3% against a strong compare of double-digit growth last year. At 45% of company revenue, Commercial Communications revenue declined 7%, which reflects the normalization of demand environment that we referenced last quarter. We saw cautious, but stable spending across the communications ecosystem, particularly in the smartphone and PC computing markets as customers work through post-pandemic, inventory dynamics, and macro uncertainty. At the same time, our customers continue to invest in long range strategic R&D programs. Keysight's first-to-market solutions are enabling future requirements in 5G, including non-terrestrial networks, release 17 capabilities, Open RAN, AIML driven data center networks, and early 6G research. After a 3-year pause, we saw strong global industry participation at Mobile World Congress and Optical Fiber Conference this year. At these events, we showcased our capabilities with the key industry players to advance new technologies and used cases. This quarter, we enabled Samsung to demonstrate 5G new radio non-terrestrial network used cases and satellite connectivity. In addition, we secured a key win in commercial space to test antennas, transceivers, and telemetry systems. Keysight is also enabling ongoing Open RAN adoption. For example, CableLabs used Keysight's Open RAN architect solutions to achieve key interoperability milestones. Regionally, we saw strength in India with ongoing 5G and Open RAN deployments. Strategic data center R&D activity continues to gain momentum and Keysight secured an early win with a leading customer to implement AIML used cases. Our unique and comprehensive solution stack, which spans the physical protocol and the application layers, is enabling us to capitalize on these new market and technology inflections. We are also continuing to advance early 6G research with industry leaders around the world. In Japan, we engaged with NTT DOCOMO, a new spectrum technologies for sub-Terahertz frequencies. In the UK, in collaboration with National Physical Laboratory and University of Surrey, we enabled connectivity at speeds greater than 100 gigabits per second using Keysight's 6G testbed. Turning to our aerospace and defense government business, we achieved record second quarter orders and revenue. Double-digit order growth was driven by increasing defense spending worldwide. At 22% of company revenue, ADG revenue was up 7%. Defense modernization spending remains strong in radar and spectrum operations, while investment in space and satellite and ongoing research in 5G and 6G drove growth. We saw strong demand from the U.S. and European primes with spend picking up in next generation programs. We recently announced software based real time spectrum analysis solution allowing satellite network operators to provide users with the highest quality of service. Keysight continues to innovate to meet the needs of this evolving market. Software and services revenue growth across business segments was steady and represented over one-third of company revenue. Value-added solutions are becoming increasingly important in the evolving design, emulation, and test environments. In collaboration with Synopsys and Ansys, we recently announced a 79 gigahertz millimeter wave radio frequency reference flow for TSMC. This allows us to provide mutual customers with the solutions they need to push the boundaries of RF and millimeter wave design into applications for autonomous systems. Technology megatrends and customers innovation workflows are driving an expansion in software opportunities. We expect software and services growth to continue to outpace overall company growth over the next three years. Before I turn it over to Neil, I'd like to highlight some of the things that make me proud to lead this company. A collaborative and innovative culture is one of the strategic enablers for Keysight's continued value creation and an enduring competitive advantage. We recently published our 2022 corporate social responsibility report, which showcases the progress that we have made against our commitments and we're proud to have significantly surpassed many key impact goals for fiscal year 2022. We also released our 2022 diversity, equity, and inclusion report, which highlights the company's accomplishments in building an inclusive workplace and expanding new STEM partnerships. To sum it up, our market leadership and deep customer relationships are sustainable competitive advantages. We're guided by our Keysight leadership model and run the company to outperform and to consistently create value under all business conditions. We believe the structural and financial flexibility of our operating model enables us to be resilient in the current macro environment. I would like to thank our employees for exemplifying a high performance winning culture and consistently delivering exceptional value to our customers and shareholders. With that, I will now turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook. This is Satish here. If I can add to Neil's points, quite pleased with the financial performance in this environment. Obviously, both CSG and EISG showed gross margin improvements. In EISG, a lot of it was linked to volume, but if you look, the business model is solid, right? You look at the software and services, have been steadily outpacing the business \u2013 overall business growth for a long time now, and we expect that trend to continue. And I would say that that gives us confidence, as Neil pointed out, that as we continue to execute our strategy of going up the stack all the way from physical protocol and application layers, we'll continue to have more opportunities moving forward. Yes. So, I think the headline on demand, I think, in orders has been stability, right? I think that's sort of the theme and it holds true even in Commercial Communications where, obviously, we discussed the dynamics of customers working through inventory corrections. Some of them are in a place where they're starting to think about next year's programs. They're starting to think about other programs. But then some of them are still working through the inventory correction situation in their business. So it's really dependent on different customers. But broadly, I would say, if you look at our 5G business, the R&D parts of the opportunity continues to hold up better, and there are different drivers there. And then you referenced the base station side, actually, was also holding up in-line with quarter one. And I think on the networking side, we had slightly down quarter-over-quarter. But all-in-all, it's holding up well at this time. I don't know that I would go as far as calling a trough or calling a bottom, but I \u2013 we remain focused on delivering to our customers' road maps. And we're seeing high engagement with our customers, particularly in comms after the OFC and Mobile World Congress, I think people are starting to think about what the future might bring, and there's tremendous opportunity to innovate and nobody wants to fall behind. Thank you, Samik. Yes. I think maybe from a business model standpoint, as you know, we've been driving to increasing solutions, more software and services mix, higher ARR, and that's been part of the strategy for go-to-market and that could alter in a very moderate way, the mix. But at some point, yes, I think as demand gets back in-line, we would expect the supply and demand balance to be restored. Yes. Thank you, Mehdi. And as you know, we have a diversified portfolio, and we have diversified end market exposure that gives us plenty of opportunity to continue to expand our share position. We still only have 25% market share in our markets, and we have additional new [SAM] [ph] opportunities that I outlined at Investor Day. But if you just look at the high level, you'd say the innovation trends across our end markets continue to accelerate. And I think what we're seeing even during this time is customers are not pulling back on their long-term priorities, especially with regard to keeping their competitiveness going. And so, that is a trend that we expect to continue, and that would bode well for \u2013 in wireless Release 17 and new innovations that are coming up. And heading into 6G, which is on a road map for the industry. And in wireline, clearly, the move to 800 gig terabit Ethernet and multiple optimizations that networks have to go through in the world of AI-ML, I think that's another diversified opportunity for us that we're pretty excited about. And then you go into aerospace defense. I think research spanned across multiple nations of the world continue to remain strong as many nations are investing in organic IP. You look at supply onshoring or reshoring or security around supply chain, that is a demand driver. And when you look at semiconductor, the move \u2013 the road map is pretty secure to actually go through the progression from 7-nanometer to 5 to 3 to 2 and so on and so forth. So, we look at across our end markets, including the General Electronics business with digital health, and I didn't talk about the one that is currently inflecting, which is automotive, with EV and AV. And all these are secular trends. And I think our focus as a company on R&D innovations, enabling customers to go faster, is definitely \u2013 will put us in a good position to capitalize. Yes. And I think just to add to the point, right, it is an uncertain environment that's out there. And I think when we speak with customers, the engagement levels are high. But in terms of them planning for budgets, they're really relying on their underlying business to pick-up. And so there's that dynamic which results in an elongated cycle to close the pipeline, and so that's the case. And our guide, we try to be central weighted. We're not factoring in any macro recovery nor are we factoring in any recovery from China reopening into the guide. And those could be upside, but the macro could get worse too. So, that's the way we see it, and we'll keep you updated. Yes. Thank you. I think AI, it's safe to say that it's been under discussion for quite a long time, and you could say machine-learning algorithms are not that new. But what we're seeing now is a tick up in networks really thinking about the way to train AI models, the way to infer in an AI environment, and that creates some opportunities for us. I think Kailash has referred to that in our presentation at Investor Day as some pilots that we have going on. And fundamentally, you look at it at the high level, you have in a typical search not so traffic in the network. And with AI-ML, you have a lot of east-west traffic. And I think modeling that and being able to train your network to perform is going to become a differentiator. And I think having the full stack in wireless and [ wireline ] allows us to go address opportunities for our customers. How big that could be, I mean, to be determined. But I do know that a lot of our customers are having discussions with us at this time, and we're continuing to invest in this new emerging opportunity. Thank you. Meta, I'll take the second part first and then Neil will speak to the backlog. I think the \u2013 in comms, obviously, the big driver is new innovation, new technology trends. So, we saw strength in Release 17, non-terrestrial networks, all of the same themes that we've been talking about, and some increased investments around the globe around the next-generation technologies. And so, largely in R&D, the trends are holding.  And in production environments, our production test environments is where we're seeing much more weakness in demand as customers are digesting this excess inventory associated with smartphones and PCs and such. And our share position, even though at a lower level, continues to be strong, and we're focused on our portfolio and our portfolio continues to grow, and we'll continue to release new products in alignment with customer needs. With regard to the backlog position, obviously, we have a backlog situation. As Neil mentioned, we have a growing deferred revenue balance with increasing focus we have placed on software services and ARR. And we also, in accordance with where we're seeing the order strength, whether it's automotive or in semiconductor or in aerospace defense, we're also providing more system type of capabilities to our customers, which have longer lead times. Neil will give you more specifics. Yes. I think as we mentioned, automotive has been a fairly new vertical expansion for us, one that we focused on since Keysight was formed, and we have successfully grown that to over $500 million. And we continue to see even more opportunity to expand as there's going to be ongoing innovations in EV and AV, not only in automobiles, but in other sectors as well, with the push for autonomous and electrification even in a broader set of industries. And we're continuing to build the most comprehensive portfolio all the way from design to silicon bring up to simulation, validation, compliance testing and manufacturing with more emphasis on R&D, really. And we're helping create standards, we're also working on finding new methodologies for testing that will be disruptive. And to that extent, we've made a small technology tuck-ins that have enhanced our software content and ability to make contributions to the workflow in this area. And we see, as we think about our M&A, we see a strong pipeline for opportunities and we'll continue to evaluate them against our strategic and financial hurdles, and we'll look to lean in for the right opportunity."

As a reminder, we are hosting our 2023 Investor Day on March 7th at the New York Stock Exchange. Management is also scheduled to participate in the Morgan Stanley Investor Conference on March 8th. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Satish.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Jason. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Keysight delivered exceptional first quarter financial results, posting revenue and earnings above the high end of our guidance against a backdrop of moderating demand. Our performance and consistent execution demonstrate the resilience of our business, and despite the challenging macro dynamics, we believe Keysight is well-positioned to build on our success and expand our leadership across our end-markets. I\u2019ll focus my comments today on three key headlines. First, we achieved strong financial results. Revenue was a first quarter record and grew 14% on a core basis, driven by strength in both business segments and across all geographies. We again demonstrated the durability of our financial model and delivered $2.02 in earnings per share. Second, we started to see a normalization of what has been a robust and prolonged period of investment by our customers. Over the past two years, significant demand for Keysight\u2019s solutions resulted in a 15% compound order growth rate and a book-to-bill of 1.09. As demand slows in the near-term, Keysight\u2019s exposure to multiple end markets, its differentiated portfolio, and our strong operating discipline positions us well to weather the current macro dynamics. Third, we remain confident in the secular, long-term growth trends across our markets. Our software-centric solutions strategy is well-aligned with the needs of our customers, which we expect will enable us to outperform the market. We look forward to providing you a more comprehensive update on our long-term growth strategies and financial objectives at our upcoming Investor Day. Now let\u2019s take a deeper look at our first quarter results. Orders declined 13% year-over-year against a strong compare of 22% growth in the last year\u2019s first quarter. The slowing demand and business specific headwinds that we anticipated last quarter materialized largely as expected. These included the year-over-year impact of currency, our exit of Russia, and incremental China trade sanctions, which together contributed to a 6-point drag on the compare. We saw customers exercise caution in response to macroeconomic uncertainty. This was most notable among our largest customers in Commercial Communications, who were impacted by sharp demand decline in consumer electronics and computing segments. They are restructuring and reassessing their near-term priorities as the industry digests inventory, while at the same time maintaining investments across key, strategic programs. While the duration is difficult to predict, we expect these dynamics to weigh on our customers for at least the next couple of quarters. Despite macro challenges, revenue grew 10%, or 14% on a core basis. Strong execution and operational discipline resulted in gross margin of 65%, operating margin of 30%, and earnings per share growth of 22%. Turning to our business segments. The Electronics Industrial Solutions Group revenue grew 19% and delivered double-digit revenue growth for the 10th consecutive quarter, which underscores the diversity of our industry exposure. In automotive, we achieved record revenue and strong double-digit growth across all regions. Sales of electric vehicles continued to grow significantly in 2022, further fueling investment in EV and AV technologies and manufacturing. This quarter we secured multiple strategic wins with large OEMS and Tier 1 suppliers across a breadth of applications such as 5G, autonomous driving emulation, battery and charging infrastructure design, and in-vehicle networks. To strengthen our position in this market and capitalize on this growing, decades-long opportunity, we continue to expand our portfolio of solutions. An example is our current collaboration with Jiyun Technologies to develop a high-efficiency, compact battery test system to help accelerate the launch of new electric vehicles. In general electronics, double-digit revenue growth was driven by continued strength in emerging verticals such as digital health and IoT. We also secured wins in advanced research, as R&D investment remains robust in quantum, photonics, and Beyond 5G. Semiconductor solutions revenue growth was driven by continued fab investments in new wafer capacity and advanced nodes. While the inventory adjustments are pacing demand, foundries continue to execute their longer-term plans to globalize their production. We see significant opportunities in this market, and are investing in solutions for emerging semiconductor applications such as silicon photonics, high-power semis, and millimeter wave. Turning to our Communications Solutions Group, revenue grew 7%, with growth across both end markets and all regions. Commercial Communications revenue grew 11% on a core basis, to reach a record Q1, which was driven by ongoing, strategic investments in communications ecosystem. We saw strength in 5G R&D and deployments, Open-RAN, and datacenter networking, with increased focus on 800 gigabit and terabit communications solutions. These programs remain a priority and are driving demand for Keysight\u2019s first-to-market solutions. As a trusted advisor, we remain actively engaged with our customers as they adapt to the current macro environment. We recently announced our collaboration with Qualcomm to accelerate 5G non-terrestrial network communications for broadband in remote areas, and enable device makers to speed development and verification of 3GPP Release 17 compliant designs. We continued to support the progression of standards and submitted the first 3GPP Release 16 protocol conformance test, enabling new use cases such as private and industrial networks, and autonomous vehicles. Investment in early 6G research is underway and Keysight joined forces with 16 organizations to create 6G-SANDBOX, a pan-European testbed for 6G experimentation and validation of 5G-Advanced and 6G capabilities. Nokia recently selected Keysight\u2019s sub-Terahertz testbed to validate D band and E band technology to accelerate R&D critical to 5G-Advanced and 6G use cases in millimeter wave and sub-terahertz frequency spectrum. We also announced industry\u2019s first and highest density network cybersecurity test platform, which provides data center network infrastructure and cloud providers with leading 400 gigabit Ethernet security validation capabilities. These solutions reinforce our leadership across wireless and wireline ecosystems. We are also looking forward to Mobile World Congress in Barcelona next week. Keysight will be engaged with many customers and industry leaders, and showcasing our solutions for advancing 5G standards including Release 17 and early research in 6G and intelligent automation. Turning to our government, defense, and aerospace business, record Q1 revenue grew 9% on a core basis, achieving its second highest revenue quarter driven by increased U.S. government spending, and strength in space and satellite, including new applications for non-terrestrial networks. We recently won a five-year contract with the U.S. Army who chose Keysight\u2019s Field Fox handheld spectrum analyzer for field use. We expect U.S. government budget appropriations to ramp spending in new programs in the second half of this year. We also anticipate an increase in defense budgets worldwide, and growing investment in new technologies such as 5G, space and satellite, quantum, and advanced research. Consistent with our strategy, we continue to expand our software capabilities. We recently completed the acquisition of Cliosoft, whose data and IP management software tools enhance our portfolio of electronic design automation solutions. In addition, Eggplant\u2019s test automation platform was recently recognized as a leader by The Forrester Wave. About one-third of total revenue, the growing mix of software and services is integral to the durability of our financial model. Keysight\u2019s differentiation is a function of our software-centric solutions strategy, collaboration with our customers, and investments we are making to ensure that we address the most challenging technology needs of today, and into the future. We are prioritizing high-conviction growth opportunities to solidify our competitive position for the long-term, while at the same time accelerating initiatives to drive further efficiencies consistent with our financial model. We remain committed to creating long-term value for business stakeholders, and positively impacting the global community. I\u2019m proud that Keysight has been named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the fourth year in a row. I\u2019d like to thank all our Keysight employees for their dedication and relentless execution, which drives our strong track record of performance and is a testament to Keysight\u2019s Leadership Model, our values, and to our people. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook.\nNeil Dougherty: Thank you, Satish, and hello, everyone. Q1 was a strong quarter and a solid start to the year. We delivered revenue of $1,381 million, which was above the high end of our guidance range, and grew 10%, or 14% on a core basis. As we anticipated, macroeconomic uncertainty moderated demand in the first quarter. Orders of $1.3 billion were down 13%, or 10% on a core basis. Even with revenue outpacing orders by $80 million, we ended the quarter with over $2.5 billion in backlog. Turning to our operational results for Q1, we reported gross margin of 65% and operating expenses of $492 million, resulting in operating margin of 30%. We achieved net income of $363 million and delivered $2.02 in earnings per share, which was above the high-end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 180 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments, our Communications Solutions Group generated revenue of $939 million, up 7%, or 10% on a core basis. Commercial Communications revenue of $629 million was up 8%, with double-digit revenue growth in the Americas. Aerospace, defense and government revenue of $310 million benefited from increased U.S. government spending, which we believe will continue to ramp through FY23. Altogether, CSG delivered record gross margin of 67%, and operating margin of 29%. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated first quarter revenue of $442 million, up 19%, or 23% on a core basis, with double-digit revenue growth in automotive and general electronics, demonstrating the diversity of our markets. Growth was strongest in the Americas and Europe. EISG reported gross margin of 61%, and operating margin of 32%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our first quarter with $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generating cash flow from operations of $366 million, and free cash flow of $306 million, or 22% of revenue. Shares repurchases this quarter totaled approximately 700,000 shares at an average share price of $176, for a total consideration of $125 million. Now, turning to our outlook. We\u2019re navigating the same evolving macro and industry dynamics that others have noted. As Satish mentioned, we expect it will take at least a couple of quarters for customers to work through their near-term challenges. If the current demand environment persists through our fourth quarter, we would expect to deliver low single-digit revenue and earnings per share growth for the year, achieved through steady backlog conversion, strong cost discipline, and the flexibility of our financial model. Turning to our second quarter guidance. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1,370 million to $1,390 million, and Q2 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.91 to $1.97, based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 179 million shares. While near-term uncertainties are moderating the demand environment, Keysight\u2019s secular, long-term growth trends remain intact. Our differentiated, first-to-market solutions, durability of our financial model, steady cash generation, and strong balance sheet position us well to deliver on our commitments to our customers and shareholders. We look forward to sharing more with you about the compounding nature of our business at our upcoming Investor Day. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.\nJason Kary: Thanks, Neil. Jason, can you give the instructions for the Q&A, please?\nOperator: Yes. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.\nMark Delaney: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking the question. I was hoping, first, if you could elaborate a little bit more on the comments on orders. It seems like it\u2019s particularly impacting the Commercial Communications business and maybe certain other areas are doing a bit better. But if you could offer a bit more on where you\u2019re seeing the orders and where perhaps you\u2019re seeing some moderation from customers?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Hi Mark. What we\u2019ll do -- first, I want to start by saying our customer engagements remain very strong, robust shipment activity this quarter, and you see that reflected in the strong revenue performance. Second, our backlog is still at $2.5 billion, high-quality, low cancellations to date. And to put this demand normalization in context, I would just point to two things. First, as we said in the last earnings call, we have some business-specific headwinds, roughly 6 to 7 points, that played out. And this quarter, our comps from a year ago, we were up 22%. So putting those things in context, a little bit more deep dive I\u2019ll provide on the end markets could be helpful. In Commercial Communications, we saw the top customer pull back, especially in the wireless part of the business, due to the macro challenges and the inventory digestion that they were going through, especially with regard to the smartphone industry. We also saw equally the activity system pickup on the wireline side as customers are investing in 400 gig and 800 gig Ethernet and terabit and beyond. So, those investments remain strong. In our aerospace and defense business, we\u2019re starting to see a favorable uptick in the U.S. business as budgets are passed and program spends get unlocked. It\u2019s also important to note that the -- that all of the prime contractors had stronger backlog positions, which also gives us a good outlook as we look ahead. And our Industrial business continues to show resilience with the research spend occurring in different countries around the world, automotive with EV and AV and next-gen semi investments remaining strong as well. So, we put all of this in context and say, we remain confident in the portfolio differentiation we have and we\u2019re actively engaged with our customers, which will enable us to outperform this environment.\nMark Delaney: Thanks, Satish. That\u2019s very helpful. My other question was on the cost controls, and the Company spoke about being disciplined. Were you alluding more to the variable nature of your cost structure, and that will moderate spending depending on what demand ultimately does this year, or are there more specific steps that Keysight is planning to take on cost controls? Thank you.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Mark, as we mentioned, always that we have this variable cost structure and operating model, that\u2019s the first leg of our resilience from a financial perspective. But we\u2019re always looking for dynamic resource allocation opportunities, especially in a market like this, where we see some of our customers pull back. We redeploy to other customers who need these technologies so that we\u2019re maximizing. So that\u2019s part of that discipline that I referenced. And we always have on deck operational efficiency programs as part of the Keysight leadership model. And we\u2019re remaining focused on that, in some cases, even accelerating that. That should help us offset the inflationary impacts to the P&L as we are all faced with right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.\nMehdi Hosseini: I want to go back to booking a backlog. You guys have been very clear for a couple of quarters that post-COVID we\u2019re going to have to go through a backlog normalization. And I want to get some more color from you is, is there any way you can separate or differentiate the backlog normalization from end market demand weakness, especially in the smartphone area that you highlighted?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Maybe I\u2019ll just start, and then Neil can add. I\u2019d say that if we look at our end markets and if you take a look at the commercial comps, especially in the wireless side, the top customer pull back is definitely macro related and related to the inventory exposure that they have, which has been widely talked about. But if we look at the base customer spend, it remains pretty strong. So, that\u2019s as far as that end market is concerned, but we start to look at aerospace defense and our industrial exposure, which continues to provide us top line diversity. And I think that will play out as we go through the year as well. Neil, specific to our backlog position?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. I mean, the only thing I would add to that is maybe starting with the supply chain, we still have areas where we are supply chain constrained. But in other areas, we\u2019ve seen a pretty rapid improvement in terms of availability of product and kind of the trend towards normalization of lead times. And so what we are seeing, and I\u2019ve talked about this is something we expected. In many cases, we have products for the -- or customers for those products that have scheduled shipments now out an additional quarter and beyond. And as our lead times have come in, they don\u2019t now, at this time, need to place new orders until they get delivery of the product that\u2019s already sitting in backlog. And so, the -- if you\u2019re around 6 or 8 months, there was this tendency to place orders early to get in line to adjust for those long lead times. Now that we\u2019re seeing lead times normalize and coupled with macro uncertainty, there\u2019s no longer that incentive to get in line early and that is creating a little bit of additional pressure on the order line.\nMehdi Hosseini: Sure. And just a follow-up here. You did $1.3 billion of new orders. Is there any way we could think about the R&D portion of that order or the strategic investment that were reflected in the $1.3 billion from production? And I\u2019m just trying to better understand how we should think about the downside risk in booking activity from here? Is there like a -- is $800 million a quarter the worst-case scenario, or anything in that nature that you can offer would be very helpful.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you, Mehdi. Again, it remains a highly uncertain environment as you know. What we\u2019re seeing is customers typically firm up demand and budgets at the beginning of the year because of the concerns they have, they\u2019re pushing out those decisions to later in the year. So, the uncertainty definitely remains. But as we look at the spending environment, especially even in commercial comms, we see more pullback around manufacturing expansions relative to the R&D plans of customers. So that\u2019s generally the trend. And if you look in the ISG business, I\u2019ll say, in the semiconductor as an example, customers are not pulling back on next-gen semi capacity, right, whether it\u2019s 5-nanometer or 3-nanometer, they\u2019re actually maybe cutting back on some of the 7-nanometer work they were planning on. So, the focus on next generation remains very strong. I may -- I will ask Mark to provide some color on the customer dynamics that he\u2019s seeing in the -- from a sales perspective.\nMark Wallace: Yes. And I would -- Mehdi, I would -- just to directly answer your question, the mix during the quarter was still very predominant R&D. And Satish mentioned, the pullback was much less there and especially in commercial comms than it was on the manufacturing side. The other factor that we\u2019ve talked about in the past on other conference calls is our funnel. We have a six-month funnel that gives us a strong indication of the forward-looking demand. That has been factored into our guide. It has normalized with the effects that we saw pretty acutely here in the first quarter. And looking out six months, the demand signal looks to be fairly consistent, in line with what we saw in Q1.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Mehdi, the other point with regard to your comment on the downside risk, right? I\u2019ll say that we\u2019ve done a lot of work to enter into more of the R&D markets of our customers. That still remains a priority for us. We\u2019ve also done quite a bit of work to diversify this business to expand into industrial end markets, aerospace defense and auto in particular. And finally, through our sales footprint, we\u2019ve done work to attract new customers, and that remains a critical priority for us, and we -- which I remain confident that all of these actions will enable us to outperform in this environment as well.\nOperator: Our next question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.\nMeta Marshall: Just a couple of questions. I mean, maybe you spoke to kind of Open-RAN millimeter wave and kind of some areas of investment. I guess as we think about the communications business, could you just give us a sense of like what are the strongest revenue driver is growing in - moving into kind of calendar year 2023? Is it Open-RAN? Is the millimeter wave? Is it 6G? Just kind of some -- what is the general strength of that business coming from? And then, maybe as a follow-up question, you guys mentioned some kind of cost discipline, stronger cost discipline that you are balancing out kind of the lower demand indications from. But just a sense of where investments are still being made, just what degree of those cuts are we kind of talking about as we move throughout the year? Thanks.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Meta, thank you. So first of all, we remain intensely focused on continuing to innovate and strengthen our portfolio. So from an R&D perspective, the collaborations we have with our customers informs where we invest, and we feel pretty good about it. At best, some of these pullbacks are short-term delays for R&D spend, and we expect those to recover as our customer deals with these inventory dynamics that we mentioned. With regard to 5G, I think I would say that the R&D roadmap remains in place, right? Our customers have a multiyear roadmap, and they continue to invest to realize that roadmap. And at the big picture level, I would say while substantial progress has been made in terms of 5G deployments, we still have about roughly 1 billion subscribers in the world, and the roadmap is to take it from $1 billion to $5 billion in the next five years or so. So clearly, there\u2019s more deployment activity occurring that\u2019s in front of us with India and other parts of the world leading that effort. The standards progression, which really is a basis for R&D business with Release 16 and Release 17, moving into Release 18, which will be 5G advanced, is pretty strong. And those innovation vectors around non-terrestrial networks, new features such as RedCap for IoT applications -- proliferation of 5G into new verticals remains areas of opportunity for us that we\u2019re investing in to continue to differentiate along with Open-RAN as well, which we have talked about. But the industry roadmap remains solid, and our differentiation remains strong in these markets.\nNeil Dougherty: And then, Meta, I\u2019ll just address the cost discipline question. So, first and foremost, I\u2019d like to just emphasize that we are continuing growth-oriented investments that are going to drive this business forward in the future. We\u2019re very clear about what those priorities are internally and we\u2019re keeping our foot on the gas with regard to our most important growth-driven investments. That being said, I like the way Satish characterized it, right? We always have onset a tap of efficiency gains that we\u2019re looking to that we\u2019re looking to operate on as part of our continuous improvement culture. And given the environment that we\u2019re in with pressure on the top line, coupled with not just inflation, frankly, but signs that the dollar is going to backtrack on some of the strengthening that we saw last year, which will also put pressure on our foreign currency spending. We felt it was prudent for us to take actions to accelerate some of that efficiency. So, it\u2019s across the P&L, but we are not putting future growth investments at risk.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan.\nSamik Chatterjee: I guess if I can just start with orders. And if you can comment on the linearity of orders through the quarter based on your expectations for seeing some of this digestion from customers for another couple of quarters, so just you had more deterioration maybe as you exit the quarter. But just wanted to check if sort of what\u2019s the trend through the month in the quarter that you saw. And the comment that you made about electronics orders holding up better than communication overall. Now, I hate to sort of generalize EISG overall, but it\u2019s seems a bit counterintuitive because my impression was that communication is a bit more R&D aligned for you than EISG in general. But maybe if you can sort of correct me there or why -- explain why that\u2019s happening if R&D is most protected? And I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nMark Wallace: Sure. Samik, this is Mark. I\u2019ll take the first question on linearity of orders. And it was -- we had about two-thirds of our orders after the second month. We had a big finish to the end of FY22 and our fourth quarter. So, we had a nice rebound in December and the last quarter was about 34% of the total orders of bookings for the quarter. So, it was a pretty linear flow of business. On the electronic industrial side, what we see, as Satish mentioned, is continued demand around next-generation process technologies for our semiconductor business, very long-term secular growth drivers that we\u2019ve been talking about for a long time. The activity level and focus around the next-generation auto, EV in particular, is continuing to ramp. Again, this is a decade-long transformation. The number of EVs sold last year as opposed to ICE vehicles continues to grow. So, I see this as a long-term trend. And what I was particularly surprised with was how our general electronics business held up, particularly around some of the verticals that we\u2019re focused on, digital health care, advanced research and education. Obviously, some of this is exposed to broader GDP kind of markets, and we saw the PMI stay below 54. I think it was five or six months in a row. But in general, the three segments below EISG continued to show resilience and, overall, continued investments in these next-generation technologies.\nSamik Chatterjee: For my follow-up and maybe to just change gears here a bit, there\u2019s a competitor of yours who is going through a strategic review process with interest from multiple parties for an acquisition. I\u2019m not asking you to comment on the interest in that company in itself. But how should we think about benefits to Keysight from scaling the business in a step function from here on? And the level of -- leverage -- debt leverage on the balance sheet you would be comfortable with if attractive opportunities did come through that are more visible?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you, Samik. I\u2019d say you\u2019re right. We don\u2019t comment on any specific opportunity. I would just say that we remain confident in the business that we run, its cash generation potential. You\u2019ve seen the strong free cash flow performance of the business. And so congruent with that, we have a consistent capital allocation discipline, which is around organic growth and M&A where it makes sense and return of capital. And with regard to M&A, you\u2019ve seen us be incredibly patient and disciplined with regard to the opportunities we pursue. We look at hundreds of companies after having done market assessments on them. And then we\u2019ve done about 20 to date. And we\u2019ve been -- and we\u2019ve done them with a view of the strategy and what scale that we can bring to the target and how we see the -- first, the strategic fed, but second and equally important is the return to our shareholders. So, I think those hurdles will continue to remain in place, and we remain very disciplined.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Snyder with UBS.\nChrist Snyder: So back on the conference call in November, the Company talked about book-to-bills approaching a more normalized 1.0x. The quarter came in a bit below that at 0.94. So, were orders in the quarter softer than you would have expected back in November? Or [Technical Difficulty] for book-to-bills to improve as the year goes on and kind of reach that more normalized average of 1.0x for the full year?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. I mean, if you go back to the November quarter, we talked about 8 points of specific headwinds that we were facing from currency and from China, Russia, those things, and that we expected that we were also recognizing macro on -- softness on top of that or anticipating macro softness on top of that. So, by and large, I\u2019d say the quarter came in largely in line with our expectations. It\u2019s obviously hard to put a quantification on macro. I mean, looking forward, as Satish has said, it\u2019s very difficult to call at this point. We\u2019ve attempted to give you some parameters with which to think about the business. Mark has commented that in our funnel, which looks out over the next couple of quarters would indicate demand that\u2019s more or less in line with what we just saw in the first quarter. And then, I did state in my prepared comments that if that kind of order trend remain in place for our entire remainder of our fiscal year, we\u2019d expect to still be able to deliver a low single-digit revenue and EPS growth. So, we\u2019re taking it one quarter at a time, but that should hopefully give you some guardrails with which to think about the business.\nChrist Snyder: Thank you. I appreciate that. And then just kind of staying on orders for fiscal Q1, is there anything or color you could provide around how orders in China did during the quarter, given a lot of the disruption over there? And also government and defense business orders, just given some of the budgeting resolution processes going on? Thank you.\nMark Wallace: Sure. This is Mark. I\u2019ll comment on both of those. So we faced, as everyone did, the unanticipated breakout from COVID, and there were some incremental trade restrictions that happened in the month of December. We did see orders decline in China. They actually increased sequentially. So, that kind of indicates the unusual seasonality that we faced. But it was -- relative to what we were expecting to face with some of the declines, I was pleased with our response. And it really continues to be in line with what we\u2019ve talked about in the past, which is our ability to pivot to new opportunities and the breadth of our customer base in China, which continues to be an area of strength for us. And that includes automotive, where the business was up. Some of the private networks, which is a new use case for 5G from an industrial standpoint, continue to show signs of growth for us. Mature process technologies for semiconductor. So, as we go forward and the economy begins to normalize there and maybe reopen into the second half, we\u2019ll keep a close eye on that as well. Aerospace defense, as Satish noted in his opening comments and otherwise, we saw a strong growth -- order growth, in the U.S. That\u2019s a direct byproduct of the budget being approved much earlier this year than last year. And what we see happen in Q1 was not new program starts, but rather multiyear programs that were stalled because of continuing resolution turn back on and some of that spend continue to flow. So, as we get through the next several months and quarters, and the record high RDT&E budget flows through the process, we hope to see some additional tailwinds there. Outside the U.S., with the geopolitical situation, we expect to see continued long-term demand for defense modernization. So, we\u2019re positioned well to capture that as well.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Just maybe to add a comment to Mark, the space and satellite also continues to inflect for us in the aerospace defense business, and is showing some momentum there with customers, too.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: I\u2019m going to go back to kind of the order and backlog dynamics. Neil, I think last quarter, you had mentioned that you were maybe about four or five weeks of kind of inflated or elevated backlog relative to normal. I\u2019m curious where that stands right now? And does your low single-digit assumption assume -- growth-wise assume kind of back to normalized backlog levels through the course of the year?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. It\u2019s a great question. So obviously, revenue outpaced orders by about $80 million within the quarter. You can do the math on it. But if we see a similar environment persist for the remainder of the year, which is, again, in line with the guardrails what I put out there, we\u2019d burn $300 million plus of that kind of abnormal backlog. So, it may not get us all the way home, but it would get us a significant chunk of the way towards normalization of the backlog over a multi-quarter period. We always knew it would take multiple quarters to normalize the backlog. And while this is just one scenario, I think it\u2019s not out of line with our expectations.\nAaron Rakers: Okay. And that\u2019s helpful. And then, a quick follow-up. Just on the semiconductor business, you continue to perform well. And I don\u2019t know the answer to this question, but I\u2019ll just put it out there, is that -- is there any kind of disruptions? I think there\u2019s been a supplier in the semiconductor supply chain that had seen, I think, some cyber attack issues. Is that at all impactful to your business or not?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: No, not at all. For us, we serve the wafer stage, which is on the front end. It takes a longer lead time from our fabs to put capacity. And we see customers sticking with their plans for 5-nanometer and below. And equally, we\u2019re also quite pleased with the progression we\u2019re making to further add more applications into our solution stat, whether it is high-power applications for certain chips or silicon photonics or millimeter wave. So we continue to build that portfolio out.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup.\nJim Suva: The first part of my question is, Neil, you made the question that are the statement as the year plays out, if it does according to plan, you\u2019re looking at kind of sales growth. I think I heard you say low mid-single digits, and then you said -- and EPS growth. Did you mean the EPS growth to be positive or like in that same range of sales growth? Because typically, earnings per share grows at a bigger or a magnitude about sales growth. Then I\u2019ll have a follow-up. Thank you.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. So what I said, first of all, we weren\u2019t guiding the year. What we said is, it\u2019s a highly uncertain environment, it\u2019s difficult to know. But if the demand stays consistent with where -- what we saw in Q1 through the remainder of our year, we would expect to deliver in that scenario low single-digit revenue and low single-digit EPS growth. Obviously, our model calls for higher revenue growth than that with 40% operating leverage, which enables us to get to double-digit EPS growth. So, in a scenario where revenues are growing at a lower level, coupled with this inflationary environment, which is a bit abnormal, we\u2019d be looking at low singles for both revenue and EPS. Again, under that specific scenario where our orders remain more or less in line with what we saw in the first quarter.\nJim Suva: Great. And then my follow-up question is, I believe it was in the month of December that had the incremental trade restrictions against China. I think that\u2019s right. And so when we think about your commentary for 2023, if things are consistent, how much of sales impact is that incremental restrictions? Is that what you\u2019re referring to in your prepared commentary about the kind of 3 to 4 points -- or 6 to 7 points of growth impact, or can you just help me flesh out the impact of the trade restrictions? Thank you.\nNeil Dougherty: So, the new China trade restrictions that came about in December is an additional 1 to 2 points of headwind for us over the longer term. The comment about 6 to 7 was -- on the call last quarter, I outlined what at the time we thought was going to be 8 points of headwind coming from China, Russia and FX. As we got to the end of the quarter, what we thought was going to be 8 was more like 6.5, so call it 6 to 7, and that\u2019s largely because the dollar backed up a little bit. So, the FX impact was less than originally expected. The China impact was slightly less as well.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank.\nMatthew Niknam: Maybe just a follow-up on that last one. On the Analyst Day, I\u2019m just wondering any initial thoughts on what we could expect on March 7th in terms of just updates to longer-term targets? And then just on the M&A backdrop, I\u2019m just wondering, what\u2019s the latest you\u2019re seeing in terms of opportunities and valuations. And I know in the past you\u2019ve been focused on some smaller size software deals. I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s still the focus or maybe whether you\u2019re open to larger deals, just considering the pullback in private market valuations. Thanks.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you. I look forward to sharing the forward-looking view on the market fundamentally at the Investor Day. Across our end markets, we have -- we see innovation accelerating. And I think we\u2019ll lay out Keysight\u2019s strategy to go into set those exciting long-term opportunities. So that\u2019s number one. But I think with regard to M&A, clearly, if you look at how we\u2019ve grown, we\u2019ve been disciplined in actioning M&A of all sizes. You\u2019ve seen us do Anite and Ixia, slightly larger scale and then a lot of technology tuck-ins, which have helped us complete the workflow and actually create greater value for customers and also expand our margins in the process. So from that perspective, we remain active in exploring new markets and targets as well. But again, as I mentioned before, we have strong strategic and financial hurdles that we have to meet as gates before we go ahead and transact the business. On the valuation front, on the margin, we think the valuations are likely to come in as more of the market reality sets in with a number of the firms, so. And with the strong balance sheet and cash position, we remain active in exploring opportunities.\nOperator: Our next question is from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis.\nAdam Thalhimer: Congrats on the Q1 beat. First question on cancellations. You said that they\u2019ve been low to date. I guess I just wanted to gauge your level of concern that that could get worse.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. We\u2019ve had no increase in our cancellation rate. So we continue to believe the quality of our backlog is very high.\nAdam Thalhimer: And then I guess I\u2019m just curious, how does this downturn and what you\u2019re seeing so far compare to prior downturns? Because amazingly, you guys have been public almost 10 years, but we haven\u2019t had a prolonged recession during that period.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I think I\u2019ll take this. Satish here. Every recession, the environment is different. And I would say that after having a couple of very strong growth years, some normalization was inevitable. And what we\u2019re seeing is pull back from some of the customers in response to some of the inventory excesses in specific markets. But I go back to our portfolio position is the strongest it\u2019s ever been because of our emphasis on solutions. Our business model today is much stronger because we have -- over 33% of our business is software and services, which gives us additional resilience. And we have a strong operating model at the Company that allows us to tide over some perturbations in the marketplace. And we also enter the year with a strong backlog position as well. So from those perspectives, it\u2019s different. I also think if you look at the gross margin at the Company level, we continue to stay strong at 65%. And I think with the operational model in place, we remain confident about our ability to demonstrate that resilience.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rob Mason with Baird.\nRob Mason: Satish, frankly, I\u2019ll follow up your comment with a question just around the software orders in the quarter. I kind of inferred that they remain resilient. But as you think about where you\u2019ve seen some challenges in Commercial Communications, to the extent that there\u2019s a slowdown in renewals, or is that something that hits your radar screen as you see some of the headcount reductions take place in the tech sector? Just how you defend against that?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I think we have an incredibly sticky business with our customers, and we\u2019re not seeing them pull back on renewals. Obviously, new purchases are taking longer, as Mark alluded to earlier. But I think even in the Commercial Communications sector, we have two businesses, right, wireless and wireline. We\u2019re seeing stronger pullback from customers in the wireless side of the equation. The wireline customers continue to innovate. You see some of the trends in data center and cloud that are playing out. Need for faster data rates is important. Also in lieu of all of the activity that\u2019s going on around AI, there\u2019s a greater need to optimize the workflows of our customers. So, that part of the opportunity continues to remain stronger on a relative basis. I\u2019ll just have Mark make any comment on...\nMark Wallace: Yes. Rob, just to answer -- yes, that was -- Satish did a great job. And I\u2019ll just let you know we didn\u2019t see the pullback in software like we did in other parts of the business. As a matter of fact, our renewals were up and our growth from subscriptions and enterprise agreements remained steady, which is what you would expect from a sticky business, something that has kind of a continuous flow of value in a subscription model. So that really worked for us this quarter.\nRob Mason: Sure. Sure. Is that -- maybe just as a follow-on question, is that the influence that -- there seems to certainly be maybe a trend with -- two quarters, two years make a trend, where the first quarter gross margin is a good bit stronger in the Commercial Communications segment and then maybe steps down, moderates in the second quarter. Is that still the expectation or the dynamic at play there?\nNeil Dougherty: Could you repeat that? I\u2019m sorry.\nRob Mason: Yes. Just essentially, your communications -- CSG group gross margins tends to have a much stronger first quarter gross margin, at least going by the last couple of years, than it does the remainder of the year. Is that -- would that be the expectation this year as well?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. I mean I don\u2019t think you can draw any conclusions looking at historical sequential gross margin data as to what to expect. At least as I would think about it, any perturbations that may have appeared to have repeated have to be more coincidental than systematic.\nOperator: And our final question is from David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: The typical seasonality is for a nice sequential uptick in EISG in the second quarter. Lot of the commentary on the call has been that ESG remains pretty strong. I mean, within your second quarter guidance, should we expect kind of that historical sequential pattern in EISG?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. I mean all I would say is our sequential guide right now takes a look at our large backlog, looks at the schedule of shipments, looks at the incoming funnel. And obviously, we\u2019re going to rely on a portion of incoming orders to turn into revenue within the quarter. And so. we have a high degree of confidence in our ability to deliver to the number that we\u2019ve put out.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Got it. And then also IE -- on EISG, excuse me. The trend in gross margin has been a little bit softer over the last couple of quarters. Is there -- that being said, margin expansion -- operating margin expansion has continued to be quite good. But I\u2019m just wondering, is there something in the mix or other dynamics that you could call out to sort of explain that gross margin trend there?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Across the businesses, we\u2019re obviously looking to create value for our customers and that value expectations go up with time, greater solutions, content, greater -- software obviously increases the gross margin. You see that in our CSG business, 67% gross margin. So, we\u2019ll continue to drive that up. On the EISG business, slightly lower software content, higher mix of manufacturing offerings traditionally. But equally, our emphasis on creating solutions is not diminished. We\u2019re in fact, adding more software content, even to our semi manufacturing test systems, we\u2019re providing more analytics capabilities, and we have strong customer uptake for those. So, over time, as we come off this inflationary impacts of the supply chain and other things that we\u2019ve talked about, I would continue to expect more margin upside and look forward to sharing some of that with you at the Investor Day.\nOperator: There are no more questions, so I\u2019ll pass the call back over to the management team for closing remarks.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you, and thank you all for joining. Keysight delivered another strong quarter, revenue up 10%, strong gross margins at 65%, operating profit 30%, free cash flow of greater than $300 million. And we continue to remain focused on actively collaborating with our customer -- customers across the multiple end markets we serve as they navigate these dynamic conditions, which gives us the confidence in our ability to outperform. Again, we have a diversified end market exposure, strong solutions portfolio that\u2019s growing, strength of backlog, strong cash position and a strong balance sheet. And all of these enable us to invest to realize our long-term growth strategies. But we\u2019re doing so with the fiscal discipline and prudent operational initiatives that we have in place. We look forward to seeing you all in New York on March 7th. And I\u2019m excited to share the future growth strategy moving forward. Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes the conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Wallace",
            "content": "Yes. And I would -- Mehdi, I would -- just to directly answer your question, the mix during the quarter was still very predominant R&D. And Satish mentioned, the pullback was much less there and especially in commercial comms than it was on the manufacturing side. The other factor that we've talked about in the past on other conference calls is our funnel. We have a six-month funnel that gives us a strong indication of the forward-looking demand. That has been factored into our guide. It has normalized with the effects that we saw pretty acutely here in the first quarter. And looking out six months, the demand signal looks to be fairly consistent, in line with what we saw in Q1. Sure. Samik, this is Mark. I'll take the first question on linearity of orders. And it was -- we had about two-thirds of our orders after the second month. We had a big finish to the end of FY22 and our fourth quarter. So, we had a nice rebound in December and the last quarter was about 34% of the total orders of bookings for the quarter. So, it was a pretty linear flow of business. On the electronic industrial side, what we see, as Satish mentioned, is continued demand around next-generation process technologies for our semiconductor business, very long-term secular growth drivers that we've been talking about for a long time. The activity level and focus around the next-generation auto, EV in particular, is continuing to ramp. Again, this is a decade-long transformation. The number of EVs sold last year as opposed to ICE vehicles continues to grow. So, I see this as a long-term trend. And what I was particularly surprised with was how our general electronics business held up, particularly around some of the verticals that we're focused on, digital health care, advanced research and education. Obviously, some of this is exposed to broader GDP kind of markets, and we saw the PMI stay below 54. I think it was five or six months in a row. But in general, the three segments below EISG continued to show resilience and, overall, continued investments in these next-generation technologies. Sure. This is Mark. I'll comment on both of those. So we faced, as everyone did, the unanticipated breakout from COVID, and there were some incremental trade restrictions that happened in the month of December. We did see orders decline in China. They actually increased sequentially. So, that kind of indicates the unusual seasonality that we faced. But it was -- relative to what we were expecting to face with some of the declines, I was pleased with our response. And it really continues to be in line with what we've talked about in the past, which is our ability to pivot to new opportunities and the breadth of our customer base in China, which continues to be an area of strength for us. And that includes automotive, where the business was up. Some of the private networks, which is a new use case for 5G from an industrial standpoint, continue to show signs of growth for us. Mature process technologies for semiconductor. So, as we go forward and the economy begins to normalize there and maybe reopen into the second half, we'll keep a close eye on that as well. Aerospace defense, as Satish noted in his opening comments and otherwise, we saw a strong growth -- order growth, in the U.S. That's a direct byproduct of the budget being approved much earlier this year than last year. And what we see happen in Q1 was not new program starts, but rather multiyear programs that were stalled because of continuing resolution turn back on and some of that spend continue to flow. So, as we get through the next several months and quarters, and the record high RDT&E budget flows through the process, we hope to see some additional tailwinds there. Outside the U.S., with the geopolitical situation, we expect to see continued long-term demand for defense modernization. So, we're positioned well to capture that as well. Yes. Rob, just to answer -- yes, that was -- Satish did a great job. And I'll just let you know we didn't see the pullback in software like we did in other parts of the business. As a matter of fact, our renewals were up and our growth from subscriptions and enterprise agreements remained steady, which is what you would expect from a sticky business, something that has kind of a continuous flow of value in a subscription model. So that really worked for us this quarter."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Neil Dougherty",
            "content": "Thank you, Satish, and hello, everyone. Q1 was a strong quarter and a solid start to the year. We delivered revenue of $1,381 million, which was above the high end of our guidance range, and grew 10%, or 14% on a core basis. As we anticipated, macroeconomic uncertainty moderated demand in the first quarter. Orders of $1.3 billion were down 13%, or 10% on a core basis. Even with revenue outpacing orders by $80 million, we ended the quarter with over $2.5 billion in backlog. Turning to our operational results for Q1, we reported gross margin of 65% and operating expenses of $492 million, resulting in operating margin of 30%. We achieved net income of $363 million and delivered $2.02 in earnings per share, which was above the high-end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 180 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments, our Communications Solutions Group generated revenue of $939 million, up 7%, or 10% on a core basis. Commercial Communications revenue of $629 million was up 8%, with double-digit revenue growth in the Americas. Aerospace, defense and government revenue of $310 million benefited from increased U.S. government spending, which we believe will continue to ramp through FY23. Altogether, CSG delivered record gross margin of 67%, and operating margin of 29%. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated first quarter revenue of $442 million, up 19%, or 23% on a core basis, with double-digit revenue growth in automotive and general electronics, demonstrating the diversity of our markets. Growth was strongest in the Americas and Europe. EISG reported gross margin of 61%, and operating margin of 32%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our first quarter with $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generating cash flow from operations of $366 million, and free cash flow of $306 million, or 22% of revenue. Shares repurchases this quarter totaled approximately 700,000 shares at an average share price of $176, for a total consideration of $125 million. Now, turning to our outlook. We're navigating the same evolving macro and industry dynamics that others have noted. As Satish mentioned, we expect it will take at least a couple of quarters for customers to work through their near-term challenges. If the current demand environment persists through our fourth quarter, we would expect to deliver low single-digit revenue and earnings per share growth for the year, achieved through steady backlog conversion, strong cost discipline, and the flexibility of our financial model. Turning to our second quarter guidance. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1,370 million to $1,390 million, and Q2 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.91 to $1.97, based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 179 million shares. While near-term uncertainties are moderating the demand environment, Keysight's secular, long-term growth trends remain intact. Our differentiated, first-to-market solutions, durability of our financial model, steady cash generation, and strong balance sheet position us well to deliver on our commitments to our customers and shareholders. We look forward to sharing more with you about the compounding nature of our business at our upcoming Investor Day. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A. Yes. I mean, the only thing I would add to that is maybe starting with the supply chain, we still have areas where we are supply chain constrained. But in other areas, we've seen a pretty rapid improvement in terms of availability of product and kind of the trend towards normalization of lead times. And so what we are seeing, and I've talked about this is something we expected. In many cases, we have products for the -- or customers for those products that have scheduled shipments now out an additional quarter and beyond. And as our lead times have come in, they don't now, at this time, need to place new orders until they get delivery of the product that's already sitting in backlog. And so, the -- if you're around 6 or 8 months, there was this tendency to place orders early to get in line to adjust for those long lead times. Now that we're seeing lead times normalize and coupled with macro uncertainty, there's no longer that incentive to get in line early and that is creating a little bit of additional pressure on the order line. And then, Meta, I'll just address the cost discipline question. So, first and foremost, I'd like to just emphasize that we are continuing growth-oriented investments that are going to drive this business forward in the future. We're very clear about what those priorities are internally and we're keeping our foot on the gas with regard to our most important growth-driven investments. That being said, I like the way Satish characterized it, right? We always have onset a tap of efficiency gains that we're looking to that we're looking to operate on as part of our continuous improvement culture. And given the environment that we're in with pressure on the top line, coupled with not just inflation, frankly, but signs that the dollar is going to backtrack on some of the strengthening that we saw last year, which will also put pressure on our foreign currency spending. We felt it was prudent for us to take actions to accelerate some of that efficiency. So, it's across the P&L, but we are not putting future growth investments at risk. Yes. I mean, if you go back to the November quarter, we talked about 8 points of specific headwinds that we were facing from currency and from China, Russia, those things, and that we expected that we were also recognizing macro on -- softness on top of that or anticipating macro softness on top of that. So, by and large, I'd say the quarter came in largely in line with our expectations. It's obviously hard to put a quantification on macro. I mean, looking forward, as Satish has said, it's very difficult to call at this point. We've attempted to give you some parameters with which to think about the business. Mark has commented that in our funnel, which looks out over the next couple of quarters would indicate demand that's more or less in line with what we just saw in the first quarter. And then, I did state in my prepared comments that if that kind of order trend remain in place for our entire remainder of our fiscal year, we'd expect to still be able to deliver a low single-digit revenue and EPS growth. So, we're taking it one quarter at a time, but that should hopefully give you some guardrails with which to think about the business. Yes. It's a great question. So obviously, revenue outpaced orders by about $80 million within the quarter. You can do the math on it. But if we see a similar environment persist for the remainder of the year, which is, again, in line with the guardrails what I put out there, we'd burn $300 million plus of that kind of abnormal backlog. So, it may not get us all the way home, but it would get us a significant chunk of the way towards normalization of the backlog over a multi-quarter period. We always knew it would take multiple quarters to normalize the backlog. And while this is just one scenario, I think it's not out of line with our expectations. Yes. So what I said, first of all, we weren't guiding the year. What we said is, it's a highly uncertain environment, it's difficult to know. But if the demand stays consistent with where -- what we saw in Q1 through the remainder of our year, we would expect to deliver in that scenario low single-digit revenue and low single-digit EPS growth. Obviously, our model calls for higher revenue growth than that with 40% operating leverage, which enables us to get to double-digit EPS growth. So, in a scenario where revenues are growing at a lower level, coupled with this inflationary environment, which is a bit abnormal, we'd be looking at low singles for both revenue and EPS. Again, under that specific scenario where our orders remain more or less in line with what we saw in the first quarter. So, the new China trade restrictions that came about in December is an additional 1 to 2 points of headwind for us over the longer term. The comment about 6 to 7 was -- on the call last quarter, I outlined what at the time we thought was going to be 8 points of headwind coming from China, Russia and FX. As we got to the end of the quarter, what we thought was going to be 8 was more like 6.5, so call it 6 to 7, and that's largely because the dollar backed up a little bit. So, the FX impact was less than originally expected. The China impact was slightly less as well. Yes. We've had no increase in our cancellation rate. So we continue to believe the quality of our backlog is very high. Could you repeat that? I'm sorry. Yes. I mean I don't think you can draw any conclusions looking at historical sequential gross margin data as to what to expect. At least as I would think about it, any perturbations that may have appeared to have repeated have to be more coincidental than systematic. Yes. I mean all I would say is our sequential guide right now takes a look at our large backlog, looks at the schedule of shipments, looks at the incoming funnel. And obviously, we're going to rely on a portion of incoming orders to turn into revenue within the quarter. And so. we have a high degree of confidence in our ability to deliver to the number that we've put out."

            "name": "Satish Dhanasekaran",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Keysight delivered exceptional first quarter financial results, posting revenue and earnings above the high end of our guidance against a backdrop of moderating demand. Our performance and consistent execution demonstrate the resilience of our business, and despite the challenging macro dynamics, we believe Keysight is well-positioned to build on our success and expand our leadership across our end-markets. I'll focus my comments today on three key headlines. First, we achieved strong financial results. Revenue was a first quarter record and grew 14% on a core basis, driven by strength in both business segments and across all geographies. We again demonstrated the durability of our financial model and delivered $2.02 in earnings per share. Second, we started to see a normalization of what has been a robust and prolonged period of investment by our customers. Over the past two years, significant demand for Keysight's solutions resulted in a 15% compound order growth rate and a book-to-bill of 1.09. As demand slows in the near-term, Keysight's exposure to multiple end markets, its differentiated portfolio, and our strong operating discipline positions us well to weather the current macro dynamics. Third, we remain confident in the secular, long-term growth trends across our markets. Our software-centric solutions strategy is well-aligned with the needs of our customers, which we expect will enable us to outperform the market. We look forward to providing you a more comprehensive update on our long-term growth strategies and financial objectives at our upcoming Investor Day. Now let's take a deeper look at our first quarter results. Orders declined 13% year-over-year against a strong compare of 22% growth in the last year's first quarter. The slowing demand and business specific headwinds that we anticipated last quarter materialized largely as expected. These included the year-over-year impact of currency, our exit of Russia, and incremental China trade sanctions, which together contributed to a 6-point drag on the compare. We saw customers exercise caution in response to macroeconomic uncertainty. This was most notable among our largest customers in Commercial Communications, who were impacted by sharp demand decline in consumer electronics and computing segments. They are restructuring and reassessing their near-term priorities as the industry digests inventory, while at the same time maintaining investments across key, strategic programs. While the duration is difficult to predict, we expect these dynamics to weigh on our customers for at least the next couple of quarters. Despite macro challenges, revenue grew 10%, or 14% on a core basis. Strong execution and operational discipline resulted in gross margin of 65%, operating margin of 30%, and earnings per share growth of 22%. Turning to our business segments. The Electronics Industrial Solutions Group revenue grew 19% and delivered double-digit revenue growth for the 10th consecutive quarter, which underscores the diversity of our industry exposure. In automotive, we achieved record revenue and strong double-digit growth across all regions. Sales of electric vehicles continued to grow significantly in 2022, further fueling investment in EV and AV technologies and manufacturing. This quarter we secured multiple strategic wins with large OEMS and Tier 1 suppliers across a breadth of applications such as 5G, autonomous driving emulation, battery and charging infrastructure design, and in-vehicle networks. To strengthen our position in this market and capitalize on this growing, decades-long opportunity, we continue to expand our portfolio of solutions. An example is our current collaboration with Jiyun Technologies to develop a high-efficiency, compact battery test system to help accelerate the launch of new electric vehicles. In general electronics, double-digit revenue growth was driven by continued strength in emerging verticals such as digital health and IoT. We also secured wins in advanced research, as R&D investment remains robust in quantum, photonics, and Beyond 5G. Semiconductor solutions revenue growth was driven by continued fab investments in new wafer capacity and advanced nodes. While the inventory adjustments are pacing demand, foundries continue to execute their longer-term plans to globalize their production. We see significant opportunities in this market, and are investing in solutions for emerging semiconductor applications such as silicon photonics, high-power semis, and millimeter wave. Turning to our Communications Solutions Group, revenue grew 7%, with growth across both end markets and all regions. Commercial Communications revenue grew 11% on a core basis, to reach a record Q1, which was driven by ongoing, strategic investments in communications ecosystem. We saw strength in 5G R&D and deployments, Open-RAN, and datacenter networking, with increased focus on 800 gigabit and terabit communications solutions. These programs remain a priority and are driving demand for Keysight's first-to-market solutions. As a trusted advisor, we remain actively engaged with our customers as they adapt to the current macro environment. We recently announced our collaboration with Qualcomm to accelerate 5G non-terrestrial network communications for broadband in remote areas, and enable device makers to speed development and verification of 3GPP Release 17 compliant designs. We continued to support the progression of standards and submitted the first 3GPP Release 16 protocol conformance test, enabling new use cases such as private and industrial networks, and autonomous vehicles. Investment in early 6G research is underway and Keysight joined forces with 16 organizations to create 6G-SANDBOX, a pan-European testbed for 6G experimentation and validation of 5G-Advanced and 6G capabilities. Nokia recently selected Keysight's sub-Terahertz testbed to validate D band and E band technology to accelerate R&D critical to 5G-Advanced and 6G use cases in millimeter wave and sub-terahertz frequency spectrum. We also announced industry's first and highest density network cybersecurity test platform, which provides data center network infrastructure and cloud providers with leading 400 gigabit Ethernet security validation capabilities. These solutions reinforce our leadership across wireless and wireline ecosystems. We are also looking forward to Mobile World Congress in Barcelona next week. Keysight will be engaged with many customers and industry leaders, and showcasing our solutions for advancing 5G standards including Release 17 and early research in 6G and intelligent automation. Turning to our government, defense, and aerospace business, record Q1 revenue grew 9% on a core basis, achieving its second highest revenue quarter driven by increased U.S. government spending, and strength in space and satellite, including new applications for non-terrestrial networks. We recently won a five-year contract with the U.S. Army who chose Keysight's Field Fox handheld spectrum analyzer for field use. We expect U.S. government budget appropriations to ramp spending in new programs in the second half of this year. We also anticipate an increase in defense budgets worldwide, and growing investment in new technologies such as 5G, space and satellite, quantum, and advanced research. Consistent with our strategy, we continue to expand our software capabilities. We recently completed the acquisition of Cliosoft, whose data and IP management software tools enhance our portfolio of electronic design automation solutions. In addition, Eggplant's test automation platform was recently recognized as a leader by The Forrester Wave. About one-third of total revenue, the growing mix of software and services is integral to the durability of our financial model. Keysight's differentiation is a function of our software-centric solutions strategy, collaboration with our customers, and investments we are making to ensure that we address the most challenging technology needs of today, and into the future. We are prioritizing high-conviction growth opportunities to solidify our competitive position for the long-term, while at the same time accelerating initiatives to drive further efficiencies consistent with our financial model. We remain committed to creating long-term value for business stakeholders, and positively impacting the global community. I'm proud that Keysight has been named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the fourth year in a row. I'd like to thank all our Keysight employees for their dedication and relentless execution, which drives our strong track record of performance and is a testament to Keysight's Leadership Model, our values, and to our people. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook. Yes. Hi Mark. What we'll do -- first, I want to start by saying our customer engagements remain very strong, robust shipment activity this quarter, and you see that reflected in the strong revenue performance. Second, our backlog is still at $2.5 billion, high-quality, low cancellations to date. And to put this demand normalization in context, I would just point to two things. First, as we said in the last earnings call, we have some business-specific headwinds, roughly 6 to 7 points, that played out. And this quarter, our comps from a year ago, we were up 22%. So putting those things in context, a little bit more deep dive I'll provide on the end markets could be helpful. In Commercial Communications, we saw the top customer pull back, especially in the wireless part of the business, due to the macro challenges and the inventory digestion that they were going through, especially with regard to the smartphone industry. We also saw equally the activity system pickup on the wireline side as customers are investing in 400 gig and 800 gig Ethernet and terabit and beyond. So, those investments remain strong. In our aerospace and defense business, we're starting to see a favorable uptick in the U.S. business as budgets are passed and program spends get unlocked. It's also important to note that the -- that all of the prime contractors had stronger backlog positions, which also gives us a good outlook as we look ahead. And our Industrial business continues to show resilience with the research spend occurring in different countries around the world, automotive with EV and AV and next-gen semi investments remaining strong as well. So, we put all of this in context and say, we remain confident in the portfolio differentiation we have and we're actively engaged with our customers, which will enable us to outperform this environment. Yes. Mark, as we mentioned, always that we have this variable cost structure and operating model, that's the first leg of our resilience from a financial perspective. But we're always looking for dynamic resource allocation opportunities, especially in a market like this, where we see some of our customers pull back. We redeploy to other customers who need these technologies so that we're maximizing. So that's part of that discipline that I referenced. And we always have on deck operational efficiency programs as part of the Keysight leadership model. And we're remaining focused on that, in some cases, even accelerating that. That should help us offset the inflationary impacts to the P&L as we are all faced with right now. Yes. Maybe I'll just start, and then Neil can add. I'd say that if we look at our end markets and if you take a look at the commercial comps, especially in the wireless side, the top customer pull back is definitely macro related and related to the inventory exposure that they have, which has been widely talked about. But if we look at the base customer spend, it remains pretty strong. So, that's as far as that end market is concerned, but we start to look at aerospace defense and our industrial exposure, which continues to provide us top line diversity. And I think that will play out as we go through the year as well. Neil, specific to our backlog position? Yes. Thank you, Mehdi. Again, it remains a highly uncertain environment as you know. What we're seeing is customers typically firm up demand and budgets at the beginning of the year because of the concerns they have, they're pushing out those decisions to later in the year. So, the uncertainty definitely remains. But as we look at the spending environment, especially even in commercial comms, we see more pullback around manufacturing expansions relative to the R&D plans of customers. So that's generally the trend. And if you look in the ISG business, I'll say, in the semiconductor as an example, customers are not pulling back on next-gen semi capacity, right, whether it's 5-nanometer or 3-nanometer, they're actually maybe cutting back on some of the 7-nanometer work they were planning on. So, the focus on next generation remains very strong. I may -- I will ask Mark to provide some color on the customer dynamics that he's seeing in the -- from a sales perspective. Mehdi, the other point with regard to your comment on the downside risk, right? I'll say that we've done a lot of work to enter into more of the R&D markets of our customers. That still remains a priority for us. We've also done quite a bit of work to diversify this business to expand into industrial end markets, aerospace defense and auto in particular. And finally, through our sales footprint, we've done work to attract new customers, and that remains a critical priority for us, and we -- which I remain confident that all of these actions will enable us to outperform in this environment as well. Yes. Meta, thank you. So first of all, we remain intensely focused on continuing to innovate and strengthen our portfolio. So from an R&D perspective, the collaborations we have with our customers informs where we invest, and we feel pretty good about it. At best, some of these pullbacks are short-term delays for R&D spend, and we expect those to recover as our customer deals with these inventory dynamics that we mentioned. With regard to 5G, I think I would say that the R&D roadmap remains in place, right? Our customers have a multiyear roadmap, and they continue to invest to realize that roadmap. And at the big picture level, I would say while substantial progress has been made in terms of 5G deployments, we still have about roughly 1 billion subscribers in the world, and the roadmap is to take it from $1 billion to $5 billion in the next five years or so. So clearly, there's more deployment activity occurring that's in front of us with India and other parts of the world leading that effort. The standards progression, which really is a basis for R&D business with Release 16 and Release 17, moving into Release 18, which will be 5G advanced, is pretty strong. And those innovation vectors around non-terrestrial networks, new features such as RedCap for IoT applications -- proliferation of 5G into new verticals remains areas of opportunity for us that we're investing in to continue to differentiate along with Open-RAN as well, which we have talked about. But the industry roadmap remains solid, and our differentiation remains strong in these markets. Yes. Thank you, Samik. I'd say you're right. We don't comment on any specific opportunity. I would just say that we remain confident in the business that we run, its cash generation potential. You've seen the strong free cash flow performance of the business. And so congruent with that, we have a consistent capital allocation discipline, which is around organic growth and M&A where it makes sense and return of capital. And with regard to M&A, you've seen us be incredibly patient and disciplined with regard to the opportunities we pursue. We look at hundreds of companies after having done market assessments on them. And then we've done about 20 to date. And we've been -- and we've done them with a view of the strategy and what scale that we can bring to the target and how we see the -- first, the strategic fed, but second and equally important is the return to our shareholders. So, I think those hurdles will continue to remain in place, and we remain very disciplined. Yes. Just maybe to add a comment to Mark, the space and satellite also continues to inflect for us in the aerospace defense business, and is showing some momentum there with customers, too. No, not at all. For us, we serve the wafer stage, which is on the front end. It takes a longer lead time from our fabs to put capacity. And we see customers sticking with their plans for 5-nanometer and below. And equally, we're also quite pleased with the progression we're making to further add more applications into our solution stat, whether it is high-power applications for certain chips or silicon photonics or millimeter wave. So we continue to build that portfolio out. Yes. Thank you. I look forward to sharing the forward-looking view on the market fundamentally at the Investor Day. Across our end markets, we have -- we see innovation accelerating. And I think we'll lay out Keysight's strategy to go into set those exciting long-term opportunities. So that's number one. But I think with regard to M&A, clearly, if you look at how we've grown, we've been disciplined in actioning M&A of all sizes. You've seen us do Anite and Ixia, slightly larger scale and then a lot of technology tuck-ins, which have helped us complete the workflow and actually create greater value for customers and also expand our margins in the process. So from that perspective, we remain active in exploring new markets and targets as well. But again, as I mentioned before, we have strong strategic and financial hurdles that we have to meet as gates before we go ahead and transact the business. On the valuation front, on the margin, we think the valuations are likely to come in as more of the market reality sets in with a number of the firms, so. And with the strong balance sheet and cash position, we remain active in exploring opportunities. Yes. I think I'll take this. Satish here. Every recession, the environment is different. And I would say that after having a couple of very strong growth years, some normalization was inevitable. And what we're seeing is pull back from some of the customers in response to some of the inventory excesses in specific markets. But I go back to our portfolio position is the strongest it's ever been because of our emphasis on solutions. Our business model today is much stronger because we have -- over 33% of our business is software and services, which gives us additional resilience. And we have a strong operating model at the Company that allows us to tide over some perturbations in the marketplace. And we also enter the year with a strong backlog position as well. So from those perspectives, it's different. I also think if you look at the gross margin at the Company level, we continue to stay strong at 65%. And I think with the operational model in place, we remain confident about our ability to demonstrate that resilience. Yes. I think we have an incredibly sticky business with our customers, and we're not seeing them pull back on renewals. Obviously, new purchases are taking longer, as Mark alluded to earlier. But I think even in the Commercial Communications sector, we have two businesses, right, wireless and wireline. We're seeing stronger pullback from customers in the wireless side of the equation. The wireline customers continue to innovate. You see some of the trends in data center and cloud that are playing out. Need for faster data rates is important. Also in lieu of all of the activity that's going on around AI, there's a greater need to optimize the workflows of our customers. So, that part of the opportunity continues to remain stronger on a relative basis. I'll just have Mark make any comment on... Yes. Across the businesses, we're obviously looking to create value for our customers and that value expectations go up with time, greater solutions, content, greater -- software obviously increases the gross margin. You see that in our CSG business, 67% gross margin. So, we'll continue to drive that up. On the EISG business, slightly lower software content, higher mix of manufacturing offerings traditionally. But equally, our emphasis on creating solutions is not diminished. We're in fact, adding more software content, even to our semi manufacturing test systems, we're providing more analytics capabilities, and we have strong customer uptake for those. So, over time, as we come off this inflationary impacts of the supply chain and other things that we've talked about, I would continue to expect more margin upside and look forward to sharing some of that with you at the Investor Day. Yes. Thank you, and thank you all for joining. Keysight delivered another strong quarter, revenue up 10%, strong gross margins at 65%, operating profit 30%, free cash flow of greater than $300 million. And we continue to remain focused on actively collaborating with our customer -- customers across the multiple end markets we serve as they navigate these dynamic conditions, which gives us the confidence in our ability to outperform. Again, we have a diversified end market exposure, strong solutions portfolio that's growing, strength of backlog, strong cash position and a strong balance sheet. And all of these enable us to invest to realize our long-term growth strategies. But we're doing so with the fiscal discipline and prudent operational initiatives that we have in place. We look forward to seeing you all in New York on March 7th. And I'm excited to share the future growth strategy moving forward. Thank you."

My name is Joel and I will be your lead operator today. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded today, Tuesday, November 19th, 2024 at 1:30 PM Pacific Time. I would now like to hand the call over to Paulenier Sims, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ms. Sims.\nPaulenier Sims: Thank you and welcome, everyone, to Keysight's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Fiscal Year 2024. Joining me are Keysight's President and CEO, Satish Dhanasekaran; and our CFO, Neil Dougherty. In the Q&A session, we will be joined by Chief Customer Officer, Mark Wallace. The press release and information to supplement today's discussion are on our website at investor.keysight.com under Financial Information and Quarterly Reports. Today's comments will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. We will also make reference to core growth, which excludes the impact of currency movements and acquisitions or divestitures completed within the last 12 months. The most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations are on our website and all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. We will make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company on today's call. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. We assume no obligation to update them and encourage you to review our recent SEC filings for a more complete view of these risks and other factors. Lastly, management is scheduled to participate in upcoming investor conferences hosted by Wells Fargo and Barclays. And now I will turn the call over to Satish.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. My comments will focus on three key headlines. First, Keysight executed well and delivered fourth quarter revenue and earnings per share above the high-end of our guidance range under market conditions, which remain consistent with our expectations. Orders finished slightly above our expectations and grew 1% year-over-year and 8% sequentially, driven by ongoing strength in AI and strong year-end bookings in our US Aerospace, Defense and Government Business. Second, strong execution and cost discipline drove full-year revenue of $5 billion and earnings per share of $6.27, which were down from record highs of 2023. Results were paced by gradual improvement throughout the year with better performance in the second half as expected. Under challenging market conditions, we demonstrated the resilience of our business model by delivering 26% operating profit and over $900 million in free cash flow. We also returned approximately 50% of free cash flow to shareholders through repurchases. Third, we progressed our software-centric solutions strategy by investing to realize organic growth opportunities through innovation and industry collaborations, while expanding the breadth of our solutions through selective M&A. As we look ahead, the strength of our differentiated portfolio, deep engagement with customers and the accelerating pace of technology innovation gives us confidence in our ability to outperform as markets recover. Now let's begin with an overview of Keysight's fourth quarter business performance. Communications Solutions Group revenue was flat year-over-year and grew 6% sequentially with growth across both Commercial Communications and Aerospace, Defense and Government. CSG orders returned to growth for the full-year, reflecting AI momentum in wireline, stability in wireless and consistent strength in ADG. In wireline markets, demand remains strong due to ongoing expansion in AI data center infrastructure even as telco investments continue to be muted. As the timeline for 800 gig and 1.6 terabit adoption accelerates, the industry is investing in advanced technologies, including silicon photonics, chiplets and high-speed electrical and optical interconnects. Keysight continued to expand its portfolio of solutions across the technology stack to enable customers in both R&D and manufacturing. At the Open Compute Project in San Jose, Keysight showcased our newly introduced AI workload and system emulation solution in collaboration with academia and hyperscalers. Our solution provides high fidelity emulation of AI model training and inferencing workloads to optimize training time and benchmark AI infrastructure performance. At ECOC Conference, Keysight showcased physical and protocol AI solutions with industry leaders to enable 800 gig interoperability with critical optical and electrical interface technologies. In wireless, demand was stable as smartphone industry nears the end of its inventory correction and telco CapEx normalizes from peak levels. Investment continues in Open RAN expansion, ongoing standards progression with emphasis on non-terrestrial networks and early 6G research. This quarter, we announced multiple O-RAN collaborations with industry leaders such as NTT DOCOMO, DISH Networks and Pegatron. We also collaborated with Qualcomm to establish industry's first end-to-end interoperability and data connection in the candidate frequency band for 6G FR3. We're also well poised to drive industry innovation forward with our differentiated full-stack solutions. Turning to Aerospace, Defense and Government stronger-than-expected seasonality drove orders to an all-time high. The funnel of opportunities remain strong. The US defense budget is expected to grow low-single digits, while government investment in defense modernization in Europe and Asia is projected to increase. Customer engagements on electromagnetic spectrum operations, radar and advanced communication use cases remains high. Satellite communication investments is expected to continue as more LEOs constellations are launched over the next few years. Keysight is capitalizing on the growing investment in defense modernization around the globe. At the recent European Microwave Conference, we showcased our leading capabilities in phased array, over-the-air compact antenna design and test in collaboration with analog devices. We also highlighted our latest flagship performance network analyzer. It's differentiated and industry-leading capabilities include wide band, high dynamic range, pre-selective receivers for faster S-parameter measurements to enable customers' high-frequency component designs. Turning to Electronic Industrial Solutions Group, revenue was down year-over-year as expected, but grew mid-single-digits sequentially. Orders were mixed with year-over-year growth in semi and general electronics, offset by automotive market headwinds. In semiconductor, robust demand drove strong order growth for our parametric wafer test solutions. We saw broad-based foundry investment to expand capacity and address leading-edge applications driven by AI. This included advanced DRAM technologies such as high-bandwidth memory and DDR5 as well as silicon photonics. Enabling further advances in power semiconductor production and efficiency, this quarter Keysight introduced an innovative single pass 3 kilowatt high voltage wafer test solution. In Automotive, the industry is facing challenges and we expect the headwinds to continue in 2025. This quarter, production-related demand was sequentially stable, while we saw incrementally cautious pending due to slowing EV sales and battery oversupply. Even with near-term headwinds, we remain focused on customers' emerging innovation and design needs. Our R&D engagements for software-defined vehicle as well as broader electrical and physical design applications remain high. ESI grew its solution business this year through steady renewals and new customer additions. Over this period, the ESI team also made significant contributions to the use of AI to improve product performance simulations and offering workflow solutions with immersive visualization to validate assembly and servicing. In general electronics, we saw stable manufacturing demand, albeit at lower levels, and a modest sequential improvement in consumer and industrial high-speed connectivity applications. Public and private sector investment in support of advanced research and technology workforce development grew this quarter and digital health application demand was again strong. Turning to Software and Services, revenues grew 8% this quarter and accounted for 39% of total Keysight revenue. Annual recurring revenue from Software and Services also grew 16% to approximately $1.5 billion and accounted for roughly 30% of Keysight overall. We saw solid growth in our design engineering software portfolio in 2024 reflecting the expansion of virtual prototyping across a broad range of industries. As a recognized thought leader in RF EDA, Keysight was selected to lead a US government joint public and private sector effort to leverage AI and machine-learning to automate and bring efficiencies to complex RF integrated circuit designs. In summary, Keysight has continued to sustain strategic progress and momentum through the downturn. The flexibility and discipline of our operating model has proven our ability to deliver strong financial results and healthy cash flows in a variety of economic conditions. We have positioned the business to emerge stronger as markets recover to capitalize on the opportunities ahead of us and to create value for all stakeholders. Before I conclude, I'd like to sincerely thank our employees once again for all their outstanding contributions, commitment and strong track-record of execution under a variety of market conditions. With that, I'll turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook.\nNeil Dougherty: Thank you, Satish, and hello, everyone. Fourth quarter revenue of $1,287 million was above the high-end of our guidance range and down 2% or down 5% on a core basis. Orders of $1,345 million were up 1% as reported or down 1% on a core basis. Backlog increased $53 million in the quarter to finish at $2.4 billion. Looking at our operational results for Q4, we reported gross margin of 64.5%. Operating expenses of $497 million were up 5% year-over-year. Q4 operating margin was 26% or 28% on a core basis. Turning to earnings, we achieved $288 million of net income and delivered earnings per share of $1.65. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 174 million shares. For the full-year, Keysight generated revenue of $4,979 million, down 9% as reported or down 12% on a core basis. Gross margin was 65% down 60 basis points versus the prior year. We sustained investment in R&D at $871 million or 17.5% of revenue, while driving further operating efficiencies in SG&A, which declined 7% excluding acquisitions. Full year core operating margin of 26.5% was down 370 basis points continuing to outperform Keysight's down cycle model and demonstrating the financial resilience of the business. Net income of $1.1 billion resulted in earnings per share of $6.27. Moving to the performance of our segments. The Communications Solutions Group generated fourth quarter revenue of $894 million flat as reported or down 2% on a core basis. Commercial Communications revenue of $591 million grew 4% while Aerospace, Defense and Government revenue of $303 million declined 6%. Altogether CSG delivered gross margin of 67% and operating margin of 28%. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated revenue of $393 million down 6% or 11% on a core basis. EISG reported gross margin of 58% and operating margin of 21%, an increase of approximately 100 basis points versus the prior quarter. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents generating cash flow from operations of $359 million and free cash flow of $328 million. Share repurchases this quarter totaled 974,000 shares at an average price per share of approximately $154 for a total consideration of $150 million. Full-year share repurchases totaled $439 million or 49% of the $905 million in free cash flow generated this year. Now turning to our outlook. We expect the demand environment to remain mixed and for recovery to occur gradually through the year, barring any further macro degradation. Our base case assumptions for FY'25 are for revenue growth at the low end of our 5% to 7% long-term target and earnings growth in line with our 10% target. As a reminder, the timing of ESI's annual contract renewals typically results in 40% to 45% of their full-year revenue being recognized in our fiscal first quarter with the balance recognized relatively evenly over the remainder of the fiscal year. For the rest of the business, we are modeling the typical mid-single-digit seasonal decline in revenue from Q4 to Q1. As a result, we expect first quarter revenue to be in the range of $1,265 million to $1,285 million and Q1 earnings per share in the range of $1.65 to $1.71 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 174 million shares. Now a few modeling considerations for the full-year. Given the annual ESI contract renewals in Q1, we expect a material sequential decrease in ESI revenue in Q2. And over the same period, we expect a low-single-digit increase in core Keysight revenue. At current debt levels, annual interest expense is expected to be approximately $70 million, capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $150 million and we are modeling a 14% non-GAAP effective tax rate for FY'25. With that, I will now turn it back to Paulenier for the Q&A.\nPaulenier Sims: Thank you, Neil. Operator, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A?\nOperator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nAaron Rakers: Yeah, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the results. I guess my first question is, I want to ask you about the wireless piece of the business. It seems to be recovering. I think it was kind of mid-single-digit if I'm correct from the presentation order growth in the quarter. I'm just curious of how you, I guess, the past conversations suggested that's more of a stabilizing business as we move through this year. Has that started to change? Has your view of growth kind of recovery in that business started to evolve or deepen as we look through this next fiscal year?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yeah, thank you, Aaron. Indeed a good quarter. We executed well and capitalized on the opportunities we saw. Specific to your question on wireless, we continue to feel more confident, I would say, after two quarters where the business has stabilized. And we're seeing more strengths on the infrastructure side where there's more activity from customers around Open RAN and 6G research. So that drives that. And on the devices side, it's lagging a little bit where customers still continue to be focused on ongoing standards evolutions. So, I mean, at this point, we continue to believe that the business will remain stable in '25. We'll call it when we see it. But we continue to feel good about the ongoing momentum we're seeing in our wireline business that's driven growth for commercial communications.\nAaron Rakers: Yeah and then as a quick follow up kind of sticking with looking at some of the segments. The Aerospace and Defense segment, I'm curious because this question come up with some investors. It sounds like you're pretty confident that, that business continues to progress on the growth profile that you outlined. But have you seen any areas of concern or any kind of churn in programs, et cetera, around some of the federal dynamics of spend? Any uncertainties around that, that you would point to?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yeah, I think the Aaron, the long-term trajectory of that business is actually the one that is easiest to forecast given the budget clarity that typically gets and the priorities that get set both in the US and in allied nations. And if you look at electromagnetic spectrum operations, space and satellite and other areas, those are the areas where defense modernization investments are moving to and we feel good about our position. Relative to the year, obviously, orders were slightly down year-over-year, but off of a record compare from a year-ago. And some of the wins that we had were systems wins, which take us a little longer to ship. So you haven't yet seen that in the revenue line. But as we look ahead, obviously, the short-term with the administration change in the US does bring some uncertainties. But even at times like in 2016 where that happened, we just had some business more out between quarters and so we'll monitor the situation, but we feel good about the current situation with regard to our business there.\nAaron Rakers: Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Rob Mason with Baird. Your line is now open. I apologize. The next question is from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nTim Long: Thank you. Yeah, two for me as well. First, could you -- you mentioned AI leading the strength in wireline, obviously a lot going on there, a lot of activity. Could you maybe expand a little bit on how big that business is getting for you and maybe some examples of newer areas that Keysight is being pulled into because of the move in AI? And then the second one, I just wanted to follow-up on the software services up to 39% of revenues here. Maybe just talk a little bit about that evolving part of the business model and how Keysight is going to be able to move that number further and maybe impact on gross margin as that moves higher as well? Thank you.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Tim. Clearly, the wireline business has gained momentum this year driven by AI, but this is one of the examples of proof-of-concepts that I highlighted at Investor Day of last year. And so we're quite pleased with the way the opportunity has progressed. Our wireline business has exceeded over $1 billion in orders this year, growing at double-digit rates. And we service a broad set of customers in that industry, right. You think about silicon designers, system integrators, NEMs, hyperscalers and contract manufacturers. So it's actually a broad set of customers. But what's driving the activity in AI right now is actually a concentrated set of customers from hyperscalers that are investing in large infrastructure upgrades. So that's the effort. And the supply chain right now continues to be constrained. So investments are being made to unlock the supply chain to enable the scale to build. And so we're involved in that. We're capitalizing on that. But as we think about the future, we participated in some forums like the OCP and ECOC earlier this year and you can start to see the scale expand. It's not yet reflected in the results yet, but we start to build scale around compute, whether it's centralized or at the edge, power and thermal being very big issues for companies. Networking technologies are being adopted, maybe even faster than they were being adopted before this AI became a big trend. And our opportunities we're excited about are not just in the physical layer, but in the protocol layer, allowing customers to emulate how traffic flows through an AI infrastructure and therefore optimize their investments. So we're pretty excited about the opportunities long-term here and capitalizing on the near-term strength.\nNeil Dougherty: Yeah. And then as it relates to Software and Services, obviously continuing to see a nice mix-shift towards those portions of our business. And as I think the part of your question address gross margin, there could be, software portions of those businesses are accretive to Keysight's average gross margin, the services portions are slightly dilutive to Keysight's average gross margin, but overall both the service business has a lower expense structure, so both contribute nicely to profitability when you think about it from the operating margin line.\nMark Wallace: And then, Tim, I would just add, this is Mark. As far as the expansion, we've shown that it's more resilient to the current macro. Customers continue to invest in new methods shifting left on virtual simulation and emulation of their systems to help reduce costs and increase efficiencies and we're seeing that. And then the second part, of course, is the further leverage of some of our new assets like ESI, it being exposed to more of our customers in different regions, the US for Aerospace, Defense parts of Asia with a broad Keysight footprint in those regions. We see that as a driver for additional growth as we go forward.\nTim Long: Okay. Thank you.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Tim.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Rob Jamieson with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.\nRobert Jamieson: Hey, guys. Congrats on the quarter. Just a couple of quick ones from me. Just first on the Communications business. Just what kind of benefit could we see from the funding just in second half of '25? I mean is there much benefit there if that funding does get actually released and finally comes to fruition? And then I guess also any potential risk of that being reversed just given some of Trump's advisors at this point that have been anti-BEAD funding?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yeah, I think the good thing about Keysight's business model in comps and in fact rest of our business is the broad set of customers we serve. That diversity and breadth is a source of great strength during times of change. And so while we do pick up some incremental business every year from new logos that come up because they're funded directly or indirectly there are some direct funding from government at times that flows into Open RAN. We've called some of those wins out and even the CHIPS Act, but we're not heavily tethered to any one of those things. So I would just say that those are incremental in some ways, but not as material as maybe the headlines enthusiastic especially because we're more involved in the R&D side of those labs and so we feel good. I think the momentum we see because of our renewed focus on go-to-market expansion that we had put in place with marketing is the continued attraction of new logos that we see across our business. It continues to be the focus for us moving forward as well.\nRobert Jamieson: That's really helpful. I appreciate that. And then I guess just on tariffs just real quick. And just -- you guys have been dealing with this in one way or another for over eight years. Can you just talk about your previous strategies around your pivots in the APAC region, just whether it's been Huawei, ZTE or even the Trump tariffs, just how you've kind of managed that in the past?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yeah, I would just say it's probably, it's a question behind the question if I'm understanding you right is what are the implications of the US elections and therefore the policy changes that might ensue. And so like everybody, we're monitoring three areas, tax, trade, both tariffs and trade restrictions, right, the areas and along with defense spending that might ensue. It would be premature for us to comment on them, except to say that we've been pretty agile in ensuring compliance when there is a new government restriction and pivoting our sales resources to go after new opportunities. A potential offset could be and again I'm breaking my rule and speculating a little bit is if there were to be tariffs of the orders being discussed, many companies are looking to more of China into other areas in Southeast Asia and we remain prepared to capitalize on the opportunities if should that occur.\nRobert Jamieson: Got it. Similar to like what we saw with reshoring and everything during supply chain disruptions, the benefit that we saw there.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Exactly.\nRobert Jamieson: Great. Thank you very much.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Rob Mason with Baird. Your line is now open.\nRobert Mason: Good afternoon. And again nice jump on the quarter. Just with respect to your thoughts around 2025 revenue. Satish, I know you covered some of the segments, but just at a high-level I mean is it fair to think you think all of your major, I'll say segments, again we're talking wireline, wireless, automotive, general electronics, some of these verticals. Would all of them have an opportunity to grow in '25 do you think within the kind of mid-single-digit profile that you're talking about? Automotive sounds like maybe it was the most challenge, but I'd just like to get your thoughts there around all.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yeah, that's good. Look, our job number one, Rob, was to stabilize the business and return to order growth, which we set out as a priority for the second half and I'm quite pleased that we've executed to that. Now looking at the facts, you'd say CSG has returned to growth in the -- for the full-year from an order perspective and EISG is yet to do that. So that sort of summarizes the mix demand environment. And just projecting forward, we expect continued sort of slow gradual recovery as we move into 2025. We're not baking in, in our base case all segments inflecting. And should that happen, we'll be prepared to capitalize on it. But our base case that Neil's called out at -- in his outlook section is for 5% revenue growth and 10% EPS growth for the year.\nRobert Mason: Yes. Okay, that's helpful. And just as a follow up and maybe just directed to Neil just with the higher ESI revenue in the first quarter, I would assume that the gross margin will reflect that at least sequentially. Could you maybe give us a little bit of thoughts around your OpEx as you trend in from fourth quarter into first quarter, there's often some resets. I know seasonality as well influences that, but I'm just kind of curious what kind of trajectory OpEx is on as you enter the new year?\nNeil Dougherty: Yeah, let me just touch on a couple of seasonality related comments since you've opened the door to that. I think, first of all, as you mentioned with regard to gross margin, with the sizable uptick in ESI revenue, we would expect some gross margin upside from that business in Q1. Similarly, though, then as you move from Q1 to Q2, you have reverse effect as that revenue comes out of the model. So just if you put it on one side, you got to take it out on the other side. With regard to OpEx, just reminding you of some things that are kind of the norm for Keysight, we do salary administration for the entire company here in the first quarter of the year. So that will be impacting the P&L starting essentially now. And then as the business inflects from a period of contraction back to a period of growth, we have essentially our variable pay programs turning back on, which will increase OpEx here starting in the first half of next year.\nRobert Mason: Very good. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nMatthew Niknam: Hey, guys. Thank you so much for taking the question. On macro, I'm curious if you can speak to how that backdrop has evolved over the last quarter? It seems like there's some pockets that are getting better yet. It seems like others like auto that are maybe a little bit softer. So any general commentary on the macro backdrop you can provide? And then just as a follow-up on Aerospace, Defense can you talk about maybe what changed later in the quarter? You mentioned a very strong closeout to the quarter, particularly around the US. I'm just curious in terms of what changed and how maybe that's trended into the start of fiscal 1Q? Thanks.\nNeil Dougherty: Yeah, why don't I start maybe by making some comments about macro and then we'll let Mark Wallace make some comments about the broader Aerospace, Defense business. So first of all, as Satish mentioned in his prepared comments, the results in Q4 were marginally better than we expected coming into the quarter. And so I think that's possible. A lot of that strength itself was in Aerospace, Defense and so Mark will talk about that. But I think as you think about macro changes and the previous question alluded to this as well, I think the automotive business is where we're seeing the most pressure significant pullback in spend around EV development at this point in time, which is impacting that industry pretty significantly. I think if you look across broader strength in wireline stability, maybe not yet a strong catalyst for growth in wireless, but at least stability, a nice forward momentum in Aerospace, Defense. I think with regard to semi, it's a question of timing. When do -- I think everybody is optimistic about a turn back on in semi. The question is when does that really begin in earnest. And then the industrial end markets, maybe the biggest question mark because I think some of that is going to be tied to how a lot of that capacity that was put in place during the '21, '22, '23 supply chain disruptions. Over what time is that capacity fully absorbed and people start to once again reinvest in manufacturing capacity? So that's kind of how we're thinking through the end markets from a macro perspective.\nMark Wallace: Yeah, and Matt, I think the Aerospace, Defense as Satish talked about, the focus on defense modernization has remained a top priority in the US and allied nations. We had continuing resolution in the first part of last fiscal year, the government fiscal year '24, which put some delays on new program starts. So as we entered into the fourth quarter with the government fiscal year-end in September, we saw increased spend as we would normally see, which was not certain because of delays in the budgeting process. So that was a big positive. We see continued investments from the prime contractors as well as the direct government in the US and the prime contractors in Western Europe as well as we've been talking about for many quarters due to the geopolitical situation that continues to unfold. So those factors come together. And then longer-term I think the areas that are promising for us continue to be around EMSO space and satellite and quantum with some of the government-funded research that's occurring in all parts of the world continue to offer us opportunities over the coming quarters.\nMatthew Niknam: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess for my first one, Satish, if I can go back to your comments earlier about not really embedding sort of inflection in all of the businesses and your 5% growth target for fiscal '25. How should I think about what kind of recovery or what your expectations are embedded in for semi-cap and general electronics? It seems like both are a bit mixed in terms of what you're seeing, but if you can just outline how you're thinking about those two areas in particular? And I have a quick follow-up after that. Thank you.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Samik. I think for semiconductor fabs, just based on what we're seeing and the pipeline of opportunities we see for our wafer test solutions around silicon photonics and new memory topologies and some of the higher voltage types of wafers, I think that strength continues for us in somewhat a little bit offset by and that's the bigger part of our semi business, somewhat offset by a slowdown that a number of the semiconductor equipment manufacturers have reported as well. So you put that in the mix. We still think semi grows from these levels for us. And again semiconductor is, as you know, is roughly 10% of our total revenue at the company level. From a general electronics perspective, what we have started to see and again one quarter doesn't make a trend. So I just want to caution you. But I do think in Q4, we saw stability in manufacturing, which finally resulted in the underlying strength in research spending around next-generation technologies, the broad new customer logo, all of that return that business to growth. Again, it's just one quarter, but we think that stability in manufacturing continues as we move forward as well, which should give some -- which should return -- which should put EISG on return to order growth at some point in the year, it's difficult to call at this point.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay, correct. And for my follow-up, maybe this is more for Neil. I think, Neil, a question you're getting a lot from investors is when they look at some of your previous margin targets that were a bit more longer-term for fiscal '26, you're not really that much different at this point from a gross margin perspective where the guidance was 66% to 67%, but you significantly had a gap to your operating margin target of 31% to 32%. How should we think about the drivers and sort of beyond volume leverage, how you're thinking about other drivers that get you closer to that target or is there something that sort of needs to be revaluated relative to those targets? Thank you.\nNeil Dougherty: Yeah, I'd say a couple of things. So first of all, I think we're pleased with how gross margins have held up on the downside of the cycle. Obviously, we've gotten some benefit here from the addition of the ESI software business, but even if you look at the core Keysight business, the gross margins have held up pretty well in total on the downside of the cycle. I think when you start to think about those targets that we put out, 66%, 67% operating margin targets where again we're 150 basis points, 200 basis points off of that at current levels. And but we're significantly further off on the operating margin line. I think you need to look at the impact that the acquisitions are having in the short-run where we've made some acquisitions that are accretive to gross margins, but significantly dilutive to operating margins. And I think as we get those businesses integrated and start to operate them within the greater Keysight operating model, there's going to be opportunity for us to drive significant profit leverage on those acquisitions and start to close that gap on the operating margin side. Thanks.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: And Samik we remain confident in the long-term growth opportunities of this business. And you've seen when we can deliver above model growth rates, the sort of earnings power and leverage we have, we continue to operate this business in a disciplined way to be able to realize those and get us back on track.\nSamik Chatterjee: Sure. Thank you. Thanks a lot.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nKaran Juvekar: Hi. This is Karan on for Meta. Congrats on the quarter. So just starting on the Automotive side. Clearly, you remain quite positive on simulation. But outside of that, are there any other exposures that you have within auto that could cause a pickup in the business outside of maybe EV sales improving? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nMark Wallace: Sure. Yeah, so there are several parts to automotive. The part that we're seeing, the slowdown and project delays is around EV investments that have been quite robust over the last several years with battery test labs. So we're seeing a pause in that. We're seeing manufacturing demand also stay lower levels, but that's another part of our business that as inventories normalize that we should see some increasing flow through of manufacturing test for that. The part that's remained steady is the software defined vehicles or the ADAS, the autonomy side, where we have continued innovation crossing over multiple parts of our business into communications, sensor technology and so forth, and a lot of that is software as well. So there's a lot of work being done in that frame. And the other one that doesn't get as much attention, at least from these calls, but gets a lot of attention on the news is the infrastructure. So the charging infrastructure and the standards associated with those in every region of the world represents additional opportunities that we're pursuing. So long-term drivers of growth, secular drivers around AV, the manufacturing coming back on new advanced technologies remains an area of focus for us over many years.\nKaran Juvekar: Got it. That's helpful. And then coming back to the AI side. Are there any areas that you see in your portfolio that you could maybe grow content or offer new products to sort of take advantage of the opportunity that you're seeing today? Thank you.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yeah, good question. I think as we mentioned, the more logical areas which we have seen growth come from to date or results come from to date are associated with the physical layer tools where we provide our oscilloscopes, our sampling scopes and other tools that we provide. And what we're seeing is a bigger opportunity for our emulation platforms we're still in early pilots with customers on. Again, it's a small, it's a concentrated set of opportunities today. We expect that industry and the impact AI is going to have to be broader and we're participating in enabling the ecosystem with the right set of tools all the way from design, emulation to test and our focus is on enabling our customers in the R&D parts of the workflow and it's a pretty rich opportunity for us. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Your line is now open.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Congrats on the beat. And Mark, congratulations on your retirement.\nMark Wallace: Hey, thanks, Adam.\nAdam Thalhimer: I wanted to ask first about the operating margin in Communications. I think that was your best ever quarterly operating margin. It kind of took me by surprise. Curious what drove that and what the outlook is there?\nNeil Dougherty: Yeah. So obviously, we are very pleased with the results in CSG. Gross margins have held up very strong in that business. I think we see a tight, not only do we see a higher software content, higher recurring revenue from software, which obviously helps margins, but I think there's less margin diversity in the CSG portfolio than we see on the ESG side. So less impact from mix. From a profitability standpoint, I think we're very pleased that we're keeping our foot on the gas. On the R&D side, continuing to invest to position ourselves to capitalize on the upside while driving significant efficiencies and SG&A resulting in the strong profitability that we saw. So it was the strongest profitability we saw this quarter, not an all-time record, obviously, but very strong operating margins in CSG this quarter.\nAdam Thalhimer: And then in EISG, as you think about the full-year, what are the growth offsets to the weakness in auto?\nNeil Dougherty: You're talking about in '24 and '25?\nAdam Thalhimer: For fiscal '25 what offsets in auto this year.\nNeil Dougherty: Yeah, I mean, I think as Satish look forward, as we look to semi and to the broader industrial markets, there is reason for optimism with some of the fab programs and the absorption of capacity that was put in place in prior years, again, likely to be more back-end loaded. We've talked about at the Keysight level of gradual improvement through the year. And so as Satish just said we would expect there is an opportunity for EISG, which has not yet returned to order growth to do so in the back half of the year. And I think that would be with some significant increase in the strength of the semi markets and some modest recovery in industrial end markets.\nAdam Thalhimer: Got it. Thanks, Neil.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nWilliam Bryant: Hey, thank you for taking my question. You have Will on for Mark Delaney here. Just one on M&A. So, with the proposed Spirent transaction still ongoing, will Keysight be open to do other larger transactions in the near-term if one that made business and financial sense was available?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yeah, I would just say, look, we have reiterated a very strong organic growth strategy that we're focused on realizing. We've also identified specific markets that we have studied to pursue a selective M&A. And at this point, while we continue to evaluate targets, we always remain disciplined and we'll look at them. But it's not a matter of capital as much as bandwidths to pursue more deals given the deals that we've already announced, which we're working through.\nWilliam Bryant: No, extremely helpful. Thank you for that. And just one more on capital allocation. How should we be thinking about buybacks for fiscal '25? Any cadence commentary or any color that you can add there would be helpful. Thank you.\nNeil Dougherty: Yeah, the only thing I would say is that obviously, we look forward to the close of the Spirent transaction, which will be a significant capital outlay for the company. And but we do expect that we will at a minimum continue with our buyback program at at-least the anti-dilutive level and then we'll be trying to strike a balance between starting to get the cash ready to close the Spirent transaction traded off against what we might see as opportunistic opportunities to do more on the buyback front.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the call back to Paulenier Sims for any closing comments.\nPaulenier Sims: Thank you, operator, and thank you all for joining us today. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes our conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Neil Dougherty",
            "content": "Thank you, Satish, and hello, everyone. Fourth quarter revenue of $1,287 million was above the high-end of our guidance range and down 2% or down 5% on a core basis. Orders of $1,345 million were up 1% as reported or down 1% on a core basis. Backlog increased $53 million in the quarter to finish at $2.4 billion. Looking at our operational results for Q4, we reported gross margin of 64.5%. Operating expenses of $497 million were up 5% year-over-year. Q4 operating margin was 26% or 28% on a core basis. Turning to earnings, we achieved $288 million of net income and delivered earnings per share of $1.65. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 174 million shares. For the full-year, Keysight generated revenue of $4,979 million, down 9% as reported or down 12% on a core basis. Gross margin was 65% down 60 basis points versus the prior year. We sustained investment in R&D at $871 million or 17.5% of revenue, while driving further operating efficiencies in SG&A, which declined 7% excluding acquisitions. Full year core operating margin of 26.5% was down 370 basis points continuing to outperform Keysight's down cycle model and demonstrating the financial resilience of the business. Net income of $1.1 billion resulted in earnings per share of $6.27. Moving to the performance of our segments. The Communications Solutions Group generated fourth quarter revenue of $894 million flat as reported or down 2% on a core basis. Commercial Communications revenue of $591 million grew 4% while Aerospace, Defense and Government revenue of $303 million declined 6%. Altogether CSG delivered gross margin of 67% and operating margin of 28%. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated revenue of $393 million down 6% or 11% on a core basis. EISG reported gross margin of 58% and operating margin of 21%, an increase of approximately 100 basis points versus the prior quarter. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents generating cash flow from operations of $359 million and free cash flow of $328 million. Share repurchases this quarter totaled 974,000 shares at an average price per share of approximately $154 for a total consideration of $150 million. Full-year share repurchases totaled $439 million or 49% of the $905 million in free cash flow generated this year. Now turning to our outlook. We expect the demand environment to remain mixed and for recovery to occur gradually through the year, barring any further macro degradation. Our base case assumptions for FY'25 are for revenue growth at the low end of our 5% to 7% long-term target and earnings growth in line with our 10% target. As a reminder, the timing of ESI's annual contract renewals typically results in 40% to 45% of their full-year revenue being recognized in our fiscal first quarter with the balance recognized relatively evenly over the remainder of the fiscal year. For the rest of the business, we are modeling the typical mid-single-digit seasonal decline in revenue from Q4 to Q1. As a result, we expect first quarter revenue to be in the range of $1,265 million to $1,285 million and Q1 earnings per share in the range of $1.65 to $1.71 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 174 million shares. Now a few modeling considerations for the full-year. Given the annual ESI contract renewals in Q1, we expect a material sequential decrease in ESI revenue in Q2. And over the same period, we expect a low-single-digit increase in core Keysight revenue. At current debt levels, annual interest expense is expected to be approximately $70 million, capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $150 million and we are modeling a 14% non-GAAP effective tax rate for FY'25. With that, I will now turn it back to Paulenier for the Q&A. Yeah. And then as it relates to Software and Services, obviously continuing to see a nice mix-shift towards those portions of our business. And as I think the part of your question address gross margin, there could be, software portions of those businesses are accretive to Keysight's average gross margin, the services portions are slightly dilutive to Keysight's average gross margin, but overall both the service business has a lower expense structure, so both contribute nicely to profitability when you think about it from the operating margin line. Yeah, let me just touch on a couple of seasonality related comments since you've opened the door to that. I think, first of all, as you mentioned with regard to gross margin, with the sizable uptick in ESI revenue, we would expect some gross margin upside from that business in Q1. Similarly, though, then as you move from Q1 to Q2, you have reverse effect as that revenue comes out of the model. So just if you put it on one side, you got to take it out on the other side. With regard to OpEx, just reminding you of some things that are kind of the norm for Keysight, we do salary administration for the entire company here in the first quarter of the year. So that will be impacting the P&L starting essentially now. And then as the business inflects from a period of contraction back to a period of growth, we have essentially our variable pay programs turning back on, which will increase OpEx here starting in the first half of next year. Yeah, why don't I start maybe by making some comments about macro and then we'll let Mark Wallace make some comments about the broader Aerospace, Defense business. So first of all, as Satish mentioned in his prepared comments, the results in Q4 were marginally better than we expected coming into the quarter. And so I think that's possible. A lot of that strength itself was in Aerospace, Defense and so Mark will talk about that. But I think as you think about macro changes and the previous question alluded to this as well, I think the automotive business is where we're seeing the most pressure significant pullback in spend around EV development at this point in time, which is impacting that industry pretty significantly. I think if you look across broader strength in wireline stability, maybe not yet a strong catalyst for growth in wireless, but at least stability, a nice forward momentum in Aerospace, Defense. I think with regard to semi, it's a question of timing. When do -- I think everybody is optimistic about a turn back on in semi. The question is when does that really begin in earnest. And then the industrial end markets, maybe the biggest question mark because I think some of that is going to be tied to how a lot of that capacity that was put in place during the '21, '22, '23 supply chain disruptions. Over what time is that capacity fully absorbed and people start to once again reinvest in manufacturing capacity? So that's kind of how we're thinking through the end markets from a macro perspective. Yeah, I'd say a couple of things. So first of all, I think we're pleased with how gross margins have held up on the downside of the cycle. Obviously, we've gotten some benefit here from the addition of the ESI software business, but even if you look at the core Keysight business, the gross margins have held up pretty well in total on the downside of the cycle. I think when you start to think about those targets that we put out, 66%, 67% operating margin targets where again we're 150 basis points, 200 basis points off of that at current levels. And but we're significantly further off on the operating margin line. I think you need to look at the impact that the acquisitions are having in the short-run where we've made some acquisitions that are accretive to gross margins, but significantly dilutive to operating margins. And I think as we get those businesses integrated and start to operate them within the greater Keysight operating model, there's going to be opportunity for us to drive significant profit leverage on those acquisitions and start to close that gap on the operating margin side. Thanks. Yeah. So obviously, we are very pleased with the results in CSG. Gross margins have held up very strong in that business. I think we see a tight, not only do we see a higher software content, higher recurring revenue from software, which obviously helps margins, but I think there's less margin diversity in the CSG portfolio than we see on the ESG side. So less impact from mix. From a profitability standpoint, I think we're very pleased that we're keeping our foot on the gas. On the R&D side, continuing to invest to position ourselves to capitalize on the upside while driving significant efficiencies and SG&A resulting in the strong profitability that we saw. So it was the strongest profitability we saw this quarter, not an all-time record, obviously, but very strong operating margins in CSG this quarter. You're talking about in '24 and '25? Yeah, I mean, I think as Satish look forward, as we look to semi and to the broader industrial markets, there is reason for optimism with some of the fab programs and the absorption of capacity that was put in place in prior years, again, likely to be more back-end loaded. We've talked about at the Keysight level of gradual improvement through the year. And so as Satish just said we would expect there is an opportunity for EISG, which has not yet returned to order growth to do so in the back half of the year. And I think that would be with some significant increase in the strength of the semi markets and some modest recovery in industrial end markets. Yeah, the only thing I would say is that obviously, we look forward to the close of the Spirent transaction, which will be a significant capital outlay for the company. And but we do expect that we will at a minimum continue with our buyback program at at-least the anti-dilutive level and then we'll be trying to strike a balance between starting to get the cash ready to close the Spirent transaction traded off against what we might see as opportunistic opportunities to do more on the buyback front."

            "content": "Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. My comments will focus on three key headlines. First, Keysight executed well and delivered fourth quarter revenue and earnings per share above the high-end of our guidance range under market conditions, which remain consistent with our expectations. Orders finished slightly above our expectations and grew 1% year-over-year and 8% sequentially, driven by ongoing strength in AI and strong year-end bookings in our US Aerospace, Defense and Government Business. Second, strong execution and cost discipline drove full-year revenue of $5 billion and earnings per share of $6.27, which were down from record highs of 2023. Results were paced by gradual improvement throughout the year with better performance in the second half as expected. Under challenging market conditions, we demonstrated the resilience of our business model by delivering 26% operating profit and over $900 million in free cash flow. We also returned approximately 50% of free cash flow to shareholders through repurchases. Third, we progressed our software-centric solutions strategy by investing to realize organic growth opportunities through innovation and industry collaborations, while expanding the breadth of our solutions through selective M&A. As we look ahead, the strength of our differentiated portfolio, deep engagement with customers and the accelerating pace of technology innovation gives us confidence in our ability to outperform as markets recover. Now let's begin with an overview of Keysight's fourth quarter business performance. Communications Solutions Group revenue was flat year-over-year and grew 6% sequentially with growth across both Commercial Communications and Aerospace, Defense and Government. CSG orders returned to growth for the full-year, reflecting AI momentum in wireline, stability in wireless and consistent strength in ADG. In wireline markets, demand remains strong due to ongoing expansion in AI data center infrastructure even as telco investments continue to be muted. As the timeline for 800 gig and 1.6 terabit adoption accelerates, the industry is investing in advanced technologies, including silicon photonics, chiplets and high-speed electrical and optical interconnects. Keysight continued to expand its portfolio of solutions across the technology stack to enable customers in both R&D and manufacturing. At the Open Compute Project in San Jose, Keysight showcased our newly introduced AI workload and system emulation solution in collaboration with academia and hyperscalers. Our solution provides high fidelity emulation of AI model training and inferencing workloads to optimize training time and benchmark AI infrastructure performance. At ECOC Conference, Keysight showcased physical and protocol AI solutions with industry leaders to enable 800 gig interoperability with critical optical and electrical interface technologies. In wireless, demand was stable as smartphone industry nears the end of its inventory correction and telco CapEx normalizes from peak levels. Investment continues in Open RAN expansion, ongoing standards progression with emphasis on non-terrestrial networks and early 6G research. This quarter, we announced multiple O-RAN collaborations with industry leaders such as NTT DOCOMO, DISH Networks and Pegatron. We also collaborated with Qualcomm to establish industry's first end-to-end interoperability and data connection in the candidate frequency band for 6G FR3. We're also well poised to drive industry innovation forward with our differentiated full-stack solutions. Turning to Aerospace, Defense and Government stronger-than-expected seasonality drove orders to an all-time high. The funnel of opportunities remain strong. The US defense budget is expected to grow low-single digits, while government investment in defense modernization in Europe and Asia is projected to increase. Customer engagements on electromagnetic spectrum operations, radar and advanced communication use cases remains high. Satellite communication investments is expected to continue as more LEOs constellations are launched over the next few years. Keysight is capitalizing on the growing investment in defense modernization around the globe. At the recent European Microwave Conference, we showcased our leading capabilities in phased array, over-the-air compact antenna design and test in collaboration with analog devices. We also highlighted our latest flagship performance network analyzer. It's differentiated and industry-leading capabilities include wide band, high dynamic range, pre-selective receivers for faster S-parameter measurements to enable customers' high-frequency component designs. Turning to Electronic Industrial Solutions Group, revenue was down year-over-year as expected, but grew mid-single-digits sequentially. Orders were mixed with year-over-year growth in semi and general electronics, offset by automotive market headwinds. In semiconductor, robust demand drove strong order growth for our parametric wafer test solutions. We saw broad-based foundry investment to expand capacity and address leading-edge applications driven by AI. This included advanced DRAM technologies such as high-bandwidth memory and DDR5 as well as silicon photonics. Enabling further advances in power semiconductor production and efficiency, this quarter Keysight introduced an innovative single pass 3 kilowatt high voltage wafer test solution. In Automotive, the industry is facing challenges and we expect the headwinds to continue in 2025. This quarter, production-related demand was sequentially stable, while we saw incrementally cautious pending due to slowing EV sales and battery oversupply. Even with near-term headwinds, we remain focused on customers' emerging innovation and design needs. Our R&D engagements for software-defined vehicle as well as broader electrical and physical design applications remain high. ESI grew its solution business this year through steady renewals and new customer additions. Over this period, the ESI team also made significant contributions to the use of AI to improve product performance simulations and offering workflow solutions with immersive visualization to validate assembly and servicing. In general electronics, we saw stable manufacturing demand, albeit at lower levels, and a modest sequential improvement in consumer and industrial high-speed connectivity applications. Public and private sector investment in support of advanced research and technology workforce development grew this quarter and digital health application demand was again strong. Turning to Software and Services, revenues grew 8% this quarter and accounted for 39% of total Keysight revenue. Annual recurring revenue from Software and Services also grew 16% to approximately $1.5 billion and accounted for roughly 30% of Keysight overall. We saw solid growth in our design engineering software portfolio in 2024 reflecting the expansion of virtual prototyping across a broad range of industries. As a recognized thought leader in RF EDA, Keysight was selected to lead a US government joint public and private sector effort to leverage AI and machine-learning to automate and bring efficiencies to complex RF integrated circuit designs. In summary, Keysight has continued to sustain strategic progress and momentum through the downturn. The flexibility and discipline of our operating model has proven our ability to deliver strong financial results and healthy cash flows in a variety of economic conditions. We have positioned the business to emerge stronger as markets recover to capitalize on the opportunities ahead of us and to create value for all stakeholders. Before I conclude, I'd like to sincerely thank our employees once again for all their outstanding contributions, commitment and strong track-record of execution under a variety of market conditions. With that, I'll turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook. Yeah, thank you, Aaron. Indeed a good quarter. We executed well and capitalized on the opportunities we saw. Specific to your question on wireless, we continue to feel more confident, I would say, after two quarters where the business has stabilized. And we're seeing more strengths on the infrastructure side where there's more activity from customers around Open RAN and 6G research. So that drives that. And on the devices side, it's lagging a little bit where customers still continue to be focused on ongoing standards evolutions. So, I mean, at this point, we continue to believe that the business will remain stable in '25. We'll call it when we see it. But we continue to feel good about the ongoing momentum we're seeing in our wireline business that's driven growth for commercial communications. Yeah, I think the Aaron, the long-term trajectory of that business is actually the one that is easiest to forecast given the budget clarity that typically gets and the priorities that get set both in the US and in allied nations. And if you look at electromagnetic spectrum operations, space and satellite and other areas, those are the areas where defense modernization investments are moving to and we feel good about our position. Relative to the year, obviously, orders were slightly down year-over-year, but off of a record compare from a year-ago. And some of the wins that we had were systems wins, which take us a little longer to ship. So you haven't yet seen that in the revenue line. But as we look ahead, obviously, the short-term with the administration change in the US does bring some uncertainties. But even at times like in 2016 where that happened, we just had some business more out between quarters and so we'll monitor the situation, but we feel good about the current situation with regard to our business there. Thank you, Tim. Clearly, the wireline business has gained momentum this year driven by AI, but this is one of the examples of proof-of-concepts that I highlighted at Investor Day of last year. And so we're quite pleased with the way the opportunity has progressed. Our wireline business has exceeded over $1 billion in orders this year, growing at double-digit rates. And we service a broad set of customers in that industry, right. You think about silicon designers, system integrators, NEMs, hyperscalers and contract manufacturers. So it's actually a broad set of customers. But what's driving the activity in AI right now is actually a concentrated set of customers from hyperscalers that are investing in large infrastructure upgrades. So that's the effort. And the supply chain right now continues to be constrained. So investments are being made to unlock the supply chain to enable the scale to build. And so we're involved in that. We're capitalizing on that. But as we think about the future, we participated in some forums like the OCP and ECOC earlier this year and you can start to see the scale expand. It's not yet reflected in the results yet, but we start to build scale around compute, whether it's centralized or at the edge, power and thermal being very big issues for companies. Networking technologies are being adopted, maybe even faster than they were being adopted before this AI became a big trend. And our opportunities we're excited about are not just in the physical layer, but in the protocol layer, allowing customers to emulate how traffic flows through an AI infrastructure and therefore optimize their investments. So we're pretty excited about the opportunities long-term here and capitalizing on the near-term strength. Thank you, Tim. Yeah, I think the good thing about Keysight's business model in comps and in fact rest of our business is the broad set of customers we serve. That diversity and breadth is a source of great strength during times of change. And so while we do pick up some incremental business every year from new logos that come up because they're funded directly or indirectly there are some direct funding from government at times that flows into Open RAN. We've called some of those wins out and even the CHIPS Act, but we're not heavily tethered to any one of those things. So I would just say that those are incremental in some ways, but not as material as maybe the headlines enthusiastic especially because we're more involved in the R&D side of those labs and so we feel good. I think the momentum we see because of our renewed focus on go-to-market expansion that we had put in place with marketing is the continued attraction of new logos that we see across our business. It continues to be the focus for us moving forward as well. Yeah, I would just say it's probably, it's a question behind the question if I'm understanding you right is what are the implications of the US elections and therefore the policy changes that might ensue. And so like everybody, we're monitoring three areas, tax, trade, both tariffs and trade restrictions, right, the areas and along with defense spending that might ensue. It would be premature for us to comment on them, except to say that we've been pretty agile in ensuring compliance when there is a new government restriction and pivoting our sales resources to go after new opportunities. A potential offset could be and again I'm breaking my rule and speculating a little bit is if there were to be tariffs of the orders being discussed, many companies are looking to more of China into other areas in Southeast Asia and we remain prepared to capitalize on the opportunities if should that occur. Exactly. Thank you. Yeah, that's good. Look, our job number one, Rob, was to stabilize the business and return to order growth, which we set out as a priority for the second half and I'm quite pleased that we've executed to that. Now looking at the facts, you'd say CSG has returned to growth in the -- for the full-year from an order perspective and EISG is yet to do that. So that sort of summarizes the mix demand environment. And just projecting forward, we expect continued sort of slow gradual recovery as we move into 2025. We're not baking in, in our base case all segments inflecting. And should that happen, we'll be prepared to capitalize on it. But our base case that Neil's called out at -- in his outlook section is for 5% revenue growth and 10% EPS growth for the year. Thank you, Samik. I think for semiconductor fabs, just based on what we're seeing and the pipeline of opportunities we see for our wafer test solutions around silicon photonics and new memory topologies and some of the higher voltage types of wafers, I think that strength continues for us in somewhat a little bit offset by and that's the bigger part of our semi business, somewhat offset by a slowdown that a number of the semiconductor equipment manufacturers have reported as well. So you put that in the mix. We still think semi grows from these levels for us. And again semiconductor is, as you know, is roughly 10% of our total revenue at the company level. From a general electronics perspective, what we have started to see and again one quarter doesn't make a trend. So I just want to caution you. But I do think in Q4, we saw stability in manufacturing, which finally resulted in the underlying strength in research spending around next-generation technologies, the broad new customer logo, all of that return that business to growth. Again, it's just one quarter, but we think that stability in manufacturing continues as we move forward as well, which should give some -- which should return -- which should put EISG on return to order growth at some point in the year, it's difficult to call at this point. And Samik we remain confident in the long-term growth opportunities of this business. And you've seen when we can deliver above model growth rates, the sort of earnings power and leverage we have, we continue to operate this business in a disciplined way to be able to realize those and get us back on track. Thank you. Yeah, good question. I think as we mentioned, the more logical areas which we have seen growth come from to date or results come from to date are associated with the physical layer tools where we provide our oscilloscopes, our sampling scopes and other tools that we provide. And what we're seeing is a bigger opportunity for our emulation platforms we're still in early pilots with customers on. Again, it's a small, it's a concentrated set of opportunities today. We expect that industry and the impact AI is going to have to be broader and we're participating in enabling the ecosystem with the right set of tools all the way from design, emulation to test and our focus is on enabling our customers in the R&D parts of the workflow and it's a pretty rich opportunity for us. Thank you. Yeah, I would just say, look, we have reiterated a very strong organic growth strategy that we're focused on realizing. We've also identified specific markets that we have studied to pursue a selective M&A. And at this point, while we continue to evaluate targets, we always remain disciplined and we'll look at them. But it's not a matter of capital as much as bandwidths to pursue more deals given the deals that we've already announced, which we're working through."

My name is Sierra, and I'll be your lead operator for today. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded today, Tuesday, August 20, 2024, at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time. I would now like to hand the call over to Jason Kary, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJason Kary: Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to Keysight's third quarter earnings conference call for fiscal year 2024. Joining me are Keysight's President and CEO, Satish Dhanasekaran, and our CFO, Neil Dougherty. In the Q&A session, we'll be joined by Chief Customer Officer, Mark Wallace. The press release and information to supplement today's discussions are on our website at investor.keysight.com under Financial Information and Quarterly Reports. Today's comments will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. We will also make reference to core growth, which excludes the impact of currency movements and acquisitions or divestitures completed within the last 12 months. The most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations are on our website and all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. We will make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company on today's call. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. We assume no obligation to update them and encourage you to review our recent SEC filings for a more complete view of these risks and other factors. Lastly, management is scheduled to participate in upcoming investor conferences hosted by Jefferies, Deutsche Bank, Citi and Goldman Sachs. And now I will turn the call over to Satish.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. My comments will focus on three key headlines. First, Keysight executed well by delivering revenue and earnings above the high end of our guidance in market conditions that were stable and consistent with our expectations. Second, orders of $1.25 billion was slightly above expectations and in line with prior year and growing low-single-digits sequentially. In a mixed demand environment, we continue to see stability and pockets of growth, particularly in commercial communications. The funnel of opportunities supports our outlook for second half orders to be above first-half orders followed by a more gradual recovery in 2025, barring any further macroeconomic degradation. Third, we remain confident in the strength of our business model and are intently focused on value creation for both customers and our shareholders. Our capital allocation priorities have not changed. First, we're strategically investing to deliver leading-edge capabilities as new technologies inflect and to return the company to our long-term growth trajectory. Second, we're expanding our SAM and growth opportunities through disciplined M&A. And third, we are committed to returning capital through share repurchases. In fact, we returned over $715 million or 78% of free cash flow over the past four quarters. Now let's begin with a brief overview of Keysight's third quarter performance. Revenue of $1.2 billion and earnings per share of $1.57, above our expectations. And for the second consecutive quarter, we saw relative stability in both orders and revenue. Turning to our business segments. CSG returned to order growth in Q3. While revenue declined 8% year-over-year, we saw some modest improvement sequentially. Commercial Communications orders grew low-double-digits. Strong growth in wireline driven by AI, more than offset the year-over-year decline in a sequentially stable wireless business. Wireline orders grew for a third consecutive quarter, driven by robust investment in the re-architecture of data center networks for 400-gig, 800-gig and terabit data rates, AI model training and network performance. We're benefiting from the investments we have made to position Keysight ahead of this technology inflection. In R&D, we're enablers with our design and emulation solutions across the technology stack for key applications, including GPU servers, AI workload emulation and performance benchmarking. In manufacturing, AI cluster and switching deployments drove capacity demand this quarter, and we secured key wins in GPU rack connectivity applications with market-leading customers. Keysight also collaborated with Cisco and Panduit to demonstrate interconnect technologies in AI cluster networks to reduce power consumption. We're also actively engaged with customers in the ultra-ethernet consortium to define future network architectures for AI and high-performance workloads. In wireless, demand has been stable for the past three quarters, albeit at a lower level on a year-over-year basis. While customer spending remains cautious, the breadth of our solutions portfolio is enabling us to capture ongoing R&D investment in non-terrestrial networks, open radio access network deployments and release 18 of the 3GPP standard. Customers are also investing in scaling 5G and evaluating next-generation technologies. For example, at the recent IEEE International Conference and Communications, Keysight showcased early 6G technology together with Ericsson. Government incentives, particularly in U.S., Europe and Japan are driving development of a robust ecosystem to commercialize open radio access networks. This quarter, Keysight's open radio access network solutions enable state-of-the-art open testing and integration centers across the globe from Europe, to North America to Asia. Turning to aerospace, defense and government. Revenue and orders were down year-over-year, sequentially flat. The prolonged U.S. budget approval process has caused delays in appropriation of funding for new projects, which we expect to filter through over the next few quarters. In the interim, spending on defense modernization remains steady with healthy demand from U.S. primes and allied governments. Keysight recently expanded its engagement with U.S. government through joint cyber defense collaborative to enhance cybersecurity resiliency. In the quarter, we secured key wins with U.S. and European primes for spectrum operation applications. We also expanded our Quantum footprint with a multi-hundred Cubed application win with a key government customer. Turning to Electronic Industrial Solutions Group, revenue continued to normalize from a strong prior year declining double-digits as expected. Customer spending and market conditions remain muted, but we saw relative stability in orders and revenue on a sequential basis. In semiconductor, revenue was also down year-over-year versus an all-time high Q3 last year. Orders increased low-single-digits and were up strongly on a sequential basis. While certain segments of the market continue to work through excess inventory, higher performance requirements for AI workloads drove spending in advanced nodes, high-bandwidth memory and silicon photonics technologies. The investments that we have made specific to these market opportunities resulted in increased demand from foundry and memory customers for our parametric wafer test solutions. In automotive, orders and revenue declined double-digits. Lower auto manufacturing activity remains a headwind in the near-term. In new mobility, EV orders were lower as demand for some battery test and charging infrastructure investments were delayed, while AV orders grew mid-single-digits on a sequential basis. The opportunities in R&D continue to grow as customer engagement in transition to software-defined vehicles ramps. As an example, Riscure successfully completed the first car connectivity consortium digital key certification in conjunction with NXP. This certification strengthens trust in security of next-generation vehicles. It also further expands Keysight's security evaluation offering for the automotive industry. In general electronics, customer spending remains constrained, particularly in manufacturing, China and the distribution channel. There were pockets of growth in digital health and advanced research, where orders grew low-double-digits. Software and services revenues are resilient and grew this quarter while accounting for 39% of total Keysight revenue. Annual recurring revenue from software and services also increased year-over-year and in Q3 accounted for roughly 29% of overall Keysight. Our Eggplant software test automation platform is expanding with multiple consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. We're also gaining early traction in sales channel leverage between ESI and Keysight to expand into select accounts and geographies. The collaboration resulted in a key win in the satellite communication space. Lastly, Keysight's design engineering software platform continues to grow. This quarter, we launched new releases for virtual prototyping and simulation capabilities, which address high-performance use cases across our communications, aerospace and defense and automotive end markets. In summary, the strength and differentiation of Keysight's business model is enabling us to outperform in a variety of economic conditions. We're well positioned to capitalize on technology inflections ahead of us and remain laser-focused on value creation for both customers and shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook.\nNeil Dougherty: Thank you, Satish, and hello, everyone. Third quarter revenue of $1.217 billion was above the high end of our guidance range and down 12% or 13% on a core basis. Orders of $1.249 billion were essentially flat or down 1% on a core basis. Backlog at the end of the quarter grew $30 million to finish at $2.3 billion. Looking at our operational results for Q3, we reported gross margin of 64%. Operating expenses of $484 million, were up 1% year-over-year. Excluding acquisitions, SG&A expenses were down 7%, reflecting our cost flexibility and actions taken to-date. Q3 operating margin was 24% or 26% on a core basis. Year-to-date, core operating margin is down only 400 basis points, continuing to outperform Keysight's down cycle model and demonstrating the financial resiliency of the business. During the quarter, we amended our tax returns from 2020 onward to reflect an amortization deduction related to a prior period corporate restructuring. This change reduces our effective non-GAAP tax rate from 17% to 14% or 300 basis points for fiscal year 2024 and going forward. Turning to earnings. We achieved $275 million of net income and delivered earnings of $1.41 per share, excluding the impact of the tax rate change. This tax change added an additional $0.16 to earnings per share, of which $0.11 relates to the first-half of FY '24 and $0.05 to Q3. All in, we finished the quarter at $1.57 in earnings per share. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 175 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments. The Communications Solutions Group generated revenue of $847 million, down 8% on both a reported and core basis. Commercial communications revenue of $572 million, declined 6%. While aerospace defense and government revenue of $275 million, was down 10%. Altogether, CSG delivered gross margin of 67% and operating margin of 26%. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated revenue of $370 million, down 20% or 24% on a core basis. EISG reported gross margin of 58% and operating margin of 20%, an increase of approximately 100 basis points versus the prior quarter on slightly lower revenue. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generating cash flow from operations of $255 million and free cash flow of $222 million. Share repurchases this quarter totaled 1.07 million shares at an average price per share of approximately $140 for a total consideration of $150 million. Now turning to our outlook. We expect to finish the year slightly better than anticipated, with fourth quarter revenue in the range of $1.245 billion to $1.265 billion, and Q4 earnings per share in the range of $1.53 to $1.59 and based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 174 million shares. In closing, in an uncertain macro environment, we are executing on the dimensions that we control, capturing the current market opportunities and positioning Keysight for success as markets recover. With that, I will turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.\nJason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Sierra, could you proceed with the instructions for the Q&A?\nOperator: Definitely. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nMark Delaney: Yes. Good afternoon, and thanks very much for taking my questions. Orders were up slightly both sequentially and year-on-year after being down year-on-year for the prior six quarters. Maybe you can help us better understand how meaningful you think the pickup in orders is as a sign that the cyclical environment may be changing?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes, hi Mark, thanks for the question. Obviously, we're encouraged by the continued stability that we see in our base business inflections that are material in our wireline business, some signs of rebound in semi, although it's too early to call it. So -- and then there's some incremental weakness in the automotive sector. So we put it all in the blender, and say, in this current environment, we're encouraged by this returning to slight year-over-year growth as we've seen, but it might be too soon to call a recovery at this time. And the key point is we're executing well, and we feel good about the -- our own portfolio and its differentiation and the investments we have made to continue to keep that going.\nMark Delaney: Thanks for that Satish. My other question was a follow-up on the orders. You mentioned AI as a positive contributor yet again to commercial communications. Maybe you can help us better understand what percentage of commercial communications orders are tied to AI at this point? And how impactful might AI be for revenue within commercial comms as you look out over the next 12 months or so? Thank you.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Thanks, Mark. Yes, we're quite pleased that commercial communications orders grew double-digits this quarter. Again, as I mentioned, we have a pretty diverse portfolio that caters to the entire communication cycle system with solutions. So you can think of wireless and wireline and the wireline ecosystem represents roughly about 40% to 45% of our commercial communications business, and it's inflecting driven by the AI spend. Now when you think about how big could be longer term, I think the answer is becoming quite clear that AI is going to be a pretty transformational technology that's going to lead to evolutions of multiple underlying waves of standards and technologies, but it's not yet played out. Today, the state of the affairs is it's a highly concentrated opportunity set driven by the big investments made by the hyperscalers. And it is a constricted sort of constraint, I should say, sort of environment from a supply perspective. So there are some challenges that the customers are working through. So we're seeing, and we're picking up some of that capital investments that are playing out through our manufacturing business that is rapidly expanding. But equally, we're making good progress, I would say, in engaging with standardization across the entire stack and in making meaningful contributions in R&D across compute, power and thermal, networking protocols and memory, all aspects of innovation that customers are playing into. But again, the ecosystem, I believe, will broaden over time. And our goal has been for the last 18 months to nest this opportunity, feel good about our market position.\nMark Delaney: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question -- questions. I want to go back, it's been a little while, but at the Analyst Day a little over a year ago, you had outlined a revenue CAGR of 5% to 7%. And I'm curious as we kind of see the stabilization of orders, we think about the return of growth here. Is there anything that's changed as we start to think about the next fiscal year that you would put out there for us to think about relative to that 5% to 7% growth rate. And if so, I mean, why wouldn't we expect even a stronger growth rate just given the easy comps that you're looking at?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you, Aaron. Obviously, our long-term view of the opportunities and the underlying drivers remain unchanged. And so we would expect the business to trend back to those levels. That's point number one. However, look, '21 and '22 have been outsized years for our markets, and '23 was a flat year, flattish year. We continue to deliver value in '24 is a down year for the market. And so our first priority is to say that we can -- the business conditions have stabilized. That was our sort of first milestone, I should say. And as a sign of that, we feel good about what we had shared with you last quarter, which is that the second half orders would be greater than the first half, okay? So that's the first thing. Second is the shape of the recovery, as we've seen, it's still a pretty mixed environment. And we're not, at this point, factoring in an in-phase recovery, if you will, across all our multiple end markets. And therefore, we would, at this point, say we're thinking about this as a slow gradual recovery in 2025. However, the actions that we're taking in terms of things we control, our innovations, engagements with customers are all with an intent to maximize. And I feel good about Keysight's position. Obviously, we want to see some more progression in the funnel dynamics, which are trending positive, but you'll hear more from Mark later we want to see that progress a bit more before we can talk about what those growth rates might be for '25.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Very helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up. I'm curious, as you -- Neil, I think a quarter or two ago, you talked about longer-dated backlog build or orders. I'm curious, any update on that and what you're seeing in the market today.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. The incoming order rate range reasonably stable in the upper single-digits level of mix. And on the revenue side, we are trending in that direction. We're not yet to the point where the revenues are at that level. But in the next quarter or two, we'd expect to achieve that.\nAaron Rakers: Yes, thank you.\nNeil Dougherty: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Nickman with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nMichael Allen: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. This is Michael Allen on for Matt Niknam. I was just wondering if you could make a little more dig a little more to the aerospace, the ADG segment. Is -- or are these delays just kind of pushing more into the next quarter? Or is this kind of a slowdown of when you expect to see more of a year-over-year growth rate? Or just any more color on that.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you. I'd say the older arching trends given the geopolitics that we're under are positive, so that's number one. There is bipartisan support for budgets in defense in the United States and increasing support for raising budgets around the world. Japan just announced an increase and Europe is also focused on that. And I feel good about Keysights focus -- long-term focus we've had in defense modernization with Quantum solutions with solutions for ultra-magnetic spectrum operations, space and satellite. They're all aligned with the right priorities. Having said that, the budgets and appropriation timing does have an impact really hard to predict on a quarterly basis. But we like the pipeline that's building. The prime contractors increases are also something we monitor in the U.S., and we feel good that those will all eventually flush into orders for us. This year, obviously, we're lapping a full year of 2023 of record levels for order and revenue for the aerospace and defense business. So you'll see some -- the revenue levels are down. And to the point about the long-dated backlog, we have won some large systems businesses last year and this year, which will also convert into revenue next year. So I would say that the drivers have remained intact. Our position remains solid and the pipeline is strong. Thank you.\nMichael Allen: Awesome, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Just on automotive. I mean, I think the broader weakness in the EV market is well known. But I saw you mentioned clients delaying projects. Are they looking to kind of restart maybe at the beginning of calendar 2025. just sort of gain a sense of the tone in those customer conversations.\nMark Wallace: Yes, David, this is Mark. It's hard to predict when the timing is for some of these projects. Some of them have very long processes associated with the procurement process, including proof of concepts. And then the projects themselves last many quarters, it falls into this category of some of the long-dated business that we've been talking about for quite a while. What I think we are seeing though is the continuous focus on innovation with our key automotive customers, the AV side and software-defined vehicles that is now migrating toward continued to show growth in the quarter sequentially. We are continuing to work with customers in all regions. So this is a global situation that we are well positioned for. And what I would look for in 2025 is some of the moderation of the slowness that we've experienced for many quarters around manufacturing as capacities are required to increase. And then I think given the regulatory situation, the political climate and the long-term commitments to e-mobility, I would expect the pause that we're seeing right now in some of these battery test and EV projects to begin gaining some momentum in the next several quarters.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Understood. And then a quick one for Neil. Just to check, when you said 14% tax rate going forward, that's a good baseline modeling assumption for next fiscal year?\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. For next year, we actually would expect it to that tax rate to hold for multiple years. The next thing that we're aware of is the U.S. GILTI tax rate, that's a tax on offshore profitability is scheduled to increase in 2027. So we'll need to evaluate the impact of that on Keysight once we get closer to that implementation date. And then the only other thing I would add is both of the current presidential candidates have prioritized tax legislation for the first year of new administration. Obviously, we don't have any way to assess what those programs would be like and so this doesn't account for anything that could be passed as part of a new presidential administration. But the status quo through '27.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thanks. A couple of questions maybe on kind of the communications business. And what do you see as catalyst for improvement in fiscal '25 in that business, even if they are gradual. And then just maybe as a second question, I realize probably limited updates, but any update on Spirent acquisition. Thanks.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I would just say from a spiral, I'll take the second one first. Obviously, I'm going to be limited by what I can add. But I think an update to the situation is that we've received the shareholder approval Spirent shareholder approval for the transaction, and we're working through the regulatory process. And at this point, as we have stated before, we expect the transaction to be completed in the first half of fiscal '25. As far as your original question, I mean, it is quite exciting to see tremendous demand and inflection in the wireline business. As I mentioned before, it is concentrated and it is in a supply-constrained environment. So it remains to be seen how long the manufacturing build-outs go, but that's a near-term dynamic, and we're capitalizing on it. I think the R&D opportunities associated with the multiple areas that I touched upon the key sites, engaging with customers on. We feel like it gives us a good pipeline to go execute for the next three- to five-year horizon because there is going to be bigger wave. And with any of these technology trends, hard to really see it until it happens, so -- but we're engaged and we're making meaningful contributions for our customers. But I would expect stability in wireless to continue and some increase perhaps in deployment activity across the globe, which would give further some signs of growth to our component test business there. And then as I think about the wireline side of the business, continued investments in R&D, maybe some moderating manufacturing investments in the second half of next year. So that's sort of our thinking at this point.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is open.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes, thanks for taking my question. A couple of follow-ups for me. Thanks for color on the booking trends into the October quarter. But if I were just to take a look into the Q1 fiscal year '25. Historically, Q1 has been seasonally down in terms of booking. And is there anything with the startup of new fiscal year that would make this year any different than prior years? And I have a follow-up.\nNeil Dougherty: Yes. I think as it relates to that by '25, I think given visibility is probably a little bit premature for us to give too much guidance. As Satish said, we are expecting a moderate recovery into '25. I think as you have just noted, in Keysight's core business, we do typically see a sequential decrease in the mid-single-digits, orders and revenue as we move from Q1 -- Q4 into Q1. The one thing that we -- you will need to account for, however, is the ESI business has kind of the opposite seasonality, recognizing about 45% -- 40% to 45% of their revenues in the first quarter of Keysight's fiscal year. So you'll have the historic history would suggest throughout the Keysight business sequentially down in ESI sequentially up, and we'll have to see how that plays out given the market environment.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: And maybe Mark can make a comment on the funnel dynamics.\nMark Wallace: Yes. So Mehdi, the funnel, as we said before, is trending positive, I would say. And as I look at where we are today versus three months ago, so this is kind of a sequential trend, we're seeing more funnel intake. So that's new opportunities coming into our pipeline. And we're seeing speed or the velocity at which some of those deals are going through the funnel and closing increasing as well. So that gives us a short-term funnel that supports our guide for Q4 and we'll continue to watch this carefully, but there are improving pipeline dynamics that we're seeing in the business.\nMehdi Hosseini: Great. Thanks for all the details. If I may just have a follow-up on that. As you look into next fiscal year, calendar year, is there anything with wireless infrastructure, anything that would help with some technology upgrade would -- and I mean like with the existing base stations would need to be upgraded from a not a stand-alone to a stand-alone? Or is there anything else that is out there that would also help with the upgrade? Or is the recovery in the core telecom wireless silicon is going to be driven by just a capacity expansion?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. It's a really good question, Mehdi. I think the thing about our business is we tend to be more on the R&D labs of our customers. So we're on the front end. So towards that end, we see continued progression of standards, release '17, release '18, release '19 coming in and new teams such as AI in the context of RAN becoming real, open RAN deployments or Open RAN interoperability labs around the world are scaling. So all those are, I would say, positive trends from a sequential basis. Obviously, were down from the peak as the capex cycle from telcos are down. But the stability in the business is good. We feel good about our engagements around these next-generation themes that I mentioned, and then some earlier activity around 6G is picking up, which we're making contributions to. So -- but again, I would expect that the 5G business will have some stability because there's more deployment activities around the world, and that should provide some more stability until six GRIs.\nMehdi Hosseini: Thank you.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thomas Davis. Your line is now open.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hey, good afternoon guys, nice quarter.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Hi, thank you, Adam.\nAdam Thalhimer: Sorry if I missed this, but the sequential revenue growth that you're looking for in Q4, is that weighted more towards communications? Like do you expect both segments to be sequentially up?\nNeil Dougherty: One moment. But yes, so this is the seasonal uptick, obviously, we see in both businesses. It's probably going to skew a little bit more towards the comms business than the industrial business at this point, given some of the pressure that we continue in manufacturing and automotive that Satish just shared.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: And typically, end of the year, Adam, we would expect a seasonal uptick in our Aerospace and Defense business, which has always been the case. So that's another contributor as well.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. And on the semiconductor side, last quarter, you talked about fabrication delays. I think you said it might come back late Q4 or 2025. Can you just give an update there?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. On the semi side, I'd say that the project activities are returning and we started to see some sequential growth. The pipeline remains solid and especially around memory, which is stronger and technologies such as silicon photonics, where we had invested with customers. And now AI is driving a higher sense of urgency to pull the trigger on those activities. Some parts on the logic side, still, it's still a mixed environment on the logic side. But we feel good about sequential recovery in that business.\nAdam Thalhimer: Great. Thanks guys.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Jameson with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.\nRob Jameson: Hi there. Yes, just a quick question on the auto exposure here. I know you talked about the EV weakness and some of the political headwinds there. But on the autonomous vehicle side, just would look to kind of have you expand a little bit on how that leads on your core communications? And maybe some color around what that opportunity might look like in the long term? And how much as a percentage of total orders that is for that business?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. So thank you. As you have rightfully noted, the automotive business and the automotive marketplace is transforming, right? And I think for Keysight historically, very low exposure in that area. And as we have said before, we have grown the business to $500 million almost from a very small base. And a big part of that was really manufacturing, one-third of the business is manufacturing and production where we are engaged in the electronics manufacturing of it, and we have a differentiated position there. Two-third of the business, obviously, is all new mobility EV that Mark Walls talked about earlier and AV as well. And it's a marketplace that continues to transform. On one dimension you have Chinese battery, call it, commoditization pressures that customers are feeling. And yet the regulations around batteries and their safety needs dictate more testing there in region. And on the other side, I think the commercial ecosystem is starting to engage directly with automakers. And that's what Mark defined as the software-defined vehicle opportunity set with silicon software combining and it really plays to Keysight's traditional strength, and it's more an extension of what we do for traditional comps customers and we're able to take those and go to market for them. Mark, anything further?\nMark Wallace: Yes. No, you hit it on the last part. I was going to point out that this crosses over many parts of our business going back many years from our semiconductor and our comms EDA design tools to more and more our security and cyber types of tools that go into these environments with silicon. They obviously leverage our strengths in commercial comms, which we've been capturing for many years with communication standards, connecting vehicles to everything into the components that are used to sense as well as the computational capabilities and the standards that go within the digital standards and the optical standards that go within the vehicle itself. So that's the -- from radar to connected cars, this is crossing over multiple areas where Keysight has a leadership position, and that's why we continue to see such an active customer landscape.\nRobert Jamieson: That's really helpful. Perfect. And then I guess just one last one. I know there was a lot of volatility in the end of July. But just curious on demand trends through maybe the back half of the quarter and an early look into August. Was there any material changes or is it just kind of like plotting along or any positive negatives that we should be aware of?\nMark Wallace: Now, we saw ramping in the quarter from month to month, but it wasn't necessarily unusual. We ended our first half in May, and that typically pull some business in because we -- most of our sellers are on a six-month quota. So we had to start a little bit with the depleted funnel, but then we quickly grew that in. As I said, what we've seen throughout the last three months is the positive funnel dynamics, which is more funnel intake and then moving that business through the funnel. So I would say it was a fairly typical seasonality to the quarter, and we're two weeks into Q4 now.\nRobert Jamieson: Great, thank you.\nMark Wallace: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nPriyanka Thapa: Hi, this is Priyanka Thapa on for Samik Chatterjee. Just one question. You stated that you have a huge opportunity set because of hyperscaler investments. Are these hyperscalers direct customers for test equipment relative to the AI data center equipment testing? And which kind of areas can you potentially see this exposure to hyperscalers broadening out over time? Thanks.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Priyanka. So what I stated was obviously the hyperscaler investment in digital infrastructure upgrade and the capital equipment being deployed to upgrade the networks to be more AI ready, if you will, is proliferating through the ecosystem and the large supply chain, and we're benefiting from the manufacturing exposure there. So that was point number one. But we're increasing our exposure as some of the hyperscalers enter into silicon programs and build their own organic capability, that's a growing customer base that we're continuing to expand into. We're also participating in consortiums for more open standardization that some of the hyperscalers are leading. So we're making a growing contribution there. And we feel good about our ability to take the physical and protocol layer assets into this marketplace and provide total solutions for customers, not only in traditional areas you would expect us to in computation or connectivity, but also into emulating training and inference scheme so that AI can scale effectively.\nPriyanka Thapa: Thanks.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you all for your questions. That concludes our Q&A session for today. I would like to turn the call back to Jason Kary for any closing remarks.\nJason Kary: Well, thanks, Sierra, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you at the upcoming conferences this quarter and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes our conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Neil Dougherty",
            "content": "Thank you, Satish, and hello, everyone. Third quarter revenue of $1.217 billion was above the high end of our guidance range and down 12% or 13% on a core basis. Orders of $1.249 billion were essentially flat or down 1% on a core basis. Backlog at the end of the quarter grew $30 million to finish at $2.3 billion. Looking at our operational results for Q3, we reported gross margin of 64%. Operating expenses of $484 million, were up 1% year-over-year. Excluding acquisitions, SG&A expenses were down 7%, reflecting our cost flexibility and actions taken to-date. Q3 operating margin was 24% or 26% on a core basis. Year-to-date, core operating margin is down only 400 basis points, continuing to outperform Keysight's down cycle model and demonstrating the financial resiliency of the business. During the quarter, we amended our tax returns from 2020 onward to reflect an amortization deduction related to a prior period corporate restructuring. This change reduces our effective non-GAAP tax rate from 17% to 14% or 300 basis points for fiscal year 2024 and going forward. Turning to earnings. We achieved $275 million of net income and delivered earnings of $1.41 per share, excluding the impact of the tax rate change. This tax change added an additional $0.16 to earnings per share, of which $0.11 relates to the first-half of FY '24 and $0.05 to Q3. All in, we finished the quarter at $1.57 in earnings per share. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 175 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments. The Communications Solutions Group generated revenue of $847 million, down 8% on both a reported and core basis. Commercial communications revenue of $572 million, declined 6%. While aerospace defense and government revenue of $275 million, was down 10%. Altogether, CSG delivered gross margin of 67% and operating margin of 26%. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated revenue of $370 million, down 20% or 24% on a core basis. EISG reported gross margin of 58% and operating margin of 20%, an increase of approximately 100 basis points versus the prior quarter on slightly lower revenue. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generating cash flow from operations of $255 million and free cash flow of $222 million. Share repurchases this quarter totaled 1.07 million shares at an average price per share of approximately $140 for a total consideration of $150 million. Now turning to our outlook. We expect to finish the year slightly better than anticipated, with fourth quarter revenue in the range of $1.245 billion to $1.265 billion, and Q4 earnings per share in the range of $1.53 to $1.59 and based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 174 million shares. In closing, in an uncertain macro environment, we are executing on the dimensions that we control, capturing the current market opportunities and positioning Keysight for success as markets recover. With that, I will turn it back to Jason for the Q&A. Yes. The incoming order rate range reasonably stable in the upper single-digits level of mix. And on the revenue side, we are trending in that direction. We're not yet to the point where the revenues are at that level. But in the next quarter or two, we'd expect to achieve that. Thank you. Yes. For next year, we actually would expect it to that tax rate to hold for multiple years. The next thing that we're aware of is the U.S. GILTI tax rate, that's a tax on offshore profitability is scheduled to increase in 2027. So we'll need to evaluate the impact of that on Keysight once we get closer to that implementation date. And then the only other thing I would add is both of the current presidential candidates have prioritized tax legislation for the first year of new administration. Obviously, we don't have any way to assess what those programs would be like and so this doesn't account for anything that could be passed as part of a new presidential administration. But the status quo through '27. Yes. I think as it relates to that by '25, I think given visibility is probably a little bit premature for us to give too much guidance. As Satish said, we are expecting a moderate recovery into '25. I think as you have just noted, in Keysight's core business, we do typically see a sequential decrease in the mid-single-digits, orders and revenue as we move from Q1 -- Q4 into Q1.

            "name": "Satish Dhanasekaran",
            "content": "Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. My comments will focus on three key headlines. First, Keysight executed well by delivering revenue and earnings above the high end of our guidance in market conditions that were stable and consistent with our expectations. Second, orders of $1.25 billion was slightly above expectations and in line with prior year and growing low-single-digits sequentially. In a mixed demand environment, we continue to see stability and pockets of growth, particularly in commercial communications. The funnel of opportunities supports our outlook for second half orders to be above first-half orders followed by a more gradual recovery in 2025, barring any further macroeconomic degradation. Third, we remain confident in the strength of our business model and are intently focused on value creation for both customers and our shareholders. Our capital allocation priorities have not changed. First, we're strategically investing to deliver leading-edge capabilities as new technologies inflect and to return the company to our long-term growth trajectory. Second, we're expanding our SAM and growth opportunities through disciplined M&A. And third, we are committed to returning capital through share repurchases. In fact, we returned over $715 million or 78% of free cash flow over the past four quarters. Now let's begin with a brief overview of Keysight's third quarter performance. Revenue of $1.2 billion and earnings per share of $1.57, above our expectations. And for the second consecutive quarter, we saw relative stability in both orders and revenue. Turning to our business segments. CSG returned to order growth in Q3. While revenue declined 8% year-over-year, we saw some modest improvement sequentially. Commercial Communications orders grew low-double-digits. Strong growth in wireline driven by AI, more than offset the year-over-year decline in a sequentially stable wireless business. Wireline orders grew for a third consecutive quarter, driven by robust investment in the re-architecture of data center networks for 400-gig, 800-gig and terabit data rates, AI model training and network performance. We're benefiting from the investments we have made to position Keysight ahead of this technology inflection. In R&D, we're enablers with our design and emulation solutions across the technology stack for key applications, including GPU servers, AI workload emulation and performance benchmarking. In manufacturing, AI cluster and switching deployments drove capacity demand this quarter, and we secured key wins in GPU rack connectivity applications with market-leading customers. Keysight also collaborated with Cisco and Panduit to demonstrate interconnect technologies in AI cluster networks to reduce power consumption. We're also actively engaged with customers in the ultra-ethernet consortium to define future network architectures for AI and high-performance workloads. In wireless, demand has been stable for the past three quarters, albeit at a lower level on a year-over-year basis. While customer spending remains cautious, the breadth of our solutions portfolio is enabling us to capture ongoing R&D investment in non-terrestrial networks, open radio access network deployments and release 18 of the 3GPP standard. Customers are also investing in scaling 5G and evaluating next-generation technologies. For example, at the recent IEEE International Conference and Communications, Keysight showcased early 6G technology together with Ericsson. Government incentives, particularly in U.S., Europe and Japan are driving development of a robust ecosystem to commercialize open radio access networks. This quarter, Keysight's open radio access network solutions enable state-of-the-art open testing and integration centers across the globe from Europe, to North America to Asia. Turning to aerospace, defense and government. Revenue and orders were down year-over-year, sequentially flat. The prolonged U.S. budget approval process has caused delays in appropriation of funding for new projects, which we expect to filter through over the next few quarters. In the interim, spending on defense modernization remains steady with healthy demand from U.S. primes and allied governments. Keysight recently expanded its engagement with U.S. government through joint cyber defense collaborative to enhance cybersecurity resiliency. In the quarter, we secured key wins with U.S. and European primes for spectrum operation applications. We also expanded our Quantum footprint with a multi-hundred Cubed application win with a key government customer. Turning to Electronic Industrial Solutions Group, revenue continued to normalize from a strong prior year declining double-digits as expected. Customer spending and market conditions remain muted, but we saw relative stability in orders and revenue on a sequential basis. In semiconductor, revenue was also down year-over-year versus an all-time high Q3 last year. Orders increased low-single-digits and were up strongly on a sequential basis. While certain segments of the market continue to work through excess inventory, higher performance requirements for AI workloads drove spending in advanced nodes, high-bandwidth memory and silicon photonics technologies. The investments that we have made specific to these market opportunities resulted in increased demand from foundry and memory customers for our parametric wafer test solutions. In automotive, orders and revenue declined double-digits. Lower auto manufacturing activity remains a headwind in the near-term. In new mobility, EV orders were lower as demand for some battery test and charging infrastructure investments were delayed, while AV orders grew mid-single-digits on a sequential basis. The opportunities in R&D continue to grow as customer engagement in transition to software-defined vehicles ramps. As an example, Riscure successfully completed the first car connectivity consortium digital key certification in conjunction with NXP. This certification strengthens trust in security of next-generation vehicles. It also further expands Keysight's security evaluation offering for the automotive industry. In general electronics, customer spending remains constrained, particularly in manufacturing, China and the distribution channel. There were pockets of growth in digital health and advanced research, where orders grew low-double-digits. Software and services revenues are resilient and grew this quarter while accounting for 39% of total Keysight revenue. Annual recurring revenue from software and services also increased year-over-year and in Q3 accounted for roughly 29% of overall Keysight. Our Eggplant software test automation platform is expanding with multiple consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. We're also gaining early traction in sales channel leverage between ESI and Keysight to expand into select accounts and geographies. The collaboration resulted in a key win in the satellite communication space. Lastly, Keysight's design engineering software platform continues to grow. This quarter, we launched new releases for virtual prototyping and simulation capabilities, which address high-performance use cases across our communications, aerospace and defense and automotive end markets. In summary, the strength and differentiation of Keysight's business model is enabling us to outperform in a variety of economic conditions. We're well positioned to capitalize on technology inflections ahead of us and remain laser-focused on value creation for both customers and shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook. Yes, hi Mark, thanks for the question. Obviously, we're encouraged by the continued stability that we see in our base business inflections that are material in our wireline business, some signs of rebound in semi, although it's too early to call it. So -- and then there's some incremental weakness in the automotive sector. So we put it all in the blender, and say, in this current environment, we're encouraged by this returning to slight year-over-year growth as we've seen, but it might be too soon to call a recovery at this time. And the key point is we're executing well, and we feel good about the -- our own portfolio and its differentiation and the investments we have made to continue to keep that going. Thanks, Mark. Yes, we're quite pleased that commercial communications orders grew double-digits this quarter. Again, as I mentioned, we have a pretty diverse portfolio that caters to the entire communication cycle system with solutions. So you can think of wireless and wireline and the wireline ecosystem represents roughly about 40% to 45% of our commercial communications business, and it's inflecting driven by the AI spend. Now when you think about how big could be longer term, I think the answer is becoming quite clear that AI is going to be a pretty transformational technology that's going to lead to evolutions of multiple underlying waves of standards and technologies, but it's not yet played out. Today, the state of the affairs is it's a highly concentrated opportunity set driven by the big investments made by the hyperscalers. And it is a constricted sort of constraint, I should say, sort of environment from a supply perspective. So there are some challenges that the customers are working through. So we're seeing, and we're picking up some of that capital investments that are playing out through our manufacturing business that is rapidly expanding. But equally, we're making good progress, I would say, in engaging with standardization across the entire stack and in making meaningful contributions in R&D across compute, power and thermal, networking protocols and memory, all aspects of innovation that customers are playing into. But again, the ecosystem, I believe, will broaden over time. And our goal has been for the last 18 months to nest this opportunity, feel good about our market position. Yes. Thank you, Aaron. Obviously, our long-term view of the opportunities and the underlying drivers remain unchanged. And so we would expect the business to trend back to those levels. That's point number one. However, look, '21 and '22 have been outsized years for our markets, and '23 was a flat year, flattish year. We continue to deliver value in '24 is a down year for the market. And so our first priority is to say that we can -- the business conditions have stabilized. That was our sort of first milestone, I should say. And as a sign of that, we feel good about what we had shared with you last quarter, which is that the second half orders would be greater than the first half, okay? So that's the first thing. Second is the shape of the recovery, as we've seen, it's still a pretty mixed environment. And we're not, at this point, factoring in an in-phase recovery, if you will, across all our multiple end markets. And therefore, we would, at this point, say we're thinking about this as a slow gradual recovery in 2025. However, the actions that we're taking in terms of things we control, our innovations, engagements with customers are all with an intent to maximize. And I feel good about Keysight's position. Obviously, we want to see some more progression in the funnel dynamics, which are trending positive, but you'll hear more from Mark later we want to see that progress a bit more before we can talk about what those growth rates might be for '25. Yes. Thank you. I'd say the older arching trends given the geopolitics that we're under are positive, so that's number one. There is bipartisan support for budgets in defense in the United States and increasing support for raising budgets around the world. Japan just announced an increase and Europe is also focused on that. And I feel good about Keysights focus -- long-term focus we've had in defense modernization with Quantum solutions with solutions for ultra-magnetic spectrum operations, space and satellite. They're all aligned with the right priorities. Having said that, the budgets and appropriation timing does have an impact really hard to predict on a quarterly basis. But we like the pipeline that's building. The prime contractors increases are also something we monitor in the U.S., and we feel good that those will all eventually flush into orders for us. This year, obviously, we're lapping a full year of 2023 of record levels for order and revenue for the aerospace and defense business. So you'll see some -- the revenue levels are down. And to the point about the long-dated backlog, we have won some large systems businesses last year and this year, which will also convert into revenue next year. So I would say that the drivers have remained intact. Our position remains solid and the pipeline is strong. Thank you. Yes. I would just say from a spiral, I'll take the second one first. Obviously, I'm going to be limited by what I can add. But I think an update to the situation is that we've received the shareholder approval Spirent shareholder approval for the transaction, and we're working through the regulatory process. And at this point, as we have stated before, we expect the transaction to be completed in the first half of fiscal '25. As far as your original question, I mean, it is quite exciting to see tremendous demand and inflection in the wireline business. As I mentioned before, it is concentrated and it is in a supply-constrained environment. So it remains to be seen how long the manufacturing build-outs go, but that's a near-term dynamic, and we're capitalizing on it. I think the R&D opportunities associated with the multiple areas that I touched upon the key sites, engaging with customers on. We feel like it gives us a good pipeline to go execute for the next three- to five-year horizon because there is going to be bigger wave. And with any of these technology trends, hard to really see it until it happens, so -- but we're engaged and we're making meaningful contributions for our customers. But I would expect stability in wireless to continue and some increase perhaps in deployment activity across the globe, which would give further some signs of growth to our component test business there. And then as I think about the wireline side of the business, continued investments in R&D, maybe some moderating manufacturing investments in the second half of next year. So that's sort of our thinking at this point. And maybe Mark can make a comment on the funnel dynamics. Yes. It's a really good question, Mehdi. I think the thing about our business is we tend to be more on the R&D labs of our customers. So we're on the front end. So towards that end, we see continued progression of standards, release '17, release '18, release '19 coming in and new teams such as AI in the context of RAN becoming real, open RAN deployments or Open RAN interoperability labs around the world are scaling. So all those are, I would say, positive trends from a sequential basis. Obviously, were down from the peak as the capex cycle from telcos are down. But the stability in the business is good. We feel good about our engagements around these next-generation themes that I mentioned, and then some earlier activity around 6G is picking up, which we're making contributions to. So -- but again, I would expect that the 5G business will have some stability because there's more deployment activities around the world, and that should provide some more stability until six GRIs. Thank you. Hi, thank you, Adam. And typically, end of the year, Adam, we would expect a seasonal uptick in our Aerospace and Defense business, which has always been the case. So that's another contributor as well. Yes. On the semi side, I'd say that the project activities are returning and we started to see some sequential growth. The pipeline remains solid and especially around memory, which is stronger and technologies such as silicon photonics, where we had invested with customers. And now AI is driving a higher sense of urgency to pull the trigger on those activities. Some parts on the logic side, still, it's still a mixed environment on the logic side. But we feel good about sequential recovery in that business. Thank you. Yes. So thank you. As you have rightfully noted, the automotive business and the automotive marketplace is transforming, right? And I think for Keysight historically, very low exposure in that area. And as we have said before, we have grown the business to $500 million almost from a very small base. And a big part of that was really manufacturing, one-third of the business is manufacturing and production where we are engaged in the electronics manufacturing of it, and we have a differentiated position there. Two-third of the business, obviously, is all new mobility EV that Mark Walls talked about earlier and AV as well. And it's a marketplace that continues to transform. On one dimension you have Chinese battery, call it, commoditization pressures that customers are feeling. And yet the regulations around batteries and their safety needs dictate more testing there in region. And on the other side, I think the commercial ecosystem is starting to engage directly with automakers. And that's what Mark defined as the software-defined vehicle opportunity set with silicon software combining and it really plays to Keysight's traditional strength, and it's more an extension of what we do for traditional comps customers and we're able to take those and go to market for them. Mark, anything further? Thank you, Priyanka. So what I stated was obviously the hyperscaler investment in digital infrastructure upgrade and the capital equipment being deployed to upgrade the networks to be more AI ready, if you will, is proliferating through the ecosystem and the large supply chain, and we're benefiting from the manufacturing exposure there. So that was point number one. But we're increasing our exposure as some of the hyperscalers enter into silicon programs and build their own organic capability, that's a growing customer base that we're continuing to expand into. We're also participating in consortiums for more open standardization that some of the hyperscalers are leading. So we're making a growing contribution there. And we feel good about our ability to take the physical and protocol layer assets into this marketplace and provide total solutions for customers, not only in traditional areas you would expect us to in computation or connectivity, but also into emulating training and inference scheme so that AI can scale effectively. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Keysight Technologies Fiscal Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sierra, and I will be your lead operator today. [Operator Instructions]. This call is being recorded today, Monday, May 20, 2024, at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time.  \n I would now like to hand the call over to Jason Kary, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Kary. \nJason Kary: Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to Keysight's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Fiscal year 2024. Joining me are Keysight's President and CEO, Satish Dhanasekaran; and our CFO, Neil Dougherty. In the Q&A session, we'll be joined by Chief Customer Officer, Mark Wallace. The press release and information to supplement today's discussion are on our website at investor.keysight.com under Financial Information and Quarterly Reports.  \n Today's comments will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. We will also make reference to core growth, which excludes the impacts of currency movements and acquisitions or divestitures completed within the last 12 months. The most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations are on our website and all our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. We will make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company on today's call. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. We assume no obligation to update them and encourage you to review our recent SEC filings for a more complete view of these risks and other factors.  \n Lastly, management is scheduled to participate in upcoming investor conferences hosted by Baird and UBS. And now I will turn the call over to Satish. \nSatish Dhanasekaran: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. My comments will focus on 3 key headlines. First, Keysight executed well in a market environment that was largely unchanged from the first quarter, revenue of $1.2 billion and earnings per share of $1.41 exceeded the high end of our guidance. Second, orders of $1.2 billion were in line with prior quarter. We saw pockets of growth and stability across multiple end markets even as customer spending remained constrained. Our base case scenario for the full year is unchanged with the revenue relatively stable from Q2 to Q3 and orders increasing modestly in the second half.  \n Third, our deep customer collaborations and relationships are strong and continue to inform our future road maps. These engagements reinforce our confidence in the long-term secular growth trends of our markets. The pace of innovation is accelerating across multiple vectors, and while remaining disciplined, we are investing to increase our differentiation and to capitalize on the waves of technology inflection ahead of us.  \n Now let me begin with a brief overview of Keysight's second quarter performance. Revenue of $1.2 billion and earnings per share of $1.41 were above our expectations. Revenue and orders continued to normalize from the strong prior year, but were stable on a sequential basis, excluding ESI seasonality. We delivered operating margin of 24% reflecting a healthy gross margin of 65% and the cost actions and discipline that we have exercised to date.  \n Turning to our business segments. Communications Solutions Group revenue declined versus prior year, which benefited from robust backlog conversion. On the demand front, orders were flat year-over-year and grew 4% on a sequential basis. Investment in defense modernization continue to drive activity in aerospace, defense and government, and we were pleased to see commercial communications order growth for the first time after 6 consecutive quarters of declines.  \n Wireline orders grew on a robust demand for our differentiated AI data center solutions. These include a new AI test platform that is being used by several industry leaders to emulate AI workloads and benchmark network performance.  \n Hyperscaler customer engagements remained high as they accelerated their AI application development. We deepened our R&D collaboration with NVIDIA on next-generation communication technologies this quarter. We also saw strong demand for AI infrastructure solutions, including test and validation of 400 and 800 gig transceivers and ultra high-speed interconnects in GPU-based compute systems.  \n Our advancement of leading-edge network innovation was on display at the Optical Fiber Conference, where we demonstrated the industry's first 1.6 terabit Ethernet test solution in partnership with industry leaders. In wireless, there are some encouraging signs of incremental improvement in the industry outlook as parts of the ecosystem continue to normalize. Our latest suite of 5G solutions launched over the past year is enabling ongoing investment in evolution of 5G standards, nonterrestrial and open RAN.  \n With the first round of NTIA grants to enhance testing of interoperability, performance and security of open RAN networks, we secured key wins with several customers in the U.S. We also saw increased demand for chipset R&D as well as component production.  \n Earlier in the quarter, we partnered with industry leaders to showcase new products and solutions at Mobile World Congress including nonterrestrial network chipset development with Qualcomm.  \n Turning to Aerospace, Defense and Government, defense modernization spending continued in radar and spectrum operations, space and satellite and signal monitoring. We saw a healthy demand from the U.S. government and primes in the quarter. After several continuing resolutions, the 2024 U.S. defense budget was approved in late March. It includes a 5% increase for research, development, test and evaluation, which is expected to drive incremental program spend.  \n Strong demand for electromagnetic spectrum operation applications resulted in significant wins at U.S. and European Prime. We expect this trend to continue into the second half and 2025.  \n Turning to Electronic Industrial Solutions Group, orders and revenue continue to normalize from a record prior year, declining double digits as expected. Customer spending and market conditions remain muted, but we saw relative stability on a sequential basis.  \n In semiconductor, the industry outlook is improving with projections of recovery in 2025. Inventories are coming down to more healthy levels and demand is picking up in certain areas such as high-bandwidth memory. Additional new fab installations were announced this quarter, in the near term, foundry customers are working through delays in existing projects and expect production to begin in late '24 and '25. Consistent with this backdrop, we saw improvement in our memory-related business and ongoing steady demand for Keysight's proprietary laser Interferometer positioning systems.  \n In automotive, revenue was sequentially stable when excluding acquisitions. We had a steady demand for both our EV and AV solutions. Beyond the headlines, consumer adoption of EV continues to grow, although at a slower pace. The development of cost-effective, longer-range batteries and a more robust charging infrastructure remains a strategic priority for OEMs and governments in a very competitive market.  \n During the quarter, we expanded our global battery test footprint with a new large Gigafactory customer in Europe. We're also pleased with the addition of ESI to our automotive and simulation software solutions portfolio. The business is tracking well to both top line and profit expectations. This quarter, ESI expanded its multi-decade collaboration with Volkswagen Group, establishing a joint material testing and intelligent simulation lab in Asia. This collaboration will advance automotive simulation technology and drive new to industry standard safety and efficiency forward in the region.  \n In general electronics markets, customer spending remains constrained, particularly in manufacturing, China and the distribution channel, we do continue to see growth in digital health and advanced research supported by government funding in Asia and the U.S., such as the CHIPS Act. This quarter, we expanded our partnership with EMVision in Australia to enable innovation in novel point-of-care medical imaging technology and analysis.  \n As a key element of our solution strategy, software and services orders and revenue growth continued to outpace overall Keysight. At approximately 39% of total revenue, software and services enhance the differentiation of our solutions and are more resilient in current market conditions. Within the chip domain, next-generation performance demands are driving an exponential increase in system level design requirements and complexity. Keysight simulation and emulation software capabilities enable our customers to address these challenges and accelerate time to market for their advanced systems and chips. We recently introduced Quantum Pro, an integrated EDA solution for Cubic design and the development of quantum computers.  \n In addition, we launched a new solution for die-to-die interconnect simulation, which is a key step in verifying performance of heterogeneous and 3D integrated circuit designs commonly known as chiplets. Looking ahead, the pace of technology innovation and digitization is accelerating and proliferating across multiple industries and use cases. Keysight is investing today both organically and inorganically to capitalize on these future technology waves and inflections.  \n In addition to steady organic investment in R&D, we are expanding our solutions portfolio and our served addressable markets through M&A. This quarter, we announced our intent to acquire Spartan Communications, a highly complementary business in network analytics. We also completed the acquisition of Riscure in the quarter, expanding our automated security assessment capabilities and solutions for semiconductors, embedded systems and connected devices.  \n In closing, I would like to thank our employees once again for consistently delivering value to our customers and shareholders. The Keysight team's high performance and winning culture is key to our success and a competitive differentiator. While it's difficult to call the timing of the recovery, we're encouraged by pockets of growth that are emerging, the relative stability of investment levels and the strength of our customer collaborations Consistent with the Keysight leadership model, we remain disciplined and continue to streamline operations to ensure strong financial performance in these dynamic market conditions.  \n As we look beyond the current period of normalization, the long-term secular growth trends driving our business are intact. Taken together, our broad portfolio of differentiated solutions, strong customer relationships, technology leadership and durable financial model positions us well into a market recovery. With that, I'll turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook. \nNeil Dougherty: Thank you, Satish, and hello, everyone. Second quarter revenue of $1.216 billion was just above the high end of our guidance range and down 13% or 14% on a core basis. Orders of $1.219 billion declined 8% or 9% on a core basis. As a reminder, Keysight's historical first to second quarter seasonality was muted by the cadence of the ESI business with approximately half of ESI orders and revenue recognized in the first quarter of the fiscal year. Excluding ESI, orders grew 4% sequentially, and revenue was in line with Q1. We ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in backlog.\n Looking at our operational results for Q2, we reported gross margin of 65%. Operating expenses of $496 million were down 2% year-over-year even with the addition of ESI and Riscure. Excluding these acquisitions, SG&A expenses were down 10% or $29 million, reflecting the flexibility of our cost structure and actions taken to date. Q2 operating margin was 24% or 25% on a core basis. Despite a 14% decline in core revenue in the first half, first half operating margin declined 400 basis points, outperforming Keysight's downside model expectations and demonstrating the financial resiliency of the business. \n Turning to earnings. We achieved $247 million of net income and delivered earnings of $1.41 per share. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 175 million shares. \n Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated revenue of $840 million down 10% or 11% on a core basis. Commercial communications revenue of $563 million declined 10% while Aerospace, Defense and Government revenue of $277 million was down 11%. Altogether, CSG delivered gross margin of 68% and operating margin of 27%. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated revenue of $376 million, down 17% or 21% on a core basis. EISG reported gross margin of 58% and operating margin of 19% due to the seasonality of ESI profitability, lower revenue volume and some unfavorability in mix. \n Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generating cash flow from operations of $110 million and free cash flow of $74 million, which reflected higher cash taxes and the timing of collections in the quarter. \n Share repurchases this quarter totaled 302,000 shares at an average price per share of approximately $153 for a total consideration of $46 million. \n Now turning to our outlook. We expect third quarter revenue to be in the range of $1.180 billion to $1.200 billion and Q3 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.30 to $1.36 and based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 175 million shares. As we look to the full year, our base case scenario remains the same and assumes a mid-single-digit increase in revenue from Q3 to Q4, which implies full year revenue of approximately $4.9 billion. \n In closing, we remain disciplined and focused on what we control, while investing to capitalize on the best growth opportunities as markets normalize and recover. Keysight's customer focus, technology leadership and broad solutions portfolio give us confidence in the long-term trajectory of the business and the ability to outperform in a variety of market conditions. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A. \nJason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Sierra, would you give the instructions for the Q&A, please? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Rob Mason with Baird. \nRobert Mason: So I'm thinking -- it sounds like your base case for the year, obviously, is still intact. Just thinking through that more thoroughly, the orders typically in the third quarter maybe down -- maybe flat to down slightly sequentially. And then you have better order trends in the fourth quarter seasonally.  Should we think this is, again, still tied more to book and ship as you think about the revenue upticking in the fourth quarter? Or any help you can provide just on the clarity for that slope? \nNeil Dougherty: Yes. So yes. So first of all, I agree with your assessment of the typical seasonality of our business as we typically move from Q2 to Q3, I'd say the small downtick in both orders and revenue would be typical for seasonality, admittedly hard to find over the last couple of years, COVID, recovery supply chain. But if you went back in time, that would have been the typical seasonality. Then with the mid-single-digit uptick into Q4 driven by [indiscernible] annualized sales cycle or second half sales cycle as well as the strength of aerospace defense business tied to the government fiscal year-end. And I think that's largely what we're seeing here this year as well as we -- in terms of our expectation for the remainder of the year. \nRobert Mason: Very good. And then just as a follow-up, could you dig a little bit deeper into your overall Wireline business, the AI data center piece, obviously, seeing some strength. I'm just curious with these new platforms that are rolling out, what stage of adoption are we seeing with those? And just comment more broadly on the Wireline business over and beyond the AI data center exposure? \nSatish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Rob. I think this quarter for the first time in 6 quarters, our commercial communications orders grew, and as a result of the inflection that we're seeing in the wireline business associated with AI. And it's still very early days as the world continues to look at all of the applications that could be launched leveraging AI at scale. And I would say it's still very early days even for Keysight's business. So what we're seeing is probably a first inflection, I would say.\n The big headline that we've seen in the last couple of quarters and that accelerated this quarter was the push from customers to lead in the hardware infrastructure space and how critical it's performance is for cost, for energy and in general for the user experience in the AI application. For Keysight, in our Wireline business, having the breadth of the portfolio that caters to networking, computing, storage, interconnects -- and we're able to make contributions that are broad, but we're just getting started is the way I would frame it up -- the heterogeneous environment there is helping us play a critical role, and we're also engaged in a number of these standards bodies. So we saw strong double-digit growth in the business for the Wireline business this quarter, and also sequentially a strong uptick in Q2. \nOperator: Next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. \nWilliam G. Bryant: This is Will Bryant on for Mark Delaney. So in your press release, you all reiterated that you are assuming modest order growth in the second half of the fiscal year. Can you give us some additional color on what gives you confidence that the orders will pick up in the second half? \nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you. I think what we have said is the market environment remains unchanged. And as we said in the previous call, we're not -- our base case does not assume any significant market recovery, right? So barring that is just a seasonal uptick in Q4 as Neil just referenced coming from our aerospace defense business. But we are continuing to feel that the demand environment is stabilizing. I would say, as I pointed out earlier, Wireline inflections and demand remains strong. I'd say the aerospace defense is stable. And our ISG business, which had -- which had seen 4 quarters, including the current quarter of declines stemming from normalization and manufacturing is also starting to show some seasonal -- or starting to show some sequential growth, I should say, this quarter, all of which we view as sense of stability in the business. \nWilliam G. Bryant: That's helpful. And just 1 quick follow-up on just thinking about how you guys are managing OpEx as you guys are planning the business in these volatile end markets. Could you give us any additional color about what you want to manage OpEx? \nNeil Dougherty: Yes. First, I'd remind you of the statements we made a quarter ago that we do expect if excluding the additional OpEx from our acquisitions, our total OpEx spending to be down about 3% on a year-over-year basis with all of that savings coming from the SG&A line items as we look to maintain our investments in R&D to ensure that the business is well positioned to capture the upswing when it occurs. .\n I think we're looking in terms of the types of actions that we're taking. We're obviously always looking for ways to streamline operations and drive efficiency in our business. I think if you take a look, you'll notice that over the course of the last 4 quarters, our headcounts are down about 5% as we look to absorb attrition. We've provided some incentives for folks to transition into retirement, and been absorbing those during this period of time. \n In addition, we obviously have a very flexible cost structure -- cost structure has been flexing as expected, which is also contributing to the financial performance in line with our model. \nOperator: Our next question today comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. \nAaron Rakers: I'll just put them both out there right away. I guess on the EISG segment. I'm curious on the semiconductor space. Can you, first of all, help us appreciate the size of that or any kind of clarity you could give in terms of that piece of ESIG. And within that, how do we think about these fab projects being delayed into late calendar '24 and into '25 and the timing when that starts to turn more positive. And then I'd also be curious on the interconnect side, you mentioned chip-to-chip interconnect simulation stuff. I'm curious how much of an opportunity that presents? Who are you competing against there and just kind of framing that out as far as opportunities as we look forward? \nNeil Dougherty: Yes. So I'll take the first question, sizing of [semi and then] hand it over to Mark to make some comments on the market. What we've said is that our semi business is kind of 10-ish percent of total Keysight maybe a little less. \nMark Wallace: Okay. Yes. And then in terms of the fabs and the delays of timing, we've been watching that closely over the last several quarters, we have seen some movement. We've said before that our funnel gives us about 6 months of visibility out into market timing, and we're starting to see some activity that would suggest that some of those fab expansions that have been delayed the funding associated with them should be beginning to show some signs of CapEx spend towards the end of the calendar year. But we're watching it very closely. \n We have very deep relationships with the customers -- and certainly, the underlying drivers for advanced process technologies related back to AI are continuing to be very strong as these applications begin to grow at scale. \nSatish Dhanasekaran: And then last point of you question was on interconnect -- last part of your question, I didn't want to miss it. It was our interconnect technologies. And as you think about data center coming from today's node sizes of $300,000 or $250,000 to $1 million and beyond. At some point, I think interconnect has become very important. The nature of those interconnects, the high performance requirement associated with them are critical, and therefore, interoperability testing needs are key and key sites, differentiated technologies across our core product line is playing a critical role already, and we'll continue to play a critical role moving forward to help our customers. \nOperator: Our next question today comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. \nMeta Marshall: Maybe a couple of questions for me. First, just on ESI, -- any commentary in terms of ability to sell that product to other customers as you get it integrated in or just any commentary on early performance. And then just maybe as a second question, any update on long-dated orders or contribution of orders from long-dated orders worth noting? . \nSatish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Meta. Again, we're quite pleased with the acquisition. The performance in the first half has exceeded our initial plans, so which is good. Again, I view this simulation and emulation as a long-term strategic priority for the company and ESI was clearly -- gave us some differentiated capability to go pursue it. The culture fit 1, 2 quarters in is re-traded because our teams are working seamlessly, the collaborative culture, the focus on technology, all of those things are headed in the right direction. .\n And from a revenue acceleration perspective, that's the focus for the team, right? It's -- we're really prioritizing taking ESI's core products into aerospace defense in the U.S. and increasing our exposure with Asian auto manufacturers. I'll let Mark make some comments on how the sales team is doing on that front. But overall, quite pleased with the acquisition. \nMark Wallace: Thanks, Satish. It's been an exciting quarter and half for us as we've begun to work more closely across different geographies, really the plan that we put in place back in late Q1 continues to be the plan we're executing around our common areas of focus from a customer standpoint in North America, where ESI is underexposed with aerospace defense. And then in both directions around auto, especially in Europe, we're seeing opportunities open for both our classic business and working closely with ESI. \n So momentum. These are fairly long cycle, sales cycles many months to get to a point of closure, but we're already starting to see some progress in our funnel, and I'm encouraged with the way the teams are working together. \nNeil Dougherty: And just a quick comment on long-dated orders. The mix of long-dated disorders within the quarter were consistent with the recent past. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. \nMatthew Niknam: Just 2, if I could. First, maybe big picture if you could talk a little bit about the Spirent deal, why now and maybe some of the strategic rationale behind that deal? And then secondarily, just as we think about operating cash flow, maybe for Neil, if you could just maybe talk a little bit about some of the drivers of relative softness this quarter and how to think about working cap and some of the other items that go into that for the second half of the year? \nSatish Dhanasekaran: Thank you. As far as being a company we've known for some time, we used to have a partnership with them. And I think the rationale headlines are: first, it's a SAM expansion opportunity. You think about the portfolio aspirant with focus on service assurance, positioning really a good fit to that network analytics expansion opportunity I laid out at the Investor Day. And then when I think about the financial aspect of this deal, I think it creates value for customers and more scale and synergies inside the Keysight environment, but equally for our shareholders, it's a good deal from a point of view of -- it meets our hurdles, M&A hurdles internally and it's accretive to gross and operating margins post integration. \n So we feel really good about the opportunity. We're continuing to work through the regulatory process right now. \nNeil Dougherty: Yes. And then getting to your question on free cash flow and working capital. So obviously, free cash flow is a little bit softer within the quarter, but pointing out north of $350 million through the first half of this year. .\n In terms of within the quarter, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we do have seasonably higher tax payments in the second quarter of the fiscal year. That was expected. And then the timing of revenue over the past couple of quarters was not conducive to high collections within the quarter is the best way to say that. We actually entered the quarter with about $90 million lower accounts receivable than we entered the prior quarter. And then because of Lunar New Year and other things, we got off to a bit of a slow start in February. And so that meant that the -- those Q2 revenues that otherwise would have been collectible within the quarter was -- we were off to a slow start. \n I think your question about working capital, just a couple of comments. So while collections were lower within the quarter, we do not have any material increased risk around accounts receivable, our allowance for bad debt is very low, and we tend to not have issues in that area. We do, however, have significantly increased inventory over the past couple of years, largely stemming from various things related to the supply chain. We delayed for a long time, the refresh of our demo portfolio so we could take new products and get them to customers. when supply chains normalize, we did refresh our demo portfolio and took the existing demo equipment and put it under a used equipment pool, which is a benefit now because it gives us yet another opportunity to serve customers. And we also had to make some investments because some of our vendors were cleaning up their part list, we had to make some longer-term investments in the assurance of supply -- in inventory. \n So I feel pretty good about it. I think there is a path to reducing inventory over time, but it's going to be hard to market recovery. \nOperator: Our next question today comes from David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America. \nDavid Ridley-Lane: Several competitors have pushed out their own recovery time lines. You're obviously sticking with yours. What are the 1 or 2 things that you would point to in the results that give you the most confidence in that outlook? \nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you, David. I think, look, we look at it 1 quarter at a time. And so far, our focus has been on execution in our discussion with customers, I would say that's the most relevant 1 as many customers have commented that they are going through the bottom. -- has their own economics improve. They've come back and they have doubled down on the programs and projects that we've been in discussions with. So that inflecting nature that correlation to their business is perhaps the most important 1 that we look at. \n Big picture, when we start to look at macro factors, I would say, SIA, you look at even smartphone sales, PC sales, other things, you start to see some improvement along with the PMI indices that are growing. So while not calling for timing or magnitude of recovery at this point, we remain focused on execution. The 1 tactical area that we -- the data that we have in-house is on our pipeline, and I'll have Mark make a comment on the pipeline. \nMark Wallace: Yes, David, I would just simply say our pipeline supports this expectation of the modest improvement in H2 orders driven by the seasonality in Q4. Funnel intake, which is growth of new business into the funnel is up in pockets with the green shoots that we've already spoken about with AI and wireline memory, and continued demand in the longer-term secular businesses that we've spoken about with aerospace, defense and EV. We have not yet seen the lift from the U.S. defense budget being signed in the middle of March. So we hope to see some of that come through as well. \n And again, velocity is key, and we're starting to see some of that pick up, which shows some confidence in our customers. \nDavid Ridley-Lane: Got it. Okay. And just a quick follow-up. Obviously, you have your internal plans in terms of the cost actions you're taking. I was a bit surprised that the sort of the magnitude of the restructuring cost in the quarter though. Did you take expanded actions? Or is this all part of the plan as envisioned 3, 6 months ago? \nNeil Dougherty: No expanded actions. I think if you're looking at the reconciliations that were provided -- the category is actually listed as restricting other and there was a modest legal settlement that occurred within the quarter as well that's skewing that number higher. \nOperator: Our next question today comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson, Davis. \nAdam Thalhimer: In the EISG segment in the ESG segment, do you see revenue -- do you see further weakness in revenue and margins in the back half? Or do you think things improve versus Q2? \nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I think I would say the answer is twofold, right? One is on the order line, we think the demand environment improves a bit as we go into the second half, especially Q4, driven by some of the semiconductor spend that we're expecting to land in Q4, but again, revenue would be offset because some of the business that we book in the EISG does have a bigger percentage of long-dated sort of backlog items. So it is twofold. We expect that Neil can give us -- we would expect that revenue would be -- would face some headwinds in the second half even as orders improve. . \nNeil Dougherty: Yes. As you think about the margin situation in EISG, I highlighted kind of 3 factors, right, the seasonality of ESI, which is strongly profitable in Q1 in a modest loss position in the remainder of the year, that is impacting ISG profit. But by far the biggest -- the biggest driver is the revenue decline, right? So revenues down sharply here in Q2. And I think as long as we're operating in these revenue ranges, it's going to be reasonably range-bound in the current operating margin vicinity. \nMark Wallace: And just want to add on the order line. The EISG business in Asia went in about 2 quarters after CSP. So that was just lapped at the end of Q2. So that gives us some confidence that the comparison lease will be getting easier in the second half. \nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. And then 1 for commercial communications on -- can you help us frame the AI data center opportunity for you guys versus 5G at the peak? \nSatish Dhanasekaran: Well, first of all, from a timing perspective, it's very early days for the AI opportunity primarily because there are obviously logical areas where we engage with customers, but we have several active collaborations underway around silicon, 1 on real-time training of clusters, interconnects, testing methodologies for benchmarking AI, protocol aspects of the new standard [EUEC] transceiver manufacturing interoperability. So while we are in booking some business today, and we have some several active collaborations underway which are quite promising, and the ecosystem of customers that we serve will expand over time. \n Very hard to compare and contrast with 5G or wireless side. But I think -- the key for the commercial comps business has always been to increase our emphasis in early R&D because we know that it makes us much more strategic and critical to customers. Second is to maintain diversity in application sets. So we have both equal focus on wireless and wireline that give us ways to drive growth by market. And then we feel really good about our competitive position on our portfolio strength and it's only going to grow as we -- as the industry adopts AI at scale. \nOperator: Next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna. \nMehdi Hosseini: Two follow-ups. Satish, I'm trying to better understand how you're managing business beyond the second half -- and I want to go back to the Analyst Day, you talked about the 5% to 7% longer-term revenue growth. And obviously, 2023 -- fiscal year '23, turned out will be a lot worse. So it helps you with a lower base. And if I even think of the low end of that longer-term revenue target range, your revenues in FY '25 and '26 would need to be up double digit. And what I want to understand, as I noted earlier, I want to see how you're planning how you're running the operation. I don't see any 1 killer app on the horizon. There are several smaller killer app. And to what extent M&A is going to be part of your strategy to hit that revenue target? And I have a follow-up. \nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you, Mehdi. So I know you asked several questions in one, but let's make sure I hit all of them. But I'll start by saying, look, we feel really good about our long-term growth expectations for the business. And as we laid out the 3-pronged growth strategy at Investor Day, we see these technology trends are accelerating. We see transforming industries increasing our ecosystem of customers we can serve, and we see market dynamics with governments around the world investing for organic IP. So none of those have fundamentally changed, and we feel like we're in a good position. And if you look at our strategy through this downturn is to continue to invest in R&D in a prudent way, but really focus those investments on where our customers need the most help, especially in the R&D labs of our customers making us more strategic and the cost actions that we've taken in navigating this downturn has been largely on the SG&A line. So we feel good about the opportunity that we see ahead. .\n As far as the -- our ability to deliver to those results, clearly, while we feel good, it is possible that the time line pushes out a bit given the decline that we've had in '24. And so a lot depends on the timing of the recovery. But if history is any measure, every time we've had strong pullbacks, we've had stronger uptrend as well in terms of orders. So we continue to watch that strategically. Software and services has been an area of focus for us. Software and Services now is roughly 40% of the total company, which is a good trend, and we want to keep driving that higher -- and as I've reiterated before, we look at several deals. We've looked at over 350, 400 deals in the company, and we've only done about 20. So we're very selective in our strategy. It's not about revenue. We look strategically at the areas where we feel like we want to make a bigger contribution and where we can bring value to those assets when they come inside Keysight. So there is -- from that point of view, there's really no change. We're an organic first company. We believe in investing with our customers to create long-term value. \nMehdi Hosseini: Great. And then maybe follow-up and put the question to Neil. As you think about these longer-term targets and inventory cash flow normalizing, should we assume that your free cash flow would go back to the historical average of like high-teen percentage of revenue that was very significant when we were going through the up cycle a couple of years ago? \nNeil Dougherty: Yes. I think over time, Mehdi, but I think in the short run, the way we think about free cash flow internally is we look for a relatively high conversion of non-GAAP net income into free cash flow. And we've talked about running that in the 90% or higher range. And so while we don't have a specific free cash flow guide that we put out there, I think that's how we think about it over the longer term. The 1 thing that I would say, and you can see this by looking back in our history, is that there are periods of time where we have kind of nonstandard cash flow items that can reduce that level of free cash flow conversion. And specifically, I'm thinking about things like restructuring costs. And most notably, given where we are right now, M&A costs, either integration or transaction costs associated with M&A. \n So as you start to think of about us now working on the integration of ESI and hopefully in the not-too-distant future, beginning to work on the integration of Spirent, those things will be short-term drains on free cash flow conversion. I think the good news is the ability for us to drive future benefits. We talked about Spirent being ultimately accretive to operating margins, it's ultimately going to drive higher free cash flows going forward once we get through these periods of integration. \nOperator: Thank you all for your questions. That will conclude our Q&A session for today. I would like to turn the call back to Jason Kary for any closing comments. \nJason Kary: Thank you, everyone, for joining us, and we appreciate the opportunity to speak with you today. We'll turn it back to Sierra just to wrap up and close the call. \nOperator: Thank you. That will conclude today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Okay. Yes. And then in terms of the fabs and the delays of timing, we've been watching that closely over the last several quarters, we have seen some movement. We've said before that our funnel gives us about 6 months of visibility out into market timing, and we're starting to see some activity that would suggest that some of those fab expansions that have been delayed the funding associated with them should be beginning to show some signs of CapEx spend towards the end of the calendar year. But we're watching it very closely. \n We have very deep relationships with the customers -- and certainly, the underlying drivers for advanced process technologies related back to AI are continuing to be very strong as these applications begin to grow at scale. Thanks, Satish. It's been an exciting quarter and half for us as we've begun to work more closely across different geographies, really the plan that we put in place back in late Q1 continues to be the plan we're executing around our common areas of focus from a customer standpoint in North America, where ESI is underexposed with aerospace defense. And then in both directions around auto, especially in Europe, we're seeing opportunities open for both our classic business and working closely with ESI. \n So momentum. These are fairly long cycle, sales cycles many months to get to a point of closure, but we're already starting to see some progress in our funnel, and I'm encouraged with the way the teams are working together. Yes, David, I would just simply say our pipeline supports this expectation of the modest improvement in H2 orders driven by the seasonality in Q4. Funnel intake, which is growth of new business into the funnel is up in pockets with the green shoots that we've already spoken about with AI and wireline memory, and continued demand in the longer-term secular businesses that we've spoken about with aerospace, defense and EV.

            "name": "Neil Dougherty",
            "content": "Thank you, Satish, and hello, everyone. Second quarter revenue of $1.216 billion was just above the high end of our guidance range and down 13% or 14% on a core basis. Orders of $1.219 billion declined 8% or 9% on a core basis. As a reminder, Keysight's historical first to second quarter seasonality was muted by the cadence of the ESI business with approximately half of ESI orders and revenue recognized in the first quarter of the fiscal year. Excluding ESI, orders grew 4% sequentially, and revenue was in line with Q1. We ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in backlog.\n Looking at our operational results for Q2, we reported gross margin of 65%. Operating expenses of $496 million were down 2% year-over-year even with the addition of ESI and Riscure. Excluding these acquisitions, SG&A expenses were down 10% or $29 million, reflecting the flexibility of our cost structure and actions taken to date. Q2 operating margin was 24% or 25% on a core basis. Despite a 14% decline in core revenue in the first half, first half operating margin declined 400 basis points, outperforming Keysight's downside model expectations and demonstrating the financial resiliency of the business. \n Turning to earnings. We achieved $247 million of net income and delivered earnings of $1.41 per share. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 175 million shares. \n Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated revenue of $840 million down 10% or 11% on a core basis. Commercial communications revenue of $563 million declined 10% while Aerospace, Defense and Government revenue of $277 million was down 11%. Altogether, CSG delivered gross margin of 68% and operating margin of 27%. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated revenue of $376 million, down 17% or 21% on a core basis. EISG reported gross margin of 58% and operating margin of 19% due to the seasonality of ESI profitability, lower revenue volume and some unfavorability in mix. \n Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generating cash flow from operations of $110 million and free cash flow of $74 million, which reflected higher cash taxes and the timing of collections in the quarter. \n Share repurchases this quarter totaled 302,000 shares at an average price per share of approximately $153 for a total consideration of $46 million. \n Now turning to our outlook. We expect third quarter revenue to be in the range of $1.180 billion to $1.200 billion and Q3 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.30 to $1.36 and based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 175 million shares. As we look to the full year, our base case scenario remains the same and assumes a mid-single-digit increase in revenue from Q3 to Q4, which implies full year revenue of approximately $4.9 billion. \n In closing, we remain disciplined and focused on what we control, while investing to capitalize on the best growth opportunities as markets normalize and recover. Keysight's customer focus, technology leadership and broad solutions portfolio give us confidence in the long-term trajectory of the business and the ability to outperform in a variety of market conditions. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A. Yes. So yes. So first of all, I agree with your assessment of the typical seasonality of our business as we typically move from Q2 to Q3, I'd say the small downtick in both orders and revenue would be typical for seasonality, admittedly hard to find over the last couple of years, COVID, recovery supply chain. But if you went back in time, that would have been the typical seasonality. Then with the mid-single-digit uptick into Q4 driven by [indiscernible] annualized sales cycle or second half sales cycle as well as the strength of aerospace defense business tied to the government fiscal year-end. And I think that's largely what we're seeing here this year as well as we -- in terms of our expectation for the remainder of the year. Yes. First, I'd remind you of the statements we made a quarter ago that we do expect if excluding the additional OpEx from our acquisitions, our total OpEx spending to be down about 3% on a year-over-year basis with all of that savings coming from the SG&A line items as we look to maintain our investments in R&D to ensure that the business is well positioned to capture the upswing when it occurs. .\n I think we're looking in terms of the types of actions that we're taking. We're obviously always looking for ways to streamline operations and drive efficiency in our business. I think if you take a look, you'll notice that over the course of the last 4 quarters, our headcounts are down about 5% as we look to absorb attrition. We've provided some incentives for folks to transition into retirement, and been absorbing those during this period of time. \n In addition, we obviously have a very flexible cost structure -- cost structure has been flexing as expected, which is also contributing to the financial performance in line with our model. Yes. So I'll take the first question, sizing of [semi and then] hand it over to Mark to make some comments on the market. What we've said is that our semi business is kind of 10-ish percent of total Keysight maybe a little less. And just a quick comment on long-dated orders. The mix of long-dated disorders within the quarter were consistent with the recent past. Yes. And then getting to your question on free cash flow and working capital. So obviously, free cash flow is a little bit softer within the quarter, but pointing out north of $350 million through the first half of this year. .\n In terms of within the quarter, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we do have seasonably higher tax payments in the second quarter of the fiscal year. That was expected. And then the timing of revenue over the past couple of quarters was not conducive to high collections within the quarter is the best way to say that. We actually entered the quarter with about $90 million lower accounts receivable than we entered the prior quarter. And then because of Lunar New Year and other things, we got off to a bit of a slow start in February. And so that meant that the -- those Q2 revenues that otherwise would have been collectible within the quarter was -- we were off to a slow start. \n I think your question about working capital, just a couple of comments. So while collections were lower within the quarter, we do not have any material increased risk around accounts receivable, our allowance for bad debt is very low, and we tend to not have issues in that area. We do, however, have significantly increased inventory over the past couple of years, largely stemming from various things related to the supply chain. We delayed for a long time, the refresh of our demo portfolio so we could take new products and get them to customers. when supply chains normalize, we did refresh our demo portfolio and took the existing demo equipment and put it under a used equipment pool, which is a benefit now because it gives us yet another opportunity to serve customers.

I think there is a path to reducing inventory over time, but it's going to be hard to market recovery. No expanded actions. I think if you're looking at the reconciliations that were provided -- the category is actually listed as restricting other and there was a modest legal settlement that occurred within the quarter as well that's skewing that number higher. Yes. As you think about the margin situation in EISG, I highlighted kind of 3 factors, right, the seasonality of ESI, which is strongly profitable in Q1 in a modest loss position in the remainder of the year, that is impacting ISG profit. But by far the biggest -- the biggest driver is the revenue decline, right? So revenues down sharply here in Q2.

            "name": "Satish Dhanasekaran",
            "content": "Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. My comments will focus on 3 key headlines. First, Keysight executed well in a market environment that was largely unchanged from the first quarter, revenue of $1.2 billion and earnings per share of $1.41 exceeded the high end of our guidance. Second, orders of $1.2 billion were in line with prior quarter. We saw pockets of growth and stability across multiple end markets even as customer spending remained constrained. Our base case scenario for the full year is unchanged with the revenue relatively stable from Q2 to Q3 and orders increasing modestly in the second half.  \n Third, our deep customer collaborations and relationships are strong and continue to inform our future road maps. These engagements reinforce our confidence in the long-term secular growth trends of our markets. The pace of innovation is accelerating across multiple vectors, and while remaining disciplined, we are investing to increase our differentiation and to capitalize on the waves of technology inflection ahead of us.  \n Now let me begin with a brief overview of Keysight's second quarter performance. Revenue of $1.2 billion and earnings per share of $1.41 were above our expectations. Revenue and orders continued to normalize from the strong prior year, but were stable on a sequential basis, excluding ESI seasonality. We delivered operating margin of 24% reflecting a healthy gross margin of 65% and the cost actions and discipline that we have exercised to date.  \n Turning to our business segments. Communications Solutions Group revenue declined versus prior year, which benefited from robust backlog conversion. On the demand front, orders were flat year-over-year and grew 4% on a sequential basis. Investment in defense modernization continue to drive activity in aerospace, defense and government, and we were pleased to see commercial communications order growth for the first time after 6 consecutive quarters of declines.  \n Wireline orders grew on a robust demand for our differentiated AI data center solutions. These include a new AI test platform that is being used by several industry leaders to emulate AI workloads and benchmark network performance.  \n Hyperscaler customer engagements remained high as they accelerated their AI application development. We deepened our R&D collaboration with NVIDIA on next-generation communication technologies this quarter. We also saw strong demand for AI infrastructure solutions, including test and validation of 400 and 800 gig transceivers and ultra high-speed interconnects in GPU-based compute systems.  \n Our advancement of leading-edge network innovation was on display at the Optical Fiber Conference, where we demonstrated the industry's first 1.6 terabit Ethernet test solution in partnership with industry leaders. In wireless, there are some encouraging signs of incremental improvement in the industry outlook as parts of the ecosystem continue to normalize. Our latest suite of 5G solutions launched over the past year is enabling ongoing investment in evolution of 5G standards, nonterrestrial and open RAN.  \n With the first round of NTIA grants to enhance testing of interoperability, performance and security of open RAN networks, we secured key wins with several customers in the U.S. We also saw increased demand for chipset R&D as well as component production.  \n Earlier in the quarter, we partnered with industry leaders to showcase new products and solutions at Mobile World Congress including nonterrestrial network chipset development with Qualcomm.  \n Turning to Aerospace, Defense and Government, defense modernization spending continued in radar and spectrum operations, space and satellite and signal monitoring. We saw a healthy demand from the U.S. government and primes in the quarter. After several continuing resolutions, the 2024 U.S. defense budget was approved in late March. It includes a 5% increase for research, development, test and evaluation, which is expected to drive incremental program spend.  \n Strong demand for electromagnetic spectrum operation applications resulted in significant wins at U.S. and European Prime. We expect this trend to continue into the second half and 2025.  \n Turning to Electronic Industrial Solutions Group, orders and revenue continue to normalize from a record prior year, declining double digits as expected. Customer spending and market conditions remain muted, but we saw relative stability on a sequential basis.  \n In semiconductor, the industry outlook is improving with projections of recovery in 2025. Inventories are coming down to more healthy levels and demand is picking up in certain areas such as high-bandwidth memory. Additional new fab installations were announced this quarter, in the near term, foundry customers are working through delays in existing projects and expect production to begin in late '24 and '25. Consistent with this backdrop, we saw improvement in our memory-related business and ongoing steady demand for Keysight's proprietary laser Interferometer positioning systems.  \n In automotive, revenue was sequentially stable when excluding acquisitions. We had a steady demand for both our EV and AV solutions. Beyond the headlines, consumer adoption of EV continues to grow, although at a slower pace. The development of cost-effective, longer-range batteries and a more robust charging infrastructure remains a strategic priority for OEMs and governments in a very competitive market.  \n During the quarter, we expanded our global battery test footprint with a new large Gigafactory customer in Europe. We're also pleased with the addition of ESI to our automotive and simulation software solutions portfolio. The business is tracking well to both top line and profit expectations. This quarter, ESI expanded its multi-decade collaboration with Volkswagen Group, establishing a joint material testing and intelligent simulation lab in Asia. This collaboration will advance automotive simulation technology and drive new to industry standard safety and efficiency forward in the region.  \n In general electronics markets, customer spending remains constrained, particularly in manufacturing, China and the distribution channel, we do continue to see growth in digital health and advanced research supported by government funding in Asia and the U.S., such as the CHIPS Act. This quarter, we expanded our partnership with EMVision in Australia to enable innovation in novel point-of-care medical imaging technology and analysis.  \n As a key element of our solution strategy, software and services orders and revenue growth continued to outpace overall Keysight. At approximately 39% of total revenue, software and services enhance the differentiation of our solutions and are more resilient in current market conditions. Within the chip domain, next-generation performance demands are driving an exponential increase in system level design requirements and complexity. Keysight simulation and emulation software capabilities enable our customers to address these challenges and accelerate time to market for their advanced systems and chips. We recently introduced Quantum Pro, an integrated EDA solution for Cubic design and the development of quantum computers.  \n In addition, we launched a new solution for die-to-die interconnect simulation, which is a key step in verifying performance of heterogeneous and 3D integrated circuit designs commonly known as chiplets. Looking ahead, the pace of technology innovation and digitization is accelerating and proliferating across multiple industries and use cases. Keysight is investing today both organically and inorganically to capitalize on these future technology waves and inflections.  \n In addition to steady organic investment in R&D, we are expanding our solutions portfolio and our served addressable markets through M&A. This quarter, we announced our intent to acquire Spartan Communications, a highly complementary business in network analytics. We also completed the acquisition of Riscure in the quarter, expanding our automated security assessment capabilities and solutions for semiconductors, embedded systems and connected devices.  \n In closing, I would like to thank our employees once again for consistently delivering value to our customers and shareholders. The Keysight team's high performance and winning culture is key to our success and a competitive differentiator. While it's difficult to call the timing of the recovery, we're encouraged by pockets of growth that are emerging, the relative stability of investment levels and the strength of our customer collaborations Consistent with the Keysight leadership model, we remain disciplined and continue to streamline operations to ensure strong financial performance in these dynamic market conditions.  \n As we look beyond the current period of normalization, the long-term secular growth trends driving our business are intact. Taken together, our broad portfolio of differentiated solutions, strong customer relationships, technology leadership and durable financial model positions us well into a market recovery. With that, I'll turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook. Thank you, Rob. I think this quarter for the first time in 6 quarters, our commercial communications orders grew, and as a result of the inflection that we're seeing in the wireline business associated with AI. And it's still very early days as the world continues to look at all of the applications that could be launched leveraging AI at scale. And I would say it's still very early days even for Keysight's business. So what we're seeing is probably a first inflection, I would say.\n The big headline that we've seen in the last couple of quarters and that accelerated this quarter was the push from customers to lead in the hardware infrastructure space and how critical it's performance is for cost, for energy and in general for the user experience in the AI application. For Keysight, in our Wireline business, having the breadth of the portfolio that caters to networking, computing, storage, interconnects -- and we're able to make contributions that are broad, but we're just getting started is the way I would frame it up -- the heterogeneous environment there is helping us play a critical role, and we're also engaged in a number of these standards bodies. So we saw strong double-digit growth in the business for the Wireline business this quarter, and also sequentially a strong uptick in Q2. Yes. Thank you. I think what we have said is the market environment remains unchanged. And as we said in the previous call, we're not -- our base case does not assume any significant market recovery, right? So barring that is just a seasonal uptick in Q4 as Neil just referenced coming from our aerospace defense business. But we are continuing to feel that the demand environment is stabilizing. I would say, as I pointed out earlier, Wireline inflections and demand remains strong. I'd say the aerospace defense is stable. And our ISG business, which had -- which had seen 4 quarters, including the current quarter of declines stemming from normalization and manufacturing is also starting to show some seasonal -- or starting to show some sequential growth, I should say, this quarter, all of which we view as sense of stability in the business. And then last point of you question was on interconnect -- last part of your question, I didn't want to miss it. It was our interconnect technologies. And as you think about data center coming from today's node sizes of $300,000 or $250,000 to $1 million and beyond. At some point, I think interconnect has become very important. The nature of those interconnects, the high performance requirement associated with them are critical, and therefore, interoperability testing needs are key and key sites, differentiated technologies across our core product line is playing a critical role already, and we'll continue to play a critical role moving forward to help our customers. Thank you, Meta. Again, we're quite pleased with the acquisition. The performance in the first half has exceeded our initial plans, so which is good. Again, I view this simulation and emulation as a long-term strategic priority for the company and ESI was clearly -- gave us some differentiated capability to go pursue it. The culture fit 1, 2 quarters in is re-traded because our teams are working seamlessly, the collaborative culture, the focus on technology, all of those things are headed in the right direction. .\n And from a revenue acceleration perspective, that's the focus for the team, right? It's -- we're really prioritizing taking ESI's core products into aerospace defense in the U.S. and increasing our exposure with Asian auto manufacturers. I'll let Mark make some comments on how the sales team is doing on that front. But overall, quite pleased with the acquisition. Thank you. As far as being a company we've known for some time, we used to have a partnership with them. And I think the rationale headlines are: first, it's a SAM expansion opportunity. You think about the portfolio aspirant with focus on service assurance, positioning really a good fit to that network analytics expansion opportunity I laid out at the Investor Day. And then when I think about the financial aspect of this deal, I think it creates value for customers and more scale and synergies inside the Keysight environment, but equally for our shareholders, it's a good deal from a point of view of -- it meets our hurdles, M&A hurdles internally and it's accretive to gross and operating margins post integration. \n So we feel really good about the opportunity. We're continuing to work through the regulatory process right now. Yes. Thank you, David. I think, look, we look at it 1 quarter at a time. And so far, our focus has been on execution in our discussion with customers, I would say that's the most relevant 1 as many customers have commented that they are going through the bottom. -- has their own economics improve. They've come back and they have doubled down on the programs and projects that we've been in discussions with. So that inflecting nature that correlation to their business is perhaps the most important 1 that we look at. \n Big picture, when we start to look at macro factors, I would say, SIA, you look at even smartphone sales, PC sales, other things, you start to see some improvement along with the PMI indices that are growing. So while not calling for timing or magnitude of recovery at this point, we remain focused on execution. The 1 tactical area that we -- the data that we have in-house is on our pipeline, and I'll have Mark make a comment on the pipeline. Yes. I think I would say the answer is twofold, right? One is on the order line, we think the demand environment improves a bit as we go into the second half, especially Q4, driven by some of the semiconductor spend that we're expecting to land in Q4, but again, revenue would be offset because some of the business that we book in the EISG does have a bigger percentage of long-dated sort of backlog items. So it is twofold. We expect that Neil can give us -- we would expect that revenue would be -- would face some headwinds in the second half even as orders improve. . Well, first of all, from a timing perspective, it's very early days for the AI opportunity primarily because there are obviously logical areas where we engage with customers, but we have several active collaborations underway around silicon, 1 on real-time training of clusters, interconnects, testing methodologies for benchmarking AI, protocol aspects of the new standard [EUEC] transceiver manufacturing interoperability. So while we are in booking some business today, and we have some several active collaborations underway which are quite promising, and the ecosystem of customers that we serve will expand over time. \n Very hard to compare and contrast with 5G or wireless side. But I think -- the key for the commercial comps business has always been to increase our emphasis in early R&D because we know that it makes us much more strategic and critical to customers. Second is to maintain diversity in application sets. So we have both equal focus on wireless and wireline that give us ways to drive growth by market. And then we feel really good about our competitive position on our portfolio strength and it's only going to grow as we -- as the industry adopts AI at scale. Yes. Thank you, Mehdi. So I know you asked several questions in one, but let's make sure I hit all of them. But I'll start by saying, look, we feel really good about our long-term growth expectations for the business. And as we laid out the 3-pronged growth strategy at Investor Day, we see these technology trends are accelerating. We see transforming industries increasing our ecosystem of customers we can serve, and we see market dynamics with governments around the world investing for organic IP. So none of those have fundamentally changed, and we feel like we're in a good position. And if you look at our strategy through this downturn is to continue to invest in R&D in a prudent way, but really focus those investments on where our customers need the most help, especially in the R&D labs of our customers making us more strategic and the cost actions that we've taken in navigating this downturn has been largely on the SG&A line. So we feel good about the opportunity that we see ahead. .\n As far as the -- our ability to deliver to those results, clearly, while we feel good, it is possible that the time line pushes out a bit given the decline that we've had in '24. And so a lot depends on the timing of the recovery. But if history is any measure, every time we've had strong pullbacks, we've had stronger uptrend as well in terms of orders. So we continue to watch that strategically. Software and services has been an area of focus for us. Software and Services now is roughly 40% of the total company, which is a good trend, and we want to keep driving that higher -- and as I've reiterated before, we look at several deals. We've looked at over 350, 400 deals in the company, and we've only done about 20. So we're very selective in our strategy. It's not about revenue. We look strategically at the areas where we feel like we want to make a bigger contribution and where we can bring value to those assets when they come inside Keysight. So there is -- from that point of view, there's really no change. We're an organic first company. We believe in investing with our customers to create long-term value."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Keysight Technologies Fiscal First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Joel, and I'll be your lead operator today. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded today, Tuesday, February 20, 2024 at 1:30 PM Pacific Time. I would now like to hand the call over to Jason Kary, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Kary.\nJason Kary: Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to Keysight's first quarter earnings conference call for fiscal year 2024. Joining me are Keysight's President and CEO, Satish Dhanasekaran; and our CFO, Neil Dougherty. In the Q&A session, we'll be joined by Chief Customer Officer, Mark Wallace. The press release and information to supplement today's discussion are on our website at investor.keysight.com under the Financial Information and Quarterly Reports. Today's comments will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. We will also make reference to core growth, which excludes the impact of currency movements and acquisitions or divestitures completed within the last 12 months. The most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations are on our website, and all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. We will make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company on today's call. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. We assume no obligation to update them and encourage you to review our recent SEC filings for a more complete view of these risks and other factors. Lastly, management is scheduled to participate in upcoming investor conferences, hosted by Susquehanna and Morgan Stanley. And now, I will turn the call over to Satish.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. My comments will focus on three key headlines: First, Keysight delivered revenue of $1.3 billion and earnings per share of $1.63, both of which exceeded the high-end of our guidance. Given the current market conditions, these results reflect the Keysight team's strong execution and resilience of our financial model. Second, orders were $1.2 billion as the demand environment remains constrained. As certain markets continue to normalize from post-pandemic spending levels, our aerospace, defense and government, and network and data center businesses grew, highlighting the benefit of our diverse end-market exposure. Customer engagement and collaborations on next-generation themes remained strong. The adoption of new use cases such as AI is driving new activity and investment across the ecosystem. However, we're not factoring in a strong recovery this fiscal year. Our base-case scenario is for a modest first-half to second-half improvement in orders and revenue. Third, Keysight continues to be well-positioned for outperformance into a market recovery. We are investing to enhance our market leadership and expand our broad portfolio of leading solutions. We are also pleased to have completed the acquisition of ESI ahead of schedule and extend a warm welcome to the team. Along with our existing EDA business, the addition of ESI further expands our software solutions for simulation and emulation, a market with favorable growth attributes as the virtualization of design and prototyping increases. Now, let's begin with a brief overview of Keysight's first quarter performance. Market conditions were largely unchanged from the prior quarter. Across our end markets, investment in R&D remained steady, while manufacturing and overall economic activity in Asia continued to moderate. First quarter orders were $1.2 billion, revenue $1.3 billion, and earnings per share of $1.63 were above our guidance, and we generated strong cash flow. Gross margins across the business was strong, and including ESI, we achieved a record 67%, demonstrating the differentiation of our solutions. Operating margin was 28%, reflecting expense discipline and cost actions that we have taken over the past quarter and last year. Turning to our business segments. Communications Solutions Group revenue declined relative to a strong compare last year, which was driven by robust backlog conversion. Quarter one gross margin was a record 68%, reflecting a greater mix of software and higher-value solutions. Orders were in line with expectations with strength in aerospace, defense and government, and the wireline business, while wireless continues to normalize. Aerospace, defense and government revenue declined while orders grew year-over-year. Spending levels remain elevated, as governments around the world prioritize investments in defense modernization, space and satellite applications. We are scaling our threat emulation offerings to a broader set of customers for electromagnetic spectrum operation applications in the US and Europe, resulting in key wins at large primes. Our space and satellite solutions drove businesses this quarter for new space modules and low Earth orbit applications. Leveraging our protocol and digital twin capabilities, we've partnered with Lockheed Martin and a broad set of technology leaders to successfully demonstrate a secure 5G and data link network that integrates land, air and space operations. In commercial communications, customer spending remains cautious. While we're not seeing a market recovery yet, industry inventories are slowly returning to normalized levels. For example, smartphone sales in the fourth quarter of 2023 grew meaningfully for the first time since mid-2021. In our wireless business, customer engagements remain high, with ongoing R&D activity in advanced technologies. This results in software and service upgrades that contributed to higher gross margins in the quarter. 5G standards continue to progress and are driving a wide range of new use cases and features for ongoing network deployment. New band combinations are expected to be added to the 3GPP standard this year, driving certification needs. This quarter, we hosted Global Certification Forum that brought together industry leaders across a broad array of sectors to collaborate on certification requirements for network and device interoperability and performance. Next week at Mobile World Congress, we will be demonstrating over a dozen solutions for 5G, Open RAN, satellite connectivity, AI and early 6G capabilities, many of which will be showcased in partnership with industry-leading customers. Moving to our wireline business, we saw order growth for our data center solutions. Orders for 400 gig and 800 gig solutions, both in R&D and manufacturing, grew double-digits. We also achieved a key milestone in partnership with Marvell by enabling test and verification of their new ultra-high-speed networking chip designed for next-generation AI-driven cloud applications. The adoption of AI is clearly lifting activity across the entire data center ecosystem. As the industry deploys AI infrastructure at scale, we expect the demand for high-speed networking and computing capabilities to grow. Turning to the Electronic Industrial Solutions Group, revenue was down, reflecting ongoing normalization from outsized demand in the prior year. Customer spending remains cautious as market conditions, particularly in manufacturing, and regionally in China were weaker. Underneath the macro headlines, we see pockets of growth where customers are leaning in and investing to address new use cases and emerging technologies across multiple end markets. In semiconductor, the market environment is mixed. Despite the improved industry outlook for overall fab investments, foundry customers continued to push out large projects due to delays in construction and production timelines. At the same time, we saw strong demand for Keysight's proprietary interferometer system, driven by industry progression in EUV technology. Next-generation performance requirements for new AI-driven data center and ADAS use cases are also driving investments. And we saw some improvement this quarter in memory-related demand as well as mature process capacity in China. In automotive, the funnel of EV opportunities continues to be strong. Competition amongst OEMs, upcoming regulatory requirements and support from government subsidies are incentivizing investments in R&D for new battery technology and charging infrastructure. During the quarter, we secured a key win that marks the expansion of our European battery test footprint into France. As we have noted before, EV funnel is healthy, but the timing and the size of these system-level and longer-dated engagements are expected to vary from quarter to quarter. In general electronics, market conditions were unchanged from last quarter. Ongoing capacity normalization and cautious spending continued to weigh on the consumer electronics and manufacturing portions of the market. We saw steady demand for our solutions in digital health, industrial automation and advanced research. This quarter, we secured key wins in digital health applications for medical imaging and scanning as well as test automation. Consistent with our software-centric solutions strategy, the value that our customers derive from software and service offerings is enabling business resilience in the current market conditions. Software and services orders and revenue continued to outperform the broader business this quarter and were greater than 35% of total Keysight even excluding ESI. ESI further enhances our design engineering software portfolio and expands our addressable market in automotive, avionics, smart manufacturing, and human workflows. We were pleased to complete the acquisition ahead of schedule, and ESI's results were also ahead of expectations for the quarter. In summary, our market leadership and the strength of our solutions portfolio gives us confidence in our ability to capitalize on the multiple waves of technology innovations and long-term secular growth trends of our markets. Our team's relentless customer focus and sustained customer collaborations also position us well for long-term value creation. In addition, the strength of our financial model continues to generate healthy margins and cash flow. With that, I will turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook.\nNeil Dougherty: Thank you, Satish, and hello, everyone. First quarter revenue of $1.259 billion was just above the high end of our guidance range and down 9%, or 14% on a core basis. Orders of $1.220 billion declined 6%, or 12% on a core basis. We ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in backlog. Looking at our operational results for Q1, we reported record gross margin of 67%, an increase of 200 basis points year-over-year. Excluding ESI, gross margin was a near-record 66% on lower revenue, supported by a solid mix of software and higher-value solutions. In addition, software was 22% of revenue, while recurring revenue from both software and services grew 10%. Operating expenses of $491 million were flat year-over-year even with the addition of ESI, demonstrating the flexibility of our cost structure and the cost actions that we have taken. Q1 operating margin was 28%, or 27% excluding ESI. These results demonstrate the financial flexibility and resilience of our business. We are outperforming the financial model that we put in place over a decade ago, which calls for only a 300 basis point to 400 basis point year-over-year decline in operating margin when revenue declines 10%. Turning to earnings. We achieved $286 million of net income and delivered earnings of $1.63 per share, of which ESI contributed $0.09. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 176 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated revenue of $839 million, down 11%, or 12% on a core basis. Commercial communications revenue of $544 million declined 14%, while aerospace, defense and government revenue of $295 million was down 5%. Altogether, CSG delivered a record gross margin of 68%, and operating margin of 27%. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated revenue of $420 million, down 5% or 19% on a core basis. EISG reported gross margin of 65%, and operating margin of 31%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the first quarter with $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, which reflects the purchase of ESI within the quarter, generating cash flow from operations of $328 million and free cash flow of $281 million. Share repurchases this quarter totaled 625,000 shares at an average price per share of approximately $149 for a total consideration of $93 million. Now, turning to our outlook. Given Q1 core orders of $1.14 billion and the typical sequential decline in ESI orders and revenue from Q1 to Q2, we expect second quarter revenue to be in the range of $1.190 billion to $1.210 billion, and Q2 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.34 to $1.40 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 175 million shares. This guidance includes approximately $25 million in ESI revenue and a few cents of earnings dilution from ESI. As we look to the second half of the year and our six-month order funnel, we aren't assuming a strong revenue recovery in Keysight's fiscal second half, which ends in October. Our base-case scenario is that revenue is relatively flat from Q2 to Q3 and sequentially up mid-single-digits Q3 to Q4, in line with typical historical seasonality. That said, we do expect second-half orders to exceed first-half orders, which will be supportive of revenue growth in 2025. In closing, Keysight's flexible cost structure and discipline, track record of execution and diverse end markets, give us confidence in our ability to outperform even in the current market conditions, while at the same time, investing to capitalize on the best growth opportunities as markets recover. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.\nJason Kary: Thanks, Neil. Joel, could you please give the instructions for the Q&A?\nOperator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe if I can start with the first one, just on the sort of what you're implying in terms of the recovery for the back half. I mean, just looking at the 2Q guide, to me, it implies that the organically the business is -- or the core business is down a bit and there is some ESI revenue sequentially declining as well. But if the core business is down sequentially, what's driving the expectation for a recovery starting in 3Q and 4Q? I know you said you're not baking in a recovery in relation to the macros, so is there something more customer-specific or end-market-specific that you're seeing that's driving that expectation? Then, I have a quick follow-up. Thank you.\nNeil Dougherty: Yeah. Hi, Samik. I would just say that, as we stated in our prepared remarks, right now, we are -- our base case does not include a meaningful second-half recovery. We're really more looking at seasonal changes as you move throughout the fiscal year, so flattish Q2 to Q3, and then a typical seasonal uptick into Q4, which is typically our stronger quarter of the year. In aggregate, we do expect orders and revenue in the second half to be modestly above the first half, but we're not baking in a recovery at this point.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. I guess -- sorry, Satish, just to clarify, I was more looking at what's the driver there? I mean, when you call it seasonal, it's been below seasonal for a bit. So, is it something more specific to the end markets? And I'll ask my follow-up at same time, if you don't mind.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Sure.\nSamik Chatterjee: If you can just shed a bit more light on the order trends in relation to EISG? I know you said, largely unchanged spending, but what are you seeing in the different verticals when it comes to autos versus broader industrial because we've seen a lot of weaker macro data points on that front? Thank you.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yeah. Thank you, Samik. I would say, at the highest level, the customer engagements that we have are remaining strong. And while there are signs of optimism from customers as we enter the new calendar year, we have not yet seen a progression through our pipeline. And as we said in our -- in my prepared remarks, the market conditions remain largely unchanged from a quarter ago. The aerospace, defense strength that we saw last year continues on. And what we have seen incrementally is the wireline business has actually grown for the first time this quarter, and that was a function of some of the AI-related end-market inflections that are occurring. If I take a regional cut at this, I would say, our largest region, Americas, grew for the first time in four quarters, and this is driven by again the strength in aerospace, defense and the wireline business. But Asia continues to remain weak, especially which is impacting the EISG business and some of the wireless business in that region as it continues to normalize from the peak spending levels. Again to put your question in perspective, CSG entered that normalization phase early and EISG was offset by a few quarters. And so that's what's currently playing out. So, given this backdrop, we think it's prudent to think of a base-case assumption where orders and revenue would be up modestly first half to second half. But should there be a broad and stronger recovery sooner, and there may be some signs out there around SIA index where things are picking up, some of the inventory digestion that's happening, capacity utilization, fabs, but should that occur, we will be in a good position to capitalize on that and recover quicker.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nMark Delaney: Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Satish, you mentioned I believe double-digit growth in orders to support data center builds for products like high-speed wireline, which you attributed to AI. Can you give us a better sense of how much of either revenue or orders may be directly or indirectly benefiting from AI at this stage, and how you see that progressing?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yeah, that's a really good question. It's still an emerging opportunity for us, but what is significant this quarter is, we started to see the wireline core parts of our business inflect. And if you recall in the past earnings calls, I've talked about the traffic patterns caused by generative AI really impacting the whole network architecture, compute to networking and switching and silicon, and therefore, we knew that demand was coming up. And so, what we noticed this quarter is our wireline business started to inflect, driven by 400-gig and 800-gig transceiver business in manufacturing as that starts to scale, increased focus on terabit research, we announced a collaboration with Marvell in advanced technologies as well there. So that's the business of today. But as we start to think about the broader landscape here, I would say the memory technologies with HBM is starting to gain interest in our customers, different processor architectures, increased silicon activity enabled by AI. And then, for us, it's very exciting because there is a lot of tools that we can deploy our IP because we have the total stack to help engineers train the AI ML models better. And so, you will see, we announced a collaboration with NVIDIA on this front as well. And there's new interface standards. And you know our business is driven by standardization process. So, new interface standards are good for our CXL PCIe Gen-7 and the Ultra Ethernet Consortium are playing into it. Silicon photonics in quantum, while they are sort of enabling technologies, are other areas where we've had investment, where we're now able to address new opportunities. Now a lot of that is not yet baked into our forecast, but we're continuing to action these things through the investments we're making.\nMark Delaney: Yeah. That's a helpful color. My second question was on margins. The company has a target for its EBIT margin to reach 31% to 32% by fiscal '26. Maybe you can help us better understand what kind of revenue would be needed for the company to reach that kind of margin. And I think you have a 5% to 7% revenue CAGR target. I mean, should we be thinking about a couple of years of at least the high-end, if not, higher revenue relative to that targeted order to reach your margin objective? Thanks.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Thank you. It might be a little too premature to talk about the outer years, but here's how we're thinking about it. We've had -- obviously, this is the second year we're entering in where orders are declining. And every time that's happened, we would expect a bounce back in the outer years to be stronger. So that's still to be proven out. And you know the sort of earnings leverage that we get when we are able to grow our business above our models. So, profitability, I'm pretty encouraged by the strong gross margins we're maintaining even on declining top-line right now, that's a function of the software and services content, and just the discipline which we run our business. And so, I feel like getting our business back to growth is the principal driver. And given all the trends that we see across wireless, wireline, the long-term trends we see in next-gen silicon and aerospace, defense and in semi, we believe that we can get back to this growth model that we put out at Investor Day.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. And apologies for the background noise. Maybe just a couple of questions for me. Maybe first, and just in terms of -- clearly, you guys were a little bit more cautious entering into the year. You had guided at the full year. I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of versus the environment as you saw 90 days ago, how have your expectations changed? And maybe just on the second question, just in terms of ESI and the earlier closure that we had, just any changes that you can make or able to make to that business kind of earlier than you expected? Thanks.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yeah. I think as far as the ESI question goes, I think we're quite positive, incrementally positive about the opportunities that we have to grow our -- grow the ESI business in Keysight's environment. We've long studied the system simulation/emulation marketplace. And so, having all of the capabilities is definitely a huge advantage. And for us, bringing an asset that was sort of locked-in in an European environment and exposing it with our go-to-market channel and taking that into our customer base remains an opportunity to drive growth above what they've been able to do. But incrementally I'm pretty bullish about the technology and the depth of simulation capabilities they bring. They also have a hybrid AI capability that is pretty unique and differentiated that we'll look to fully leverage across the company as we go, and we're also positive about the strong start in the first quarter for ESI. And I'll just hand it off to Mark to make some comments on the pipeline that he sees and how he sees that progressing.\nMark Wallace: Yeah. Thanks, Satish. Well, Meta, the pipeline that we see today really supports our base scenario that second-half orders and revenue will be modestly higher than the first half, and this is seen through some improvement in our six-month funnel that Neil mentioned in his prepared statements and we've called out in various other earnings calls as well. The improvement comes in the form of some funnel intake up modestly indicating that we have some green shoots and pockets of demand that are showing up. And the other area is in the funnel velocity, or in other words, how long it takes for opportunities to move through the funnel as some customers are beginning to move a bit more quickly. So, 90 days later, those are the big changes. The short-term funnel is about the same at the beginning of Q1, which still remains constrained, but we are seeing some positive pipeline dynamics as we look out six months.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks so much.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS. You may proceed.\nChris Snyder: Thank you. I guess it sounds like from much of the demand end-market commentary that things are very similar in a demand sense from where they were three months ago. But I guess my question is, is there any place in the business where you see demand continuing to deteriorate on the leading edge? Because orders were down, it seems like on an organic basis, about mid-teens versus Q4, which is a bit sharper than seasonality, and the book-to-bill did step back below 1 after being above 1 last quarter. So, are there any places in the business where things are getting worse? Thank you.\nNeil Dougherty: Yeah. I mean I think areas of relative weakness, Satish talked about Asia and China specifically continues to be challenging. I think manufacturing continues to be challenging. And I think we see our wireless customers that are still working through some other issues. On the positive side, wireline, driven by AI is clearly a strength point. Mark, do you want to add?\nMark Wallace: Yeah. I would just add to that, we have said that the weakness is in China for EISG businesses. As we said, if you look at China, we saw customer engagements continue. I was there in December. Our historic exposure to China has been high-teens of revenue. It was a little lower than that in Q1, and it was because of the continued headwinds incrementally worse in semi and manufacturing. But we did see sequential order growth from Q1 to Q -- from Q4 to Q1 driven by this demand that we talked about earlier with growth in 400 gig and 800 gig, R&D for the data center upgrades, some demand for 5G private networks. And as a global company, we're also exposed to some of the offshoring, that has been going on and continues as some of the multinational companies move offshore. And the last thing I'll say is, thinking back over the last several quarters, we vastly de-risked China from a trade perspective. It was it was meaningless in Q1, additions to the RPL have had a [variable] (ph) impact. We continue to monitor the situation very closely. So that's where we've seen some of the headwinds, but even there I've seen some positive indicators in China as well.\nChris Snyder: Thank you. Appreciate that. And then, for my follow-up, I wanted to ask around backlog. Neil, I think you said $2.3 billion again, which is more than six months of coverage at this quarterly revenue run rate. But you guys are kind of saying that you don't expect revenue to get better into the back half of the year. So, on this excess backlog, when does the company think it could start coming through in revenue? And is it because these big chip customers are pushing out their CapEx plans, or is it just because of the company has moved more towards a solutions-based model? Any help with that would be great. Thank you.\nNeil Dougherty: Yeah. So, you're correct. The number is $2.3 billion. And I would start by saying that we now stated a couple of quarters ago that we believe we've worked through the excess backlog. And so -- and we did that last year when revenue outpaced orders by the tune of $275 million or something like that was when we worked through that excess backlog. I think as we look currently, we're managing a couple of things. Obviously, by design, our recurring revenue businesses, software and services are holding up. You see that in an increasing deferred revenue balance. But in addition to this, we're also managing this dynamic between where our -- we've seen a pretty significant increase in these longer-dated orders, which if you remember correctly, historically been about 2% of our incoming order rate and we really didn't talk about it as a result of that. Last year, they were more like 8% of the incoming order rate. They were 8% again here in Q1. And as Mark talked about, we have a robust funnel of longer-dated opportunities as we look out over the course of the next six months. And so, that's the dynamic that we're starting to see. We are starting to see those longer-dated orders show up in revenue. We saw that beginning in Q1. And by Q4, we expect revenue from those longer-dated programs to be about 8% of that Q4 revenue.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Your line is open.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hey, good afternoon, guys.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Hi, Adam.\nAdam Thalhimer: I think to get to the -- a question on operating margins. I think to get to the midpoint of guidance, they're down 600 basis points, 700 basis points year-over-year. And my question is, is that what you would expect in your model? Or is there something specifically impacting margins in Q2?\nNeil Dougherty: No. I think that's basically -- we are performing in line with the model, right? So, if you take a look at what's happening, obviously, you see the significant sequential decline in ESI, which is as expected. But if you adjust for that, you're seeing a mid-teens kind of decline in the core business, right, from a revenue perspective. And we've talked about the downside model that contemplates 300 basis points to 400 basis points of operating margin decline when revenues are down 10%. Obviously, we're down significantly more than that, but we're continuing to perform basically in line with that model. We've taken significant actions. Our cost actions started last year and enabled us to deliver record operating margins on flat revenue in an inflationary environment. And then, this quarter, as it started to begin to appear that the recovery was pushing out, we've taken incremental actions that are going to benefit us. We now expect that total OpEx for the company will be down low-single digits on a year-over-year basis prior to the addition of ESI. And all of that reduction is going to show up in the SG&A line items as we like to strike a balance between investment and financial performance. We're going to maintain our investments in R&D. We would expect R&D to be flat. But again, total OpEx down about 3%, driven by actions we've taken to control SG&A.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. And then just a quick one on -- how is auto demand holding up in this environment, EV/AV charging?\nMark Wallace: Yeah, Adam, in the quarter, we saw continued R&D spend for battery and charging infrastructure. We expect that to continue. Manufacturing spend, supply chain spend was down. You've seen unit volumes drop for both conventional and EV demand. So that's where we see that. But e-mobility, which is EV and autonomous, as Neil mentioned, as I mentioned, the funnel remains strong, very robust, as we look at Q2 into FY '24. A lot of this is a long-dated program spend around battery test charging infrastructure. Some of these products -- programs are fluid. So many of them are based on some government subsidies that you may have read have been delayed in Europe and so forth. But we're tied into all of those. And as we look forward, this space continues to be one that's going to be driving growth for us for a long time.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: And also, some of the capabilities that we have developed around electrification are finding new applications in aerospace and defense and other end-markets that are also going to be impacted by the similar trends. And so, we're quite pleased by the leverage and synergies we'll see as we move forward.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is open.\nTim Long: Thank you. I wanted to ask one on the wireless business. Can you just kind of run through some of the technologies and give us a sense how they might be influencing the business? Just curious, you mentioned the 5GPP standards. What's on the come there? Anything new with millimeter wave, or 6G, or O-RAN? If you could just kind of give us a little state of the union on those? And then, I have a follow-up.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yeah, we'll do. Tim, I think at the highest level, what we've seen so far is that Release 15 and 16 deployments that have occurred largely in the United States and in China and now in India. So, we expected, and we've talked about this to the industry capital, would peak some point in '22-'23. So roughly we got that timing right. But if you think about the business model that we established for commercial comms and for our wireless business, it was always about more vector to service the R&D customers. So, while even in this environment, the volumes are down especially the manufacturing production-related volumes with the RAN markets down. So, we're starting to see that effect and the businesses normalizing. But what we're continuing to see is customers engage with us in buying upgrades for their release library. So going from 15, 16 to 17 as an example, which is much more evolutionary nature. But as we think about the future now, the roadmap is very clear. It's sort of a roadmap for the next five years where the industry is working on Release 18, Release 19 followed by 20, which would include some early study items on 6G as an example. But some of the same ideas that we had for growth, which are built around vertical industry expansions with AI ML, new device form factors such as the Vision Pro that's just launched that's capturing a lot of imagination on what augmented reality can mean in the future. And just sort of the integration I should say of satellite communications and terrestrial networks is opening up new threads of innovation and exposing us to more customers that want our capability. So all-in-all, in balance, I look at the capabilities we have, our market leadership position that we've established in 5G, and I feel confident that post-normalization of this demand that we can return the business to growth even prior to 6G. But that's yet to play out, but that's our best thinking at this point.\nTim Long: Okay, great. And then I just wanted to follow up on the optical side. It sounds like 400 gig, 800 gig are pretty strong. Could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing on R&D for the cycle beyond that? And also, curious about what's going on the software side Ixia and some of the other software businesses related to optical wireline. Thank you.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yeah. I think, what we're seeing is obviously, the first instantiation with every technology like this, where 100 gig times 400 gig times eight sort of topologies are currently being -- are being deployed. And so, we're obviously, engaged with that and we're starting to benefit from that. But the roadmap is clear, right, then it's going to get to 200 times four, because the scaling continues and leading to even higher-speed research in 1.6 terabits and beyond. So that's on the wireline side. The Ixia business or what was Ixia business, we -- it's integrated into our wireline business and it's been remarkably stable for us in the commercial communications market because of the higher services and software content associated with that business. And it's also a business that doesn't really trend up that significantly during upcycles. So, it's been a very steady business for us. And one we're -- now we're able to take out some of the traffic generation capabilities and adapt it to go address some of the emerging AI use cases. So, we're quite pleased by the assets we have in the company and by our ability to go and solve customers' emerging challenges even beyond the traditional segments we serve.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nAaron Rakers: Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions. I have two as well. Neil, I wanted to go back to your prior comments on kind of backlog. I know last quarter -- last couple of quarters, you've talked about these longer-dated backlog or order dynamics, and I think even last quarter you quantified it at like $400 million. Can you give us an update how much of your backlog today is kind of these longer-dated deals? And could we consider them as kind of large lumpy deals that possibly rev rec wise show up late this year into more so '25? Or how do we just think about that?\nNeil Dougherty: Yeah. From a backlog perspective, we're in the $400 million to $500 million range of our backlog as these long-dated deals. You are correct that they tend to be larger lumpier deals in aerospace, defense, auto, and even in the semi space. And as I said on the previous question about this, we've actually started to see them now, because we started to see the ramp in a little bit in Q1 of last year, but then really in earnest in Q2 of last year on the order line, and some of those things are starting to flow through to revenue now. Now, we're not at 8% yet from a revenue perspective. We expect to be there by the end of the year. But just as you suggested, it is lumpy, right? So, you could end up in a situation where there is relatively lower either order or revenue activity from these types of transactions and some other quarter you might have double activity just given the nature of the business.\nAaron Rakers: Yeah, that's helpful, Neil. And then, as a second question, I wanted to go back to the AI networking discussion. Clearly, a lot of focus here, but a lot of focus on the wireline side is this 400-gig, 800-gig transition towards Ethernet versus InfiniBand. I'm curious to Keysight's positioning. Is there a disproportionate position around Ethernet and the deployment cycle of back-end AI networks based on Ethernet versus InfiniBand? Or is it maybe not such that we should delineate between the two for the company?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yeah. I think for us, we don't try to pick winners. In some ways, innovation is best served when you have multiple competing technologies approach the same challenge. But fundamentally, data is growing. The pattern of data through these networks are altering and changing, which requires the communication systems to adapt. And I think all the way from memory to network, NIC cards, to compute architectures are getting more heterogeneous if you will. So, more standards. I talked about CXL, the Ultra Ethernet Consortium, PCIe Gen-7, et cetera. So, all of that really creates a real good bed of technologies for us to service through our platforms. And often, it's the same underlying platform -- I missed out USB 4.0, but often it's the same sort of underlying platforms that we have from all the way from oscilloscopes, to our BERTs, to our network traffic emulators from our Ixia acquisition. So, we tend to go approach these things and then add in more software capabilities as we move forward. We're actually quite pleased with the performance and the resilience of our software business even through these times. And software and services represents roughly now 40% of the total order/revenue in the most recent quarter, and we'll continue to keep growing the value of the company. Our ARR was also up double digits this quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.\nMatt Niknam: Hey, guys, thanks for taking the questions. Just maybe unpacking the guide for fiscal 2Q, are you anticipating modest sequential pressure across the board? Or are there any pockets in the business where you may be anticipating or seeing some level of sequential improvements in the fiscal second quarter? And then maybe just secondly, in terms of -- we talked a lot about wireline. I'm just wondering on the wireless side, expectations for that business this year, simply given maybe some green shoots we're reading about, and also the fact that seem to be a business that maybe started seeing the downturn a little bit sooner. So, I'm just wondering if there's any additional color you can share in terms of expectations for the year. Thanks.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yeah. I'll take the second part, then I'll have Mark sort of walk through his thinking on the pipeline, which really no impact -- I mean, which really flow into our guide, if you will. On the wireless side, I think we're continuing to expect stability and moderation as it comes off of strong peak demand years in '21 and '22. So that normalization phase continues to play out over the next couple of quarters, and that's sort of our base case thinking on wireless. All of the R&D activity that I described continues on, but we're still waiting for any inflection in component spend which we're not seeing at this point. So that's sort of our expectations on wireless. And I'll just have Mark make some comments on the pipeline.\nMark Wallace: Yeah. And Matt, I think it's more of the same what we've been speaking about in terms of the markets that are driving growth. I expect aerospace, defense to continue to be an area of driving growth for us, not only in the US but in Europe and other countries that are faced with the geopolitical situation that exists today. We are operating under continuing resolution in the US, which we're expecting that budget to be signed this quarter, which is favorable for us in terms of the RDT and E-Line items that are getting bipartisan support to progress through this election year. So that seems to be an area for us. And then, the defense modernization, as we've already touched around, there is multiple areas of innovation that involve long-term, short-term programs with the prime contractors, again around MSO space crossing over into commercial sector. So there's a lot of vectors within what we would traditionally call aerospace and defense. Wireline as we just spent a lot of time talking about continues to provide opportunities for us to grow. And then I think as we've mentioned, the automotive funnel, which is quite robust, has programs that are crossing into the next several three quarters and we are actively engaged with all of those. So, I expect that to be a driver of growth for us as well. And we'll watch it and take it a quarter at a time with the headwinds that we're currently experiencing on manufacturing and on semiconductors. But as we mentioned, we saw some growth around memory. That's an early indicator that typically goes first. We expect that to continue to be an area of strength. And of course, we're watching very closely the status of these additional fabs that are in the process of being built out in various places around the world.\nMatt Niknam: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna. You may proceed.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. First one is for Neil. Just want to better understand the organic change in your revenue. Assuming $60 million from ESI in the January quarter and then about $25 million in the April quarter, the decline in organic revenue on a sequential basis is only 2%. Is that correct?\nNeil Dougherty: It was -- ESI was $67 million, $68 million in Q1 a little higher, and so I think the revenue decline Q1 to Q2 in the core is still rounds to 1%. It's just a tick over 1%.\nMehdi Hosseini: Sure. So perhaps maybe the expectation was for a different contribution from ESI and maybe a little bit better than expected trend with the organic. But the ESI is making some compares difficult. Would you agree?\nNeil Dougherty: Yeah. I mean, yes. First of all, ESI was great in Q1. There's significantly 10% or more above our expectation going into the quarter. They saw strong renewal activity as expected with some good upsizing of transactions and other things that drove that revenue nicely. The sequential decline in ESI is totally as expected that we talked about it last quarter, that 40% to 45% of their orders and revenue are falling because their renewal schedules fall on Keysight's first quarter. But it does make the compares a bit more challenging when looking at the combined entity.\nMehdi Hosseini: Right. Okay. Don't want to come across [indiscernible], but I think these compares get a little bit murky looking into April versus January. Looking into July and October, obviously, your comments suggest maybe April, July will be the bottom and then a modest recovery in October. So the question for Satish is what do you think the driver behind that modest rebound would be? And why should we assume acceleration in that rebound into FY '25? The 5G is behind us, but what are some of the other key drivers that would give you confidence that the modest rebound should follow by acceleration unless you tell me it's just going to be a modest improvement into FY '25?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yeah. The profile -- the timing and the profile of the recovery, Mehdi, as you can appreciate, is hard to really quantify or analytically quantify for you at this point. But let me give you some subjective color on what we're seeing. I think we're seeing continued strength in aerospace, defense. Mark touched upon that. The trends are on defense modernization. The new emulation solutions are continuing to proliferate through that ecosystem. And given the sort of national security emphasis that's playing out, we think that's on a sure track. We also have seen the 5G platform that we have get into some of the more defense-related applications and we announced a collaboration as an example with Lockheed Martin. So, we look at that and we look at the pipeline of opportunities that Mark referenced and feel good about the aerospace and defense. And typically, as you would expect, our aerospace, defense has the strongest quarter in quarter four. So that's one part of the equation. The other thing is what we're hearing from some of our semiconductor customers as the fab companies coming out and laying out their plans for '25 is they're all planning for a pretty strong '25 capital environment around next-generation 2-nanometer technology, and some of the new investments around power semiconductor and silicon photonics and other areas. And so, we would expect some uptick there in our semi business, which has been depressed by the time we roll out in Q4 and entering into Q1. So, it's hard to really time it on a quarterly basis, but that's sort of the horizon that we would expect. We would expect the wireline business to largely continue to perform well because the drivers on AI continue to remain robust. And then wireless, I'm just factoring in a pretty gradual recovery as we go through the year. So that's sort of our base case. Now, there is this whole macro. What does the macro do? And if the global PMI improves quicker, then maybe there's some upside in our general electronics business. But we're at this point just assuming that there isn't this big broad recovery this year or in this fiscal year anyway. We would assume that second half is just modestly bigger in business than the first half. But again, if we go back and look at the situation as we take it a step back, last year was the first year where orders declined double digits. We were still able to use our backlog to deliver revenue -- a stronger revenue -- I mean at least an upside revenue and strong profitability. So now we're coming off of that, this will be the second year when if orders don't rebound, we would expect a strong rebound from our experience historically running this business.\nMehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: One of the hallmarks of Keysight has been the ability to continue to invest organically and inorganically through cycles. How do you see R&D spending and also your appetite for additional M&A this year?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yeah. Thank you. I think first and foremost, I would say from an organic -- we're an organic-first company. We believe in taking a long-term view of our markets. And what's changed since we formed Keysight is our organization that is focused on customers. So we're getting strong validation around our investments with our customers. So, partnerships and collaborations are key to how we are able to realize the full value of our organic investment. So, we feel very good about where we are focused on from a portfolio perspective and our ability to drive long-term organic growth. Now, having said that, I laid out at Investor Day four or five areas where we are looking at some expansion opportunities. Some of them we're pursuing organically as well, but we're also looking at our pipeline from an M&A perspective and looking for opportunities where we can create good return on investment for our shareholders. You've seen us be incredibly disciplined as we have pursued these opportunities. We walked away from deals where we thought we couldn't get a good return. And so, you can expect that even as we pursue these opportunities and look at the pipeline, we will stay disciplined as we go through this -- as we go through the evaluation.\nNeil Dougherty: And I could add -- just add one additional bit of color on the R&D side. We stayed very disciplined in the period of time in '21 and '22, where revenues were growing at a high level of rate. We underspent our R&D target of 16.5% of revenue that continued into '23. What that enables us to do now in '24 is maintain R&D investments basically flat. As I said in my earlier comments, that'll take R&D up above that 16.5% target on a percent of revenue basis, but it'll allow us to continue our investments to make sure that we're full participants in the eventual upturn.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Great. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up. How are you working on getting the ESI and Keysight sales forces aligned and prioritizing which customers to go after on a joint basis? And am I right in thinking just similar to other software companies, it takes six, nine months to build the pipeline and then another six months to close, so those benefits, we should think of showing up maybe in fiscal '25?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yeah, I think ESI was well on track of transforming the business to growth. And our first priority is to continue to support their base plan. And that's baked into '24. But in a targeted way, Mark and his team have already started to engage to take those capabilities and apply them to our aerospace and defense customer base in the U.S. as a first order of priority. But as I've gotten to know that portfolio, what gives me excitement is their core technologies around hybrid AI, which I think could find a broader leverage into other Keysight applications to accelerate our pursuits. But that's with time. Our number one priority is to stabilize, integrate, and basically keep their base plan on track. And I think they're off to a good start.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: All right. Thank you very much.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Rob Mason with Baird. You may proceed.\nRob Mason: Yes, thank you. Neil, I wanted to go back to the conversation you pointed out the operating model performing as expected on the downside operating margin on a year-over-year basis. Is there anything that you'd call out sequentially impacting operating margins? It just looks like the sequential deleverage is a little high, if I'm doing my math correctly, higher.\nNeil Dougherty: Yeah, it's a good question. And there are a few things. So, first of all, we had a very favorable mix within the quarter in Q1, not just because ESI was in at $67 million or $68 million of revenue on software, but even within the Keysight classic portion of the business, we were north of 66%, so very favorable in the core as well. We do not expect to be mixed to be as favorable next quarter as it was or frankly -- probably for the rest of the year, mix is unlikely to be as favorable as it was in the first quarter. And the other thing would be from an OpEx perspective, we do expect Q2 OpEx to be seasonally higher, that is typical. And the single biggest factor to that is PTO usage. PTO usage is the lowest in the second quarter of our fiscal year, and that's enough to drive a measurable increase in OpEx as we move from Q1 to Q2.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: It might also be worth highlighting our confidence in both the operating cash flow performance and also the free cash flow conversion, we had 98% of net operating profit this quarter. So, we feel good about the cash flow generation capabilities as we navigate this near-term downturn in our markets.\nRob Mason: Yeah, certainly. Just as a second question. There's -- during the quarter, we saw more, I guess, some of your EDA and simulation participants in the market converging. I know Keysight has some strategic partnerships with some of the players involved there. I'm just curious how you think consolidation around those areas affects your opportunity? And maybe you could speak to any of the test layers that would be more impacted or not? And really just kind of getting at how do you define Keysight's moat in this backdrop where you're seeing some of the simulation converge?\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Yeah. I think when we think about the markets, we're approaching it, obviously, from tests to emulation to simulation, and we're connecting the workflow there. In many ways, we collaborate with all of the players that have been on record, and we have a relationship with them so that we can offer a good workflow experience for customers. And this has long been a market where there's been good interplay between the tools because just like Keysight is an engineering company, we are also a customer of a number of these tools, and it's hard to standardize on the tool or the other because each of them have different focus areas and different strategies. So, when we piece it together, we don't view this as necessarily a big impact to our plans. We, in fact, are continuing to progress our system simulation, emulation strategy and SAM expansion. And with ESI in the company, we have more capabilities to drive that strategy moving forward.\nRob Mason: Very good. That's helpful. Thank you.\nSatish Dhanasekaran: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions in queue. With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Jason for concluding remarks.\nJason Kary: Thanks, Joel, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to talking to you later this quarter and wish you a good day.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Wallace",
            "content": "Yeah. Thanks, Satish. Well, Meta, the pipeline that we see today really supports our base scenario that second-half orders and revenue will be modestly higher than the first half, and this is seen through some improvement in our six-month funnel that Neil mentioned in his prepared statements and we've called out in various other earnings calls as well. The improvement comes in the form of some funnel intake up modestly indicating that we have some green shoots and pockets of demand that are showing up. And the other area is in the funnel velocity, or in other words, how long it takes for opportunities to move through the funnel as some customers are beginning to move a bit more quickly. So, 90 days later, those are the big changes. The short-term funnel is about the same at the beginning of Q1, which still remains constrained, but we are seeing some positive pipeline dynamics as we look out six months. Yeah. I would just add to that, we have said that the weakness is in China for EISG businesses. As we said, if you look at China, we saw customer engagements continue. I was there in December. Our historic exposure to China has been high-teens of revenue. It was a little lower than that in Q1, and it was because of the continued headwinds incrementally worse in semi and manufacturing. But we did see sequential order growth from Q1 to Q -- from Q4 to Q1 driven by this demand that we talked about earlier with growth in 400 gig and 800 gig, R&D for the data center upgrades, some demand for 5G private networks. And as a global company, we're also exposed to some of the offshoring, that has been going on and continues as some of the multinational companies move offshore. And the last thing I'll say is, thinking back over the last several quarters, we vastly de-risked China from a trade perspective. It was it was meaningless in Q1, additions to the RPL have had a [variable] (ph) impact. We continue to monitor the situation very closely. So that's where we've seen some of the headwinds, but even there I've seen some positive indicators in China as well. Yeah, Adam, in the quarter, we saw continued R&D spend for battery and charging infrastructure. We expect that to continue. Manufacturing spend, supply chain spend was down. You've seen unit volumes drop for both conventional and EV demand. So that's where we see that. But e-mobility, which is EV and autonomous, as Neil mentioned, as I mentioned, the funnel remains strong, very robust, as we look at Q2 into FY '24. A lot of this is a long-dated program spend around battery test charging infrastructure. Some of these products -- programs are fluid. So many of them are based on some government subsidies that you may have read have been delayed in Europe and so forth. But we're tied into all of those. And as we look forward, this space continues to be one that's going to be driving growth for us for a long time. Yeah. And Matt, I think it's more of the same what we've been speaking about in terms of the markets that are driving growth. I expect aerospace, defense to continue to be an area of driving growth for us, not only in the US but in Europe and other countries that are faced with the geopolitical situation that exists today. We are operating under continuing resolution in the US, which we're expecting that budget to be signed this quarter, which is favorable for us in terms of the RDT and E-Line items that are getting bipartisan support to progress through this election year.

            "name": "Neil Dougherty",
            "content": "Thank you, Satish, and hello, everyone. First quarter revenue of $1.259 billion was just above the high end of our guidance range and down 9%, or 14% on a core basis. Orders of $1.220 billion declined 6%, or 12% on a core basis. We ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in backlog. Looking at our operational results for Q1, we reported record gross margin of 67%, an increase of 200 basis points year-over-year. Excluding ESI, gross margin was a near-record 66% on lower revenue, supported by a solid mix of software and higher-value solutions. In addition, software was 22% of revenue, while recurring revenue from both software and services grew 10%. Operating expenses of $491 million were flat year-over-year even with the addition of ESI, demonstrating the flexibility of our cost structure and the cost actions that we have taken. Q1 operating margin was 28%, or 27% excluding ESI. These results demonstrate the financial flexibility and resilience of our business. We are outperforming the financial model that we put in place over a decade ago, which calls for only a 300 basis point to 400 basis point year-over-year decline in operating margin when revenue declines 10%. Turning to earnings. We achieved $286 million of net income and delivered earnings of $1.63 per share, of which ESI contributed $0.09. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 176 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated revenue of $839 million, down 11%, or 12% on a core basis. Commercial communications revenue of $544 million declined 14%, while aerospace, defense and government revenue of $295 million was down 5%. Altogether, CSG delivered a record gross margin of 68%, and operating margin of 27%. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated revenue of $420 million, down 5% or 19% on a core basis. EISG reported gross margin of 65%, and operating margin of 31%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the first quarter with $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, which reflects the purchase of ESI within the quarter, generating cash flow from operations of $328 million and free cash flow of $281 million. Share repurchases this quarter totaled 625,000 shares at an average price per share of approximately $149 for a total consideration of $93 million. Now, turning to our outlook. Given Q1 core orders of $1.14 billion and the typical sequential decline in ESI orders and revenue from Q1 to Q2, we expect second quarter revenue to be in the range of $1.190 billion to $1.210 billion, and Q2 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.34 to $1.40 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 175 million shares. This guidance includes approximately $25 million in ESI revenue and a few cents of earnings dilution from ESI. As we look to the second half of the year and our six-month order funnel, we aren't assuming a strong revenue recovery in Keysight's fiscal second half, which ends in October. Our base-case scenario is that revenue is relatively flat from Q2 to Q3 and sequentially up mid-single-digits Q3 to Q4, in line with typical historical seasonality. That said, we do expect second-half orders to exceed first-half orders, which will be supportive of revenue growth in 2025. In closing, Keysight's flexible cost structure and discipline, track record of execution and diverse end markets, give us confidence in our ability to outperform even in the current market conditions, while at the same time, investing to capitalize on the best growth opportunities as markets recover. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A. Yeah. Hi, Samik. I would just say that, as we stated in our prepared remarks, right now, we are -- our base case does not include a meaningful second-half recovery. We're really more looking at seasonal changes as you move throughout the fiscal year, so flattish Q2 to Q3, and then a typical seasonal uptick into Q4, which is typically our stronger quarter of the year. In aggregate, we do expect orders and revenue in the second half to be modestly above the first half, but we're not baking in a recovery at this point. Yeah. I mean I think areas of relative weakness, Satish talked about Asia and China specifically continues to be challenging. I think manufacturing continues to be challenging. And I think we see our wireless customers that are still working through some other issues. On the positive side, wireline, driven by AI is clearly a strength point. Mark, do you want to add? Yeah. So, you're correct. The number is $2.3 billion. And I would start by saying that we now stated a couple of quarters ago that we believe we've worked through the excess backlog. And so -- and we did that last year when revenue outpaced orders by the tune of $275 million or something like that was when we worked through that excess backlog. I think as we look currently, we're managing a couple of things. Obviously, by design, our recurring revenue businesses, software and services are holding up. You see that in an increasing deferred revenue balance. But in addition to this, we're also managing this dynamic between where our -- we've seen a pretty significant increase in these longer-dated orders, which if you remember correctly, historically been about 2% of our incoming order rate and we really didn't talk about it as a result of that. Last year, they were more like 8% of the incoming order rate. They were 8% again here in Q1. And as Mark talked about, we have a robust funnel of longer-dated opportunities as we look out over the course of the next six months. And so, that's the dynamic that we're starting to see. We are starting to see those longer-dated orders show up in revenue. We saw that beginning in Q1. And by Q4, we expect revenue from those longer-dated programs to be about 8% of that Q4 revenue. No. I think that's basically -- we are performing in line with the model, right? So, if you take a look at what's happening, obviously, you see the significant sequential decline in ESI, which is as expected. But if you adjust for that, you're seeing a mid-teens kind of decline in the core business, right, from a revenue perspective. And we've talked about the downside model that contemplates 300 basis points to 400 basis points of operating margin decline when revenues are down 10%. Obviously, we're down significantly more than that, but we're continuing to perform basically in line with that model. We've taken significant actions. Our cost actions started last year and enabled us to deliver record operating margins on flat revenue in an inflationary environment. And then, this quarter, as it started to begin to appear that the recovery was pushing out, we've taken incremental actions that are going to benefit us. We now expect that total OpEx for the company will be down low-single digits on a year-over-year basis prior to the addition of ESI. And all of that reduction is going to show up in the SG&A line items as we like to strike a balance between investment and financial performance. We're going to maintain our investments in R&D. We would expect R&D to be flat. But again, total OpEx down about 3%, driven by actions we've taken to control SG&A. Yeah. From a backlog perspective, we're in the $400 million to $500 million range of our backlog as these long-dated deals. You are correct that they tend to be larger lumpier deals in aerospace, defense, auto, and even in the semi space. And as I said on the previous question about this, we've actually started to see them now, because we started to see the ramp in a little bit in Q1 of last year, but then really in earnest in Q2 of last year on the order line, and some of those things are starting to flow through to revenue now. Now, we're not at 8% yet from a revenue perspective. We expect to be there by the end of the year. But just as you suggested, it is lumpy, right? So, you could end up in a situation where there is relatively lower either order or revenue activity from these types of transactions and some other quarter you might have double activity just given the nature of the business. It was -- ESI was $67 million, $68 million in Q1 a little higher, and so I think the revenue decline Q1 to Q2 in the core is still rounds to 1%. It's just a tick over 1%. Yeah. I mean, yes. First of all, ESI was great in Q1. There's significantly 10% or more above our expectation going into the quarter. They saw strong renewal activity as expected with some good upsizing of transactions and other things that drove that revenue nicely. The sequential decline in ESI is totally as expected that we talked about it last quarter, that 40% to 45% of their orders and revenue are falling because their renewal schedules fall on Keysight's first quarter. But it does make the compares a bit more challenging when looking at the combined entity. And I could add -- just add one additional bit of color on the R&D side. We stayed very disciplined in the period of time in '21 and '22, where revenues were growing at a high level of rate. We underspent our R&D target of 16.5% of revenue that continued into '23. What that enables us to do now in '24 is maintain R&D investments basically flat. As I said in my earlier comments, that'll take R&D up above that 16.5% target on a percent of revenue basis, but it'll allow us to continue our investments to make sure that we're full participants in the eventual upturn. Yeah, it's a good question. And there are a few things. So, first of all, we had a very favorable mix within the quarter in Q1, not just because ESI was in at $67 million or $68 million of revenue on software, but even within the Keysight classic portion of the business, we were north of 66%, so very favorable in the core as well. We do not expect to be mixed to be as favorable next quarter as it was or frankly -- probably for the rest of the year, mix is unlikely to be as favorable as it was in the first quarter. And the other thing would be from an OpEx perspective, we do expect Q2 OpEx to be seasonally higher, that is typical. And the single biggest factor to that is PTO usage. PTO usage is the lowest in the second quarter of our fiscal year, and that's enough to drive a measurable increase in OpEx as we move from Q1 to Q2."

            "name": "Satish Dhanasekaran",
            "content": "Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. My comments will focus on three key headlines: First, Keysight delivered revenue of $1.3 billion and earnings per share of $1.63, both of which exceeded the high-end of our guidance. Given the current market conditions, these results reflect the Keysight team's strong execution and resilience of our financial model. Second, orders were $1.2 billion as the demand environment remains constrained. As certain markets continue to normalize from post-pandemic spending levels, our aerospace, defense and government, and network and data center businesses grew, highlighting the benefit of our diverse end-market exposure. Customer engagement and collaborations on next-generation themes remained strong. The adoption of new use cases such as AI is driving new activity and investment across the ecosystem. However, we're not factoring in a strong recovery this fiscal year. Our base-case scenario is for a modest first-half to second-half improvement in orders and revenue. Third, Keysight continues to be well-positioned for outperformance into a market recovery. We are investing to enhance our market leadership and expand our broad portfolio of leading solutions. We are also pleased to have completed the acquisition of ESI ahead of schedule and extend a warm welcome to the team. Along with our existing EDA business, the addition of ESI further expands our software solutions for simulation and emulation, a market with favorable growth attributes as the virtualization of design and prototyping increases. Now, let's begin with a brief overview of Keysight's first quarter performance. Market conditions were largely unchanged from the prior quarter. Across our end markets, investment in R&D remained steady, while manufacturing and overall economic activity in Asia continued to moderate. First quarter orders were $1.2 billion, revenue $1.3 billion, and earnings per share of $1.63 were above our guidance, and we generated strong cash flow. Gross margins across the business was strong, and including ESI, we achieved a record 67%, demonstrating the differentiation of our solutions. Operating margin was 28%, reflecting expense discipline and cost actions that we have taken over the past quarter and last year. Turning to our business segments. Communications Solutions Group revenue declined relative to a strong compare last year, which was driven by robust backlog conversion. Quarter one gross margin was a record 68%, reflecting a greater mix of software and higher-value solutions. Orders were in line with expectations with strength in aerospace, defense and government, and the wireline business, while wireless continues to normalize. Aerospace, defense and government revenue declined while orders grew year-over-year. Spending levels remain elevated, as governments around the world prioritize investments in defense modernization, space and satellite applications. We are scaling our threat emulation offerings to a broader set of customers for electromagnetic spectrum operation applications in the US and Europe, resulting in key wins at large primes. Our space and satellite solutions drove businesses this quarter for new space modules and low Earth orbit applications. Leveraging our protocol and digital twin capabilities, we've partnered with Lockheed Martin and a broad set of technology leaders to successfully demonstrate a secure 5G and data link network that integrates land, air and space operations. In commercial communications, customer spending remains cautious. While we're not seeing a market recovery yet, industry inventories are slowly returning to normalized levels. For example, smartphone sales in the fourth quarter of 2023 grew meaningfully for the first time since mid-2021. In our wireless business, customer engagements remain high, with ongoing R&D activity in advanced technologies. This results in software and service upgrades that contributed to higher gross margins in the quarter. 5G standards continue to progress and are driving a wide range of new use cases and features for ongoing network deployment. New band combinations are expected to be added to the 3GPP standard this year, driving certification needs. This quarter, we hosted Global Certification Forum that brought together industry leaders across a broad array of sectors to collaborate on certification requirements for network and device interoperability and performance. Next week at Mobile World Congress, we will be demonstrating over a dozen solutions for 5G, Open RAN, satellite connectivity, AI and early 6G capabilities, many of which will be showcased in partnership with industry-leading customers. Moving to our wireline business, we saw order growth for our data center solutions. Orders for 400 gig and 800 gig solutions, both in R&D and manufacturing, grew double-digits. We also achieved a key milestone in partnership with Marvell by enabling test and verification of their new ultra-high-speed networking chip designed for next-generation AI-driven cloud applications. The adoption of AI is clearly lifting activity across the entire data center ecosystem. As the industry deploys AI infrastructure at scale, we expect the demand for high-speed networking and computing capabilities to grow. Turning to the Electronic Industrial Solutions Group, revenue was down, reflecting ongoing normalization from outsized demand in the prior year. Customer spending remains cautious as market conditions, particularly in manufacturing, and regionally in China were weaker. Underneath the macro headlines, we see pockets of growth where customers are leaning in and investing to address new use cases and emerging technologies across multiple end markets. In semiconductor, the market environment is mixed. Despite the improved industry outlook for overall fab investments, foundry customers continued to push out large projects due to delays in construction and production timelines. At the same time, we saw strong demand for Keysight's proprietary interferometer system, driven by industry progression in EUV technology. Next-generation performance requirements for new AI-driven data center and ADAS use cases are also driving investments. And we saw some improvement this quarter in memory-related demand as well as mature process capacity in China. In automotive, the funnel of EV opportunities continues to be strong. Competition amongst OEMs, upcoming regulatory requirements and support from government subsidies are incentivizing investments in R&D for new battery technology and charging infrastructure. During the quarter, we secured a key win that marks the expansion of our European battery test footprint into France. As we have noted before, EV funnel is healthy, but the timing and the size of these system-level and longer-dated engagements are expected to vary from quarter to quarter. In general electronics, market conditions were unchanged from last quarter. Ongoing capacity normalization and cautious spending continued to weigh on the consumer electronics and manufacturing portions of the market. We saw steady demand for our solutions in digital health, industrial automation and advanced research. This quarter, we secured key wins in digital health applications for medical imaging and scanning as well as test automation. Consistent with our software-centric solutions strategy, the value that our customers derive from software and service offerings is enabling business resilience in the current market conditions. Software and services orders and revenue continued to outperform the broader business this quarter and were greater than 35% of total Keysight even excluding ESI. ESI further enhances our design engineering software portfolio and expands our addressable market in automotive, avionics, smart manufacturing, and human workflows. We were pleased to complete the acquisition ahead of schedule, and ESI's results were also ahead of expectations for the quarter. In summary, our market leadership and the strength of our solutions portfolio gives us confidence in our ability to capitalize on the multiple waves of technology innovations and long-term secular growth trends of our markets. Our team's relentless customer focus and sustained customer collaborations also position us well for long-term value creation. In addition, the strength of our financial model continues to generate healthy margins and cash flow. With that, I will turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook. Sure. Yeah. Thank you, Samik. I would say, at the highest level, the customer engagements that we have are remaining strong. And while there are signs of optimism from customers as we enter the new calendar year, we have not yet seen a progression through our pipeline. And as we said in our -- in my prepared remarks, the market conditions remain largely unchanged from a quarter ago. The aerospace, defense strength that we saw last year continues on. And what we have seen incrementally is the wireline business has actually grown for the first time this quarter, and that was a function of some of the AI-related end-market inflections that are occurring. If I take a regional cut at this, I would say, our largest region, Americas, grew for the first time in four quarters, and this is driven by again the strength in aerospace, defense and the wireline business. But Asia continues to remain weak, especially which is impacting the EISG business and some of the wireless business in that region as it continues to normalize from the peak spending levels. Again to put your question in perspective, CSG entered that normalization phase early and EISG was offset by a few quarters. And so that's what's currently playing out. So, given this backdrop, we think it's prudent to think of a base-case assumption where orders and revenue would be up modestly first half to second half. But should there be a broad and stronger recovery sooner, and there may be some signs out there around SIA index where things are picking up, some of the inventory digestion that's happening, capacity utilization, fabs, but should that occur, we will be in a good position to capitalize on that and recover quicker. Yeah, that's a really good question. It's still an emerging opportunity for us, but what is significant this quarter is, we started to see the wireline core parts of our business inflect. And if you recall in the past earnings calls, I've talked about the traffic patterns caused by generative AI really impacting the whole network architecture, compute to networking and switching and silicon, and therefore, we knew that demand was coming up. And so, what we noticed this quarter is our wireline business started to inflect, driven by 400-gig and 800-gig transceiver business in manufacturing as that starts to scale, increased focus on terabit research, we announced a collaboration with Marvell in advanced technologies as well there. So that's the business of today. But as we start to think about the broader landscape here, I would say the memory technologies with HBM is starting to gain interest in our customers, different processor architectures, increased silicon activity enabled by AI. And then, for us, it's very exciting because there is a lot of tools that we can deploy our IP because we have the total stack to help engineers train the AI ML models better. And so, you will see, we announced a collaboration with NVIDIA on this front as well. And there's new interface standards. And you know our business is driven by standardization process. So, new interface standards are good for our CXL PCIe Gen-7 and the Ultra Ethernet Consortium are playing into it. Silicon photonics in quantum, while they are sort of enabling technologies, are other areas where we've had investment, where we're now able to address new opportunities. Now a lot of that is not yet baked into our forecast, but we're continuing to action these things through the investments we're making. Thank you. It might be a little too premature to talk about the outer years, but here's how we're thinking about it. We've had -- obviously, this is the second year we're entering in where orders are declining. And every time that's happened, we would expect a bounce back in the outer years to be stronger. So that's still to be proven out. And you know the sort of earnings leverage that we get when we are able to grow our business above our models. So, profitability, I'm pretty encouraged by the strong gross margins we're maintaining even on declining top-line right now, that's a function of the software and services content, and just the discipline which we run our business. And so, I feel like getting our business back to growth is the principal driver. And given all the trends that we see across wireless, wireline, the long-term trends we see in next-gen silicon and aerospace, defense and in semi, we believe that we can get back to this growth model that we put out at Investor Day. Yeah. I think as far as the ESI question goes, I think we're quite positive, incrementally positive about the opportunities that we have to grow our -- grow the ESI business in Keysight's environment. We've long studied the system simulation/emulation marketplace. And so, having all of the capabilities is definitely a huge advantage. And for us, bringing an asset that was sort of locked-in in an European environment and exposing it with our go-to-market channel and taking that into our customer base remains an opportunity to drive growth above what they've been able to do. But incrementally I'm pretty bullish about the technology and the depth of simulation capabilities they bring. They also have a hybrid AI capability that is pretty unique and differentiated that we'll look to fully leverage across the company as we go, and we're also positive about the strong start in the first quarter for ESI. And I'll just hand it off to Mark to make some comments on the pipeline that he sees and how he sees that progressing. Thank you. Hi, Adam. And also, some of the capabilities that we have developed around electrification are finding new applications in aerospace and defense and other end-markets that are also going to be impacted by the similar trends. And so, we're quite pleased by the leverage and synergies we'll see as we move forward. Yeah, we'll do. Tim, I think at the highest level, what we've seen so far is that Release 15 and 16 deployments that have occurred largely in the United States and in China and now in India. So, we expected, and we've talked about this to the industry capital, would peak some point in '22-'23. So roughly we got that timing right. But if you think about the business model that we established for commercial comms and for our wireless business, it was always about more vector to service the R&D customers. So, while even in this environment, the volumes are down especially the manufacturing production-related volumes with the RAN markets down. So, we're starting to see that effect and the businesses normalizing. But what we're continuing to see is customers engage with us in buying upgrades for their release library. So going from 15, 16 to 17 as an example, which is much more evolutionary nature. But as we think about the future now, the roadmap is very clear. It's sort of a roadmap for the next five years where the industry is working on Release 18, Release 19 followed by 20, which would include some early study items on 6G as an example. But some of the same ideas that we had for growth, which are built around vertical industry expansions with AI ML, new device form factors such as the Vision Pro that's just launched that's capturing a lot of imagination on what augmented reality can mean in the future. And just sort of the integration I should say of satellite communications and terrestrial networks is opening up new threads of innovation and exposing us to more customers that want our capability. So all-in-all, in balance, I look at the capabilities we have, our market leadership position that we've established in 5G, and I feel confident that post-normalization of this demand that we can return the business to growth even prior to 6G. But that's yet to play out, but that's our best thinking at this point. Yeah. I think, what we're seeing is obviously, the first instantiation with every technology like this, where 100 gig times 400 gig times eight sort of topologies are currently being -- are being deployed. And so, we're obviously, engaged with that and we're starting to benefit from that. But the roadmap is clear, right, then it's going to get to 200 times four, because the scaling continues and leading to even higher-speed research in 1.6 terabits and beyond. So that's on the wireline side. The Ixia business or what was Ixia business, we -- it's integrated into our wireline business and it's been remarkably stable for us in the commercial communications market because of the higher services and software content associated with that business. And it's also a business that doesn't really trend up that significantly during upcycles. So, it's been a very steady business for us. And one we're -- now we're able to take out some of the traffic generation capabilities and adapt it to go address some of the emerging AI use cases. So, we're quite pleased by the assets we have in the company and by our ability to go and solve customers' emerging challenges even beyond the traditional segments we serve. Yeah. I think for us, we don't try to pick winners. In some ways, innovation is best served when you have multiple competing technologies approach the same challenge. But fundamentally, data is growing. The pattern of data through these networks are altering and changing, which requires the communication systems to adapt. And I think all the way from memory to network, NIC cards, to compute architectures are getting more heterogeneous if you will. So, more standards. I talked about CXL, the Ultra Ethernet Consortium, PCIe Gen-7, et cetera. So, all of that really creates a real good bed of technologies for us to service through our platforms. And often, it's the same underlying platform -- I missed out USB 4.0, but often it's the same sort of underlying platforms that we have from all the way from oscilloscopes, to our BERTs, to our network traffic emulators from our Ixia acquisition. So, we tend to go approach these things and then add in more software capabilities as we move forward. We're actually quite pleased with the performance and the resilience of our software business even through these times. And software and services represents roughly now 40% of the total order/revenue in the most recent quarter, and we'll continue to keep growing the value of the company. Our ARR was also up double digits this quarter. Yeah. I'll take the second part, then I'll have Mark sort of walk through his thinking on the pipeline, which really no impact -- I mean, which really flow into our guide, if you will. On the wireless side, I think we're continuing to expect stability and moderation as it comes off of strong peak demand years in '21 and '22. So that normalization phase continues to play out over the next couple of quarters, and that's sort of our base case thinking on wireless. All of the R&D activity that I described continues on, but we're still waiting for any inflection in component spend which we're not seeing at this point. So that's sort of our expectations on wireless. And I'll just have Mark make some comments on the pipeline. Yeah. The profile -- the timing and the profile of the recovery, Mehdi, as you can appreciate, is hard to really quantify or analytically quantify for you at this point. But let me give you some subjective color on what we're seeing. I think we're seeing continued strength in aerospace, defense. Mark touched upon that. The trends are on defense modernization. The new emulation solutions are continuing to proliferate through that ecosystem. And given the sort of national security emphasis that's playing out, we think that's on a sure track. We also have seen the 5G platform that we have get into some of the more defense-related applications and we announced a collaboration as an example with Lockheed Martin. So, we look at that and we look at the pipeline of opportunities that Mark referenced and feel good about the aerospace and defense. And typically, as you would expect, our aerospace, defense has the strongest quarter in quarter four. So that's one part of the equation. The other thing is what we're hearing from some of our semiconductor customers as the fab companies coming out and laying out their plans for '25 is they're all planning for a pretty strong '25 capital environment around next-generation 2-nanometer technology, and some of the new investments around power semiconductor and silicon photonics and other areas. And so, we would expect some uptick there in our semi business, which has been depressed by the time we roll out in Q4 and entering into Q1. So, it's hard to really time it on a quarterly basis, but that's sort of the horizon that we would expect. We would expect the wireline business to largely continue to perform well because the drivers on AI continue to remain robust. And then wireless, I'm just factoring in a pretty gradual recovery as we go through the year. So that's sort of our base case. Now, there is this whole macro. What does the macro do? And if the global PMI improves quicker, then maybe there's some upside in our general electronics business. But we're at this point just assuming that there isn't this big broad recovery this year or in this fiscal year anyway. We would assume that second half is just modestly bigger in business than the first half. But again, if we go back and look at the situation as we take it a step back, last year was the first year where orders declined double digits. We were still able to use our backlog to deliver revenue -- a stronger revenue -- I mean at least an upside revenue and strong profitability. So now we're coming off of that, this will be the second year when if orders don't rebound, we would expect a strong rebound from our experience historically running this business. Yeah. Thank you. I think first and foremost, I would say from an organic -- we're an organic-first company. We believe in taking a long-term view of our markets. And what's changed since we formed Keysight is our organization that is focused on customers. So we're getting strong validation around our investments with our customers. So, partnerships and collaborations are key to how we are able to realize the full value of our organic investment. So, we feel very good about where we are focused on from a portfolio perspective and our ability to drive long-term organic growth. Now, having said that, I laid out at Investor Day four or five areas where we are looking at some expansion opportunities. Some of them we're pursuing organically as well, but we're also looking at our pipeline from an M&A perspective and looking for opportunities where we can create good return on investment for our shareholders. You've seen us be incredibly disciplined as we have pursued these opportunities. We walked away from deals where we thought we couldn't get a good return. And so, you can expect that even as we pursue these opportunities and look at the pipeline, we will stay disciplined as we go through this -- as we go through the evaluation. Yeah, I think ESI was well on track of transforming the business to growth. And our first priority is to continue to support their base plan. And that's baked into '24. But in a targeted way, Mark and his team have already started to engage to take those capabilities and apply them to our aerospace and defense customer base in the U.S. as a first order of priority. But as I've gotten to know that portfolio, what gives me excitement is their core technologies around hybrid AI, which I think could find a broader leverage into other Keysight applications to accelerate our pursuits. But that's with time. Our number one priority is to stabilize, integrate, and basically keep their base plan on track. And I think they're off to a good start. Thank you. It might also be worth highlighting our confidence in both the operating cash flow performance and also the free cash flow conversion, we had 98% of net operating profit this quarter. So, we feel good about the cash flow generation capabilities as we navigate this near-term downturn in our markets. Yeah. I think when we think about the markets, we're approaching it, obviously, from tests to emulation to simulation, and we're connecting the workflow there. In many ways, we collaborate with all of the players that have been on record, and we have a relationship with them so that we can offer a good workflow experience for customers. And this has long been a market where there's been good interplay between the tools because just like Keysight is an engineering company, we are also a customer of a number of these tools, and it's hard to standardize on the tool or the other because each of them have different focus areas and different strategies. So, when we piece it together, we don't view this as necessarily a big impact to our plans. We, in fact, are continuing to progress our system simulation, emulation strategy and SAM expansion. And with ESI in the company, we have more capabilities to drive that strategy moving forward. Thank you."
