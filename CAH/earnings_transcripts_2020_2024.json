During the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call, we please ask that you try and limit yourself to one question, so that we can try and give everyone an opportunity. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Kaufmann: Thanks, Kevin. And good morning to everyone joining us. Before Jason and I discuss our results and outlook, let me share a few reflections. In my nearly 30-years as part of the Cardinal Health family, I have seen this company and this industry expand with new products, services and markets, evolve with technology, regulatory and model changes, and adapt when faced with external challenges. In each of these moments, we have demonstrated grit and agility. Now more than ever, we will lean on that legacy to navigate current challenges and perform our critical role in health care. In fiscal '20, we delivered on our commitments and demonstrated these traits. We grew operating earnings, exceeded our EPS guidance range, surpassed our enterprise cost savings target and strengthened our balance sheet, all while continuing to execute our long-term strategic priorities in a rapidly changing environment. We made strategic portfolio decisions, including divesting our remaining equity interest in naviHealth, as well as investing and partnering in the evolving growth areas of specialty, at-home and services. We achieved these results as we adapted our operations to address the unique challenges presented by COVID-19. We successfully transitioned our office employees to a remote work model, and we continuously maintained operations in all of our distribution facilities, nuclear pharmacies and global manufacturing plants. Through all of this, we kept our primary focus, delivering critical products and services to our customers and at the same time prioritizing the safety of our employees. As I look toward the coming year, I recognize that the global and industry dynamics resulting from the pandemic will continue to challenge areas of our business. I am confident that our team will continue rising to these challenges as we drive our strategic priorities forward. I'll provide some comments later about how I see these priorities evolving in fiscal '21 and beyond. But first, I'll turn to Jason to discuss the fourth quarter fiscal '20 and our outlook for fiscal '21.\nJason Hollar: Thanks, Mike. And good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to join you this morning on my first call since assuming the CFO role, and I look forward to engaging with you more in the future. I will provide a few comments on the fourth quarter and detail our results for the year before turning our fiscal '21 guidance and key assumptions. Starting with the quarter, we delivered better than expected EPS of $1.04, driven by improved operating performance, as well as well as lower interest and other expense. Turning to the segments. Beginning with pharma on slide 6. Revenue was flat for the quarter. As expected, in Q4, we saw reduced pharmaceutical demand as a result of the accelerated Q3 sales related to COVID-19. Pharma segment profit decreased 20% to $359 million. As anticipated, challenges related to the pandemic caused volume declines in several areas, particularly in our nuclear business and our generics program. Similar to prior quarters, segment profit also reflected a headwind from pharmaceutical distribution customer contract renewals. In Medical, Q4 revenue decreased 13% due to the adverse impact of COVID-19 related cancellation and deferral of elective procedures. This impact is primarily within products and distribution. Medical segment profit increased 24% to $120 million in the quarter, driven by cost savings initiatives and the beneficial comparison to a supplier-related charge in the prior year, partially offset by the adverse impact of COVID-19. As expected, PPE volumes for the quarter were down sequentially, but above pre-COVID-19 levels. This reflects the demand driven sellout of safety stock in the third quarter, as well as sustained increases in demand and associated global supply challenges, which we will discuss later in our remarks. Across both segments, COVID-19 was a significant headwind to our business in the fourth quarter. Although it's always difficult to approximate the impact of lost sales, we estimate COVID-19 negatively affected operating earnings by approximately $130 million despite some improvement in elective procedures and physician office visits over the course of the quarter. In Q4, we generated $240 million of operating cash flow, reflecting our continued commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet. In June, we redeemed $500 million of notes with December 2020 maturities. Additionally, we generated nearly $900 million in the quarter from the sale of investments. Now I'll transition to the full year consolidated results. In the midst of a challenging environment, we saw strong top line growth with revenue increasing 5% to $153 billion. Total company gross margin grew 1% to $6.9 billion. SG&A increased 1%, reflecting higher costs to support sales growth. Operating earnings returned to growth in fiscal '20, finishing at $2.4 billion despite a net headwind related to COVID-19 of approximately $100 million on the full year. Interest and other expense decreased 23%, primarily due to a lower debt balance and a net benefit from lower interest rates. We finished the year with $2 billion of operating cash flow. As a reminder, the day of the week in which the quarter ends affects point-in-time cash flows. We ended the year with a $2.8 billion cash balance with roughly $0.5 billion held outside the US, and nothing outstanding under our $3 billion credit facilities. From a capital allocation perspective, we took additional actions in fiscal 2020 to strengthen our position for long-term growth. We invested $375 million of CapEx back into the business, focusing on enhancing our IT infrastructure and fueling strategic growth opportunities. We paid down $1.4 billion in debt, and we returned over $900 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our effective tax rate for the year was 25%. We finished the year with earnings per share of $5.45, up more than 3% versus prior year, which exceeded our guidance range. Transitioning to the segments on slide 10. Pharma performance exceeded our expectations for the full year. Segment revenue grew 6% to $137 billion, driven by sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution customers and to a lesser extent, specialty solutions customers. Segment profit decreased 4% to $1.8 billion, reflecting the adverse impact of pharmaceutical distribution customer contract renewals, partially offset by a favorable mix of brand sales and specialty solutions grow. Importantly, although we saw lower volumes in the fourth quarter related to COVID-19, our generics program experienced overall consistent market dynamics during the year, and was a net tailwind in fiscal '20. In medical, performance was strong. Although revenue decreased 1% to $15.4 billion due to the adverse impact from COVID-19, segment profit increased 15% to $663 million. This was driven by cost savings initiatives, particularly within our global manufacturing and supply chain, and the beneficial comparison to a supplier-related charge in the prior year, partially offset by the impact of COVID-19. Across the company in fiscal '20 we demonstrated positive performance, despite significant global challenges. As these dynamics continue into fiscal '21, we are focused on building upon our operational momentum through the underlying strength and resilience of our business. Before I share our outlook for fiscal '21, let me first provide a few updates regarding the assumed COVID-19 trajectory going forward. This can be found on slide 13. After significant dialogue with both external and internal thought leaders, as well as with our upstream and downstream partners, we now believe that general recovery regarding COVID-19 will be a flatter, more elongated curve than initially anticipated. We are assuming a more significant impact from the ongoing deferral and cancellation of elective procedures and physician offices in the first half of the fiscal year, with an eventual recovery to pre COVID-19 levels, as we exit fiscal '21. On average, we believe elective procedures will be down relative to pre pandemic levels in the high single digit range and physician office visits will be down in the mid single digit range for the full year. Additionally, while we are working diligently to address global PPE supply challenges, we are assuming demand will continue to outpace available supply for the balance of fiscal '21. We are incurring higher costs, procuring certain PPE products for our customers during the pandemic, and this will be a headwind for us in fiscal '21, especially in the first half of the year. Keep in mind, our outlook is subject to considerable uncertainty, and at this time does not assume additional widespread shutdowns like we saw in the spring. We are closely monitoring key variables such as the trajectory of the virus itself, patient psychology and returning to sites of care, our customers' capacity and the overall health of the economy. Using these assumptions as our backdrop, we anticipate earnings per share in the range of $5.25 to $5.65 for fiscal '21. This range assumes an estimated incremental net headwind related to COVID-19 of a similar year-over-year magnitude as experienced in fiscal '20. We expect interest and other expense in the range of $190 million to $215 million, which reflects interest expense savings from fiscal '20 debt pay down, as well as anticipated debt pay down in fiscal '21 of at least $500 million. We are assuming a full year non-GAAP effective tax rate in the range of 24% to 26%. As a reminder, this assumption does not contemplate the potential effects of any unusual or open year audit adjustments, favorable or unfavorable, which we have historically included in our non-GAAP tax rate. Given we have multiple years of US tax audits open, we could expect greater than usual variability in our effective tax rate in the near to medium term. We anticipate dilutive shares in the range of $292 million to $296 million. And finally, we expect capital expenditures of $400 million to $450 million. For the segments, beginning with pharma on slide 15, we expect mid single-digit segment revenue growth and segment profit growth in the low single-digits. We are anticipating consistent market dynamics within our generics program and a similar contingent brand inflation rate in fiscal '21 as in fiscal '20. We also expect opioid legal costs of approximately $100 million, consistent with the prior year. In Medical although we expect lot single digit revenue growth, we expect high single-digit profit decline due to higher cost associated with procuring PPE for our customers and the impact of less elective procedures. Excluding the adverse impacts of COVID-19, we would expect Medical segment profit growth to be in the mid single digits. Mike will elaborate on our strategies to COVID-19 and our plans to continue to improve the segment's underlying performance. Before I turn the call back over to Mike, in my brief remarks last quarter, I expressed my excitement about the team, our mission and the tremendous opportunities in front of us. Those initial impressions have been further confirmed in my first few months. I am confident we can collectively navigate current and future complexities to perform our essential role in health care and realize our future opportunities. With that, let me turn it back over to Mike.\nMike Kaufmann: Jason has quickly learned our business, our strategy and our ongoing transformations across the enterprise. And on behalf of our full leadership team, we're grateful for his early contributions and partnership. Turning to our future. In fiscal '21 and beyond, we are focused on optimizing our core businesses and investing for growth. I will share how we are doing both across the segments. First, in Pharma. We're building momentum on a solid growth trajectory. We continue to enhance our infrastructure, deploying technologies across the segment to streamline our operations, improve our processes and strengthen our e-commerce platforms. We also continue to invest in generics, including our best-in-class sourcing capabilities through Red Oak as we drive all aspects of the program for sustained momentum and performance. Along with these work streams, we are fueling growth in key areas of the segment through strategic investments to diversify our capabilities and enhance the customer experience. In Specialty, we are beginning to operationalize the investment we mentioned in Q1 to establish a new distribution center outside of Nashville, Tennessee. This facility includes a state-of-the-art cold chain complex with deep frozen technology, and it enables us to drive operational efficiencies, as well as support further growth in this area of the industry. In Connected Care, we are identifying and investing in innovative digital capabilities that will improve interactions with patients, payers, pharmacies and providers. We are also investing in an expanded innovation center for theranostics opportunities in our nuclear business, which will drive longer-term profitable growth. Turning now to Medical. We have multiple initiatives underway to drive longer term growth in this segment. But first and foremost, we continue to prioritize our response to customers and their patients as we navigate the pandemic. The unprecedented and sustained increases in demand for certain product categories are creating supply challenges and cost pressures for us and for our customers that will likely negatively affect our results. In response, we have and will continue to expand our self-manufacturing capacity and sourcing capabilities. Our sourcing and marketing teams have reviewed more than 700 leads for alternative sources of PPE supply. However, only a small number of these leads have satisfied our rigorous vetting process, and we are developing sourcing relationships where economically feasible. In addition to short term pricing actions to mitigate increasing costs, our teams are also building a longer term strategy for supply assurance. Regarding our commercial strategy, although our pace has been and will continue to be affected by COVID-19, we are confident in our talent and ability to execute this important work stream. We are moving forward with an enhanced focus on supporting the needs of our diverse customer base. We believe this work stream will ramp up with the gradual increase in elective procedures as its progress is dependent upon our customers' readiness to engage in incremental product and services discussions. At the same time, we continue to optimize our end-to-end global supply chain. We are making thoughtful modifications to our logistics, planning, manufacturing and procurement initiatives, and this work is on track to deliver significant efficiencies. Also, we continue to evaluate our footprint and make selective investments in our capabilities and infrastructure. Additionally, we are continuing to grow in evolving areas like our at-Home and Services businesses through investments that further enhance our strong strategic positions. For example, in at-Home, we are investing in technology that improves our interactions with the patient and drives efficiencies to create significant value in future years. Let me now turn to the Enterprise. Our commitment to efficient operations will enable us to optimize and invest. To that end, we have multiple initiatives in-flight that will deliver savings in excess of our multiyear $500 million target, as well as technology and process improvements that drive future growth. Turning briefly to capital allocation. Our priorities of investing in the business, strengthening our balance sheet through debt paydown, and returning cash to shareholders through our differentiated dividend remain unchanged. To close, although fiscal '20 presented significant global and industry challenges, we delivered on our commitments, and our team responded with the grit that I've seen time and time again at Cardinal Health. I'd like to thank our employees, especially our frontline teams, for their dedication to our mission. What we do matters. And together, we will manage the complexities ahead, continue to deliver products and solutions to our customers and their patients, and drive growth so we can perform our essential role in health care now and into the future. With that, I'll pause to open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instruction] Thank you. And we'll first go to Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cherny: Good morning. And thanks so much for the question. So I just want to dive a little bit more into Medical. Mike, as you think about the pathway forward on the Medical side, clearly, I think everyone on this call is probably piecing together the various different data points we're getting across the whole host of utilization [ph] driven companies. How do you think about the swing factors that would lead to the upside or downside in terms of your current outlook and how that could factor through into the potential for upside, downside to the profit growth outlook that you have?\nMike Kaufmann: Yes. Thanks for the question, Michael. First of all, we're really excited that we were able to see Med grow this year. And if you adjust for COVID next year, we're excited that we have Med growing in the mid single-digits next year too. So we feel really good about the trajectory. I would say the main driver of being better or worse than where we expected is probably COVID-19 itself and the various impacts it could have on our business. First of all, if there's either major regional or an overall large shutdowns again of elective procedures, that's going to have a very negative impact on us or if it actually recovers faster or if we swing back to some pent-up demand, which - that's not what we're projecting, that could be some upside for us. So as Jason mentioned in his, we're really expecting the average high single-digits across the year in elective procedures being down for the year, high single-digits. We expect it to start higher. Obviously, we're exiting, we think from our external information and looking at ours somewhere in the mid-teens to high-teens exiting Q4 with elective procedures being down. And so we would expect to enter this year that way and then exit FY '21 at close to pre-COVID level. So that's kind of the trajectory that we see. But again, different than that, that would be the biggest potential driver. In Medical, you always have the potential driver of tariffs, FX and commodities. We're not expecting anything big on those. But as you've seen in past year, any one of those could swing one way or the other and create upside or downside. So that's probably what I would say would be the biggest potential drivers of variability in Medical.\nKevin Moran: Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. We'll next go to Glen Santangelo with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nGlen Santangelo: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Jason, I just want to follow-up on some of the comments you made with respect to the COVID impact on the fiscal '21 guidance. I think you said you expect another $100 million of a headwind in fiscal '21 consistent with fiscal '20. Is that another $100 million or is that an incremental $100 above? I'm just trying to figure out if that's a roughly $0.25 impact you're calling out or a $0.50 impact calling out? Thank you.\nJason Hollar: Yes. Thank you for the question. It is an additional incremental headwind of a similar magnitude of what we saw in '20. And just to give you a little bit more perspective in '20, we saw that fairly well balanced between the two different segments, between Med and Pharma. In '21, because of some of the reasons Mike just talked about that were a little bit more impactful for medical. We would expect there little bit of an overweighting of the impact on Medical versus Pharma.\nGlen Santangelo: Okay. Thank you.\nMike Kaufmann: Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll next go to Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Amado on for Elizabeth. I just have another question on the Medical side. Just is there anything you've been seeing in terms of volumes on the alternate site and acute care settings, sort of as doctor visits and elective procedures start to resume a bit? Thanks.\nMike Kaufmann: Yeah. Again, I'll just emphasize what we've said here. We do expect to enter this year somewhere in the mid to high teens down on elective procedures. That's really more focused on acute than alternate sites, when we look at alternate sites, we don't have as good of data and information quite on where that's at, and it's not as big of a driver for us in Medical as the acute business is. So we do expect to enter somewhere in that mid to high teens negative versus prior year, but exit the year at pre-COVID levels with it, obviously then improving during the year.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nKevin Moran: Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll next go to go to Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nCharles Rhyee: Thanks for taking question. Hey, guys, just wanted to ask, actually, still a little bit more on Medical, but I really want to focus on the at-Home business. And obviously, this is a business you guys got into several years ago. And at times, you've spoken about it clearly with COVID. I would imagine that the Home business has really accelerated, and you kind of hear that in the home health sector as well. Can you give us a sense more of what the makeup of this business as any kind of metrics around the size of this business, now within Medical sort of the growth rates relative to the overall business? And some of the dynamics that are impacting this that might be more positive or more of a headwind because of the pandemic relative to the rest of the business, I'd imagine, maybe this has PPE requirements that are hindering you or maybe not? Just wanted to get more sense on this segment because this is like -- it could be a bigger contributor going forward? Thanks.\nMike Kaufmann: Yeah, thanks for the question. It's interesting. We did take a look at that business. We really haven't seen much impact on that business from the pandemic. Because if you think about it, it's people that are at-Home and so they don't really have a need for PPE there because they're essentially treating themselves. And so we continue to just deliver products to the home. So that's a business that continues to grow well for us. We see it as one of our strategic growth areas. We're absolutely going to continue to invest in it, and we do see care moving more and more to the home. But we really didn't see much from the pandemic affect it either negatively or positively and also be helpful. It's about a $2 billion top line business that, again, we feel great about.\nCharles Rhyee: Any kind of growth rate kind of estimates you can provide us relative to the total business?\nMike Kaufmann: That's a business that over the last several years has been growing somewhere in the high single to low double-digits, depending on the year and some of the various introductions of products, and we would expect that to be able to continue to grow like that grow forward.\nCharles Rhyee: Great. Thank a lot.\nMike Kaufmann: Yeah. Thanks, Charles.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll next go to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nLisa Gill: Thanks very much. Good morning. Mike, just curious if you have any update on the opioid side. I know the next court cases are supposed to come in October, but - and any update there? I know you increased the spend to $100 million. So I'm just curious if you're getting any closer?\nMike Kaufmann: It's always a great question. I would tell you that we continue to make progress on it while the COVID was happening. So conversations continue to happen between us and the various attorney generals in the states. But as far as anything that I can give you, I wouldn't say any major updates other than that we continue to make progress and have productive conversations. The spend of $100 million in FY '21 is essentially what we spent in FY '20. So we're not expecting any incremental additional spend in those fees. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll next go to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yeah. Hi, good morning. A couple of questions here on the Pharma segment outlook. So when you when you think about the variables that are going to impact demand, last quarter, you talked about a lot about nuclear. How is nuclear progressed in the quarter? And importantly, how do you think about the progression in the -- that's embedded in your guidance? And then when - on your slide, when you talk about brand inflation, you talk about continued less dollar contribution each year. So can you maybe give a little more color on that?\nMike Kaufmann: Sure. Let me start with Nuclear. Nuclear was the business in our P segment that was, by far, the most significantly impacted. It's a very high fixed cost business. And so as you can imagine, when your procedures go down, you still need drivers, you still need pharmacists, you still - and you have a raw material that you're getting less products off of because it is radioactive and so it's deteriorating. So that business was down significantly as we expected, but it did rebound a little bit better, just a little bit better than we expected as elective procedures started to come back a little faster. They probably track closest to elective procedures on the P side, is the Nuclear business. So we continue to believe in the long-term for that business. We continue to make investments in their theranostics opportunities with manufacturers. And we still really like that business, but it was one of the biggest tailwinds in our Pharmaceutical segment. As far as the brand component goes, really, what we're saying there is we expect inflation to be the same as it was this year, roughly. But because some of the fee-for-service arrangements and mix has changed a little bit, there'll be less of the brand margin that is contingent to inflation this year than we - in FY \u201821 than in FY \u201820, which it's already at 95% or so is at \u2013 already non-contingent. So we see that getting even a little bit higher in next higher in next year. So I'll end it there.\nRicky Goldwasser: Just, can I do a quick follow-up on the Nuclear? So if you exclude in the nuclear, because to your point, it's the most significant impact. Can you maybe talk a little bit about what type of growth you'd expect for the rest of the business in fiscal year \u201821?\nMike Kaufmann: So just to be clear, I think I might have said the word tailwind on Nuclear and I meant, headwind for Q4. So I apologize for that. I think everybody probably knew that. But as far as growth, are you talking about specifically the Nuclear or overall for the Pharma segment?\nRicky Goldwasser: Overall for the Pharma - so once you exclude that Nuclear has the most negative impact, what type of \u2013 of course, just kind of like trying to quantify and adjust for it?\nMike Kaufmann: Yeah, the \u2013 we would see the Pharma segment more tightly aligned to position office visits, are probably going to be the biggest driver. I would say that, what we've been seeing in some of the IQVIA data and various sources like that, we feel like that that's a business that we expect to be averaging down in the mid-single digits for the year. And similar to the way I described it, we think it will be down mid-single digits compared to pre-COVID early in the year, with it also exiting at pre-COVID levels at the end of our fiscal year with kind of a steady improvement over the year. Thanks for the questions. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. We'll next go to Eric Coldwell with Baird. Please go ahead.\nEric Coldwell: Thanks very much. I was hoping you could dissect some of the comments on the generics program challenges sided or headwinds sided in 4Q. Trying to get a better sense of what the total dynamics were there. Was it more about volumes due to mix impacts and health care access during the last quarter or was it more about, something specific to Cardinal, your procurement or your channel successes? Thanks very much.\nMike Kaufmann: Yeah, thank you. No, I wouldn't say there was anything unusual in there, nothing that I would call out other than COVID impact related to just the volumes. So it's hard to your comment, around whether it's driven by insurance coverage or those types of things. That piece has been kind of hard to figure out. But overall, our \u2013 the generics piece being down a little bit more in Q4 is really just related to COVID volumes.\nEric Coldwell: And Mike, could you give us a sense on what you're seeing about deflation dynamics in that market, buy side, sell side, pricing, et cetera?\nMike Kaufmann: Yeah. What we saw was really pretty consistent dynamics throughout the whole year, as we had mentioned a while back, we started to see some improvement of our Q4 of FY \u201819, and that just continued during the whole year. So it stayed improved. It bounced around up and down a little bit quarter-to-quarter, but generally, it stayed pretty consistent during the whole year. And we're just projecting that to be just a little bit better next year than this year, but relatively pretty consistent. And next year, we expect our overall generic program to be net tailwind, which it was this year, but I remember at the beginning of year we thought it would be a net headwind. So we were able to flip it around this year, and we expect it now to be a net tailwind for us in FY \u201921.\nEric Coldwell: That's helpful. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And we\u2019ll next go to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRobert Jones: Great. Thanks for the question. Mike, I know you clarified that the $100 million is incremental for next year, but I was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit about the cadence how we should think about layering that into the numbers as we think about the progression from quarter-to-quarter? And then any more comments just around where that headwind might lie in next year's numbers versus this year as we think about nuclear lower utilization, the PPE procurement? Just anything around the buckets would be helpful.\nJason Hollar: Yes, this is Jason. Let me start here. As it relates to the cadence, as Mike indicated, we see in the fourth quarter of \u201820 that we are exiting the mid to high teens for elective procedures being down and, of course, in our guidance we have high single digits down. So you would -- as an average for the year. And so you that, that will trend then from that high -- mid- to high single-digits to essentially at pre-COVID levels by the end of the year, giving you that average at the high single-digits. So yes, there's going to be some choppiness along the way, but we do anticipate that it's a relatively steady march back towards pre-COVID levels by year end. So that certainly means, from a math perspective, that we would anticipate it being front-end loaded, more of an impact front half. I also made a comment in my remarks about the cost side related to PPE being also more anticipated for the first half of the year. So for those reasons, we would expect there to be an overweighting in the first half versus second half. And as it relates to where we foresee those impacts, again, most of the \u201821 impact relative to \u201820 is going to be in more Medical. And so as you highlight areas like Nuclear, so that's going to be, again, a steady improvement. We would anticipate over the course of the year, that's tied to the physician office visits. But more of that impact in \u201820, we'll see in Medical and specifically in the products and distribution of that business and related to both the cost, as well as the underlying volume related to both the physician office visits and the elective procedures.\nRobert Jones: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And we'll next go to George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead.\nGeorge Hill: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Mike, I was wondering if you'd provide a little color on your conversations with your upstream and downstream partners around utilization, just because if you listen to some of the talk from the MCOs, they're generally expecting utilization to increase in the back half of this calendar year, where it sounds like you're still calling for a significant decrease. Would just love any extra color on the conversations you've had to help us bridge the gap? Thank you.\nMike Kaufmann: Yeah. We've been talking to outside consultants, been talking to our customers, senior execs there. You can imagine to a lot of folks to try to put together our thought process. So I believe it's really well informed, but it's hard for anyone to know for sure. But our take is that we won't see any of our businesses, Med or Pharma, back to pre-COVID levels until we're exiting our fiscal \u201821. So in that May, June time frame of next year. And again, as we said, start out on electives in the mid to high teens, working its way up. And then on physician office visits in more the mid single-digits down and working its way up. So that is based on a lot of discussions with folks. And I don't think we're hearing - there was a lot of early comments around pent-up demand and potentially going above a 100%, but as we talk to people when they think about the ability to drive throughput the physique folks willing to back to the hospitals et cetera. We are not really hearing people talking about that pent-up demand kind of coming through like we did before. So that\u2019s why we think we are just getting back to kind of pre-COVID levels.\nGeorge Hill: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll next go to Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nEric Percher: Thank you. Mike, can you help us understand the dynamics of PPE? And maybe on the contracting side, it sounds like you're definitely taking on more expense, be it bought or manufactured yourself. Is there an agreement amongst the market that pricing is not going up? Or are we seeing increases in pricing that over time will be passed on to the marketplace?\nMike Kaufmann: Yes, it's a great question. As Jason mentioned in his script, when we think about the headwind in Medical around COVID, part of it is related to actual volumes of elective procedures and part of it is related to cost increases on certain categories of PPE. So to your point, we are seeing price increases on PPE, some of them incredibly significant on key categories. And so we've seen those now for a couple of months. As you can imagine, we've been having to procure some inventory at higher cost. And one of the things that we never want to do, if we can help it, is to pass on price increases to our customers. We really just view our job as being able to drive down cost for them and help them do that. But in order to balance the ability for them to be able to actually have products to protect their workers and for us to be able to procure them, we have had to acquire some product at higher prices, and we are working with our customers to adjust our pricing to them appropriately. This is not an area where we look to profit from this. This is something where we would look to try to just maintain our margin dollars in the area. And so we want to work very collaboratively with our customers. But there has been and will be a need for at least a period of time for us to work with them to adjust some pricing in certain areas of the PPE.\nEric Percher: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll next go to Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nStephen Baxter: Hi, thanks for the question. I wanted to ask about cash flow. It's been a pretty volatile line item for you as working capital swung. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about whether 2020 was maybe more of an appropriate or normalized level for your cash flow? And also, anything you can share about your expectations for fiscal 2021 and whether we should be thinking about directionally with EPS or whether there's other factors we should keep in mind? Thanks.\nMike Kaufmann: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. And you appropriately highlight that there was some volatility within the fiscal year '20 as well as we saw in Q3 very strong cash flow, as a lot of that volume surge benefited us and we sold out of inventory and a little bit of the carryover effect then for Q4. So when you look at the two quarters together, I think they're relatively indicative of what you should expect. I think the one thing to keep in mind, I think we've been very consistent about the day of the week in which the quarter and the year ends is very important to us. And for fiscal year '20, it was more adverse compared to many other years in just in terms of how the calendar fell. So at this $2 billion level, I think it's a little bit low from a calendarization perspective. And I think next year, fiscal year \u201821 will be a little bit more normal in that regard. And all other things being equal, I'd expect it to be a little bit better. But then, of course, it all comes down to other factors that may impact the underlying cash flow.\nStephen Baxter: Thank you.\nKevin Moran: Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. We'll next go to Steve Valiquette with Barclays. Please, go ahead.\nJonathan Yong: Hi. This is Jonathan Yong on for Steve. I guess, just in relation to the mid-teens down volumes that you're seeing on the Medical side, is that what is currently being experienced kind of what you saw in July? And I guess, is there any benefit that you're building in related to an elevated flu season or the theoretical potential of any COVID vaccine? Thanks.\nMike Kaufmann: Yeah. Right now, from a flu season standpoint, we're just expecting a normal flu season. We've not built in anything different from that. As far as vaccines go, we are obviously, like everyone, very hopeful that a vaccine will become available. We're very excited that, that could happen. We know that we have the absolute capabilities to be part of the solution of getting vaccines to folks and would expect and hope that we would be part of that. But even if we were, we don't see that as a big upside in terms of earnings, if there was a vaccine to distribute. So I think from those two standpoints, that's how I would see those two. In July, you mentioned July. What we're seeing in July really is just basically on track to what we said, what are our expectations that we would enter the year, like we said, on electives in that mid-teens to high teens and then grow. And there's nothing in July that would indicate that the current assumptions that we have built into our plan aren't playing out.\nJonathan Yong: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll next go to Kevin Caliendo with UBS.\nKevin Caliendo: Hi. Thanks for taking my call. Just thinking a little bit around the cash flow question and if we subtract out the dividends and your CapEx expenditures, you don't have a lot built in for share buyback. You have $500 million of debt being repaid. The math there would suggest there's still in excess of $400 million or $500 million, maybe more to play with. If we think about sort of where the company is at this point with the cash on hand and the balance sheet being in better shape than it was a year ago, what would be the optimal use of that? Is there M&A opportunities? Is there potential that you would start to buy back stock? Can you just talk a little bit about little bit about what you might do with that any excess cash?\nJason Hollar: Sure. Yeah. This is Jason. Let me start with that. And I think your math is fairly accurate there. This does give us some flexibility and I think that's where I would start, is just recognizing that we are in a little bit more uncertain of an environment, as is typical. And so this guidance does give us a little bit more flexibility to be able to react to any type of situations that may occur. One thing you mentioned is the debt paydown of $500 million. I did highlight at least $500 million in my script. So that's an example of, we'll see how comfortable we are with that type of capacity and then determine where to go from there. We have about $1.4 billion coming due in 2022 in terms of the next tower of debt. And so, that's just something that we have in our sight than you want to think about. And then we have a little bit of repo built into our share guidance. And the exact timing and amount of that is something that we will continue to evaluate, based upon all the other factors. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question will come from Jailendra Singh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nJailendra Singh: Thanks for squeezing me in there. So when thinking about PPE, I know you've talked before about rationalizing your manufacturing footprint. Can you talk about how the increased cost in that business area and in that business area and how COVID may be impacting your thought process with respect to your overall global footprint?\nMike Kaufmann: Yeah. It's a great question. It clearly has changed our thinking a little bit on our global footprint. Many of the plans that we had planned are still moving forward because a lot of our products that we actually manufacture or sell are higher end or are type of surgical types of products. And so we're continuing down that line. But as far as our far as our PPE production, I would say we're looking at a couple of different things. One is, we're evaluating the countries from which we're sourcing to make sure that we're not overly dependent on any single country or product type. And so that we will look at that because, for example, a lot of gowns were produced in China. And going forward, we want to make sure that we have a more diverse supply chain, not only overall, but for individual items. So that's one. Two is we've been - have Many of the been and will continue to increase our own capacity for the production of certain products like mask, which is an area where we made investments and have increased our productivity. And then we will take a hard look at the US. We would love to be able to do more production in the US. However, we need to make sure that we're listening to our customers and balancing their need to have lower costs with where we're manufacturing product and what's going on there. So we're going to continue to evaluate that, but continue to ramp up. And then also, we're going to evaluate the inventory levels that we carry so that we can work with customers going forward around levels of safety stock. So those are some of the different things we're looking at in our supply chain, and we'll continue to make some tweaks as we move along.\nJailendra Singh: Great.\nMike Kaufmann: Great. Well, first of all, thanks for all the questions, and we really appreciate all of you joining us this morning. And on behalf of the entire Cardinal Health family, we hope you and your families stay safe and well, and we look forward to speaking again to you sometime soon.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's call. We do thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Mike Kaufmann",
            "content": "Thanks, Kevin. And good morning to everyone joining us. Before Jason and I discuss our results and outlook, let me share a few reflections. In my nearly 30-years as part of the Cardinal Health family, I have seen this company and this industry expand with new products, services and markets, evolve with technology, regulatory and model changes, and adapt when faced with external challenges. In each of these moments, we have demonstrated grit and agility. Now more than ever, we will lean on that legacy to navigate current challenges and perform our critical role in health care. In fiscal '20, we delivered on our commitments and demonstrated these traits. We grew operating earnings, exceeded our EPS guidance range, surpassed our enterprise cost savings target and strengthened our balance sheet, all while continuing to execute our long-term strategic priorities in a rapidly changing environment. We made strategic portfolio decisions, including divesting our remaining equity interest in naviHealth, as well as investing and partnering in the evolving growth areas of specialty, at-home and services. We achieved these results as we adapted our operations to address the unique challenges presented by COVID-19. We successfully transitioned our office employees to a remote work model, and we continuously maintained operations in all of our distribution facilities, nuclear pharmacies and global manufacturing plants. Through all of this, we kept our primary focus, delivering critical products and services to our customers and at the same time prioritizing the safety of our employees. As I look toward the coming year, I recognize that the global and industry dynamics resulting from the pandemic will continue to challenge areas of our business. I am confident that our team will continue rising to these challenges as we drive our strategic priorities forward. I'll provide some comments later about how I see these priorities evolving in fiscal '21 and beyond. But first, I'll turn to Jason to discuss the fourth quarter fiscal '20 and our outlook for fiscal '21. Jason has quickly learned our business, our strategy and our ongoing transformations across the enterprise. And on behalf of our full leadership team, we're grateful for his early contributions and partnership. Turning to our future. In fiscal '21 and beyond, we are focused on optimizing our core businesses and investing for growth. I will share how we are doing both across the segments. First, in Pharma. We're building momentum on a solid growth trajectory. We continue to enhance our infrastructure, deploying technologies across the segment to streamline our operations, improve our processes and strengthen our e-commerce platforms. We also continue to invest in generics, including our best-in-class sourcing capabilities through Red Oak as we drive all aspects of the program for sustained momentum and performance. Along with these work streams, we are fueling growth in key areas of the segment through strategic investments to diversify our capabilities and enhance the customer experience. In Specialty, we are beginning to operationalize the investment we mentioned in Q1 to establish a new distribution center outside of Nashville, Tennessee. This facility includes a state-of-the-art cold chain complex with deep frozen technology, and it enables us to drive operational efficiencies, as well as support further growth in this area of the industry. In Connected Care, we are identifying and investing in innovative digital capabilities that will improve interactions with patients, payers, pharmacies and providers. We are also investing in an expanded innovation center for theranostics opportunities in our nuclear business, which will drive longer-term profitable growth. Turning now to Medical. We have multiple initiatives underway to drive longer term growth in this segment. But first and foremost, we continue to prioritize our response to customers and their patients as we navigate the pandemic. The unprecedented and sustained increases in demand for certain product categories are creating supply challenges and cost pressures for us and for our customers that will likely negatively affect our results. In response, we have and will continue to expand our self-manufacturing capacity and sourcing capabilities. Our sourcing and marketing teams have reviewed more than 700 leads for alternative sources of PPE supply. However, only a small number of these leads have satisfied our rigorous vetting process, and we are developing sourcing relationships where economically feasible. In addition to short term pricing actions to mitigate increasing costs, our teams are also building a longer term strategy for supply assurance. Regarding our commercial strategy, although our pace has been and will continue to be affected by COVID-19, we are confident in our talent and ability to execute this important work stream. We are moving forward with an enhanced focus on supporting the needs of our diverse customer base. We believe this work stream will ramp up with the gradual increase in elective procedures as its progress is dependent upon our customers' readiness to engage in incremental product and services discussions. At the same time, we continue to optimize our end-to-end global supply chain. We are making thoughtful modifications to our logistics, planning, manufacturing and procurement initiatives, and this work is on track to deliver significant efficiencies. Also, we continue to evaluate our footprint and make selective investments in our capabilities and infrastructure. Additionally, we are continuing to grow in evolving areas like our at-Home and Services businesses through investments that further enhance our strong strategic positions. For example, in at-Home, we are investing in technology that improves our interactions with the patient and drives efficiencies to create significant value in future years. Let me now turn to the Enterprise. Our commitment to efficient operations will enable us to optimize and invest. To that end, we have multiple initiatives in-flight that will deliver savings in excess of our multiyear $500 million target, as well as technology and process improvements that drive future growth. Turning briefly to capital allocation. Our priorities of investing in the business, strengthening our balance sheet through debt paydown, and returning cash to shareholders through our differentiated dividend remain unchanged. To close, although fiscal '20 presented significant global and industry challenges, we delivered on our commitments, and our team responded with the grit that I've seen time and time again at Cardinal Health. I'd like to thank our employees, especially our frontline teams, for their dedication to our mission. What we do matters. And together, we will manage the complexities ahead, continue to deliver products and solutions to our customers and their patients, and drive growth so we can perform our essential role in health care now and into the future. With that, I'll pause to open it up for questions. Yes. Thanks for the question, Michael. First of all, we're really excited that we were able to see Med grow this year. And if you adjust for COVID next year, we're excited that we have Med growing in the mid single-digits next year too. So we feel really good about the trajectory. I would say the main driver of being better or worse than where we expected is probably COVID-19 itself and the various impacts it could have on our business. First of all, if there's either major regional or an overall large shutdowns again of elective procedures, that's going to have a very negative impact on us or if it actually recovers faster or if we swing back to some pent-up demand, which - that's not what we're projecting, that could be some upside for us. So as Jason mentioned in his, we're really expecting the average high single-digits across the year in elective procedures being down for the year, high single-digits. We expect it to start higher. Obviously, we're exiting, we think from our external information and looking at ours somewhere in the mid-teens to high-teens exiting Q4 with elective procedures being down. And so we would expect to enter this year that way and then exit FY '21 at close to pre-COVID level. So that's kind of the trajectory that we see. But again, different than that, that would be the biggest potential driver. In Medical, you always have the potential driver of tariffs, FX and commodities. We're not expecting anything big on those. But as you've seen in past year, any one of those could swing one way or the other and create upside or downside. So that's probably what I would say would be the biggest potential drivers of variability in Medical. Thanks for the question. Yeah. Again, I'll just emphasize what we've said here. We do expect to enter this year somewhere in the mid to high teens down on elective procedures. That's really more focused on acute than alternate sites, when we look at alternate sites, we don't have as good of data and information quite on where that's at, and it's not as big of a driver for us in Medical as the acute business is. So we do expect to enter somewhere in that mid to high teens negative versus prior year, but exit the year at pre-COVID levels with it, obviously then improving during the year. Yeah, thanks for the question. It's interesting. We did take a look at that business. We really haven't seen much impact on that business from the pandemic. Because if you think about it, it's people that are at-Home and so they don't really have a need for PPE there because they're essentially treating themselves. And so we continue to just deliver products to the home. So that's a business that continues to grow well for us. We see it as one of our strategic growth areas. We're absolutely going to continue to invest in it, and we do see care moving more and more to the home. But we really didn't see much from the pandemic affect it either negatively or positively and also be helpful. It's about a $2 billion top line business that, again, we feel great about. That's a business that over the last several years has been growing somewhere in the high single to low double-digits, depending on the year and some of the various introductions of products, and we would expect that to be able to continue to grow like that grow forward. Yeah. Thanks, Charles. It's always a great question. I would tell you that we continue to make progress on it while the COVID was happening. So conversations continue to happen between us and the various attorney generals in the states. But as far as anything that I can give you, I wouldn't say any major updates other than that we continue to make progress and have productive conversations. The spend of $100 million in FY '21 is essentially what we spent in FY '20. So we're not expecting any incremental additional spend in those fees. Thanks for the question. Sure. Let me start with Nuclear. Nuclear was the business in our P segment that was, by far, the most significantly impacted. It's a very high fixed cost business. And so as you can imagine, when your procedures go down, you still need drivers, you still need pharmacists, you still - and you have a raw material that you're getting less products off of because it is radioactive and so it's deteriorating. So that business was down significantly as we expected, but it did rebound a little bit better, just a little bit better than we expected as elective procedures started to come back a little faster. They probably track closest to elective procedures on the P side, is the Nuclear business. So we continue to believe in the long-term for that business. We continue to make investments in their theranostics opportunities with manufacturers. And we still really like that business, but it was one of the biggest tailwinds in our Pharmaceutical segment. As far as the brand component goes, really, what we're saying there is we expect inflation to be the same as it was this year, roughly. But because some of the fee-for-service arrangements and mix has changed a little bit, there'll be less of the brand margin that is contingent to inflation this year than we - in FY \u201821 than in FY \u201820, which it's already at 95% or so is at \u2013 already non-contingent. So we see that getting even a little bit higher in next higher in next year. So I'll end it there. So just to be clear, I think I might have said the word tailwind on Nuclear and I meant, headwind for Q4. So I apologize for that. I think everybody probably knew that. But as far as growth, are you talking about specifically the Nuclear or overall for the Pharma segment? Yeah, the \u2013 we would see the Pharma segment more tightly aligned to position office visits, are probably going to be the biggest driver. I would say that, what we've been seeing in some of the IQVIA data and various sources like that, we feel like that that's a business that we expect to be averaging down in the mid-single digits for the year. And similar to the way I described it, we think it will be down mid-single digits compared to pre-COVID early in the year, with it also exiting at pre-COVID levels at the end of our fiscal year with kind of a steady improvement over the year. Thanks for the questions. Next question? Yeah, thank you. No, I wouldn't say there was anything unusual in there, nothing that I would call out other than COVID impact related to just the volumes. So it's hard to your comment, around whether it's driven by insurance coverage or those types of things. That piece has been kind of hard to figure out. But overall, our \u2013 the generics piece being down a little bit more in Q4 is really just related to COVID volumes. Yeah. What we saw was really pretty consistent dynamics throughout the whole year, as we had mentioned a while back, we started to see some improvement of our Q4 of FY \u201819, and that just continued during the whole year. So it stayed improved. It bounced around up and down a little bit quarter-to-quarter, but generally, it stayed pretty consistent during the whole year. And we're just projecting that to be just a little bit better next year than this year, but relatively pretty consistent. And next year, we expect our overall generic program to be net tailwind, which it was this year, but I remember at the beginning of year we thought it would be a net headwind. So we were able to flip it around this year, and we expect it now to be a net tailwind for us in FY '21. Yeah. We've been talking to outside consultants, been talking to our customers, senior execs there. You can imagine to a lot of folks to try to put together our thought process. So I believe it's really well informed, but it's hard for anyone to know for sure. But our take is that we won't see any of our businesses, Med or Pharma, back to pre-COVID levels until we're exiting our fiscal \u201821. So in that May, June time frame of next year. And again, as we said, start out on electives in the mid to high teens, working its way up. And then on physician office visits in more the mid single-digits down and working its way up. So that is based on a lot of discussions with folks. And I don't think we're hearing - there was a lot of early comments around pent-up demand and potentially going above a 100%, but as we talk to people when they think about the ability to drive throughput the physique folks willing to back to the hospitals et cetera. We are not really hearing people talking about that pent-up demand kind of coming through like we did before. So that's why we think we are just getting back to kind of pre-COVID levels. Yes, it's a great question. As Jason mentioned in his script, when we think about the headwind in Medical around COVID, part of it is related to actual volumes of elective procedures and part of it is related to cost increases on certain categories of PPE. So to your point, we are seeing price increases on PPE, some of them incredibly significant on key categories. And so we've seen those now for a couple of months. As you can imagine, we've been having to procure some inventory at higher cost. And one of the things that we never want to do, if we can help it, is to pass on price increases to our customers. We really just view our job as being able to drive down cost for them and help them do that. But in order to balance the ability for them to be able to actually have products to protect their workers and for us to be able to procure them, we have had to acquire some product at higher prices, and we are working with our customers to adjust our pricing to them appropriately. This is not an area where we look to profit from this. This is something where we would look to try to just maintain our margin dollars in the area. And so we want to work very collaboratively with our customers. But there has been and will be a need for at least a period of time for us to work with them to adjust some pricing in certain areas of the PPE. Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. And you appropriately highlight that there was some volatility within the fiscal year '20 as well as we saw in Q3 very strong cash flow, as a lot of that volume surge benefited us and we sold out of inventory and a little bit of the carryover effect then for Q4. So when you look at the two quarters together, I think they're relatively indicative of what you should expect. I think the one thing to keep in mind, I think we've been very consistent about the day of the week in which the quarter and the year ends is very important to us. And for fiscal year '20, it was more adverse compared to many other years in just in terms of how the calendar fell. So at this $2 billion level, I think it's a little bit low from a calendarization perspective. And I think next year, fiscal year \u201821 will be a little bit more normal in that regard. And all other things being equal, I'd expect it to be a little bit better. But then, of course, it all comes down to other factors that may impact the underlying cash flow. Yeah. Right now, from a flu season standpoint, we're just expecting a normal flu season. We've not built in anything different from that. As far as vaccines go, we are obviously, like everyone, very hopeful that a vaccine will become available. We're very excited that, that could happen. We know that we have the absolute capabilities to be part of the solution of getting vaccines to folks and would expect and hope that we would be part of that. But even if we were, we don't see that as a big upside in terms of earnings, if there was a vaccine to distribute. So I think from those two standpoints, that's how I would see those two. In July, you mentioned July. What we're seeing in July really is just basically on track to what we said, what are our expectations that we would enter the year, like we said, on electives in that mid-teens to high teens and then grow. And there's nothing in July that would indicate that the current assumptions that we have built into our plan aren't playing out. Yeah. It's a great question. It clearly has changed our thinking a little bit on our global footprint. Many of the plans that we had planned are still moving forward because a lot of our products that we actually manufacture or sell are higher end or are type of surgical types of products. And so we're continuing down that line. But as far as our far as our PPE production, I would say we're looking at a couple of different things. One is, we're evaluating the countries from which we're sourcing to make sure that we're not overly dependent on any single country or product type. And so that we will look at that because, for example, a lot of gowns were produced in China. And going forward, we want to make sure that we have a more diverse supply chain, not only overall, but for individual items. So that's one. Two is we've been - have Many of the been and will continue to increase our own capacity for the production of certain products like mask, which is an area where we made investments and have increased our productivity. And then we will take a hard look at the US. We would love to be able to do more production in the US. However, we need to make sure that we're listening to our customers and balancing their need to have lower costs with where we're manufacturing product and what's going on there. So we're going to continue to evaluate that, but continue to ramp up. And then also, we're going to evaluate the inventory levels that we carry so that we can work with customers going forward around levels of safety stock. So those are some of the different things we're looking at in our supply chain, and we'll continue to make some tweaks as we move along. Great. Well, first of all, thanks for all the questions, and we really appreciate all of you joining us this morning. And on behalf of the entire Cardinal Health family, we hope you and your families stay safe and well, and we look forward to speaking again to you sometime soon."

            "name": "Jason Hollar",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. And good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to join you this morning on my first call since assuming the CFO role, and I look forward to engaging with you more in the future. I will provide a few comments on the fourth quarter and detail our results for the year before turning our fiscal '21 guidance and key assumptions. Starting with the quarter, we delivered better than expected EPS of $1.04, driven by improved operating performance, as well as well as lower interest and other expense. Turning to the segments. Beginning with pharma on slide 6. Revenue was flat for the quarter. As expected, in Q4, we saw reduced pharmaceutical demand as a result of the accelerated Q3 sales related to COVID-19. Pharma segment profit decreased 20% to $359 million. As anticipated, challenges related to the pandemic caused volume declines in several areas, particularly in our nuclear business and our generics program. Similar to prior quarters, segment profit also reflected a headwind from pharmaceutical distribution customer contract renewals. In Medical, Q4 revenue decreased 13% due to the adverse impact of COVID-19 related cancellation and deferral of elective procedures. This impact is primarily within products and distribution. Medical segment profit increased 24% to $120 million in the quarter, driven by cost savings initiatives and the beneficial comparison to a supplier-related charge in the prior year, partially offset by the adverse impact of COVID-19. As expected, PPE volumes for the quarter were down sequentially, but above pre-COVID-19 levels. This reflects the demand driven sellout of safety stock in the third quarter, as well as sustained increases in demand and associated global supply challenges, which we will discuss later in our remarks. Across both segments, COVID-19 was a significant headwind to our business in the fourth quarter. Although it's always difficult to approximate the impact of lost sales, we estimate COVID-19 negatively affected operating earnings by approximately $130 million despite some improvement in elective procedures and physician office visits over the course of the quarter. In Q4, we generated $240 million of operating cash flow, reflecting our continued commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet. In June, we redeemed $500 million of notes with December 2020 maturities. Additionally, we generated nearly $900 million in the quarter from the sale of investments. Now I'll transition to the full year consolidated results. In the midst of a challenging environment, we saw strong top line growth with revenue increasing 5% to $153 billion. Total company gross margin grew 1% to $6.9 billion. SG&A increased 1%, reflecting higher costs to support sales growth. Operating earnings returned to growth in fiscal '20, finishing at $2.4 billion despite a net headwind related to COVID-19 of approximately $100 million on the full year. Interest and other expense decreased 23%, primarily due to a lower debt balance and a net benefit from lower interest rates. We finished the year with $2 billion of operating cash flow. As a reminder, the day of the week in which the quarter ends affects point-in-time cash flows. We ended the year with a $2.8 billion cash balance with roughly $0.5 billion held outside the US, and nothing outstanding under our $3 billion credit facilities. From a capital allocation perspective, we took additional actions in fiscal 2020 to strengthen our position for long-term growth. We invested $375 million of CapEx back into the business, focusing on enhancing our IT infrastructure and fueling strategic growth opportunities. We paid down $1.4 billion in debt, and we returned over $900 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our effective tax rate for the year was 25%. We finished the year with earnings per share of $5.45, up more than 3% versus prior year, which exceeded our guidance range. Transitioning to the segments on slide 10. Pharma performance exceeded our expectations for the full year. Segment revenue grew 6% to $137 billion, driven by sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution customers and to a lesser extent, specialty solutions customers. Segment profit decreased 4% to $1.8 billion, reflecting the adverse impact of pharmaceutical distribution customer contract renewals, partially offset by a favorable mix of brand sales and specialty solutions grow. Importantly, although we saw lower volumes in the fourth quarter related to COVID-19, our generics program experienced overall consistent market dynamics during the year, and was a net tailwind in fiscal '20. In medical, performance was strong. Although revenue decreased 1% to $15.4 billion due to the adverse impact from COVID-19, segment profit increased 15% to $663 million. This was driven by cost savings initiatives, particularly within our global manufacturing and supply chain, and the beneficial comparison to a supplier-related charge in the prior year, partially offset by the impact of COVID-19. Across the company in fiscal '20 we demonstrated positive performance, despite significant global challenges. As these dynamics continue into fiscal '21, we are focused on building upon our operational momentum through the underlying strength and resilience of our business. Before I share our outlook for fiscal '21, let me first provide a few updates regarding the assumed COVID-19 trajectory going forward. This can be found on slide 13. After significant dialogue with both external and internal thought leaders, as well as with our upstream and downstream partners, we now believe that general recovery regarding COVID-19 will be a flatter, more elongated curve than initially anticipated. We are assuming a more significant impact from the ongoing deferral and cancellation of elective procedures and physician offices in the first half of the fiscal year, with an eventual recovery to pre COVID-19 levels, as we exit fiscal '21. On average, we believe elective procedures will be down relative to pre pandemic levels in the high single digit range and physician office visits will be down in the mid single digit range for the full year. Additionally, while we are working diligently to address global PPE supply challenges, we are assuming demand will continue to outpace available supply for the balance of fiscal '21. We are incurring higher costs, procuring certain PPE products for our customers during the pandemic, and this will be a headwind for us in fiscal '21, especially in the first half of the year. Keep in mind, our outlook is subject to considerable uncertainty, and at this time does not assume additional widespread shutdowns like we saw in the spring. We are closely monitoring key variables such as the trajectory of the virus itself, patient psychology and returning to sites of care, our customers' capacity and the overall health of the economy. Using these assumptions as our backdrop, we anticipate earnings per share in the range of $5.25 to $5.65 for fiscal '21. This range assumes an estimated incremental net headwind related to COVID-19 of a similar year-over-year magnitude as experienced in fiscal '20. We expect interest and other expense in the range of $190 million to $215 million, which reflects interest expense savings from fiscal '20 debt pay down, as well as anticipated debt pay down in fiscal '21 of at least $500 million. We are assuming a full year non-GAAP effective tax rate in the range of 24% to 26%. As a reminder, this assumption does not contemplate the potential effects of any unusual or open year audit adjustments, favorable or unfavorable, which we have historically included in our non-GAAP tax rate. Given we have multiple years of US tax audits open, we could expect greater than usual variability in our effective tax rate in the near to medium term. We anticipate dilutive shares in the range of $292 million to $296 million. And finally, we expect capital expenditures of $400 million to $450 million. For the segments, beginning with pharma on slide 15, we expect mid single-digit segment revenue growth and segment profit growth in the low single-digits. We are anticipating consistent market dynamics within our generics program and a similar contingent brand inflation rate in fiscal '21 as in fiscal '20. We also expect opioid legal costs of approximately $100 million, consistent with the prior year. In Medical although we expect lot single digit revenue growth, we expect high single-digit profit decline due to higher cost associated with procuring PPE for our customers and the impact of less elective procedures. Excluding the adverse impacts of COVID-19, we would expect Medical segment profit growth to be in the mid single digits. Mike will elaborate on our strategies to COVID-19 and our plans to continue to improve the segment's underlying performance. Before I turn the call back over to Mike, in my brief remarks last quarter, I expressed my excitement about the team, our mission and the tremendous opportunities in front of us. Those initial impressions have been further confirmed in my first few months. I am confident we can collectively navigate current and future complexities to perform our essential role in health care and realize our future opportunities. With that, let me turn it back over to Mike. Yes. Thank you for the question. It is an additional incremental headwind of a similar magnitude of what we saw in '20. And just to give you a little bit more perspective in '20, we saw that fairly well balanced between the two different segments, between Med and Pharma. In '21, because of some of the reasons Mike just talked about that were a little bit more impactful for medical. We would expect there little bit of an overweighting of the impact on Medical versus Pharma. Yes, this is Jason. Let me start here. As it relates to the cadence, as Mike indicated, we see in the fourth quarter of \u201820 that we are exiting the mid to high teens for elective procedures being down and, of course, in our guidance we have high single digits down. So you would -- as an average for the year. And so you that, that will trend then from that high -- mid- to high single-digits to essentially at pre-COVID levels by the end of the year, giving you that average at the high single-digits. So yes, there's going to be some choppiness along the way, but we do anticipate that it's a relatively steady march back towards pre-COVID levels by year end. So that certainly means, from a math perspective, that we would anticipate it being front-end loaded, more of an impact front half. I also made a comment in my remarks about the cost side related to PPE being also more anticipated for the first half of the year. So for those reasons, we would expect there to be an overweighting in the first half versus second half. And as it relates to where we foresee those impacts, again, most of the \u201821 impact relative to \u201820 is going to be in more Medical. And so as you highlight areas like Nuclear, so that's going to be, again, a steady improvement. We would anticipate over the course of the year, that's tied to the physician office visits. But more of that impact in \u201820, we'll see in Medical and specifically in the products and distribution of that business and related to both the cost, as well as the underlying volume related to both the physician office visits and the elective procedures. Sure. Yeah. This is Jason. Let me start with that. And I think your math is fairly accurate there. This does give us some flexibility and I think that's where I would start, is just recognizing that we are in a little bit more uncertain of an environment, as is typical. And so this guidance does give us a little bit more flexibility to be able to react to any type of situations that may occur. One thing you mentioned is the debt paydown of $500 million. I did highlight at least $500 million in my script. So that's an example of, we'll see how comfortable we are with that type of capacity and then determine where to go from there. We have about $1.4 billion coming due in 2022 in terms of the next tower of debt. And so, that's just something that we have in our sight than you want to think about. And then we have a little bit of repo built into our share guidance. And the exact timing and amount of that is something that we will continue to evaluate, based upon all the other factors. Next question?"

The remaining time will be available for your questions. During the Q&A, we kindly ask that you try and limit yourself to one question, so that we can try and give everyone an opportunity. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Kaufmann: Thanks, Kevin. Good morning to everyone joining us. I hope you and your families are safe and well. These past several weeks, we\u2019ve had a heightened focus on both keeping our Cardinal Health family healthy and safe and on effectively serving our customers. As one of the largest suppliers of medical and pharmaceutical products, now, more than ever, we are committed to fulfilling our mission of supporting healthcare providers and the patients they serve. Keeping our distribution and manufacturing facilities functioning smoothly remains a key priority. To do so, we have implemented measures to protect and retain our frontline employees and maintain the continuity of our operations. And early on, we proactively and successfully implemented remote work policies for office employees. As the pandemic unfolds in different ways, and on different timetables around the world, our teams across the company are adapting to new working environments and responding to industry-wide challenges with tenacity, speed, and creativity. Our global manufacturing, procurement and logistics teams are finding innovative ways to consistently produce and ship medical products. Faced with significantly increased demand for mask, gowns, and other products, our R&D, manufacturing, engineering, quality and regulatory teams have been working together to increase supply in creative ways. For example, we have invested in, retrofitted and redeployed equipment to manufacture additional surgical mask, procedure gowns and face shields in our North American facilities. We have also repurposed production lines to make items like hand sanitizers and wipes for use in our facilities. We\u2019re grateful for the opportunity to serve our communities and healthcare providers, and we are using the full scale and breadth of our distribution, sourcing and manufacturing capabilities to provide essential medical supply and pharmaceuticals to customers each day. Demand for mask and other facial protection, gowns and gloves have spiked 2 to 12 times normal levels in the last 90 days. Supporting the delivery of these critical products is priority for us and we will continue to do all we can continue to address these increases in demand. I will share more about how we will continue to navigate this challenging environment to perform our essential role in healthcare. Now, I\u2019ll turn to Dave to discuss the financials.\nDave Evans: Thanks, Mike. I\u2019d also like to recognize all of our teams for their incredible efforts serving our customers during these extraordinary times and I want to express appreciation for our suppliers and partners who\u2019ve worked diligently with us to support healthcare providers. I\u2019ve been proud to be associated with Cardinal Health and all its employees over these past nine months. Before I dive into specific results, I will share the macro level financial impact of COVID-19 as I think this will help put appropriate context around my subsequent commentary on third quarter results in FY 2020 guidance. We saw a modest net positive impact related to COVID-19 in Q3. We expect a more significant in net negative impact to both earnings and margin rate in Q4. This fourth quarter impact will be primarily due to a full quarter of reduced revenues, related to declines in elective procedures in the United States and an expected reversal of accelerated Pharmaceutical sales, which I\u2019ll discuss in a moment. Turning to our results, in Q3 we delivered earnings of $1.62 per share, an increase of 2% from the prior year. Total company revenue increased 11% versus last year to $39.2 billion, with consolidated gross margin up 7% to $1.9 billion. SG&A increased 6% to $1.2 billion. The net result was growth in consolidated operating earnings of 8% from the prior year to $719 million. Moving below operating earnings, interest and other income and expense increased 28% to $79 million. This was primarily driven by the decline in the value of our deferred compensation plan investments, partially offset by lower interest expense as we continue to reduce our long-term debt. As a reminder, changes to deferred compensation reported and other income and expense are fully offset in corporate SG&A and have no bottom line impact. We continue to place a high priority on reducing debt leverage. In Q3, we paid down approximately $90 million of long-term debt and have now paid down approximately $880 million through the first nine months of fiscal 2020. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.7%, approximately 4 percentage points higher than the prior year, which included some net favorable discrete tax items. Average diluted shares outstanding were 294 million, about 5 million fewer than the prior year quarter, reflecting the $350 million accelerated share repurchase program completed in our second fiscal quarter. Moving on to cash flow, operating cash flow for the quarter was approximately $1.7 billion as we focused foremost on addressing our customer needs. Keep in mind that the timing of inventory purchases and the collections on those sales as well as the day of the week in which the quarter ends all have the potential to impact point-in-time cash flows. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.3 billion and we continue to have access to an additional $3 billion of liquidity in the form of our commercial paper program and AR securitization facility. Moving on to segment results, starting with Pharma. Segment revenue increased 12% to $35.1 billion due to sales growth from Pharmaceutical Distribution customers, and to a lesser extent, Specialty Solutions customers. Segment profit was flat at $534 million, reflecting both the strong performance of our generics program and the adverse impact of customer contract renewals. In the quarter and more specifically in March, we saw a surge in Pharmaceutical sales. We believe this was driven by accelerated purchases related to the COVID-19 pandemic and we are experiencing below-average sales early in the fourth quarter. Though not a material driver in the third quarter, activity in our Nuclear and Specialty businesses started to slow in March, as elective procedures and physician office visits began to be impacted by the virus. While we expect these activities to gradually rebound over the calendar year, the reduced activity will be more impactful to our fourth quarter, particularly in our Nuclear business which has higher margin products and a more fixed cost structure. Before closing out on Pharma, a quick note on generics. We were encouraged to see another quarter of consistent dynamics within the generics market. Recall, we first began to see this in the fourth of our fiscal 2019. If these dynamics remain consistent going forward, we don\u2019t expect a year-over-year comparison to be as beneficial. As always, factors like mix and new launches could influence quarter-to-quarter comparability. Turning now to the Medical segment, revenue increased 5% to $4.1 billion due to growth in products and distribution and Cardinal Health at-Home Solutions. Segment profit increased 15% to $178 million due to an increase in products and distribution, including benefits from global manufacturing and cost savings initiatives. In the quarter, we saw the global pandemic affect for segment in various ways: We\u2019ve seen an unprecedented increased and demand for PPE products that we both source and manufacture. Because the surge quickly outstripped inventories on-hand and available market capacity to supply new PPE, we implemented disciplined allocation procedures. This was done in collaboration with our customers to balance demand and available supply, taking into account geographic areas experiencing the greatest impacts. Due to ongoing market-wide supply constraints, we do not expect to see a similar increase in PPE-related sales in the fourth quarter despite elevated demand. We continue to maximize our internal manufacturing capacity and collaborate with our supplier partners to address this dramatic increase. Inversely, given the broader declines in elective procedures, we have seen a decrease in demand for many of our higher margin offerings by customer surgical kits, [ph] porous and legacy Patient Recovery products. As we look to Q4, I will remind you that we\u2019ll be lapping the large charge we booked in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 in the Med segment. Recall that this related to an exclusive distribution agreement with the Cordis supplier. Turning briefly to fiscal 2020 guidance, we\u2019re pleased with our performance to-date. Our underlying business fundamentals have been strong as have the momentum and progress of strategic initiatives across the company. With this performance and with only a few months of COVID-19 related impacts, at this time we are reaffirming our fiscal 2020 EPS guidance range of $5.20 to $5.40. We are also reaffirming assumptions provided last quarter for the Medical segment and corporate. We are however, making one update to our Pharma segment assumptions. Give expected Q4 COVID-related impacts; Pharma segment profits could now decline as much as mid single-digits for the year. Before handing this back to Mike, I just want to share what a privilege it\u2019s been to be a part of Cardinal Health team over these past nine months. It\u2019s through those experiences I witnessed how extraordinary this company is and how talented and committed the people are. This is a special place with an honorable mission and an enviable culture. I\u2019d like to thank the finance team for their support and patience and the full Cardinal Health family for their dedication in navigating these past nine months. I\u2019ll treasure the relationships I\u2019ve forged here for a long time to come. Finally, and most importantly, I would like to extend a very warm welcome to Jason. It\u2019s been great to have him on board and I look forward to working closely with him over the next few weeks to help make this a seamless transition. With that, let me turn it back over to Mike.\nMike Kaufmann: Thank you doesn\u2019t seem like nearly enough for all that Dave has accomplished over the last nine months. He has been a trusted advisor and a skilled CFO and his leadership has contributed significantly to our executive team and the finance organization. We appreciate his ongoing work to ensure a seamless transition with Jason Hollar who joined us on April 27th. Dave will remain with us until May 26, at which time Jason will officially assume the CFO role. Jason has been getting up to speed for the last few weeks and I already appreciate his candor and contributions. With his strong leadership background, deep financial expertise and prior experiences managing dynamic environments, he will be a true asset to our team as we navigate this pivotal time. Jason, I\u2019ll turn it to you to briefly share a few thoughts.\nJason Hollar: Thanks, Mike and thanks to Dave as well. I\u2019ve appreciated the partnership from both of you as I get up to speed. I\u2019m really excited to join the team. While Cardinal is and has been an industry leader that is essential to care, there are still tremendous opportunities in front of us. What really drew me to Cardinal Health was both the strength of the current team as well as the positive culture and values of the organization that I share. I look forward to meeting and interacting with many of you over the coming months.\nMike Kaufmann: Thanks, Jason. In my opening comments, I discussed our immediate response to the global pandemic. It\u2019s clear that the current environment presents uncertainty and although there are many variables to consider as we look ahead, I\u2019d like to highlight three areas to watch that we believe could most meaningfully affect our business. I\u2019ll then share some strategic actions we\u2019re taking to best position Cardinal Health for the future. It is important to note that each of these three areas will be affected by the trajectory of the virus itself, including its potential resurgence and manageability and the timeline for developing and distributing ways to test and treat it. This, in turn, affects when and to what extent the global environment returns to some relative normal. With that backdrop, I\u2019d like to highlight elective procedures, generics availability and pricing and the potential for changes in our ecosystem. First, elective procedures. When and how patients reenter non-emergency areas of the healthcare system, including elective medical procedures and physician office visits affects multiple areas of our business. In Med, the decline in elective procedures is causing significantly lower demand for some of the higher margin offering in our portfolio; and in Pharma, we are seeing challenges in our Nuclear business, and to a lesser extent, the physician office area of our Specialty business. Although we expect near-term headwinds in these areas, we do believe demand will eventually rebound to historical levels. It\u2019s also possible that we might see a surge in some areas related to pent-up demand. We are doing everything we can to remain prepared to meet this demand and we will continue to best position these businesses for the future. Second, generics availability and pricing. Our sourcing teams and our partners at Red Oak are working directly with suppliers to understand any potential disruptions and resulting changes in pricing that could emerge. Things like potential export restrictions or the impact of the virus on manufacturing capabilities in key countries may affect the availability of finished goods or raw materials. Although we\u2019ve seen some temporary spikes in demand for certain products, the team has partnered well with both customers and suppliers to help mitigate these disruptions. Red Oak\u2019s strengths in data and analytics as well as its visibility in understanding of the supply chain are key capabilities that we will utilize during this time of rapid change. Third, potential changes in our ecosystem. Clearly, the coronavirus has changed the way we and all companies are currently operating and will operate in the future. We are monitoring the economic conditions, changes, shifts and various timetables for recovery for the participants in the healthcare ecosystem, including, but not limited to, suppliers, customers and the patients they serve. I\u2019ll discuss how we are adjusting our strategies to best position ourselves in light of these potential changes in just a moment. These are just three of the many areas we are monitoring. In response to these shifting dynamics, we have taken strategic actions across the company to partner, adapt and invest. Let me briefly touch on each of these and share how we are leveraging our scale and heritage to better serve the healthcare system and into the future. First, we\u2019re partnering to address unprecedented demand as much as possible. Surges in demand have challenged the underlying supply in the marketplace and we have worked with partners across the supply chain to help identify alternative sources of supply. We are even partnering with non-traditional healthcare companies to develop creative, safe solutions to increase production of critical products. We\u2019re also collaborating with innovative companies like Patel, one of the largest private, non-profit research and development organizations in the world. Their teams received FDA approval for collecting, decontaminating, and returning N95 respirator masks to healthcare personnel in the US and we are working with them to provide an end-to-end solution. We will continue to partner and identify additional collaborative opportunities which will be critical as we collectively navigate this pandemic. Second, we\u2019re remaining and flexible and adaptable. COVID-19 will have long-lasting and broad-reaching implications and we are thinking about how to modify our strategies accordingly. For example, we recognize that our sales team plays a critical role in supporting our customers and we recognize there could be changes to how these teams will interact with customers going forward. For that reason, across the company, we are evaluating how to use our capabilities, talent and technologies in new ways. In Med, we will focus on furthering our commercial initiatives, optimizing our supply chain and identifying product development opportunities. In Pharma, we are committed to enhancing our customer engagement experience as well as supporting our customers with new offerings and helping them innovate through this time of change. Finally, we\u2019re continuing to invest in our business for the long-term. These significant investments will be focused on our IT infrastructure, including our customer ordering platforms, key businesses such as at-Home and Specialty and our employees to name a few. For these and other investments throughout the company, we are utilizing portions of the savings generated through our ongoing cost optimization efforts. We remain on track to deliver on our savings goals for fiscal 2020 and beyond. Now, let me shift gears and discuss capital allocation. We remain committed to a disciplined and balanced capital allocation approach that prioritizes reinvesting in the business, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders in the form of a dividend. Capital expenditures remain a critical priority going forward, so we expect to annually spend at least what we have in prior years. Further, we remain committed to improving our balance sheet through further deleveraging. As Dave mentioned, we\u2019re on track to reduce outstanding long-term debt by at least $1 billion in fiscal 2020. With respect to the dividend, our board of directors recently approved a 1% increase. Finally, going forward, we will continue to evaluate M&A and share repurchases. But in the near-term, our other capital allocation priorities take precedence. To close, we are focused on supporting the healthcare system now and into the future. We play a critical role in helping our customers combat many of the challenges this pandemic has presented. Simultaneously, we are maintaining a strategic focus on positioning ourselves for the future. Finally, I\u2019d like to reiterate my gratitude for our employees as well as for our customers and partners across the industry. It is a privilege, now more than ever, to be essential to care. With that, I\u2019ll now pause to open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Michael Cherny with Bank of America.\nMichael Cherny: Good morning and thanks for all the color so far. I just want to dive a little bit more into some of the 4Q dynamics. Mike, in particular, the reduction in the Pharma outlook for the next quarter. Is there any way to characterize or frame how much of this is tied to expectations or what you saw relative to pull-through perspective? And then as you think about 4Q, mid single-digits can be a wide range. Within mid single-digits, how do you think about what has to happen in the business qualitatively to get to the varying different degrees of where you fall out for mid single-digit performance for the year?\nDave Evans: So Michael, this is Dave. Why don\u2019t I start and then Mike can add more of the kind of the qualitative color to your question. With respect to the fourth quarter, I think the way you need to think of it on a year-over-year basis is that this slowdown in elective procedures is impacting our Pharma business in the form of our Nuclear business, which tends to be our higher margin product lines with higher fixed costs. So the Nuclear business itself is the biggest impact year-over-year. Recall on a year-over-year basis, we have the ongoing headwind of the contract renewals as well. So those are a couple of the biggest drivers that you find year-over-year. Now, offsetting that is the continued stability in the generics market dynamic, though a much smaller number. But, yeah, I would say that\u2019s probably the biggest tailwind. So, year-over-year, it\u2019s elective procedures, the contract renewals, marginally offset by the generic program\u2019s dynamic. So, Mike, do you want to provide more color on that then?\nMike Kaufmann: Yeah. I think the only thing I would add, Michael, is that our Nuclear business, we feel really good about over the mid-to-long-term. It\u2019s a business that we remain committed to and I know that probably is a surprise to a lot of folks that it\u2019s a headwind because we don\u2019t talk about it a lot. It\u2019s been a business that\u2019s been growing, but it has seen a significant reduction in it\u2019s \u2013 the procedures in its marketplace. So it\u2019s seen a significant reduction and we thought long and hard about it, but we feel really good about our positioning there. And so we\u2019re doing everything we can to maintain the cost or to manage the costs as effectively as we can. But these tend to be more technical jobs that are hard to replace and we don\u2019t want to put ourselves in a position that when it bounces back that we\u2019re not ready to go. And so that\u2019s why we have decided to invest in that business, take some short-term pain. As Dave said, we expect actually Nuclear to be the biggest negative driver in Q4, even bigger than customer contract renewals but we want to be prepared for that business to rebound, which we believe it will be.\nKevin Moran: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Glen Santangelo with Guggenheim.\nGlen Santangelo: Oh, yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Hey, Mike, in your prepared remarks, you sort of called three areas that you were monitoring closely and I was just kind of curious to maybe follow-up on two other things that you all talked about. The first was on the generic pricing trends. And secondly, I think on the Medical side, you said that there\u2019s an expectation that the recent above-average demand may not be sustainable. So I was just curious if you can comment on those two areas? Thanks very much.\nMike Kaufmann: Sure. Thanks for the question. Yeah, in the generics area of availability and pricing, we look at \u2013 Q3, there were some early challenges but our team at Red Oak did a fantastic job on the generics side, making sure understanding where we thought those supply disruptions might be, adding some new vendors to the program, buying some inventory ahead of the surge. And we actually managed it really well. And so far we\u2019re seeing that in Q4, but it\u2019s always hard to know right now with this COVID, where it might be re-surge, where we might see some export restrictions in certain countries, where certain manufacturing or raw materials might have challenges that could create either availability issues that might cause price increases or raw material increases that might create some price increases. So at this point in time, I\u2019m not saying that we\u2019re calling out anything different than what we\u2019ve seen generally, but it\u2019s something we want to keep an eye on because there\u2019s just this added situation with COVID-19 that we think could have an impact either in Q4 or possibly going forward in Q1. So we\u2019re just going to keep our eye on it and we\u2019ll be ready to react accordingly. And if we do see price increases, obviously our goal would be able to at least keep our margin per unit similar going forward. On the Medical side, when it comes to the PPE, the really biggest thing to think about is that we work through our safety stock. That\u2019s probably the one thing that people to probably connect is that in Q3 we saw significant surge, but we were able to essentially meet the demand of the surge because we had safety stock. By early in our Q4, we had blown through that safety stock, and so now we\u2019re really only able to supply what we\u2019re able to get in replenishment. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing that our PPE sales, we do not expect to see them to be the same as we saw in the surge in Q3, that, again, we had a safety stock to work ourself through.\nKevin Moran: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.\nGeorge Hill: Yeah. Good morning, guys and thanks for taking the questions. I guess, Mike, given all the color that you\u2019ve provided about the Med-Surg business, I\u2019m surprised the guidance there isn\u2019t changing as much. I guess could you talk about the puts-and-takes when I think I guess about like the regular way medical supplies business versus like the [ph] Suramed business. And I guess, can you talk about I guess more what\u2019s going on inside the segment and kind of how it relates to the guidance not coming down, I kind of expect a significant guidance change to Q4?\nMike Kaufmann: Yeah. Thanks for the question. A couple of things. Remember, we have two really big things that are the drivers for us when it comes to Medical from the positive side, and number one is going to be the year-over-year benefit of not having that charge that we had last year. So that would be number one. And then number two is going to be our cost initiatives. We\u2019ve been really, really getting after when it comes to looking at both our manufacturing, distribution and overall cost in the Medical segment. So those two are going to be the two really big positive drivers. We\u2019re also going to see strong performance in our at-Home business, our Services business. And as you can imagine, our Lab Distribution business, which we don\u2019t talk about a lot generally has had increased volumes too. And so we\u2019re seeing strong performances from the businesses. Clearly, the negative is we\u2019re getting hit very hard on elective procedures. And so our higher margin product businesses are the biggest negative driver. But I think the piece that is the key here is the excellent work that we\u2019re doing on the cost side and the performance of some of what might be considered our smaller business in the Medical segment.\nKevin Moran: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.\nRobert Jones: Great. Thanks for the questions. I guess just, Mike, going back to the Pharma segment; I wanted to just understand the guidance there a little bit better. I know it\u2019s probably been several years since you\u2019ve quantified the Nuclear business, but it sounds like that sounds like that\u2019s kind of a standout as far as the downdraft you expect to see next quarter. So I was wondering if you could give any context around the size of that business today versus probably several years ago when we probably had a clearer sign of the size of that business? And then I guess just the one other question is, the assumption on the core business, the kind of small molecule specialty channels, is the assumption that what you\u2019re seeing kind of late in the quarter, early this quarter, just kind of run rated through 4Q or is there a little bit more complexity around how you\u2019re thinking about forecasting the core business? Thanks.\nMike Kaufmann: Yes. So from a core business standpoint, what we saw was a surge in our Q3. I think you can see that through a lot of the data out there. As Dave mentioned in his script, we saw a surge in Q3 which led to upside in our Pharma business in Q3 and we\u2019ve seen the reversal of that already through April. So if you probably add the two quarters together, our assumption is that Pharma would be relatively consistent from an overall sales growth standpoint. Again, unless we see some types of surges again in this quarter that we\u2019re not necessarily anticipating, but the surge in Q3 we see reversing in Q4 on Pharma. So that\u2019s the big \u2013 really biggest driver between Q3 and Q4 when it comes to overall Pharma. We did see some and expect to see some decline in Q4 on our Specialty business because doctors\u2019 visits are down. And when you look at both oncology, in rheumatology, nephrology, you are seeing more office visit decreases in some of the non-oncology areas where we\u2019re strong. So we expect to see a little bit of that. Specifically, as it relates to Nuclear, it\u2019s about a $900 million top line business that\u2019s been growing each of the last couple of years. Ever since we had the couple of year period where there was a significant reduction in the procedures done in that business, we\u2019ve seen some consistent growth. And so what we\u2019re seeing, as Dave mentioned, this is a high fixed cost business. And so when you see the procedures decline as dramatically as we did and you have a high fixed cost, we\u2019re seeing a significant impact to the bottom line of the Nuclear business. And to try to give it some size because we\u2019re not going to get into specific details on it, but to give it some size, we expected in Q4 to be the number one negative year-over-year driver, even larger than customer contract renewals. Now, again that\u2019s an estimate at this point in time. But right now we are expecting that business to have a larger negative year-over-year impact but again, we feel good about it for the mid- to long-term. So we remain committed to it. And as we start to see electives ramp up, we\u2019re going to be ready to go to take advantage of that.\nKevin Moran: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS.\nKevin Caliendo: Hi. Thanks for taking my call. I want to ask about generics a little bit. I think you said that the generics have been improving since Q4 of last year and thus the comps will get incrementally harder. Can you talk \u2013 can you give us a little more detail on what\u2019s happening in that marketplace? Is it that the deflation is moderating? Are the spreads tightening a little bit? What do you expect going forward with regards to the generics business?\nMike Kaufmann: Yeah. Generics, as I\u2019ve said, is one of the three key areas we\u2019re keeping our eyes on because it\u2019s an area that with COVID-19, could see impacts related to raw material changes in cost, export restrictions, manufacturing facilities may or may not be affected. So there\u2019s a lot of potential dynamics that we have to keep our eye on. But as you know, our generics program really has four components, which is the cost side which is generally managed by Red Oak and we continue to see very strong performance by that team; the sell price side that we talked about and again we\u2019ve invested a lot of capabilities into our pricing and analytics team, because our overall goal is to maintain that margin per unit which is really the key, which as we said before, is why we went away from talking about individual components. So our goal is to maintain that margin per unit and then hopefully continue to see volume increases which we have seen and some new item launches, which we said from beginning of the year we expected those to be relatively small over these next couple of years. That\u2019s generally running about as expected. And so putting those four together, we\u2019re very pleased to say last quarter we now expect our generics program to be a net tailwind for the year versus at the beginning of the year. We thought it would be a net headwind and we still expect it to be a net tailwind for the year. Not quite as big potentially with some of the COVID impact, but we still expect it to be a net positive for the year.\nKevin Moran: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen.\nCharles Rhyee: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Mike, maybe building on that can you give us a sense on how you\u2019re thinking about \u2013 if 4Q is sort of a net negative and obviously we have Nuclear and a few other of the headwinds that you discussed. Your thoughts on how you expect things to recover in terms of volumes as we get into the back half of the calendar year? Obviously, we had a number of companies that have reported kind of giving their estimates on sort of a recovery path and in particular, some have discussed seeing more than 100% of volumes kind of in the, let\u2019s say, the fourth calendar quarter. Is this something that you are expecting as well as you project internally? And just to clarify \u2013 and just one other thing was you talked about the Cardinal at-Home. A lot of stuff is doing virtual now. Do you expect a change in overall patterns of how people see their providers in the future and does that create a great opportunity for the at-Home business? Thanks.\nMike Kaufmann: Yeah. I\u2019ll start with that then I\u2019ll go back to the other. We do feel really good about how our at-Home business is positioned. This has been a trend we\u2019ve been seeing for a while now, we\u2019ve been calling out. We think that this COVID-19 will just accelerate that trend and we really like the way we\u2019re positioned in that business. It\u2019s a business we have been investing in significantly on our interactions with the patient, how to run that business more efficiently. So we have and are expecting to have significant internal investments into that business going forward because we do believe it\u2019s going to be a significant growth area going forward. As far as the forecast goes, as you know it\u2019s our kind of way we work because we don\u2019t talk a lot about the following year until we get there and so we\u2019ll give you the color and obviously all the appropriate thoughts on fiscal year 2021 in August. But I will try to give you at least color in this elective procedures area; and on the rest of the stuff, we\u2019re going to continue to monitor. We\u2019re lucky in the sense that we have the benefit of being a June 30 year-end. We can take this next quarter, really evaluate the trends in generics, the economic health of the ecosystem with all of our customers and how are they doing and how will they hold up in the ongoing environment, and we feel really good about who we\u2019re partnered with. We tend to be partnered with the folks that are more likely to be consolidators than [ph] consolidatees, and we feel really good about that. But in the terms of elective procedures, obviously we started to see a fall-off in March. We expect our Q4 to be significantly down, both sequentially and year-over-year in terms of elective procedures. We do expect to see it get a little bit better as the quarter progresses but we do not expect an exit rate of our Q4 that would put us back with elective procedures in \u2013 back to where they were. Our point of view is that there\u2019s still a lot of work to be done. We think it\u2019s going to be definitely choppy and our current thoughts \u2013 but we\u2019re going to refine these as we go forward and get a chance to look at it as though we would not expect elective procedures to fully recover in the first half of our fiscal 2021. We would think that they would have more likely to fully recover in our second half but we\u2019ll give more color later on and we are going to continue to look at that pent-up demand component. We hope it will be there. We think it could be there but there\u2019s a lot of things that we need to look at to understand going forward. So I would tell you the biggest color is we do not expect to see a full recovery until the second half of our fiscal 2021 on elective procedures.\nKevin Moran: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Eric Percher with Nephron Research.\nEric Percher: Thank you and thanks for the efforts alongside the commentary. A question on Medical and I\u2019m thinking what you provided on Nuclear was very helpful. You mentioned some of the better performing elements. I know you\u2019ve sized at-Home at around $2 billion in the past. You mentioned Services and Lab but can you help us with the remainder of the business? And I know that Cordis and patient recovery are portions that are international, maybe walk us through any commentary you can give in terms of sizing some of the other businesses and how they\u2019ve been impacted or expected to be impacted in the coming quarter?\nMike Kaufmann: Yeah. This is again something we\u2019re going to continue to look at. But as you summarized well, we would think that our Services business, our at-Home business and our \u2013 well, those two businesses would perform the best going forward and the Lab business would perform well in Q4 based on what we saw in Q3. And the other biggest driver though for us in Q4 is though we\u2019re going to continue to get after our overall global manufacturing and supply chain. We\u2019re seeing outstanding work by the team there at making our manufacturing facilities more efficient, our distribution facilities more efficient. Now, of course, we\u2019re seeing a lot of added costs related to COVID here and there, expediting product and things like that but those guys are doing a lot of really good work. So the two biggest drivers in Medical for Q4 will be the year-over-year impact of not having the charge last year related to the Cordis exclusive distribution agreement; expenses will be number two, and then the other three smaller businesses, combined together, would be like the third largest positive driver. And then the biggest negative which is why we\u2019ll still have some challenges in Q4 is going to be related to overall elective procedures where our core businesses, with the biggest one being our products business, in our OR, our kitting, our Cordis business, those businesses are going to see significant declines and have seen significant declines related to COVID.\nDave Evans: Yeah, Eric, the Med is, it is a bit of a complex story for Q4. The way I [ph] distill it down is you have this charge from last year. That\u2019s nearly equally offset by the loss in elective surgeries this year. Then we have ongoing costs, benefits driven by global manufacturing supply chain and other initiatives. Those are being more or less offset in the fourth quarter by incremental cost of supply chain and cost to our labor force; the premiums to our frontline workers.\nMike Kaufmann: Yeah. I will emphasize one thing: We have not used this pandemic and demand for products as an opportunity expand to Medical product margins. So it\u2019s important to know that, that increase is not due to expansion, of taking opportunity to raise price or anything like that. So know that it\u2019s really what Dave and I talk about.\nKevin Moran: Next question, please\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jailendra Singh with Credit Suisse.\nJailendra Singh : Hi. Good morning. Thanks everyone. I was wondering if you guys can provide any color around if there was any margin impact in the third quarter from the shift from retail to mail channel we have seen and, additionally, once we are out of COVID-19, do you see this mix returning to pre-COVID levels or do you think this is going to be a new norm, just curious on your thoughts on the trend moving forward?\nMike Kaufmann: Yeah. It\u2019s a really interesting question. It\u2019s hard to decipher because we saw a lot of just pull-forward across all channels. There was a little bit of a shift to mail order. I wouldn\u2019t call it that we\u2019ve seen anything significant. I still feel really good how our retail independents are operating. They\u2019re competing very effectively. They\u2019ve added more deliveries those that weren\u2019t \u2013 or delivering those that are working to compete and do effective things there, they\u2019re continuing to serve their communities really well. So \u2013 and we did see some 90-day at retail shift too. So it\u2019s hard to know exactly right now. I think its going to take another couple of quarters to understand how that mix will be impacted. As we\u2019ve said in the past, mail order is a lower margin business for us. So if we do see a shift to there and we are obviously working with one of the largest mail order companies, we will see some margin erosion but we still feel really good about where our retail independents and chains are positioned. And at this point in time, we don\u2019t expect that to be a huge material driver for us in Q4 but we\u2019ll have to reevaluate that for next year after we get some more intel.\nKevin Moran: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore.\nElizabeth Anderson: Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. I noticed this obviously this is complicated by the COVID impact, but my question was around can you talk about a little \u2013 about how you\u2019ve seen the business performance in the early parts of prior economic downturns and how maybe qualitatively if you can talk about it over sort of the longer period of a recession? Thanks.\nMike Kaufmann: Yeah. It\u2019s hard to compare this to anything else. There\u2019s really been nothing else like this. But you can go back to events like 9/11, you can go back to events like the 2008 and 2009, and you can even go back to regional events, and generally what we see on both of our businesses is they rebound well. They tend to weather challenges like that incredibly well over the mid- to long-term, so you may see some temporary disruptions or changes, but generally these businesses tend to perform really well over cycles. And so we still feel that will be the case here. I this one is a little different in the sense of how much it has disrupted elective procedures. But again we do feel that those will recover and we still are evaluating whether or not we might see some surges related to pent-up demand, but we do feel good about the resilience of these businesses over the long-term.\nKevin Moran: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yeah. Hi, good morning. I have one follow-up on Nuclear and then my question. So, just that we understand on Nuclear. If we think about it, this was I think a $222 million business in the fourth quarter of last year. And in the guidance, in EBIT guidance for the Pharma segment, you lowered EBIT guidance by about $18 million to $73 million. In \u2013 I think we knew already about the contracts before, so should we assume that at $18 million to $73 million change is all Nuclear or is there anything else new that was not included in prior guidance? So that\u2019s kind of like the follow-up question. And my other question is really around just kind of like thinking about long-term fundamentals; like you talked about changes in the ecosystem, some other companies across the healthcare ecosystem are talking about potential changes to supply chain dynamics and bringing some manufacturing back to the US, whether its on the Pharma side or on the Med segment side. So just curious as to your thoughts on that dynamic? And if that were to happen, who would carry that additional cost? Is it going to be the wholesale distributor or is this going to be a cost that the channel will have to assume? Thank you.\nMike Kaufmann: Yeah. I\u2019ll let Dave start on the nuclear piece and then I\u2019ll come back and talk about the long-term fundamentals, so...\nDave Evans: Yeah. So let me just do a little housekeeping on the first question. So with respect to the Pharma fourth quarter segment, yeah, I think you kind of characterized Nuclear in broad terms that would be consistent with our expectations. There are other impacts though resulting from COVID-19. As we mentioned in the script, in the fourth quarter we do expect to see the reversal of the acceleration in the PD volume into Q3, so that will happen in Q4 and we also expect there to be a modest negative impact related to Specialty. So Specialty was a growing business year-to-date. It was growing in a healthy way. This slowdown of elective procedures is really going to negate some of that [indiscernible]. So Ricky those would be the major items characterizing our fourth quarter COVID impact.\nMike Kaufmann: Yeah. So as far as the supply chain goes, as you can imagine with COVID-19, we are evaluating our overall supply chain. We were, as you know, working through that, but with these changes we are looking at our global footprint with a new lens. We do some of our manufacturing right now for masks and certain other products in North America. We\u2019ll continue to look at that and we\u2019ve not seen any supply disruptions in those business. But it wasn\u2019t all of it. So we were sourcing globally. I\u2019m sure we will continue to be a global sourcer. We will absolutely take a look at China and how it plays in there. It\u2019s hard to believe that China won\u2019t be part of an overall global sourcing strategy going forward but the percentage of the products that are made there. And more importantly, the type of products that we make in China that we source in China, we don\u2019t have any actual factoring there. But where we source in China, we\u2019re going to take a look at that and make sure that we have the type of infrastructure that as we go forward not only in this situation but in future situations probably is more diversified and not as dependent as the US was on certain categories in China at this time. So absolutely we\u2019ll be taking a look at that. Your question around cost increases in the channel, it\u2019s hard to speak about how that will look going forward, but I will tell you, so far we\u2019ve been very transparent with our customers. They understand and have put patients first, just as we have. And for us to be able to do that, we\u2019ve had to change where we source and how we get certain PPE products and customers have been willing to work with us on those products and work with us on those higher cost. And we\u2019re going to continue to have those open and transparent conversations, continue to look at the supply chain going forward and determine what\u2019s the right and fair way to manage this situation as it goes to cost increases, either on raw materials and those types of things. Overall, over the longer-term, I\u2019m not too worried about new players in the marketplace. And with its current terms of manufacturing, I believe many of those are temporary for people that are trying to help out and just do the \u2013 feel an obligation, and that\u2019s great, and we really admire and respect the people that are doing that. I don\u2019t think many of them will stay in the business. And for those that will, that have the high-quality type of products that we\u2019re looking for, we think it could give us some opportunity to look \u2013 to continue to look at our overall number of sourcing partners and the ability to drive cost. So that is going to be a key area for us in FY 2021; is going to be managing supply chain and cost and we\u2019ll come back with more color when it\u2019s appropriate.\nKevin Moran: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan.\nLisa Gill: Thanks very much. Good morning and thanks, Mike, to everyone on the Cardinal team, helping with all this PP&E on the frontline. I just really want to understand two things: One just kind of dovetailing to what you were talking about. Do you see near-term opportunities to take cost out of your system? So, as you look at the ecosystem, you look at where your costs are today, do you see any cost-cutting opportunities? And then secondly, I just want to understand the health of your customer? Have you had any issues with collections? You talk about the fact that you believe there will be consolidation and you\u2019re well-positioned because you\u2019re with the larger players, but how about some of the smaller, independent pharmacies or smaller hospitals, are you seeing anything on the collection side?\nMike Kaufmann: Yeah, I\u2019ll let Dave talk a little bit about what we\u2019re seeing on the collection side and the balance sheet and then I\u2019ll talk about a few of the other things.\nDave Evans: Yeah. So, on the balance sheet side, collections. Lisa, we\u2019ve seen liquidity, as you saw in the third quarter is strong and we continue to see fairly consistent trends in terms of cash flow early in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re not oblivious to the fact as Mike mentioned, the economic health of our ecosystem will likely have some implications down the road. We\u2019re anticipating some. We expect those to be fairly modest in the grand scheme of things.\nMike Kaufmann: Yeah. And then, as again, I\u2019ve mentioned that as one of the three key areas so we will continue to look at that. And from a cost-cutting standpoint though, this is something that we\u2019re always doing. We\u2019re always taking a look at things and I wouldn\u2019t call it cost-cutting maybe in the sense that we\u2019re just cutting costs to cut costs. It\u2019s really been about prioritizing what\u2019s important and finding better ways to think about it. So if I think about when we announced what we\u2019re doing in finance last quarter, that wasn\u2019t a cost-cutting initiative. That was an initiative that saved a lot of money and reduced our overall cost, but it was out being more efficient, taking out \u2013 putting in the right locations, using AI, using robotic automations; all those types of things to really drive the right types of behaviors to have ongoing capabilities and use our skill sets at the highest levels of folks. So those are the types of things we\u2019re really looking for; like how do we do things smarter and take advantage of technology and efficiencies to get after cost. I will say one thing about the COVID situation, when we all get forced to work-from-home, you do find ability to prioritize what is really, really important and what is not so important when you\u2019re dealing with all of these types of things. And you\u2019ll also find a way I think to be faster than you normally would. And I\u2019ve seen our teams work at speeds that are just outstanding because there\u2019s such a deep commitment to patients and healthcare to get after things. So the ability to which we have flipped manufacturing plants, added capacity, work through different types of things, I do think we will find some additional cost-cutting opportunities through prioritization, technology and just being faster as a company.\nKevin Moran: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays.\nSteven Valiquette: Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone. I hope you\u2019re staying safe. So just regarding the comment in your prepared remarks about the masking, gown demand spiking up, just curious if you can give us a sense for just what percentage of your Medical segment profits roughly came from PPE just in the reported 3Q, just to give us some context around that? As the profits were announced eventually; and actually just speaking to that quickly, you\u2019re filing some of your acquisitions in recent years. Can you remind us about any seasonality in the profits of the Medical segment? Is there a factor that normally drives profits down sequentially in fiscal 3Q versus fiscal 2Q because that was kind of the trend the last three years or so? Thanks.\nMike Kaufmann: I\u2019ll chat briefly about it. If I miss anything, Dave, feel free to jump in here. We don\u2019t really break out the PPE as a percentage, plus you get into a lot of definitional issues around exactly what\u2019s PPE and [ph] not, but what we can tell you is that it did \u2013 we did see a little bit of a surge in Q3 on that where we had significantly increased demand, as I\u2019ve said, 2 to 12 times on some products. We did have some safety stock and so we blew through a lot of that, which drove some extra incremental. It\u2019s worth talking about. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a lot of our other higher margin. Kitting and surgical businesses are going to be more important type of product lines to us than the lower margin, lower value PPE type of items. But it was important enough to mention from that standpoint. And so I would say that as far as seasonality, flu can be a seasonality item for Medical. We have seen in the past when flu ramps up in a Q, either, Q2 or Q3; we see some increases in our Med business and in some of our sales because there tends to be some hospitalization. And usually also in Q2, Med tends to be a little bit strong as people kind of rush to get some of their year-end type of insurance procedures done and we tend to see some increase in electives in those types of procedures in Q2, which leads to a little bit stronger Q2 in general for us. So, hopefully, those are two pieces of helpful information.\nKevin Moran: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research.\nStephen Baxter: Hey, thanks for the question. Hope you\u2019re all doing well. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the Pharma margin rate in Q3? We had seen three quarters of relative stability on that line. And then this quarter, it was down a little bit more than maybe I had expected. I was hoping you could talk about the drivers impacting the comparison there? And also you might have touched on this but any insight into how the March pull-forward volumes may have impacted the margin comparison? Thanks.\nMike Kaufmann: Yeah. That margin profile gets a little complicated because there was a significant uptick in the surge in products. And so we don\u2019t \u2013 I would say this: There\u2019s nothing going on that\u2019s unusual in there. You probably just have some mix of certain generics, certain branded products that were higher and some lower because there were some shortages, some mix within generics. I wouldn\u2019t call out \u2013 there\u2019s nothing as we dug through the margin change that I would tell you tell you is some type of unique change that I would call out. I think it\u2019s just a lot of noise in the quarter because of the pull-forward and some of the dynamics of what items had extra demand on them and other items that maybe didn\u2019t. So I wouldn\u2019t call out anything unusual there.\nKevin Moran: Operator, I think we have time for one last question, please.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Eric Coldwell with Baird.\nEric Coldwell: Thanks. Thanks very much. Ricky\u2019s question and I think you started to hit on mine. It\u2019s about Medical. We\u2019ve been hearing that mature suppliers like Cardinal, with their existing customers have generally committed to GPO and customer contractual prices, whereas off-contract spot prices have spiked anywhere from as much as 15% \u2013 5% to 15% in some cases. I\u2019m just curious what is the potential to revisit contracts and pricing moving forward? I mean I think we\u2019re going to have a sustained demand spike in certain Medical items, the PPE, the swabs, et cetera. Clearly, a lot of supply chain integrity, service and access demand going forward. So I\u2019m just curious, any thoughts on ability to maybe revisit pricing and margin in certain Medical items going forward? Thanks very much.\nMike Kaufmann: Yeah. Thanks for the question. A couple of things: First and foremost, we are absolutely committed to keeping cost as low as possible for our customers and doing everything we can to help to be part of reducing the overall cost of healthcare in this country. So we\u2019re always looking at our sourcing strategies and our own expense structures in order to get after those types of things, so we can aggressively help our customers lower their cost, either by how much they \u2013 the price of the product, how they utilize it and all those types of things. So that being said, there are a lot of disruptions at this point in time. And so it\u2019s really hard to comment on what we see of the overall long-term. We continue to want to work with our customers and will. They have been great, and we\u2019re going to continue to have very transparent conversations for us at Cardinal. That\u2019s the way we like to work with our customers. We\u2019re not afraid to tell them bad news or give them information or whatever to help them understand how things are going because we think having open and transparent conversations around the supply constraints and those types of things is important and they\u2019ve been appreciative and working with us well. So we\u2019re going to continue to have those and where we\u2019re seeing challenges in certain PPE items that have super high demand. And the only way you can get extra supply is to bring in alternative suppliers and those might be at higher cost. We\u2019re going to continue to work with them. On our own products that we manufacture ourselves, we can control the cost structure. Obviously, we\u2019re going to be able to work with them a way to maintain our contract pricing and do those types of things. But as you said, in the spot market buys to be able to take care of patients, which is what everybody wants to do more than anything else, it\u2019s going to be incredibly important.\nKevin Moran: Operator?\nOperator: And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Mike Kaufmann for any additional or closing remarks.\nMike Kaufmann: Yeah. I just want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. On behalf of the entire Cardinal Health family, we hope you and your families stay safe and well, and we look forward to speaking to you again sometime soon.

            "content": "Thanks, Kevin. Good morning to everyone joining us. I hope you and your families are safe and well. These past several weeks, we've had a heightened focus on both keeping our Cardinal Health family healthy and safe and on effectively serving our customers. As one of the largest suppliers of medical and pharmaceutical products, now, more than ever, we are committed to fulfilling our mission of supporting healthcare providers and the patients they serve. Keeping our distribution and manufacturing facilities functioning smoothly remains a key priority. To do so, we have implemented measures to protect and retain our frontline employees and maintain the continuity of our operations. And early on, we proactively and successfully implemented remote work policies for office employees. As the pandemic unfolds in different ways, and on different timetables around the world, our teams across the company are adapting to new working environments and responding to industry-wide challenges with tenacity, speed, and creativity. Our global manufacturing, procurement and logistics teams are finding innovative ways to consistently produce and ship medical products. Faced with significantly increased demand for mask, gowns, and other products, our R&D, manufacturing, engineering, quality and regulatory teams have been working together to increase supply in creative ways. For example, we have invested in, retrofitted and redeployed equipment to manufacture additional surgical mask, procedure gowns and face shields in our North American facilities. We have also repurposed production lines to make items like hand sanitizers and wipes for use in our facilities. We're grateful for the opportunity to serve our communities and healthcare providers, and we are using the full scale and breadth of our distribution, sourcing and manufacturing capabilities to provide essential medical supply and pharmaceuticals to customers each day. Demand for mask and other facial protection, gowns and gloves have spiked 2 to 12 times normal levels in the last 90 days. Supporting the delivery of these critical products is priority for us and we will continue to do all we can continue to address these increases in demand. I will share more about how we will continue to navigate this challenging environment to perform our essential role in healthcare. Now, I'll turn to Dave to discuss the financials. Thank you doesn't seem like nearly enough for all that Dave has accomplished over the last nine months. He has been a trusted advisor and a skilled CFO and his leadership has contributed significantly to our executive team and the finance organization. We appreciate his ongoing work to ensure a seamless transition with Jason Hollar who joined us on April 27th. Dave will remain with us until May 26, at which time Jason will officially assume the CFO role. Jason has been getting up to speed for the last few weeks and I already appreciate his candor and contributions. With his strong leadership background, deep financial expertise and prior experiences managing dynamic environments, he will be a true asset to our team as we navigate this pivotal time. Jason, I'll turn it to you to briefly share a few thoughts. Thanks, Jason. In my opening comments, I discussed our immediate response to the global pandemic. It's clear that the current environment presents uncertainty and although there are many variables to consider as we look ahead, I'd like to highlight three areas to watch that we believe could most meaningfully affect our business. I'll then share some strategic actions we're taking to best position Cardinal Health for the future. It is important to note that each of these three areas will be affected by the trajectory of the virus itself, including its potential resurgence and manageability and the timeline for developing and distributing ways to test and treat it. This, in turn, affects when and to what extent the global environment returns to some relative normal. With that backdrop, I'd like to highlight elective procedures, generics availability and pricing and the potential for changes in our ecosystem. First, elective procedures. When and how patients reenter non-emergency areas of the healthcare system, including elective medical procedures and physician office visits affects multiple areas of our business. In Med, the decline in elective procedures is causing significantly lower demand for some of the higher margin offering in our portfolio; and in Pharma, we are seeing challenges in our Nuclear business, and to a lesser extent, the physician office area of our Specialty business. Although we expect near-term headwinds in these areas, we do believe demand will eventually rebound to historical levels. It's also possible that we might see a surge in some areas related to pent-up demand. We are doing everything we can to remain prepared to meet this demand and we will continue to best position these businesses for the future. Second, generics availability and pricing. Our sourcing teams and our partners at Red Oak are working directly with suppliers to understand any potential disruptions and resulting changes in pricing that could emerge. Things like potential export restrictions or the impact of the virus on manufacturing capabilities in key countries may affect the availability of finished goods or raw materials. Although we've seen some temporary spikes in demand for certain products, the team has partnered well with both customers and suppliers to help mitigate these disruptions. Red Oak's strengths in data and analytics as well as its visibility in understanding of the supply chain are key capabilities that we will utilize during this time of rapid change. Third, potential changes in our ecosystem. Clearly, the coronavirus has changed the way we and all companies are currently operating and will operate in the future. We are monitoring the economic conditions, changes, shifts and various timetables for recovery for the participants in the healthcare ecosystem, including, but not limited to, suppliers, customers and the patients they serve. I'll discuss how we are adjusting our strategies to best position ourselves in light of these potential changes in just a moment. These are just three of the many areas we are monitoring. In response to these shifting dynamics, we have taken strategic actions across the company to partner, adapt and invest. Let me briefly touch on each of these and share how we are leveraging our scale and heritage to better serve the healthcare system and into the future. First, we're partnering to address unprecedented demand as much as possible. Surges in demand have challenged the underlying supply in the marketplace and we have worked with partners across the supply chain to help identify alternative sources of supply. We are even partnering with non-traditional healthcare companies to develop creative, safe solutions to increase production of critical products. We're also collaborating with innovative companies like Patel, one of the largest private, non-profit research and development organizations in the world. Their teams received FDA approval for collecting, decontaminating, and returning N95 respirator masks to healthcare personnel in the US and we are working with them to provide an end-to-end solution. We will continue to partner and identify additional collaborative opportunities which will be critical as we collectively navigate this pandemic. Second, we're remaining and flexible and adaptable. COVID-19 will have long-lasting and broad-reaching implications and we are thinking about how to modify our strategies accordingly. For example, we recognize that our sales team plays a critical role in supporting our customers and we recognize there could be changes to how these teams will interact with customers going forward. For that reason, across the company, we are evaluating how to use our capabilities, talent and technologies in new ways. In Med, we will focus on furthering our commercial initiatives, optimizing our supply chain and identifying product development opportunities. In Pharma, we are committed to enhancing our customer engagement experience as well as supporting our customers with new offerings and helping them innovate through this time of change. Finally, we're continuing to invest in our business for the long-term. These significant investments will be focused on our IT infrastructure, including our customer ordering platforms, key businesses such as at-Home and Specialty and our employees to name a few. For these and other investments throughout the company, we are utilizing portions of the savings generated through our ongoing cost optimization efforts. We remain on track to deliver on our savings goals for fiscal 2020 and beyond. Now, let me shift gears and discuss capital allocation. We remain committed to a disciplined and balanced capital allocation approach that prioritizes reinvesting in the business, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders in the form of a dividend. Capital expenditures remain a critical priority going forward, so we expect to annually spend at least what we have in prior years. Further, we remain committed to improving our balance sheet through further deleveraging. As Dave mentioned, we're on track to reduce outstanding long-term debt by at least $1 billion in fiscal 2020. With respect to the dividend, our board of directors recently approved a 1% increase. Finally, going forward, we will continue to evaluate M&A and share repurchases. But in the near-term, our other capital allocation priorities take precedence. To close, we are focused on supporting the healthcare system now and into the future. We play a critical role in helping our customers combat many of the challenges this pandemic has presented. Simultaneously, we are maintaining a strategic focus on positioning ourselves for the future. Finally, I'd like to reiterate my gratitude for our employees as well as for our customers and partners across the industry. It is a privilege, now more than ever, to be essential to care. With that, I'll now pause to open it up for questions. Yeah. I think the only thing I would add, Michael, is that our Nuclear business, we feel really good about over the mid-to-long-term. It's a business that we remain committed to and I know that probably is a surprise to a lot of folks that it's a headwind because we don't talk about it a lot. It's been a business that's been growing, but it has seen a significant reduction in it's \u2013 the procedures in its marketplace. So it's seen a significant reduction and we thought long and hard about it, but we feel really good about our positioning there. And so we're doing everything we can to maintain the cost or to manage the costs as effectively as we can. But these tend to be more technical jobs that are hard to replace and we don't want to put ourselves in a position that when it bounces back that we're not ready to go. And so that's why we have decided to invest in that business, take some short-term pain. As Dave said, we expect actually Nuclear to be the biggest negative driver in Q4, even bigger than customer contract renewals but we want to be prepared for that business to rebound, which we believe it will be. Sure. Thanks for the question. Yeah, in the generics area of availability and pricing, we look at \u2013 Q3, there were some early challenges but our team at Red Oak did a fantastic job on the generics side, making sure understanding where we thought those supply disruptions might be, adding some new vendors to the program, buying some inventory ahead of the surge. And we actually managed it really well. And so far we're seeing that in Q4, but it's always hard to know right now with this COVID, where it might be re-surge, where we might see some export restrictions in certain countries, where certain manufacturing or raw materials might have challenges that could create either availability issues that might cause price increases or raw material increases that might create some price increases. So at this point in time, I'm not saying that we're calling out anything different than what we've seen generally, but it's something we want to keep an eye on because there's just this added situation with COVID-19 that we think could have an impact either in Q4 or possibly going forward in Q1. So we're just going to keep our eye on it and we'll be ready to react accordingly. And if we do see price increases, obviously our goal would be able to at least keep our margin per unit similar going forward. On the Medical side, when it comes to the PPE, the really biggest thing to think about is that we work through our safety stock. That's probably the one thing that people to probably connect is that in Q3 we saw significant surge, but we were able to essentially meet the demand of the surge because we had safety stock. By early in our Q4, we had blown through that safety stock, and so now we're really only able to supply what we're able to get in replenishment. And that's why we're seeing that our PPE sales, we do not expect to see them to be the same as we saw in the surge in Q3, that, again, we had a safety stock to work ourself through. Yeah. Thanks for the question. A couple of things. Remember, we have two really big things that are the drivers for us when it comes to Medical from the positive side, and number one is going to be the year-over-year benefit of not having that charge that we had last year. So that would be number one. And then number two is going to be our cost initiatives. We've been really, really getting after when it comes to looking at both our manufacturing, distribution and overall cost in the Medical segment. So those two are going to be the two really big positive drivers. We're also going to see strong performance in our at-Home business, our Services business. And as you can imagine, our Lab Distribution business, which we don't talk about a lot generally has had increased volumes too. And so we're seeing strong performances from the businesses. Clearly, the negative is we're getting hit very hard on elective procedures. And so our higher margin product businesses are the biggest negative driver. But I think the piece that is the key here is the excellent work that we're doing on the cost side and the performance of some of what might be considered our smaller business in the Medical segment. Yes. So from a core business standpoint, what we saw was a surge in our Q3. I think you can see that through a lot of the data out there. As Dave mentioned in his script, we saw a surge in Q3 which led to upside in our Pharma business in Q3 and we've seen the reversal of that already through April. So if you probably add the two quarters together, our assumption is that Pharma would be relatively consistent from an overall sales growth standpoint. Again, unless we see some types of surges again in this quarter that we're not necessarily anticipating, but the surge in Q3 we see reversing in Q4 on Pharma. So that's the big \u2013 really biggest driver between Q3 and Q4 when it comes to overall Pharma. We did see some and expect to see some decline in Q4 on our Specialty business because doctors' visits are down. And when you look at both oncology, in rheumatology, nephrology, you are seeing more office visit decreases in some of the non-oncology areas where we're strong. So we expect to see a little bit of that. Specifically, as it relates to Nuclear, it's about a $900 million top line business that's been growing each of the last couple of years. Ever since we had the couple of year period where there was a significant reduction in the procedures done in that business, we've seen some consistent growth. And so what we're seeing, as Dave mentioned, this is a high fixed cost business. And so when you see the procedures decline as dramatically as we did and you have a high fixed cost, we're seeing a significant impact to the bottom line of the Nuclear business. And to try to give it some size because we're not going to get into specific details on it, but to give it some size, we expected in Q4 to be the number one negative year-over-year driver, even larger than customer contract renewals. Now, again that's an estimate at this point in time. But right now we are expecting that business to have a larger negative year-over-year impact but again, we feel good about it for the mid- to long-term. So we remain committed to it. And as we start to see electives ramp up, we're going to be ready to go to take advantage of that. Yeah. Generics, as I've said, is one of the three key areas we're keeping our eyes on because it's an area that with COVID-19, could see impacts related to raw material changes in cost, export restrictions, manufacturing facilities may or may not be affected. So there's a lot of potential dynamics that we have to keep our eye on. But as you know, our generics program really has four components, which is the cost side which is generally managed by Red Oak and we continue to see very strong performance by that team; the sell price side that we talked about and again we've invested a lot of capabilities into our pricing and analytics team, because our overall goal is to maintain that margin per unit which is really the key, which as we said before, is why we went away from talking about individual components. So our goal is to maintain that margin per unit and then hopefully continue to see volume increases which we have seen and some new item launches, which we said from beginning of the year we expected those to be relatively small over these next couple of years. That's generally running about as expected. And so putting those four together, we're very pleased to say last quarter we now expect our generics program to be a net tailwind for the year versus at the beginning of the year. We thought it would be a net headwind and we still expect it to be a net tailwind for the year. Not quite as big potentially with some of the COVID impact, but we still expect it to be a net positive for the year. Yeah. I'll start with that then I'll go back to the other. We do feel really good about how our at-Home business is positioned. This has been a trend we've been seeing for a while now, we've been calling out. We think that this COVID-19 will just accelerate that trend and we really like the way we're positioned in that business. It's a business we have been investing in significantly on our interactions with the patient, how to run that business more efficiently. So we have and are expecting to have significant internal investments into that business going forward because we do believe it's going to be a significant growth area going forward. As far as the forecast goes, as you know it's our kind of way we work because we don't talk a lot about the following year until we get there and so we'll give you the color and obviously all the appropriate thoughts on fiscal year 2021 in August. But I will try to give you at least color in this elective procedures area; and on the rest of the stuff, we're going to continue to monitor. We're lucky in the sense that we have the benefit of being a June 30 year-end. We can take this next quarter, really evaluate the trends in generics, the economic health of the ecosystem with all of our customers and how are they doing and how will they hold up in the ongoing environment, and we feel really good about who we're partnered with. We tend to be partnered with the folks that are more likely to be consolidators than [ph] consolidatees, and we feel really good about that. But in the terms of elective procedures, obviously we started to see a fall-off in March. We expect our Q4 to be significantly down, both sequentially and year-over-year in terms of elective procedures. We do expect to see it get a little bit better as the quarter progresses but we do not expect an exit rate of our Q4 that would put us back with elective procedures in \u2013 back to where they were. Our point of view is that there's still a lot of work to be done. We think it's going to be definitely choppy and our current thoughts \u2013 but we're going to refine these as we go forward and get a chance to look at it as though we would not expect elective procedures to fully recover in the first half of our fiscal 2021. We would think that they would have more likely to fully recover in our second half but we'll give more color later on and we are going to continue to look at that pent-up demand component. We hope it will be there. We think it could be there but there's a lot of things that we need to look at to understand going forward. So I would tell you the biggest color is we do not expect to see a full recovery until the second half of our fiscal 2021 on elective procedures. Yeah. This is again something we're going to continue to look at. But as you summarized well, we would think that our Services business, our at-Home business and our \u2013 well, those two businesses would perform the best going forward and the Lab business would perform well in Q4 based on what we saw in Q3. And the other biggest driver though for us in Q4 is though we're going to continue to get after our overall global manufacturing and supply chain. We're seeing outstanding work by the team there at making our manufacturing facilities more efficient, our distribution facilities more efficient. Now, of course, we're seeing a lot of added costs related to COVID here and there, expediting product and things like that but those guys are doing a lot of really good work. So the two biggest drivers in Medical for Q4 will be the year-over-year impact of not having the charge last year related to the Cordis exclusive distribution agreement; expenses will be number two, and then the other three smaller businesses, combined together, would be like the third largest positive driver. And then the biggest negative which is why we'll still have some challenges in Q4 is going to be related to overall elective procedures where our core businesses, with the biggest one being our products business, in our OR, our kitting, our Cordis business, those businesses are going to see significant declines and have seen significant declines related to COVID. Yeah. I will emphasize one thing: We have not used this pandemic and demand for products as an opportunity expand to Medical product margins. So it's important to know that, that increase is not due to expansion, of taking opportunity to raise price or anything like that. So know that it's really what Dave and I talk about. Yeah. It's a really interesting question. It's hard to decipher because we saw a lot of just pull-forward across all channels. There was a little bit of a shift to mail order. I wouldn't call it that we've seen anything significant. I still feel really good how our retail independents are operating. They're competing very effectively. They've added more deliveries those that weren't \u2013 or delivering those that are working to compete and do effective things there, they're continuing to serve their communities really well. So \u2013 and we did see some 90-day at retail shift too. So it's hard to know exactly right now. I think its going to take another couple of quarters to understand how that mix will be impacted. As we've said in the past, mail order is a lower margin business for us. So if we do see a shift to there and we are obviously working with one of the largest mail order companies, we will see some margin erosion but we still feel really good about where our retail independents and chains are positioned. And at this point in time, we don't expect that to be a huge material driver for us in Q4 but we'll have to reevaluate that for next year after we get some more intel. Yeah. It's hard to compare this to anything else. There's really been nothing else like this. But you can go back to events like 9/11, you can go back to events like the 2008 and 2009, and you can even go back to regional events, and generally what we see on both of our businesses is they rebound well. They tend to weather challenges like that incredibly well over the mid- to long-term, so you may see some temporary disruptions or changes, but generally these businesses tend to perform really well over cycles. And so we still feel that will be the case here. I this one is a little different in the sense of how much it has disrupted elective procedures. But again we do feel that those will recover and we still are evaluating whether or not we might see some surges related to pent-up demand, but we do feel good about the resilience of these businesses over the long-term. Yeah. I'll let Dave start on the nuclear piece and then I'll come back and talk about the long-term fundamentals, so... Yeah. So as far as the supply chain goes, as you can imagine with COVID-19, we are evaluating our overall supply chain. We were, as you know, working through that, but with these changes we are looking at our global footprint with a new lens. We do some of our manufacturing right now for masks and certain other products in North America. We'll continue to look at that and we've not seen any supply disruptions in those business. But it wasn't all of it. So we were sourcing globally. I'm sure we will continue to be a global sourcer. We will absolutely take a look at China and how it plays in there. It's hard to believe that China won't be part of an overall global sourcing strategy going forward but the percentage of the products that are made there. And more importantly, the type of products that we make in China that we source in China, we don't have any actual factoring there. But where we source in China, we're going to take a look at that and make sure that we have the type of infrastructure that as we go forward not only in this situation but in future situations probably is more diversified and not as dependent as the US was on certain categories in China at this time. So absolutely we'll be taking a look at that. Your question around cost increases in the channel, it's hard to speak about how that will look going forward, but I will tell you, so far we've been very transparent with our customers. They understand and have put patients first, just as we have. And for us to be able to do that, we've had to change where we source and how we get certain PPE products and customers have been willing to work with us on those products and work with us on those higher cost. And we're going to continue to have those open and transparent conversations, continue to look at the supply chain going forward and determine what's the right and fair way to manage this situation as it goes to cost increases, either on raw materials and those types of things. Overall, over the longer-term, I'm not too worried about new players in the marketplace. And with its current terms of manufacturing, I believe many of those are temporary for people that are trying to help out and just do the \u2013 feel an obligation, and that's great, and we really admire and respect the people that are doing that. I don't think many of them will stay in the business. And for those that will, that have the high-quality type of products that we're looking for, we think it could give us some opportunity to look \u2013 to continue to look at our overall number of sourcing partners and the ability to drive cost. So that is going to be a key area for us in FY 2021; is going to be managing supply chain and cost and we'll come back with more color when it's appropriate. Yeah, I'll let Dave talk a little bit about what we're seeing on the collection side and the balance sheet and then I'll talk about a few of the other things. Yeah. And then, as again, I've mentioned that as one of the three key areas so we will continue to look at that. And from a cost-cutting standpoint though, this is something that we're always doing. We're always taking a look at things and I wouldn't call it cost-cutting maybe in the sense that we're just cutting costs to cut costs. It's really been about prioritizing what's important and finding better ways to think about it. So if I think about when we announced what we're doing in finance last quarter, that wasn't a cost-cutting initiative. That was an initiative that saved a lot of money and reduced our overall cost, but it was out being more efficient, taking out \u2013 putting in the right locations, using AI, using robotic automations; all those types of things to really drive the right types of behaviors to have ongoing capabilities and use our skill sets at the highest levels of folks. So those are the types of things we're really looking for; like how do we do things smarter and take advantage of technology and efficiencies to get after cost. I will say one thing about the COVID situation, when we all get forced to work-from-home, you do find ability to prioritize what is really, really important and what is not so important when you're dealing with all of these types of things. And you'll also find a way I think to be faster than you normally would. And I've seen our teams work at speeds that are just outstanding because there's such a deep commitment to patients and healthcare to get after things. So the ability to which we have flipped manufacturing plants, added capacity, work through different types of things, I do think we will find some additional cost-cutting opportunities through prioritization, technology and just being faster as a company. I'll chat briefly about it. If I miss anything, Dave, feel free to jump in here. We don't really break out the PPE as a percentage, plus you get into a lot of definitional issues around exactly what's PPE and [ph] not, but what we can tell you is that it did \u2013 we did see a little bit of a surge in Q3 on that where we had significantly increased demand, as I've said, 2 to 12 times on some products. We did have some safety stock and so we blew through a lot of that, which drove some extra incremental. It's worth talking about. I wouldn't say it's a lot of our other higher margin. Kitting and surgical businesses are going to be more important type of product lines to us than the lower margin, lower value PPE type of items. But it was important enough to mention from that standpoint. And so I would say that as far as seasonality, flu can be a seasonality item for Medical. We have seen in the past when flu ramps up in a Q, either, Q2 or Q3; we see some increases in our Med business and in some of our sales because there tends to be some hospitalization. And usually also in Q2, Med tends to be a little bit strong as people kind of rush to get some of their year-end type of insurance procedures done and we tend to see some increase in electives in those types of procedures in Q2, which leads to a little bit stronger Q2 in general for us. So, hopefully, those are two pieces of helpful information. Yeah. That margin profile gets a little complicated because there was a significant uptick in the surge in products. And so we don't \u2013 I would say this: There's nothing going on that's unusual in there. You probably just have some mix of certain generics, certain branded products that were higher and some lower because there were some shortages, some mix within generics. I wouldn't call out \u2013 there's nothing as we dug through the margin change that I would tell you tell you is some type of unique change that I would call out. I think it's just a lot of noise in the quarter because of the pull-forward and some of the dynamics of what items had extra demand on them and other items that maybe didn't. So I wouldn't call out anything unusual there. Yeah. Thanks for the question. A couple of things: First and foremost, we are absolutely committed to keeping cost as low as possible for our customers and doing everything we can to help to be part of reducing the overall cost of healthcare in this country. So we're always looking at our sourcing strategies and our own expense structures in order to get after those types of things, so we can aggressively help our customers lower their cost, either by how much they \u2013 the price of the product, how they utilize it and all those types of things. So that being said, there are a lot of disruptions at this point in time. And so it's really hard to comment on what we see of the overall long-term. We continue to want to work with our customers and will. They have been great, and we're going to continue to have very transparent conversations for us at Cardinal. That's the way we like to work with our customers. We're not afraid to tell them bad news or give them information or whatever to help them understand how things are going because we think having open and transparent conversations around the supply constraints and those types of things is important and they've been appreciative and working with us well. So we're going to continue to have those and where we're seeing challenges in certain PPE items that have super high demand. And the only way you can get extra supply is to bring in alternative suppliers and those might be at higher cost. We're going to continue to work with them. On our own products that we manufacture ourselves, we can control the cost structure. Obviously, we're going to be able to work with them a way to maintain our contract pricing and do those types of things. But as you said, in the spot market buys to be able to take care of patients, which is what everybody wants to do more than anything else, it's going to be incredibly important. Yeah. I just want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. On behalf of the entire Cardinal Health family, we hope you and your families stay safe and well, and we look forward to speaking to you again sometime soon. Take care, everybody."

            "content": "Thanks, Mike. I'd also like to recognize all of our teams for their incredible efforts serving our customers during these extraordinary times and I want to express appreciation for our suppliers and partners who've worked diligently with us to support healthcare providers. I've been proud to be associated with Cardinal Health and all its employees over these past nine months. Before I dive into specific results, I will share the macro level financial impact of COVID-19 as I think this will help put appropriate context around my subsequent commentary on third quarter results in FY 2020 guidance. We saw a modest net positive impact related to COVID-19 in Q3. We expect a more significant in net negative impact to both earnings and margin rate in Q4. This fourth quarter impact will be primarily due to a full quarter of reduced revenues, related to declines in elective procedures in the United States and an expected reversal of accelerated Pharmaceutical sales, which I'll discuss in a moment. Turning to our results, in Q3 we delivered earnings of $1.62 per share, an increase of 2% from the prior year. Total company revenue increased 11% versus last year to $39.2 billion, with consolidated gross margin up 7% to $1.9 billion. SG&A increased 6% to $1.2 billion. The net result was growth in consolidated operating earnings of 8% from the prior year to $719 million. Moving below operating earnings, interest and other income and expense increased 28% to $79 million. This was primarily driven by the decline in the value of our deferred compensation plan investments, partially offset by lower interest expense as we continue to reduce our long-term debt. As a reminder, changes to deferred compensation reported and other income and expense are fully offset in corporate SG&A and have no bottom line impact. We continue to place a high priority on reducing debt leverage. In Q3, we paid down approximately $90 million of long-term debt and have now paid down approximately $880 million through the first nine months of fiscal 2020. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.7%, approximately 4 percentage points higher than the prior year, which included some net favorable discrete tax items. Average diluted shares outstanding were 294 million, about 5 million fewer than the prior year quarter, reflecting the $350 million accelerated share repurchase program completed in our second fiscal quarter. Moving on to cash flow, operating cash flow for the quarter was approximately $1.7 billion as we focused foremost on addressing our customer needs. Keep in mind that the timing of inventory purchases and the collections on those sales as well as the day of the week in which the quarter ends all have the potential to impact point-in-time cash flows. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.3 billion and we continue to have access to an additional $3 billion of liquidity in the form of our commercial paper program and AR securitization facility. Moving on to segment results, starting with Pharma. Segment revenue increased 12% to $35.1 billion due to sales growth from Pharmaceutical Distribution customers, and to a lesser extent, Specialty Solutions customers. Segment profit was flat at $534 million, reflecting both the strong performance of our generics program and the adverse impact of customer contract renewals. In the quarter and more specifically in March, we saw a surge in Pharmaceutical sales. We believe this was driven by accelerated purchases related to the COVID-19 pandemic and we are experiencing below-average sales early in the fourth quarter. Though not a material driver in the third quarter, activity in our Nuclear and Specialty businesses started to slow in March, as elective procedures and physician office visits began to be impacted by the virus. While we expect these activities to gradually rebound over the calendar year, the reduced activity will be more impactful to our fourth quarter, particularly in our Nuclear business which has higher margin products and a more fixed cost structure. Before closing out on Pharma, a quick note on generics. We were encouraged to see another quarter of consistent dynamics within the generics market. Recall, we first began to see this in the fourth of our fiscal 2019. If these dynamics remain consistent going forward, we don't expect a year-over-year comparison to be as beneficial. As always, factors like mix and new launches could influence quarter-to-quarter comparability. Turning now to the Medical segment, revenue increased 5% to $4.1 billion due to growth in products and distribution and Cardinal Health at-Home Solutions. Segment profit increased 15% to $178 million due to an increase in products and distribution, including benefits from global manufacturing and cost savings initiatives. In the quarter, we saw the global pandemic affect for segment in various ways: We've seen an unprecedented increased and demand for PPE products that we both source and manufacture. Because the surge quickly outstripped inventories on-hand and available market capacity to supply new PPE, we implemented disciplined allocation procedures. This was done in collaboration with our customers to balance demand and available supply, taking into account geographic areas experiencing the greatest impacts. Due to ongoing market-wide supply constraints, we do not expect to see a similar increase in PPE-related sales in the fourth quarter despite elevated demand. We continue to maximize our internal manufacturing capacity and collaborate with our supplier partners to address this dramatic increase. Inversely, given the broader declines in elective procedures, we have seen a decrease in demand for many of our higher margin offerings by customer surgical kits, [ph] porous and legacy Patient Recovery products. As we look to Q4, I will remind you that we'll be lapping the large charge we booked in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 in the Med segment. Recall that this related to an exclusive distribution agreement with the Cordis supplier. Turning briefly to fiscal 2020 guidance, we're pleased with our performance to-date. Our underlying business fundamentals have been strong as have the momentum and progress of strategic initiatives across the company. With this performance and with only a few months of COVID-19 related impacts, at this time we are reaffirming our fiscal 2020 EPS guidance range of $5.20 to $5.40. We are also reaffirming assumptions provided last quarter for the Medical segment and corporate. We are however, making one update to our Pharma segment assumptions. Give expected Q4 COVID-related impacts; Pharma segment profits could now decline as much as mid single-digits for the year. Before handing this back to Mike, I just want to share what a privilege it's been to be a part of Cardinal Health team over these past nine months. It's through those experiences I witnessed how extraordinary this company is and how talented and committed the people are. This is a special place with an honorable mission and an enviable culture. I'd like to thank the finance team for their support and patience and the full Cardinal Health family for their dedication in navigating these past nine months. I'll treasure the relationships I've forged here for a long time to come. Finally, and most importantly, I would like to extend a very warm welcome to Jason. It's been great to have him on board and I look forward to working closely with him over the next few weeks to help make this a seamless transition. With that, let me turn it back over to Mike. So Michael, this is Dave. Why don't I start and then Mike can add more of the kind of the qualitative color to your question. With respect to the fourth quarter, I think the way you need to think of it on a year-over-year basis is that this slowdown in elective procedures is impacting our Pharma business in the form of our Nuclear business, which tends to be our higher margin product lines with higher fixed costs. So the Nuclear business itself is the biggest impact year-over-year. Recall on a year-over-year basis, we have the ongoing headwind of the contract renewals as well. So those are a couple of the biggest drivers that you find year-over-year. Now, offsetting that is the continued stability in the generics market dynamic, though a much smaller number. But, yeah, I would say that's probably the biggest tailwind. So, year-over-year, it's elective procedures, the contract renewals, marginally offset by the generic program's dynamic. So, Mike, do you want to provide more color on that then? Yeah, Eric, the Med is, it is a bit of a complex story for Q4. The way I [ph] distill it down is you have this charge from last year. That's nearly equally offset by the loss in elective surgeries this year. Then we have ongoing costs, benefits driven by global manufacturing supply chain and other initiatives. Those are being more or less offset in the fourth quarter by incremental cost of supply chain and cost to our labor force; the premiums to our frontline workers. Yeah. So let me just do a little housekeeping on the first question. So with respect to the Pharma fourth quarter segment, yeah, I think you kind of characterized Nuclear in broad terms that would be consistent with our expectations. There are other impacts though resulting from COVID-19. As we mentioned in the script, in the fourth quarter we do expect to see the reversal of the acceleration in the PD volume into Q3, so that will happen in Q4 and we also expect there to be a modest negative impact related to Specialty. So Specialty was a growing business year-to-date. It was growing in a healthy way. This slowdown of elective procedures is really going to negate some of that [indiscernible]. So Ricky those would be the major items characterizing our fourth quarter COVID impact. Yeah. So, on the balance sheet side, collections. Lisa, we've seen liquidity, as you saw in the third quarter is strong and we continue to see fairly consistent trends in terms of cash flow early in the fourth quarter. We're not oblivious to the fact as Mike mentioned, the economic health of our ecosystem will likely have some implications down the road. We're anticipating some. We expect those to be fairly modest in the grand scheme of things."

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Kevin Moran. Please go ahead.\nKevin Moran: Good morning and thank you for joining us as we discuss Cardinal Health\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2020 results. I am Kevin Moran, Vice President of Investor Relations and joining me today are Mike Kaufmann, our Chief Executive Officer, and Dave Evans, our interim Chief Financial Officer. You can find today\u2019s press release and presentation on the IR Section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in the statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statement slide at the beginning of our presentation for a description of these risks and uncertainties. During the discussion today, our comments including an update to our FY 2020 outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis, unless they are specifically called out as GAAP. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for all relevant periods can be found in the schedules attached to our press release. During the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question with one follow-up so that we can try and get everyone an opportunity to ask a question.  With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Kaufmann: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Before we discuss our Q2 performance and our outlook for the year, I would like to reiterate a few things we shared last Thursday regarding voluntary recalls for any level three surgical gowns and certain free source packs containing those affected gowns. The full press release and additional information regarding this issue can be found on our website. First and foremost, we apologize to our customers and their patients. We understand the gravity of this situation and are dedicated to resolving this issue as quickly as possible. Simultaneously, we are doing everything we can to prevent this from happening again. We are engaging third-party experts to conduct a comprehensive review of our quality assurance processes and business practices and we are committed to executing corrective and preventative actions. As we shared last week, related to these recalls, we recorded a $96 million charge in our Q2 GAAP results. This charge represents our best estimate of costs for the recalls, including inventory write-offs, as well as certain remediation and supply disruption costs such as cost to replace recalled products. To provide some clarity, $56 million of this is within cost of products sold and $40 million is within SG&A. This charge and any future adjustments made to it will be excluded from our non-GAAP financial results. On behalf of the entire Cardinal Health leadership team, I would like to thank our employees for their dedication and tireless effort. All of us, myself included, are focused on resolving this issue as quickly as possible for our customers and their patients. I\u2019ll now turn the call over today to walk through our Q2 results and updated fiscal 2020 outlook. And then I\u2019ll share some thoughts on our path forward.\nDave Evans: Thanks, Mike. I\u2019ll start with an overview of our performance for the second fiscal quarter and then provide an update to our fiscal 2020 guidance. In Q2, we delivered earnings of $1.52 per share, an increase of 18% from the prior year. This result exceeded our expectations and was driven by a combination of operating and non-operating activities which I will elaborate on the comments to follow. Total company revenue increased 5% versus last year to $39.7 billion and consolidated gross margin increased 2% from last year to $1.8 billion. SG&A increased 3% to $1.1 billion. This increase was driven by higher costs to support sales growth and by fluctuations in deferred compensation liabilities. These items were partially offset by the benefits of enterprise wide cost savings measures. The net result for the quarter with consolidated operating earnings of $646 million, a 1% increase from the prior year. Moving below operating earnings, interest and other income and expense decreased 48% to $51 million. This was primarily driven by the change in value of deferred compensation plan investments and lower interest expense as we continue to execute our de-leveraging plans. Of note, in the quarter, we paid down more than $700 million of long-term debt and have now paid down nearly $800 million through the first half. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25% nearly four percentage points lower than the prior year primarily due to the favorable impact of changes in jurisdictional mix. Average diluted shares outstanding were 294 million about 6 million fewer than last year. During the quarter, we completed $350 million accelerated share repurchase program initiated in Q1. We repurchased 7.3 million shares over the first two quarters and an average value of $48 per share. We now have $943 million remaining under our Board authorized share repurchase program. Moving on to cash flow. Operating cash flow for the quarter was approximately $700 million. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.7 billion, which included $788 million held outside the U.S. As a reminder, timing, in particularly the day of the week in which the quarter ends affects point in time cash flows. Moving on the segment results starting with Pharma. We were encouraged to see positive momentum across many areas of the segment. Segment revenue increased 6% to $35.7 billion, driven by growth in our Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty Solutions divisions. Segment profit increased 4% to $462 million, with our generics program being the largest driver.  As a reminder, what we refer to our \u2013 as our generics program includes sourcing, sell-side pricing, volume, and new item launches. For the first time in several quarters, our generics program reverted from a net earnings headwind to tailwind. At the same time, we continued to see strong growth in our Specialty Solutions business. Brand sales and mix also positively contribute as we manage changing dynamics to capture the value we create through our supply chain. These tailwinds were partially offset by Pharma Distribution customer contract renewals. Transitioning to Medical, revenue for the segment was flat to prior year at $4 billion. Growth in Cardinal Health at-Home was offset by a decline in products and distribution. As a reminder, products and distribution includes both Cardinal Health brand and national brand products. Overall, Cardinal Health brand volumes have lagged our expectations through the first half. While we recognize we still have progress to make. This validates the importance of our commercial initiatives which Mike will discuss in his remarks. Medical segment profit increased 4% to $195 million. This reflects the benefits of ongoing initiatives to improve our cost structure including work to optimize freight and IT relationships. These benefits were partially offset by a decline in products and distribution. Medical segment profits are now up 13% compared to fiscal 2019 on a year-to-date basis. Moving now to our full year outlook. With half the year behind us, we\u2019re raising our full year fiscal 2020 EPS guidance to the range of $5.20 to $5.40 from the prior range of $4.85 to $5.10. I\u2019ll call out a few items contributing to this increase. First, we now have additional clarity regarding external factors we mentioned last quarter that affect the enterprise, including brand inflation, the medical device tax and tariffs. Also based on the sustained improved trends in our generics program, we now expect the Pharma segment to exceed our original expectations for the full year. A few additional items to note in the Pharma segment as we look to the second half of the year. First, from a year-over-year comparison perspective, recall that it was in Q4 of last year when we started to see an improvement in the generic market dynamics that means we\u2019ll be comping more challenging performance in Q4 of this year. Second, we now expect opioid-related legal cost to be in the range of $100 million to $125 million for the year with the majority of the year-over-year increase occurring in the back half of the year. As a reminder, these expenses are recorded in our Pharma segment. Third, on brand inflation. While the January price increases from our contingent vendors fell within the range of our expectations, they continue to be a smaller dollar contribution each year. And in Medical, I\u2019ll remind you of the charge we took in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 related to quarters. This will affect our year-over-year growth rates in the second half for the segment. Regarding the rest of our corporate assumptions, we now anticipate FY 2020 interest and other income and expense in the range of $260 million to $280 million. This improvement is largely due to the favorability we\u2019ve seen thus far with our deferred compensation plan investments and the benefits of debt deleveraging that I mentioned earlier. As a reminder, we plan to reduce outstanding long-term debt by at least $1 billion in fiscal 2020. Finally, we expect diluted weighted average shares to be in the range of 293 million to 296 million for the full fiscal year. Given that we are halfway through the year, we\u2019ve decided to narrow this range. Regarding our segment assumptions, we are making one update. With the favorability I discussed, we now expect Pharmaceutical segment profit to decline low single digits. This is a significant improvement from our original expectation of a low double digit decline. With that, let me turn it back over to Mike.\nMike Kaufmann: Thanks, Dave. As we look to the remainder of this year and the next few, we will continue to focus on enhancing our established core businesses and on fueling sustained growth in evolving areas including Specialty and at-Home. In Pharma, let me start by saying we continue to be actively involved in ongoing negotiations of the terms for a global settlement and we remain committed to being part of the solution to the opioid epidemic. Overall, we have increased confidence in our work to drive growth across the Pharma segment. Our investments in our generic pricing and analytics capabilities as well as continued strong performance from Red Oak and improving market dynamics are enabling our generics program to now be a tailwind for the year rather than a headwind as we previously expected. Also, our investments in both our Specialty and Connected Care businesses enable us to capture value in the ever changing healthcare landscape. Moving to Medical. I mentioned last quarter that we had multiple initiatives in flight to enhance our commercial approach and streamline our supply chain. Our work in these areas continues. However, with the recent recalls, we are currently deploying our Medical segment teams to meet the most immediate needs of our customers and their patients. While we recognize this will slow momentum in our commercial and supply chain initiatives, we remain confident in the underlying strategies of these work streams, and we are dedicated to their success. We will provide an update on our next call. At the enterprise level, we remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation approach that prioritizes reinvesting in the business, maintaining a strong balance sheet and modestly growing our dividends. Opportunistically, we will continue to explore share repurchases and M&A. Across the company, we continue to prudently manage our cost structure. We\u2019re doing this through focusing our resources, improving our processes, and embracing new technologies that create better visibility and velocity throughout the company. Our goal is to be easier to do business with. As this new mindset takes root, we will continue to see a sustainable behavioral shift and ongoing value creation for years to come. With that, I\u2019ll now pause to open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Glen Santangelo with Guggenheim.\nGlen Santangelo: Yes, thanks and good morning. Just a quick question regarding the guidance in the Medical segment. I\u2019m kind of curious, does the recall have any implications for the outlook in the second half of the year? Because if you look through the first six months, your operating profit is already up double digits and Dave, as you sort of alluded to you have that easy comp coming in the fourth quarter from that charge last year. So by maintaining the guidance there, it kind of implies that, the operating performance would be pretty weak in the second half. And I\u2019m just kind of curious if I\u2019m looking at that correctly or if there\u2019s anything else there?\nDave Evans: Yes, Glen. This is Dave. Good question. So we \u2013 as you could see, we collected the direct costs and include those in our charge of $96 million. What we have uncertainty on, and frankly at this very early stage is, implications to second half in terms of revenue margin in any disruptions with our customers. So I would say that you\u2019ve read this fairly well and that we\u2019ve reflected some of that uncertainty in the guidance that we\u2019re providing for the second half for Med.\nGlen Santangelo: Okay. And then maybe if I could just ask a quick follow-up to Mike with respect to opioids, I think you were sort of forecasting about $85 million of expenses and now you\u2019ve taken your opioid litigation expenses up to a $100 million to $125 million. The framework\u2019s been out there for a few months. It kind of sounds like you\u2019re confident. Why the increased sort of litigation expense now? Hopefully, we\u2019ll winding the stack. Could you maybe give us an update on the timeline of maybe what we should be expecting from here?\nMike Kaufmann: Yes, thanks for the question. We are still dedicated to the framework and progress does continue. So that\u2019s a positive. But as you can imagine, these are incredibly complicated arrangements. We have to work through with 50 different states that we\u2019re working with. And so to get this over the goal line, there is a lot of work that\u2019s going to be done over the next several weeks and months to get that done. And even when it\u2019s agreed to, it\u2019s got to get papered. And then we\u2019ve got to work through implementation of the various components of it. And so when you begin to look at all of those costs and the way the spend, we believe, will ramp up. We believe that \u2013 you\u2019re right, the costs are going to go from $85 million was our original to $100 million to $125 million with a significant portion ramping up in the Q3 and even probably a little more in Q4. Next question, please.\nOperator: We will go to our next question from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.\nRobert Jones: Yes. Thanks for the questions. I guess just to stick with that topic, Mike, because obviously it\u2019s so important to Cardinal and to the group. One of your peers talked about narrowing conversations around a potential opioid settlement. You obviously sound incrementally, more positive that this is progressing. Could you maybe just give a little bit more on how many other states, maybe not specifically, but are more states and local governments and municipalities engaging at this point. I think the original framework that we had all seen obviously highlighted just four state AGs and I\u2019m just curious specifically, are you seeing more people coming to the other side of the table?\nMike Kaufmann: Yes, thanks again for the question on this important topic. As I said, we remain committed to this framework and we\u2019re very appreciative of the four AGs that took the initial lead on this. They have been working with all 50 states. We continue to get the feedback from those states and look to the various components of the details of the agreement. But it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate for me right now to try to tell you or handicap how many states are in or out. But I will tell you that the four AGs that we talked to continue to make progress and I think we all believe that this is the right thing to do for the companies and for the country to help get some relief to the people that need it, with not only the dollars we\u2019re talking about, which are important, but equally the other components which are distributing the free goods and working with them on programs to improve the overall monitoring of the opioids.\nRobert Jones: No, no, I appreciate that, Mike. And I guess just to go back to this generic program dynamic, you highlighted it\u2019s the first time in several quarters, it went from a headwind to a tailwind. You guys talked specifically about four components that I guess comprise your generic program. Could you maybe just dive a little deeper into what exactly changed to flip the generics from a headwind to a tailwind in the quarter?\nMike Kaufmann: Yes. I think a couple of things. I think first of all by far this is the item that drove the difference in our expectations for the quarter. As Dave mentioned, pretty much everything else was right there where we expected to be. Maybe a little bit better, but this was the big driver. And it\u2019s really good performance across all of the components. We\u2019re very happy with Red Oak. They continue to perform at a very high level, not only in getting after cost for us, but also just doing an excellent job on service level. We really believe we have industry-leading service levels, and that really helps lead to maintaining and growing our volumes, which is an important part of it. So while volumes were a little lighter than we had expected originally this year, due to the situation, as we mentioned, with Fred\u2019s that went bankrupt and some other customers that are winding down a few stores, we are still seeing volume growth. And then the other big factor is going to be just market dynamics. We\u2019ve seen significant improvement in the overall market dynamics on the pricing side. So when you put all of the components together \u2013 and we had a strong quarter on launches. It was really strength across all of the components that made the program over perform.\nDave Evans: Yes, just \u2013 I think, Mike, you hit out at the end there. I think we did have an earlier-than-expected launch of some new items. That was helpful for the quarter. In addition, we had a fairly favorable mix that help drive the results we saw in the second quarter.\nKevin Moran: Next question, please.\nOperator: We will go next to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yes, hi, good morning, and congrats on a very good quarter. Mike, going back to your comments on market dynamics and just improved on pricing, digging a little bit deeper into that. When we think about the pricing, are you seeing improved pricing on the sell side versus the buy side? And focusing on the buy side, China is an important source of generic API supply. Given what we\u2019re seeing there with the coronavirus, how does that impact supply \u2013 overall global supply in the marketplace? And what could be the potential implications on potential return to generic inflation? And is any of that in your second half outlook?\nMike Kaufmann: Yes. I\u2019ll start with \u2013 as far as the second half outlook goes, we basically are just taking the trends that we\u2019ve seen for the first half of the year around generics, the overall programs and kind of forecasting those out for the rest of the year. We\u2019re not projecting necessarily any improvements or inflation or anything like that. It\u2019s just really about being more confident that what we\u2019re seeing \u2013 now that we have roughly eight months of activity versus five last quarter, which just felt a little too early to call it, we feel like we\u2019ve had enough activity here that we feel good about increasing our guidance related to that. And that is clearly the biggest item. As far as some color on it, I think the important thing is, it\u2019s hard to really get focused on just the buy side or just the sell side because they work in tandem, and it\u2019s really about driving margin per unit. And what we\u2019re seeing is a much better balance between what\u2019s happening on the sell side in terms of the amount of inflation being less than historical, but also being able to then balance any decreases there with good performance at Red Oak. So that we can continue to manage our margin per unit in a way to be able to have the overall program grow. And as Dave said, the units and the overall launches helped to that, too. And so that\u2019s really how we look at it. As far as the China API, you can imagine, this is something that we monitor. Red Oak is in charge of that for us, and they do a great job of understanding where raw materials are coming from, where they\u2019re manufactured. And you\u2019re right, there are a decent amount of API manufactured over in China and some of the affected areas. We have \u2013 where we have \u2013 we\u2019ve worked with manufacturers to try to increase supplies ahead of this. I do think it\u2019s something that, based on the amount of supply and the supply chain, is something the industry should be able to work through. But it\u2019s hard to say how long this will last, and it\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to have to keep an eye on, and we will.\nKevin Moran: Next question, please.\nOperator: We will go to our next question from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.\nLisa Gill: Hi, thanks very much. Good morning. Mike, you called out Specialty as being a growth area again in the quarter. Can you just remind us the size of that business and the capabilities versus some of your peers? And then as we think about the potential for IPI and potential changes around reimbursement, can you talk about your thoughts on that? And any impact that you could see in your Specialty business?\nMike Kaufmann: Yes. Thanks for the question. Our Specialty business, the last number that we publicly gave for FY 2019 is that we finished around $19 billion in sales, and so that\u2019s where that business is. We continue to expect that business to have significant growth this year across all of its areas. It\u2019s sales into the actual downstream providers in the acute space as well as upstream services to manufacture. So we are seeing good momentum across all three areas in that business and continue to feel good about not only their quality of service to the customers, but some of the investments we\u2019re making in the businesses that we\u2019ll be able to talk about more here in the future, including a recent investment we\u2019ve made in [indiscernible] that was announced that we believe will also be an area of helping in the cell and gene area. So we continue to be excited about the specialty area. As far as it relates to IPI, I would say this; first of all, we\u2019re in favor of anything that can help reduce the cost of healthcare to the U.S. healthcare system. We know that\u2019s important. We hope and look to folks to be able to find ways to reduce costs for folks. So that\u2019s important to us. The second thing I would say is that when you think about IPI or any of these programs as folks are looking at, the impact to us, I think, is generally where it could impact us in the first order is, does it change list prices, does it mean that the way that manufacturers establish list prices, do they have to lower them, do they have to reduce their price increases? Those are the types of first order of kind of magnitude impact us that we look at. And as you and others have heard me say, I think that we as a company and as an industry have really worked well over the years in the fee-for-service model to first of all, make anything that\u2019s \u2013 the part that\u2019s dependent on deflate or inflation to be less than 5% of our overall margin rate, so that helps protect us from any impact or what folks might do with inflation rates. And secondly, the way we\u2019ve been able to demonstrate our ability to renegotiate DSAs over time as WAC prices fluctuate that we still feel very confident that any impact to list prices that we can manage through very effectively as a company and as an industry. The piece that\u2019s really important to us though is the impact to our customers.  We really look at any of this legislation with the true lens to our customers and the impact on them, and we want to make sure and have commented on past legislation that\u2019s been out there that we have to be really careful that type of legislation doesn\u2019t reduce access or reduce the ability of our customers and theirselves to be able to work with the actual patients to provide the type of care that we know that they deserve.\nLisa Gill: Thank you.\nMike Kaufmann: Thanks, Lisa.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go next to George Hill with Deutsche Bank.\nGeorge Hill: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, Mike and Dave, I\u2019d ask you guys a little bit more about the generics program contribution in the quarter. And I guess, what I\u2019m looking at is, you guys and your friends in Texas kind of highlighted big beat \u2013 you demonstrated big beats in earnings this quarter that were generics related, don\u2019t seem repeatable either in the next quarter and the balance of your fiscal years. So maybe could you provide a little bit more color on the earlier than expected launch of the new items that was highlighted and maybe the contribution in the quarter? And maybe some more commentary around what was delivered in the quarter that might seem more one-time versus what might seem repeatable on a go forward basis? I know that\u2019s a lot. Thanks.\nMike Kaufmann: Yes George, let me answer that. Look, when we talk about the four elements of what we described as a generic dynamic, those are continuation of trends that we would expect to see in Q3 and in Q4. So we expect to see year-over-year some healthy improvement in Q3. Q4 we don\u2019t expect to see the same year-over-year improvement because Q4 of last year if you go back and look at that, was a quarter \u2013 was the first quarter where we began to see the inflection this deflationary trend. And so we have a much more challenging comp in Q4. With respect to the accelerated launch of new items, that\u2019s not necessarily a one timer it\u2019s just a pull forward of something that was anticipated later in the year. So I think you can expect, which is why we called our guidance up specific to pharma, we expect to see some positive results in Q3. And then possibly today based on what we see somewhat moderation in the year-over-year comparison in Q4. Does that help answer your question, George?\nGeorge Hill: Yes, I think, you covered it clearly. Thank you.\nKevin Moran: Next question.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI.\nElizabeth Anderson: Hi good morning guys. I wish if you could talk a little bit more about some of the specialty profit drivers in the quarter and maybe more broadly beyond that is it sort of an increase in services? Is this the launch calendar? Any additional color you can provide on that would be helpful.\nMike Kaufmann: I think in specialty a lot of this just has to do with the normal growth of specialty. We\u2019re continuing to see certain drugs grow in the marketplace because of their success, particularly in the oncology space, getting new indications and just normal growth. That\u2019s a really big piece of it. Part of it is some of the uptake of some of the biosimilars here and there some of that, while they don\u2019t provide a lot more value than normal branded items and they generally act like that. There are some smaller opportunities on the earning side that earn a slightly better there that\u2019s been a piece of it. We\u2019ve seen really nice growth in our services business upstream with wins in our 3PL business, and our hub and some of our other businesses have continued to grow. So nothing unique about like large pieces of movement of business or anything. One-timers like that it\u2019s just nice solid growth with the volumes across the board.\nElizabeth Anderson: Thank you. That\u2019s helpful.\nMike Kaufmann: Next question.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research.\nStephen Baxter: Hey, thanks for the question. So based on how you size the relative components of the Pharma guidance coming into the year, it seemed like renewals are driving at least half of the high single digit to low double digit profit decline you\u2019re assuming. I assume the renewal impact hasn\u2019t changed, so the revised guidance for the low single digit percent decline would seem to indicate a decent amount of underlying growth excluding the renewals and the opioid expenses, which have now moved higher too. So just wanted to check and see whether you agree with that logic or anything has changed about the sizing of the renewals throughout the year? And therefore, whether we should be expecting segment profits to return to growth on a reported basis as we move into next year? Thanks.\nDave Evans: Steven is Dave. So I\u2019d say your assumptions are all pretty spot on. I would say though that we\u2019re really per usual practice. We\u2019re not in a position to comment on 2021 at this early date. But overall, I think, you\u2019ve got a good hand on. And I understand what we\u2019ve been articulating.\nKevin Moran: Next question.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Erin Wright with Credit Suisse.\nErin Wright: Great, thanks. Does your guidance assume any meaningful contribution from biosimilars? Do you continue to view that as sort of an opportunity for you longer term?\nMike Kaufmann: Yes, our guidance would assume any of the normal type related stuff for that. But there is nothing new \u2013 no new launches that created the increase related to biosimilars. We continue to think that that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll keep an eye on. I don\u2019t believe it will be a big driver for us in the short term because right now they act more like branded drugs and their overall margin rates are similar. There\u2019s a little bit of opportunity to make a little bit more money on some of the biosimilars, depending on programs we might be able to put in place with customers. But I would not call them a large driver of anything over \u2013 over this year over the short term. But something that we\u2019ll keep our eye on is something to be more of a midterm or longer term driver, particularly if they become interchangeable. And then I think for sure my opinion would change on their ability to be a much bigger driver for us.\nErin Wright: Okay, great. And then where are you in terms of the streamlining of your commercial and supply chain initiatives on the medical side of the business? You suggested that maybe you face a little bit of a setback here in terms of the recent recalls, but would you say you\u2019re still seeing some progress and focused on that front? And also if you could break out the recent quarter\u2019s trends specifically, that\u2019d be helpful. Thanks.\nMike Kaufmann: Yes, on Cordis, I\u2019ll just handle that real quick. Nothing really to report on Cordis outside of what our expectations are, the business is continuing to grow, we\u2019re seeing growth in our profit there and we continue to be really happy with what the team is doing there to meet or slightly exceed the expectations that we have for that business this year. But we don\u2019t see it being a driver outside of what we expected for the year one way or the other. As far as the initiatives in medical, we remain incredibly committed to both of them. There is nothing about the underlying strategies of our commercial realignment or our supply chain initiatives that at this time, I would say, make me feel any differently than we have been talking about. But as I noted particularly well then both of them, but probably a little bit even more in the commercial side. It has been slowed with the gallons recall. We have deployed some of our sales reps, as well as other people into the field to be actually located at the hospital locations, helping them manage through this challenge that is out there. And it\u2019s really important to us that we take care of our customers and our patients. So because of that it would slow down where we expect to be. So we have said and committed that our supply chain we would be \u2013 have a plan done by the end of Q2. That plan was done, but as we look at implementation of that plan we are taking into account this disruption that we\u2019re working on and just overall re-evaluating and make sure we look at the overall global supply chain to make sure there\u2019s no changes we would make based on some of the recent challenges. And then again on the commercial piece, we\u2019re on track to get the jobs hired and all that, but we do have folks deployed to customers.\nKevin Moran: Next question please.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Michael Cherny with BofA Securities.\nMichael Cherny: Good morning and thanks for all the details so far. So as you think about the opportunity, you said you have \u2013 you\u2019ve highlighted Specialty as a growth opportunity. Obviously you\u2019re performing well so far in areas of medical. How do you think about that against the backdrop of capital deployment? How do you think about areas where you think your customers are asking for you to do more? And as you \u2013 versus previous capital deployment and M&A opportunities, are there any other components or pieces of the business that you think is makes sense to beef up right now?\nMike Kaufmann: Yes, as I mentioned, we still feel really good about having several areas that we would consider our strategic growth areas. I would highlight four of them, Specialty being one of them. At home we\u2019ve talked about our connected care services business and pharma and our medical services businesses. These are all businesses we\u2019re seeing significant growth on the top line and on the bottom line. There are also businesses that are really right on trend, care moving towards the Home and the various things that go along with Specialty and the service businesses. So these are areas where we are prioritizing our capital expenditures to those areas so we can really focus on organic growth. And if there are M&A opportunities out there that would make sense, those would be the areas that you would see us focus on. Now that being said, we\u2019re going to continue to do all the right things in our core businesses to make sure we maintain and grow those. But for, what I would say, extra allocation of capital, those are going to be key areas that we\u2019re going to focus our capital expenditures on.\nKevin Moran: Yes Michael if I can add, so really, I\u2019d say we\u2019re focusing as well on partnerships in a way that probably more so than we have in the past. And when we do think about our internal capital, we\u2019re really thinking about it in four different categories. You get our maintenance capital where clearly you\u2019ve wrote initiatives like our supply chain, we\u2019re focusing on deploying capital to cost out type of projects, we\u2019re providing capital in areas where we need capacity for growth. But then we are also deploying some capital to explore new growth areas. So it\u2019s a pretty balanced approach, disciplined approach to getting a return on our CapEx.\nMichael Cherny: Okay, thanks. \nKevin Moran: Thanks Michael. Next question.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Steven Valiquette with Barclays.\nSteven Valiquette: Great, thanks. Good morning everyone. So just to follow-up a little bit out of Specialty two things I want just done real quick. First, I was a little bit surprised about the biosimilar because there actually had been a bunch of biosimilar [indiscernible] dollars of the physician channel. But that was not really a driver [indiscernible] just changes the price experience with either customers or suppliers and separating specialty pricing from traditional brand pricing, whether that may have played a role in some of the better Pharma Distribution segment result. Thanks.\nMike Kaufmann: Thanks. I think I picked them up. There was a little spotty on being able to hear, but I think I got all your pieces. So let me see if I can walk through them all. From a change in price standpoint, I\u2019ll look at it \u2013 we\u2019ve been very disciplined over several years in our pharma distribution business to make sure that we\u2019re splitting out our pricing on our Specialty so that it is priced differently than normal brand, so that we don\u2019t \u2013 so we can make a fair return on the specialty drugs and we\u2019ve continued that discipline with any new business or renewals with either, as I\u2019ve said before, specific pricing in that area to maintain appropriate profitability or some types of mix type of penalties in agreements to make sure that if their mix goes the wrong way, that the overall cost of goods adjust. So we continue to be very focused on that in the PD area. And also in the overall specialty business since there\u2019s very little generics in that space that is priced on a more individual drug standpoint. And again we remain very disciplined in that area to be careful. So I wouldn\u2019t say that pricing changes is either a \u2013 is a driver of our growth in specialty, but it\u2019s also not something that we\u2019re ignoring or I would say is a headwind from that standpoint. As far as growth in specialty overall, I would say it really comes from market growth. The market itself is growing significantly with new indications, new drug launches that the. Your question on biosimilars, to think about biosimilars, the way to think about it is when a biosimilar launches, you\u2019re either \u2013 you\u2019re not necessarily getting new volume to speak of because it either you\u2019re replacing of current branded drug with a biosimilar. So overall your volume doesn\u2019t generally go up because of a biosimilar it\u2019s just an opportunity to potentially be able to have some market movement capabilities to have customers prefer one over the other. And those are where we can make a little bit of extra dollars when we work with our downstream customers to prefer either the brand or the biosimilar. But from an overall perspective of drivers, at this point in time, I would not say that that is a significant driver, but I think it over time will get to be a more and more potential driver for specialty. Next question, please.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go to our next question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company.\nJames Auh: Hey, it\u2019s James on for Charles. Can you give us a quick update on our cost savings program, maybe how much of the $130 million of incremental savings expected this year has been achieved? Is it tracking in line with expectations? And perhaps how much of that\u2019s been reinvested opposed to dropping to the bottom line?\nDave Evans: Yes James thanks for the question. We\u2019re making great progress against that program and we\u2019re still on track to achieve the $500 million target as previously communicated. And I\u2019d also say we\u2019re on track to realize the $130 million or more this fiscal year. So we\u2019re making good progress. We\u2019ve got a pipeline, as you can imagine, we\u2019re tracking all sorts of opportunities and working through kind of stages of maturation. And we\u2019re seeing with strong confidence now our ability to attain the entire $500 million. So we\u2019re really continuing to focus more on not just simply cost out, but how do we try to drive improved value speed throughout the organization, increase our capabilities with the belief that that will continue to drive more savings throughout the future. With respect to the level of reinvestment we are continually encouraging our organization to press \u2013 Mike and I, with lots of difficult choices and challenges to reinvest this with high returning projects. I can\u2019t quantify for you the exact amount of that, but we\u2019re encouraged that we are seeing more and more opportunities as we build this culture within the organization of encouraging people to seek out new opportunities for ongoing cost improvements, growth drivers, et cetera, et cetera. So, I think the program is one that we should deem as a real success.\nJames Auh: Okay and just another technical question in the share count guidance, does that include any additional share repo beyond the $350 million from the ASR?\nMike Kaufmann: No. James, that assumes that we completed the $350 million, and there will be no further purchases for this fiscal year contemplated in that guidance.\nJames Auh: Okay, great. Thank you.\nKevin Moran: Thanks for the questions. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Percher with Nephron Research.\nEric Percher: Thank you. I\u2019d like to return to the Medical recall. I recognize you\u2019re still working through the potential impact going forward. But could you provide us some context for how surgical gowns and kits fit into medical broadly, maybe starting with market share, where your customers are turning and impact on other elements of the business?\nMike Kaufmann: Yes, I won\u2019t obviously be able to give a lot of detail on market share, but I can give you a little color is that there \u2013 the reason why this is such a \u2013 has a large impact, is that a lot of surgeries in the U.S. use kits. There\u2019s several different folks that compete in that space, but we do compete very effectively. We think with market leading type of quality and services tied to those kits, the ability to design and price those kits appropriately, et cetera. So the idea here is that a lot of surgeries in the U.S. do use kits and because gowns are in almost every kit. Even though when you look at this as an overall relatively small percentage of gowns sold across the U.S. because they\u2019re in kits that\u2019s why it\u2019s having a more \u2013 a larger impact than you might expect. And so I\u2019ll just stop there and see what your follow-up question is, might be on that, just to make sure I\u2019m hitting the right things for you.\nEric Percher: So I think concerns from the hospital purchasers around impact on utilization and impacts on their business. You started with an apology and are taking that head on. But what is your take on the ability to remedy this and any impact on the business from what this has done to relationships here? \nMike Kaufmann: Yes. I think any time you have a challenge in any business, it\u2019s often the way you respond, that makes the difference. And I couldn\u2019t be more impressed with how our Medical team from the leader, Steve, all the way down to people into the distribution centers have responded, taking accountability and ownership for this and said, we\u2019re going to do everything we can to make the customers\u2019 life as good as we can, knowing the circumstances. So we\u2019ve deployed hundreds of people we\u2019ve taken out, not only our Medical segment, but the Pharma team and Corporate Functions have also volunteered and sent people, even to the Vice President level, out to the field to pack kits pull things together for customers at their locations to make \u2013 to do the best we can. And so I believe that the way we\u2019re responding to this is really, really important. And I think that our feedback so far from the majority of customers is they understand things like this can happen, but they respect and appreciate the way we\u2019re responding.  It\u2019s hard to say how this ultimately \u2013 as Dave said, we don\u2019t know how this could affect our business going forward. And we\u2019re hoping that it doesn\u2019t. But we know that we have created some pain, and the most important thing to us is that our customers know that we are focused on them first and foremost so that they can treat the patients that they take care of that. But we\u2019re also taking a lot of other specific actions, too. It\u2019s not only deploying people into the field to make things better, but it is also about increasing production of similar or replacement products. For instance, we\u2019re offering our more protective level 4 gowns to help bridge the supply gap. We\u2019ve ramped up production because we do source these gown in multiple locations. And so we\u2019re ramping up sourcing elsewhere. We\u2019re working with folks that make similar products, both brand and I\u2019d say, private label products to ramp those up to get them going so we have those that go in through with surgeries. So it\u2019s really important that we look at all of these actions to make sure that we\u2019re keeping surgeries going and keeping our customers the pain from our customers as small as possible.\nKevin Moran: Next question please.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Kevin Caliendo from UBS.\nKevin Caliendo: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just want to go back to the opioid comment. I think you called out that it could take months weeks or months to get this done. And that would run into two pretty high profile state trials that are scheduled. How does this increase in spending? Does that have anything to do with maybe a longer timeline? Or how should we think about those two state trials coming up in terms of the context of your expected spend now versus what it before?\nMike Kaufmann: Yes, clearly if those trials do happen, our spending goes up, which is why we gave a range, where we\u2019re not trying to indicate that they will or they won\u2019t. We just know they\u2019re out there. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves. We feel really good that we are and will be prepared for those trials that happen. We\u2019re not going to use those trials or have those trials cause us to panic and do something that doesn\u2019t make sense. And so we\u2019re going to continue to work with the four Gs and the rest of the states to get this initial framework done is still our goal. But I wouldn\u2019t look at the increased spending around, particularly related to the trials. Again, there is a range, but it\u2019s more around finishing up the negotiations. And then you\u2019ve got to go through a documentation process, like actually papering it. And that takes \u2013 will take some significant lawyer time to get things papered and work through all those details. So I think it\u2019s more things like those. And then an implementation process working through the \u2013 how would we distribute the free goods. What changes can we make in the overall monitoring systems. There is a lot of work to be done that will take legal cost. And so we continue to be focused on it, and that\u2019s why we put that range out. \nKevin Caliendo: If I can ask one really quick follow-up on the API issue, I think, Ricky brought it up earlier. You said that you thought there was enough supply in the chain to manage it. Can you quantify like how much is actually in the supply chain in terms of product? If China were to be a six-week issue or an eight-week issue, would that still be the \u2013 would you still feel comfortable with that? \nMike Kaufmann: Yes it\u2019s a great question. I can\u2019t really give you that level of detail. I don\u2019t really know where our competitors are. I know that this is something that we\u2019ve looked at, specifically product by product, looked at products that we think have more potential risk of supply challenges because of where the raw materials add in the importance of those products to the healthcare system. And we have been working to ramp up supply and a few of those to carry a little bit extra. So for, right now, from what we see, we\u2019re not anticipating any problems. But if the shutdowns in China were to go longer or it spreads and creates other challenges, it\u2019s just hard to know at this point in time. But we think we\u2019re managing it to the best of our abilities at this point in time.\nKevin Caliendo: That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks so much.\nMike Kaufmann: Welcome.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go to our \u2013 we\u2019ll take our last question from Eric Coldwell with Baird.\nEric Coldwell: Hey thanks. Good morning. So in med-surg distribution, you cited that as both a headwind for revenue and profit. I guess I\u2019m a little bit surprised. We\u2019ve seen both inpatient and emergency department volumes increasing here for the last, call it, give or take, two, three, four quarters. And it\u2019s not only increasing, it\u2019s accelerating the increase at least to \u2013 according to some internal data and external data we have. We also had an early flu season. So what\u2019s going on in med-surg \u2013 core med-surg distribution in the U.S.? And what are the challenges that you\u2019re seeing now?\nMike Kaufmann: I think I\u2019ll start here, and then if there is anything to add, Dave can do that. I would say this, first of all, we\u2019re not seeing necessarily anything that would say that the actual med-surg historical volumes are very low-single-digit type of growth has changed significantly out there. So it\u2019s hard for me to comment on what you\u2019ve seen, but we haven\u2019t seen anything, I would say, dramatic in that spot. Remember, last year, we had a lot of lumpiness in our first couple of quarters related to the TSAs. And so some of our compare is, we think, caused by the fact that we\u2019re comparing the last year as we were going off those TSAs. And so if you look at our first half, we\u2019re roughly up 2%, which seems more in line. And so I think we really need to get another quarter or two behind us to understand overall.  And again, with this kit recall and gown recall, there is a few challenges there. We\u2019re still trying to work through. But there is nothing, I would say, big going on. And from all the work we\u2019ve done by talking to our customers and to our reps, we still feel really confident about what we\u2019re doing in our commercial restructuring the debt over the mid to long term, that\u2019s going to be a large value creator for us. But we\u2019ve got to get through these challenges for that to happen. \nEric Coldwell: Right. And I know the kit recall really didn\u2019t pop up until January. So I was clearly talking more about the last couple of quarters.\nMike Kaufmann: Absolutely.\nEric Coldwell: It\u2019s just \u2013 I guess maybe the TSA is an issue. We need to go back and revisit, but if we can take this up topline.\nDave Evans: Yes. Eric I\u2019d reiterate a little bit what Mike said, which is, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into a single quarter of Q2 because of all the transitions going on last year. I\u2019m really looking at our first half and saying, how is the first half compared to our expectations. And the first half is really \u2013 it\u2019s very much in line with our expectations.\nKevin Moran: Thanks again for the question. \nKevin Moran: All right, so let me close. I\u2019d like to close by saying we remain focused on our customers and their patients, and we will continue to deliver on our strategic priorities. Thanks for your questions and your time today, and we look forward to speaking with each of you soon. Take care.\nOperator: And this concludes today\u2019s. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mike Kaufmann",
            "content": "Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Before we discuss our Q2 performance and our outlook for the year, I would like to reiterate a few things we shared last Thursday regarding voluntary recalls for any level three surgical gowns and certain free source packs containing those affected gowns. The full press release and additional information regarding this issue can be found on our website. First and foremost, we apologize to our customers and their patients. We understand the gravity of this situation and are dedicated to resolving this issue as quickly as possible. Simultaneously, we are doing everything we can to prevent this from happening again. We are engaging third-party experts to conduct a comprehensive review of our quality assurance processes and business practices and we are committed to executing corrective and preventative actions. As we shared last week, related to these recalls, we recorded a $96 million charge in our Q2 GAAP results. This charge represents our best estimate of costs for the recalls, including inventory write-offs, as well as certain remediation and supply disruption costs such as cost to replace recalled products. To provide some clarity, $56 million of this is within cost of products sold and $40 million is within SG&A. This charge and any future adjustments made to it will be excluded from our non-GAAP financial results. On behalf of the entire Cardinal Health leadership team, I would like to thank our employees for their dedication and tireless effort. All of us, myself included, are focused on resolving this issue as quickly as possible for our customers and their patients. I'll now turn the call over today to walk through our Q2 results and updated fiscal 2020 outlook. And then I'll share some thoughts on our path forward. Thanks, Dave. As we look to the remainder of this year and the next few, we will continue to focus on enhancing our established core businesses and on fueling sustained growth in evolving areas including Specialty and at-Home. In Pharma, let me start by saying we continue to be actively involved in ongoing negotiations of the terms for a global settlement and we remain committed to being part of the solution to the opioid epidemic. Overall, we have increased confidence in our work to drive growth across the Pharma segment. Our investments in our generic pricing and analytics capabilities as well as continued strong performance from Red Oak and improving market dynamics are enabling our generics program to now be a tailwind for the year rather than a headwind as we previously expected. Also, our investments in both our Specialty and Connected Care businesses enable us to capture value in the ever changing healthcare landscape. Moving to Medical. I mentioned last quarter that we had multiple initiatives in flight to enhance our commercial approach and streamline our supply chain. Our work in these areas continues. However, with the recent recalls, we are currently deploying our Medical segment teams to meet the most immediate needs of our customers and their patients. While we recognize this will slow momentum in our commercial and supply chain initiatives, we remain confident in the underlying strategies of these work streams, and we are dedicated to their success. We will provide an update on our next call. At the enterprise level, we remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation approach that prioritizes reinvesting in the business, maintaining a strong balance sheet and modestly growing our dividends. Opportunistically, we will continue to explore share repurchases and M&A. Across the company, we continue to prudently manage our cost structure. We're doing this through focusing our resources, improving our processes, and embracing new technologies that create better visibility and velocity throughout the company. Our goal is to be easier to do business with. As this new mindset takes root, we will continue to see a sustainable behavioral shift and ongoing value creation for years to come. With that, I'll now pause to open it up for questions. Yes, thanks for the question. We are still dedicated to the framework and progress does continue. So that's a positive. But as you can imagine, these are incredibly complicated arrangements. We have to work through with 50 different states that we're working with. And so to get this over the goal line, there is a lot of work that's going to be done over the next several weeks and months to get that done. And even when it's agreed to, it's got to get papered. And then we've got to work through implementation of the various components of it. And so when you begin to look at all of those costs and the way the spend, we believe, will ramp up. We believe that \u2013 you're right, the costs are going to go from $85 million was our original to $100 million to $125 million with a significant portion ramping up in the Q3 and even probably a little more in Q4. Next question, please. Yes, thanks again for the question on this important topic. As I said, we remain committed to this framework and we're very appreciative of the four AGs that took the initial lead on this. They have been working with all 50 states. We continue to get the feedback from those states and look to the various components of the details of the agreement. But it wouldn't be appropriate for me right now to try to tell you or handicap how many states are in or out. But I will tell you that the four AGs that we talked to continue to make progress and I think we all believe that this is the right thing to do for the companies and for the country to help get some relief to the people that need it, with not only the dollars we're talking about, which are important, but equally the other components which are distributing the free goods and working with them on programs to improve the overall monitoring of the opioids. Yes. I think a couple of things. I think first of all by far this is the item that drove the difference in our expectations for the quarter. As Dave mentioned, pretty much everything else was right there where we expected to be. Maybe a little bit better, but this was the big driver. And it's really good performance across all of the components. We're very happy with Red Oak. They continue to perform at a very high level, not only in getting after cost for us, but also just doing an excellent job on service level. We really believe we have industry-leading service levels, and that really helps lead to maintaining and growing our volumes, which is an important part of it. So while volumes were a little lighter than we had expected originally this year, due to the situation, as we mentioned, with Fred's that went bankrupt and some other customers that are winding down a few stores, we are still seeing volume growth. And then the other big factor is going to be just market dynamics. We've seen significant improvement in the overall market dynamics on the pricing side. So when you put all of the components together \u2013 and we had a strong quarter on launches. It was really strength across all of the components that made the program over perform. Yes. I'll start with \u2013 as far as the second half outlook goes, we basically are just taking the trends that we've seen for the first half of the year around generics, the overall programs and kind of forecasting those out for the rest of the year. We're not projecting necessarily any improvements or inflation or anything like that. It's just really about being more confident that what we're seeing \u2013 now that we have roughly eight months of activity versus five last quarter, which just felt a little too early to call it, we feel like we've had enough activity here that we feel good about increasing our guidance related to that. And that is clearly the biggest item. As far as some color on it, I think the important thing is, it's hard to really get focused on just the buy side or just the sell side because they work in tandem, and it's really about driving margin per unit. And what we're seeing is a much better balance between what's happening on the sell side in terms of the amount of inflation being less than historical, but also being able to then balance any decreases there with good performance at Red Oak. So that we can continue to manage our margin per unit in a way to be able to have the overall program grow. And as Dave said, the units and the overall launches helped to that, too. And so that's really how we look at it. As far as the China API, you can imagine, this is something that we monitor. Red Oak is in charge of that for us, and they do a great job of understanding where raw materials are coming from, where they're manufactured. And you're right, there are a decent amount of API manufactured over in China and some of the affected areas. We have \u2013 where we have \u2013 we've worked with manufacturers to try to increase supplies ahead of this. I do think it's something that, based on the amount of supply and the supply chain, is something the industry should be able to work through. But it's hard to say how long this will last, and it's something that we're going to have to keep an eye on, and we will. Yes. Thanks for the question. Our Specialty business, the last number that we publicly gave for FY 2019 is that we finished around $19 billion in sales, and so that's where that business is. We continue to expect that business to have significant growth this year across all of its areas. It's sales into the actual downstream providers in the acute space as well as upstream services to manufacture. So we are seeing good momentum across all three areas in that business and continue to feel good about not only their quality of service to the customers, but some of the investments we're making in the businesses that we'll be able to talk about more here in the future, including a recent investment we've made in [indiscernible] that was announced that we believe will also be an area of helping in the cell and gene area. So we continue to be excited about the specialty area. As far as it relates to IPI, I would say this; first of all, we're in favor of anything that can help reduce the cost of healthcare to the U.S. healthcare system. We know that's important. We hope and look to folks to be able to find ways to reduce costs for folks. So that's important to us. The second thing I would say is that when you think about IPI or any of these programs as folks are looking at, the impact to us, I think, is generally where it could impact us in the first order is, does it change list prices, does it mean that the way that manufacturers establish list prices, do they have to lower them, do they have to reduce their price increases? Those are the types of first order of kind of magnitude impact us that we look at. And as you and others have heard me say, I think that we as a company and as an industry have really worked well over the years in the fee-for-service model to first of all, make anything that's \u2013 the part that's dependent on deflate or inflation to be less than 5% of our overall margin rate, so that helps protect us from any impact or what folks might do with inflation rates. And secondly, the way we've been able to demonstrate our ability to renegotiate DSAs over time as WAC prices fluctuate that we still feel very confident that any impact to list prices that we can manage through very effectively as a company and as an industry. The piece that's really important to us though is the impact to our customers.  We really look at any of this legislation with the true lens to our customers and the impact on them, and we want to make sure and have commented on past legislation that's been out there that we have to be really careful that type of legislation doesn't reduce access or reduce the ability of our customers and theirselves to be able to work with the actual patients to provide the type of care that we know that they deserve. Thanks, Lisa. Yes George, let me answer that. Look, when we talk about the four elements of what we described as a generic dynamic, those are continuation of trends that we would expect to see in Q3 and in Q4. So we expect to see year-over-year some healthy improvement in Q3. Q4 we don't expect to see the same year-over-year improvement because Q4 of last year if you go back and look at that, was a quarter \u2013 was the first quarter where we began to see the inflection this deflationary trend. And so we have a much more challenging comp in Q4. With respect to the accelerated launch of new items, that's not necessarily a one timer it's just a pull forward of something that was anticipated later in the year. So I think you can expect, which is why we called our guidance up specific to pharma, we expect to see some positive results in Q3. And then possibly today based on what we see somewhat moderation in the year-over-year comparison in Q4. Does that help answer your question, George? I think in specialty a lot of this just has to do with the normal growth of specialty. We're continuing to see certain drugs grow in the marketplace because of their success, particularly in the oncology space, getting new indications and just normal growth. That's a really big piece of it. Part of it is some of the uptake of some of the biosimilars here and there some of that, while they don't provide a lot more value than normal branded items and they generally act like that. There are some smaller opportunities on the earning side that earn a slightly better there that's been a piece of it. We've seen really nice growth in our services business upstream with wins in our 3PL business, and our hub and some of our other businesses have continued to grow. So nothing unique about like large pieces of movement of business or anything. One-timers like that it's just nice solid growth with the volumes across the board. Next question. Yes, our guidance would assume any of the normal type related stuff for that. But there is nothing new \u2013 no new launches that created the increase related to biosimilars. We continue to think that that's something that we'll keep an eye on. I don't believe it will be a big driver for us in the short term because right now they act more like branded drugs and their overall margin rates are similar. There's a little bit of opportunity to make a little bit more money on some of the biosimilars, depending on programs we might be able to put in place with customers. But I would not call them a large driver of anything over \u2013 over this year over the short term. But something that we'll keep our eye on is something to be more of a midterm or longer term driver, particularly if they become interchangeable. And then I think for sure my opinion would change on their ability to be a much bigger driver for us. Yes, on Cordis, I'll just handle that real quick. Nothing really to report on Cordis outside of what our expectations are, the business is continuing to grow, we're seeing growth in our profit there and we continue to be really happy with what the team is doing there to meet or slightly exceed the expectations that we have for that business this year. But we don't see it being a driver outside of what we expected for the year one way or the other. As far as the initiatives in medical, we remain incredibly committed to both of them. There is nothing about the underlying strategies of our commercial realignment or our supply chain initiatives that at this time, I would say, make me feel any differently than we have been talking about. But as I noted particularly well then both of them, but probably a little bit even more in the commercial side. It has been slowed with the gallons recall. We have deployed some of our sales reps, as well as other people into the field to be actually located at the hospital locations, helping them manage through this challenge that is out there. And it's really important to us that we take care of our customers and our patients. So because of that it would slow down where we expect to be. So we have said and committed that our supply chain we would be \u2013 have a plan done by the end of Q2. That plan was done, but as we look at implementation of that plan we are taking into account this disruption that we're working on and just overall re-evaluating and make sure we look at the overall global supply chain to make sure there's no changes we would make based on some of the recent challenges. And then again on the commercial piece, we're on track to get the jobs hired and all that, but we do have folks deployed to customers. Yes, as I mentioned, we still feel really good about having several areas that we would consider our strategic growth areas. I would highlight four of them, Specialty being one of them. At home we've talked about our connected care services business and pharma and our medical services businesses. These are all businesses we're seeing significant growth on the top line and on the bottom line. There are also businesses that are really right on trend, care moving towards the Home and the various things that go along with Specialty and the service businesses. So these are areas where we are prioritizing our capital expenditures to those areas so we can really focus on organic growth. And if there are M&A opportunities out there that would make sense, those would be the areas that you would see us focus on. Now that being said, we're going to continue to do all the right things in our core businesses to make sure we maintain and grow those. But for, what I would say, extra allocation of capital, those are going to be key areas that we're going to focus our capital expenditures on. Thanks. I think I picked them up. There was a little spotty on being able to hear, but I think I got all your pieces. So let me see if I can walk through them all. From a change in price standpoint, I'll look at it \u2013 we've been very disciplined over several years in our pharma distribution business to make sure that we're splitting out our pricing on our Specialty so that it is priced differently than normal brand, so that we don't \u2013 so we can make a fair return on the specialty drugs and we've continued that discipline with any new business or renewals with either, as I've said before, specific pricing in that area to maintain appropriate profitability or some types of mix type of penalties in agreements to make sure that if their mix goes the wrong way, that the overall cost of goods adjust. So we continue to be very focused on that in the PD area. And also in the overall specialty business since there's very little generics in that space that is priced on a more individual drug standpoint. And again we remain very disciplined in that area to be careful. So I wouldn't say that pricing changes is either a \u2013 is a driver of our growth in specialty, but it's also not something that we're ignoring or I would say is a headwind from that standpoint. As far as growth in specialty overall, I would say it really comes from market growth. The market itself is growing significantly with new indications, new drug launches that the. Your question on biosimilars, to think about biosimilars, the way to think about it is when a biosimilar launches, you're either \u2013 you're not necessarily getting new volume to speak of because it either you're replacing of current branded drug with a biosimilar. So overall your volume doesn't generally go up because of a biosimilar it's just an opportunity to potentially be able to have some market movement capabilities to have customers prefer one over the other. And those are where we can make a little bit of extra dollars when we work with our downstream customers to prefer either the brand or the biosimilar. But from an overall perspective of drivers, at this point in time, I would not say that that is a significant driver, but I think it over time will get to be a more and more potential driver for specialty. Next question, please. No. James, that assumes that we completed the $350 million, and there will be no further purchases for this fiscal year contemplated in that guidance. Yes, I won't obviously be able to give a lot of detail on market share, but I can give you a little color is that there \u2013 the reason why this is such a \u2013 has a large impact, is that a lot of surgeries in the U.S. use kits. There's several different folks that compete in that space, but we do compete very effectively. We think with market leading type of quality and services tied to those kits, the ability to design and price those kits appropriately, et cetera. So the idea here is that a lot of surgeries in the U.S. do use kits and because gowns are in almost every kit. Even though when you look at this as an overall relatively small percentage of gowns sold across the U.S. because they're in kits that's why it's having a more \u2013 a larger impact than you might expect. And so I'll just stop there and see what your follow-up question is, might be on that, just to make sure I'm hitting the right things for you. Yes. I think any time you have a challenge in any business, it's often the way you respond, that makes the difference. And I couldn't be more impressed with how our Medical team from the leader, Steve, all the way down to people into the distribution centers have responded, taking accountability and ownership for this and said, we're going to do everything we can to make the customers' life as good as we can, knowing the circumstances. So we've deployed hundreds of people we've taken out, not only our Medical segment, but the Pharma team and Corporate Functions have also volunteered and sent people, even to the Vice President level, out to the field to pack kits pull things together for customers at their locations to make \u2013 to do the best we can. And so I believe that the way we're responding to this is really, really important. And I think that our feedback so far from the majority of customers is they understand things like this can happen, but they respect and appreciate the way we're responding.  It's hard to say how this ultimately \u2013 as Dave said, we don't know how this could affect our business going forward. And we're hoping that it doesn't. But we know that we have created some pain, and the most important thing to us is that our customers know that we are focused on them first and foremost so that they can treat the patients that they take care of that. But we're also taking a lot of other specific actions, too. It's not only deploying people into the field to make things better, but it is also about increasing production of similar or replacement products. For instance, we're offering our more protective level 4 gowns to help bridge the supply gap. We've ramped up production because we do source these gown in multiple locations. And so we're ramping up sourcing elsewhere. We're working with folks that make similar products, both brand and I'd say, private label products to ramp those up to get them going so we have those that go in through with surgeries. So it's really important that we look at all of these actions to make sure that we're keeping surgeries going and keeping our customers the pain from our customers as small as possible. Yes, clearly if those trials do happen, our spending goes up, which is why we gave a range, where we're not trying to indicate that they will or they won't. We just know they're out there. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves. We feel really good that we are and will be prepared for those trials that happen. We're not going to use those trials or have those trials cause us to panic and do something that doesn't make sense. And so we're going to continue to work with the four Gs and the rest of the states to get this initial framework done is still our goal. But I wouldn't look at the increased spending around, particularly related to the trials. Again, there is a range, but it's more around finishing up the negotiations. And then you've got to go through a documentation process, like actually papering it. And that takes \u2013 will take some significant lawyer time to get things papered and work through all those details. So I think it's more things like those. And then an implementation process working through the \u2013 how would we distribute the free goods. What changes can we make in the overall monitoring systems. There is a lot of work to be done that will take legal cost. And so we continue to be focused on it, and that's why we put that range out. Yes it's a great question. I can't really give you that level of detail. I don't really know where our competitors are. I know that this is something that we've looked at, specifically product by product, looked at products that we think have more potential risk of supply challenges because of where the raw materials add in the importance of those products to the healthcare system. And we have been working to ramp up supply and a few of those to carry a little bit extra. So for, right now, from what we see, we're not anticipating any problems. But if the shutdowns in China were to go longer or it spreads and creates other challenges, it's just hard to know at this point in time. But we think we're managing it to the best of our abilities at this point in time. Welcome. I think I'll start here, and then if there is anything to add, Dave can do that. I would say this, first of all, we're not seeing necessarily anything that would say that the actual med-surg historical volumes are very low-single-digit type of growth has changed significantly out there. So it's hard for me to comment on what you've seen, but we haven't seen anything, I would say, dramatic in that spot. Remember, last year, we had a lot of lumpiness in our first couple of quarters related to the TSAs. And so some of our compare is, we think, caused by the fact that we're comparing the last year as we were going off those TSAs. And so if you look at our first half, we're roughly up 2%, which seems more in line. And so I think we really need to get another quarter or two behind us to understand overall.  And again, with this kit recall and gown recall, there is a few challenges there. We're still trying to work through. But there is nothing, I would say, big going on. And from all the work we've done by talking to our customers and to our reps, we still feel really confident about what we're doing in our commercial restructuring the debt over the mid to long term, that's going to be a large value creator for us. But we've got to get through these challenges for that to happen. Absolutely."

            "name": "Dave Evans",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. I'll start with an overview of our performance for the second fiscal quarter and then provide an update to our fiscal 2020 guidance. In Q2, we delivered earnings of $1.52 per share, an increase of 18% from the prior year. This result exceeded our expectations and was driven by a combination of operating and non-operating activities which I will elaborate on the comments to follow. Total company revenue increased 5% versus last year to $39.7 billion and consolidated gross margin increased 2% from last year to $1.8 billion. SG&A increased 3% to $1.1 billion. This increase was driven by higher costs to support sales growth and by fluctuations in deferred compensation liabilities. These items were partially offset by the benefits of enterprise wide cost savings measures. The net result for the quarter with consolidated operating earnings of $646 million, a 1% increase from the prior year. Moving below operating earnings, interest and other income and expense decreased 48% to $51 million. This was primarily driven by the change in value of deferred compensation plan investments and lower interest expense as we continue to execute our de-leveraging plans. Of note, in the quarter, we paid down more than $700 million of long-term debt and have now paid down nearly $800 million through the first half. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25% nearly four percentage points lower than the prior year primarily due to the favorable impact of changes in jurisdictional mix. Average diluted shares outstanding were 294 million about 6 million fewer than last year. During the quarter, we completed $350 million accelerated share repurchase program initiated in Q1. We repurchased 7.3 million shares over the first two quarters and an average value of $48 per share. We now have $943 million remaining under our Board authorized share repurchase program. Moving on to cash flow. Operating cash flow for the quarter was approximately $700 million. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.7 billion, which included $788 million held outside the U.S. As a reminder, timing, in particularly the day of the week in which the quarter ends affects point in time cash flows. Moving on the segment results starting with Pharma. We were encouraged to see positive momentum across many areas of the segment. Segment revenue increased 6% to $35.7 billion, driven by growth in our Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty Solutions divisions. Segment profit increased 4% to $462 million, with our generics program being the largest driver.  As a reminder, what we refer to our \u2013 as our generics program includes sourcing, sell-side pricing, volume, and new item launches. For the first time in several quarters, our generics program reverted from a net earnings headwind to tailwind. At the same time, we continued to see strong growth in our Specialty Solutions business. Brand sales and mix also positively contribute as we manage changing dynamics to capture the value we create through our supply chain. These tailwinds were partially offset by Pharma Distribution customer contract renewals. Transitioning to Medical, revenue for the segment was flat to prior year at $4 billion. Growth in Cardinal Health at-Home was offset by a decline in products and distribution. As a reminder, products and distribution includes both Cardinal Health brand and national brand products. Overall, Cardinal Health brand volumes have lagged our expectations through the first half. While we recognize we still have progress to make. This validates the importance of our commercial initiatives which Mike will discuss in his remarks. Medical segment profit increased 4% to $195 million. This reflects the benefits of ongoing initiatives to improve our cost structure including work to optimize freight and IT relationships. These benefits were partially offset by a decline in products and distribution. Medical segment profits are now up 13% compared to fiscal 2019 on a year-to-date basis. Moving now to our full year outlook. With half the year behind us, we're raising our full year fiscal 2020 EPS guidance to the range of $5.20 to $5.40 from the prior range of $4.85 to $5.10. I'll call out a few items contributing to this increase. First, we now have additional clarity regarding external factors we mentioned last quarter that affect the enterprise, including brand inflation, the medical device tax and tariffs. Also based on the sustained improved trends in our generics program, we now expect the Pharma segment to exceed our original expectations for the full year. A few additional items to note in the Pharma segment as we look to the second half of the year. First, from a year-over-year comparison perspective, recall that it was in Q4 of last year when we started to see an improvement in the generic market dynamics that means we'll be comping more challenging performance in Q4 of this year. Second, we now expect opioid-related legal cost to be in the range of $100 million to $125 million for the year with the majority of the year-over-year increase occurring in the back half of the year. As a reminder, these expenses are recorded in our Pharma segment. Third, on brand inflation. While the January price increases from our contingent vendors fell within the range of our expectations, they continue to be a smaller dollar contribution each year. And in Medical, I'll remind you of the charge we took in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 related to quarters. This will affect our year-over-year growth rates in the second half for the segment. Regarding the rest of our corporate assumptions, we now anticipate FY 2020 interest and other income and expense in the range of $260 million to $280 million. This improvement is largely due to the favorability we've seen thus far with our deferred compensation plan investments and the benefits of debt deleveraging that I mentioned earlier. As a reminder, we plan to reduce outstanding long-term debt by at least $1 billion in fiscal 2020. Finally, we expect diluted weighted average shares to be in the range of 293 million to 296 million for the full fiscal year. Given that we are halfway through the year, we've decided to narrow this range. Regarding our segment assumptions, we are making one update. With the favorability I discussed, we now expect Pharmaceutical segment profit to decline low single digits. This is a significant improvement from our original expectation of a low double digit decline. With that, let me turn it back over to Mike. Yes, Glen. This is Dave. Good question. So we \u2013 as you could see, we collected the direct costs and include those in our charge of $96 million. What we have uncertainty on, and frankly at this very early stage is, implications to second half in terms of revenue margin in any disruptions with our customers. So I would say that you've read this fairly well and that we've reflected some of that uncertainty in the guidance that we're providing for the second half for Med. Yes, just \u2013 I think, Mike, you hit out at the end there. I think we did have an earlier-than-expected launch of some new items. That was helpful for the quarter. In addition, we had a fairly favorable mix that help drive the results we saw in the second quarter. Steven is Dave. So I'd say your assumptions are all pretty spot on. I would say though that we're really per usual practice. We're not in a position to comment on 2021 at this early date. But overall, I think, you've got a good hand on. And I understand what we've been articulating. Yes James thanks for the question. We're making great progress against that program and we're still on track to achieve the $500 million target as previously communicated. And I'd also say we're on track to realize the $130 million or more this fiscal year. So we're making good progress. We've got a pipeline, as you can imagine, we're tracking all sorts of opportunities and working through kind of stages of maturation. And we're seeing with strong confidence now our ability to attain the entire $500 million. So we're really continuing to focus more on not just simply cost out, but how do we try to drive improved value speed throughout the organization, increase our capabilities with the belief that that will continue to drive more savings throughout the future. With respect to the level of reinvestment we are continually encouraging our organization to press \u2013 Mike and I, with lots of difficult choices and challenges to reinvest this with high returning projects. I can't quantify for you the exact amount of that, but we're encouraged that we are seeing more and more opportunities as we build this culture within the organization of encouraging people to seek out new opportunities for ongoing cost improvements, growth drivers, et cetera, et cetera. So, I think the program is one that we should deem as a real success. Yes. Eric I'd reiterate a little bit what Mike said, which is, I wouldn't read too much into a single quarter of Q2 because of all the transitions going on last year. I'm really looking at our first half and saying, how is the first half compared to our expectations. And the first half is really \u2013 it's very much in line with our expectations."

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Moran. Please go ahead, sir.\nKevin Moran: Good morning and welcome to Cardinal Health first quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. Today, I'm joined today by Mike Kaufmann, our Chief Executive Officer, and Dave Evans, our interim Chief Financial Officer. You can find today's press release and presentation on the IR section of our Web site at ir.cardinalhealth.com. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in these statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statements slide at the beginning of our presentation for a full description of these risks and uncertainties. Note that during the discussion today, our comments will be on a non-GAAP basis unless they are specifically called out as GAAP. Our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for all relevant periods can be found in the schedules attached to our press release. We will provide an update to our FY '20 outlook on a non-GAAP basis. We do not provide guidance on a GAAP basis due to the difficulty in predicting items that we exclude from our non-GAAP results. During the Q&A portion of today's call, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question with one follow-up, so that we may give everyone in the queue a chance to ask a question.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Kaufmann: Thanks, Kevin. And congratulations on your new role. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I am here with Dave Evans and I'd like to welcome him to his first call as our interim CFO. Dave has done a great job getting up to speed over the past few months. I'm grateful for his leadership and experience as we conduct our search for a permanent CFO. This morning, we'll cover our progress and our path forward. I'll start with a few high-level thoughts on the quarter and then Dave will cover the financials. I'll close with some thoughts on how we will build on the solid start to the year. We remain confident in our strategic direction as we focus on driving both efficiency and growth. Our Q1 performance validates our short-term progress and longer-term path. At the enterprise-level, our disciplined cost management is enabling strategic reinvestment across both segments as well as in critical, functional areas. In the Pharma segment, we're seeing early signs of positive trends. And although we still have work to do, we are making progress in key areas. In Medical, we're encouraged by early traction from our improvement efforts, as well as the initial returns from ongoing investments in our growth platforms. I'll share more about this work in both segments later in my remarks. But, first, I'll turn to Dave to walk you through our results and specific milestones we achieved in Q1.\nDavid Evans : Thanks, Mike. And thanks everyone for being with us today. I'm pleased to join you on my first call. I'll walk through the numbers and highlight a few actions taken in Q1 to demonstrate our commitment to long-term growth. Overall, I'm happy to report that we delivered earnings of $1.27 per share in the first quarter, which were ahead of our expectations. Total company revenue increased 6% versus last year to $37.3 billion. Consolidated gross margin increased 1% from last year to about $1.7 billion. The decline gross margin rate principally reflects year-over-year Pharma distribution contract renewals and products and distribution mix. SG&A, which includes variable distribution related expenses, improved 2% despite higher revenue. This improvement reflects sustained organization-wide efforts to streamline our cost structure. Mike might elaborate more on some of these efforts in a few minutes, but I'd like to say that just in the few months that I've been here, I've already seen this effort evolve from a cost reduction initiative to a broader cultural mindset of efficiency and improvement. Total operating earnings were $577 million, a 6% increase from the prior year, driven by performance in the Medical segment. Interest and other expenses were roughly flat versus prior year at $80 million. This reflects a decline in interest expense. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24%. This compares to last year's rate of 14%, which was impacted by changes to our international legal entity structure. Average diluted shares outstanding were $297 million, about $9 million fewer than last year. During the quarter, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program to opportunistically buy back $359 million of stock. We tired 80% of these shares in Q1 and expect to complete the program in our second quarter. Combining share repurchases, we returned well over $400 million to shareholders in the first quarter, demonstrating our continued commitment to look to deploying capital on a balanced, disciplined and shareholder-friendly way. Moving on to cash flow, operating cash for the quarter was a use of $653 million. As a reminder, timing, in particular, the day of the week in which the quarter ends, affects point in time cash flows. This dynamic negatively impacted our year-over-year cash flow for Q1, but will reverse in Q2. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.2 billion, which includes about $700 million held outside the US. So, I'll now transition to segment results, starting with Pharma. Revenue increased 6% to $33 billion, driven by sales growth in our Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty Solutions divisions. Segment profit decreased 3% to $398 million, which reflects the impact from Pharma distribution customer contract renewals. This was partially offset by the benefits of our ongoing cost savings initiatives and performance in our Specialty Solutions business. As a reminder, we record opioid related litigation expenses in the Pharma segment.  Before I leave Pharma, I want to note that our generics program performed roughly as expected. While we continue to see improvements in the market dynamics for generics, I would remind you that several variables impact the net performance of our generics program, including sourcing, volume, new item launches and sell side pricing. Overall, we're seeing positive trends and good progress in the Pharma segment. Mike will discuss our ongoing efforts to maintain this momentum. Transitioning to Medical, segment revenue for Q1 increased 3% to about $4 billion. This was due to organic growth across the segment led by products and distribution as well as in Cardinal Health at Home, one of our strategic growth areas. This growth was partially offset by the divestiture of naviHealth in August 2018. Segment profit increased 26% to $170 million. This reflects benefits from our cost savings initiatives, as well as growth in products and distribution services and Cardinal Health at Home. As with revenue, these benefits were partially offset by the divestiture of the naviHealth business. To provide some additional clarity, products and distribution includes both Cardinal Health brand and national brand products, as well as costs from our global supply chain.  Our work across the Medical segment to integrate our infrastructure, streamline our footprint and improve the customer experience is progressing as planned. Mike will discuss how this work will transition into growth over the longer term. Moving now to our full-year outlook, with one quarter's worth of results behind us, we've increased confidence in our full-year guidance. At the same time, we continue to monitor external factors and key assumptions that could impact our forecast. We also continue to track the timing and evolution of internal investment initiatives. Examples of external factors could be headwinds, which include tariffs and medical device tax. Examples of key assumptions we closely monitor include brand inflation and our generics program. Considering the potential fluctuation of these and other items, we are reaffirming our guidance along with our corporate and segment assumptions. While we generally don't provide quarterly guidance, I will say that, directionally, we expect operating earnings in Q2 to be modestly lower than Q1. So, before I turn it back over to Mike, I'd like to mention a significant item included in our GAAP results. In connection with a recent opioid-related settlement with Cuyahoga and Summit counties and the agreement in principle amongst the parties involved to a global settlement framework, we accrued $5.1 billion after-tax in the first quarter. We believe this global settlement framework will serve as the basis for definitive settlement terms and documentation. And for this reason, from a legal and accounting perspective, this accrual is prudent. For Cardinal Health, the cash component of the settlement framework is up to $5.6 billion over 18 years. If factors change, we'll adjust the accrual appropriately. Let me now turn it back over to Mike to provide further remarks. \nMike Kaufmann: Thanks, Dave. This settlement with the two Ohio counties enables the discussions around the global settlement framework to proceed. The global framework, which is supported by a bipartisan group of state attorneys general, is designed to resolve all pending and potential opioid lawsuits by states and political subdivisions. Importantly, with the commitment of both funds and the distribution of treatment medications, this framework provides an immediate solution to the communities and families that need it most. As you know, we have an important, but limited role, in the pharmaceutical supply chain. We take that role and the responsibility that comes with it seriously. We remain committed to being part of the solution to this epidemic and that is why we are committed to the global framework and continue to be actively involved in its progression. With that said, if this framework is not successful, we are prepared to vigorously defend ourselves. Shifting now to our strategic direction in the focus areas I mentioned last quarter. I said on our last call that, in Pharma, we're focused on two things \u2013 further enhancing our core distribution business and fueling sustained growth in key areas. Regarding our core distribution business, we are focused on continuously enhancing the customer experience, improving pricing and contract discipline, and reducing costs. We are making significant investments throughout the segment with a longer-term view of the business. For example, we're implementing digital technologies that will improve visibility and enhance our pricing capabilities. In addition, we recently began a program to improve our e-commerce capabilities and enhance the experience for our customers. Beyond investing in our core businesses, we are focused on investing to drive growth in rapidly-evolving spaces in healthcare and identifying ways to further differentiate ourselves and shape the future. For example, in Specialty, we recently made a multi-million dollar investment to establish a new distribution center outside of Nashville, Tennessee with a state-of-the-art, cold chain complex including deep frozen technology. This new facility will enable us to combine two existing distribution centers, streamline technologies to drive operational efficiencies and support continued growth in rapidly evolving areas of the Specialty industry. We're also investing in our higher margin services businesses, which we call our connected care offering, to build greater connectivity between manufacturers, payers, pharmacies and patients. We will continue to purposely redeploy capital in these and other areas that align to our strategy. Moving on the Medical, we are building out our commercial and operational capabilities across the segment and continuing investment in key areas. Dave shared some of these activities, which include enhancing our commercial approach, streamlining our supply chain, and rationalizing our footprint, are showing early signs of success. Commercially, we are more closely aligning ourselves with the needs of our customers and incentivizing our sales force to sell Cardinal brand products. We expect these enhancements to be complete by Q3 and their benefit will begin to materialize in FY 2021. As part of our supply chain work, we are reconfiguring our North American network. For example, in California, we are consolidating two of our distribution centers into a modern flagship center, which will enhance customer experience at a lower cost to serve and position the segment for growth. Additionally, with respect to our global supply chain, we more than doubled our manufacturing footprint with the patient recovery acquisition. We are already leveraging some synergies, but we see a path to capture significantly more. To that end, within the next quarter, we will finalize plans to reduce cost and deliver industry-leading service across our global network. These plans will take some time to execute. So, we have a strong governance structure in place and are committed to diligently managing our costs to realize the greatest long-term benefit. As in Pharma, we're making significant investments across the Medical segment to improve the customer experience and drive growth in both the products and services spaces. For example, as Patient Care shifts more toward the home, we continue to capture growth opportunities through Cardinal Health at Home solutions. We are committed to further developing this business and are redeploying some of our cost savings benefits in this area to improve the customer, healthcare professional and patient experiences. In Medical services, another business unit in the segment with sustained growth and strong results, we're building additional digital and data capabilities, modernizing our operating systems and streamlining clinical and operational workflows. This will reduce costs for both us and for our customers and, importantly, will improve patient safety. We recognize the components of the work across our products and services spaces will take time to translate into sustained growth and results. We remain committed to fueling this momentum. On the enterprise level, as Dave and I shared earlier, our cost savings initiatives are producing tangible benefits across the company. We expect to meet or exceed our $130 million commitment for the year, primarily through SG&A-related activities. Our initiatives to improve gross margin, like those in Medical to right-size our manufacturing and distribution footprint, will contribute more significantly to our five-year, $500 million savings goal as they will ramp up over the next few years. With these initiatives, leaders across the company are evaluating internal operating models and identifying opportunities to leverage automation, analytics and additional technologies that not only drive efficiencies and contribute to our savings goals, but to improve insights. One example is our recent partnership with Genpact, a global professional services firm focused on digital business transformation, who will help us transform our finance operating model. As part of this partnership, Genpact will create a data analytics and FP&A hub here in Central Ohio to drive industry-leading innovation. About 200 current Cardinal Health FP&A and data analytics employees are transitioning to the Genpact hub next week, alongside a team of Genpact's process, finance and data analytics experts. This is just one of the many initiatives across the company to streamline our processes, leverage our scale and enhance our data capabilities. We will share additional updates on these initiatives as they develop. As we drive these type of efficiencies across the company, we will fuel growth through balanced capital allocation. This includes reinvesting in the business, returning cash to shareholders and improving our financial flexibility, while maintaining our investment grade status. We remain committed to paying down at least $1 billion of long-term debt this fiscal year, which includes the $450 million of debt maturing in Q2. To close, in Q1, we generated positive momentum across the company. We are pleased with this start to the year and recognize that there is more work ahead. We have a strong foundation of scale and industry knowledge. With our talented and dedicated employees, we're committed to building on this foundation to adapt, innovate and lead as our industry evolves. With that, I'll now open it up for questions. \nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from George Hill of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Hill: Hey, good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the questions. Mike, I guess, can you help me square two things here. You talked about the early signs of positive trends that you're seeing in the Pharmaceutical business, but I kind of want to square that with the guide where it seems like operating earnings deceleration is going to continue through the balance of the year. So, I guess, could you put a little more color on the positive trends that you're seeing and kind of help me square that with the guide for operatings growth or actually operating kind of deterioration in the segment?\nMike Kaufmann: Go ahead. I'll let Dave start.\nDavid Evans: George. Thanks for the question. Look, I think the way we're thinking about this is, we're really pleased with the first quarter results. I'll start with that. It certainly gives us increased confidence in the full year. At the same time, I'd say we're very cautious and that we're only one quarter into the year. So, we've got some pretty significant assumptions out there that are still left open \u2013 for example, brand inflation \u2013 and there's also a lot of other key kind of environmental assumptions that we're making that could change. So, our view is, at this early stage in the year, there's just no reason to be changing our full year guidance. We'll certainly be in a much better position to do that after our next quarter earnings call.\nGeorge Hill: Okay, that's super helpful. And then, maybe just a quick follow-up is, did we see a full quarter of the CVS repricing this quarter? And is there any way to call out the impact of that?\nDavid Evans: We did see the full quarter. And we have not provided any specificity in terms of the annual impact of that contract renewal.\nMike Kaufmann: Thanks.\nGeorge Hill: Okay. Helpful, thank you.\nKevin Moran: Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. We will now take the next question from Glen Santangelo of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nGlen Santangelo: Oh, yeah. Thanks and good morning. Mike, I just wanted to follow up on the strength in the Medical business. In the past few years, you talked about the challenging market conditions, some of the supply chain issues. It sounds like this quarter, the company did a great job on the cost side. But what else has changed to help drive that performance, so we can maybe think about the sustainability of the results, you posted this quarter?\nMike Kaufmann: Yeah, thanks for the question. I feel really good about the Med segment. They performed a little better than we expected in Q1 and really happy with the transition of Steve Mason in his role. He's done an excellent job of getting up to speed so far and really surrounded himself with a solid team. SG&A clearly was a component of our performance in the quarter. But there are multiple areas where we are working through various performance improvement. For one example, service levels now are not only back to where they were at the acquisition of patient recovery products, but are actually better than at any time while we've held the business. So, we've made a lot of progress in service levels. We're making solid progress on both SG&A and items that will really drive COGS. And we're in different innings on each one of those, but really happy so far with what we saw in the first quarter of Medical.\nGlen Santangelo: Thanks. Maybe I just have one follow-up for Dave. Dave, you maintained the guidance for the full year, but you called out specifically that the operating profit in 2Q would be lower than Q1. Could you maybe just help us think about some of the assumptions in that sequential second quarter or some of the seasonal items that are maybe driving that outlook in 2Q? Thanks.\nDavid Evans: Yeah, absolutely. So, I'd say \u2013 first of all, we said modestly lower. And we think about that, we think about a variety of factors that could change from quarter to quarter. One, for example, would be our SG&A spend. We've got a large inventory of investment opportunities to drive long-term improvements, and those are ramping up. And so, the level of the spend, the pace of that spend, we expect to increase in our second quarter.  Further, we've talked about the CVS and the Kroger's contract renewal being effective July 1st, we do have other contract renewals in much smaller scale, but yet other contract renewals will be occurring in the second quarter and throughout the year. And finally, I would also say that we have some customers that have experienced difficulty either through bankruptcy or other financial distress where we're expecting some modestly lower volume in the second quarter than the first quarter. And as that volume declines, we'll capture our fair share of that, but we'll only capture our fair share of that is our current assumption. So, there's a lot more depth in that, but I'd say those are some of the headlines that give us some reason to believe that Q2 won't be just simply a mirror image of Q1.\nGlen Santangelo: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yeah. Hi, good morning. My question is related to the opioid comments. When we think about that $5.6 billion that you're now reserving, if that ends up being the final number and within that 18-year timeframe, would that have any impact on the business, the core business? And if so, do you have \u2013 what degree of freedom do you have to offset that with additional streamlining initiatives?\nMike Kaufmann: Yeah, thanks for the question. It broke up a little bit, Ricky. So, if I don't quite get the answer right, feel free to follow-up on that, particularly. I can't provide a lot of details on it. But, first of all, the settlement is spread over 18 years. And so, that's important to know. We continue to believe that that settlement is something that will be a consideration as we look at capital deployment, but not a limitation as to when we look at capital employment or investments. We do believe that the overall settlement framework is something that is supported by a bipartisan group of state attorneys general and it does provide a framework by which hopefully we can continue to not only get this behind us, but also get meaningful funds to the people that need it, begin looking at the distribution of the free goods that are out there and also look at other ways that the industry can work together to improve the overall monitoring of opioids. So, I'll stop right there and see if I was able to answer your question or not.\nRicky Goldwasser: No, you did. Thank you, Mike. Let me just have a quick follow-up, or maybe not so quick. But when we think about the long-term financial profile. Obviously, in the quarter, revenue up mid-single digits and profit were down because of the renewals that you talked about and we'll see throughout the year. But when we step back and we think about the industry on a steady state in your assets, and once you normalize for the renewals and taking into account all the streamlining and efficiencies that you talked about in your prepared comments, what type of operating profit growth do you think the business can support long-term with a mid-single-digit type top line growth?\nMike Kaufmann: Yeah. Thanks for the question. It's too early for us to give any real comments on 2021 and beyond. I would just say that we feel really good about the progress that we made this quarter, both in investing in the growth areas that we've talked about, Specialty at Home and our services businesses, but also getting after our cost structure. I think Dave made a comment that's really important, is this isn't just a cost reduction, this is taking entire cost structures out in a way that they won't come back, that the culture and the way the leadership is working is really driving at prioritizing and focusing us on the right things, so we're spending dollars in the right space, taking advantage of digital technologies, robotic automation, AI, et cetera, in order to really drive our cost structure down. So, we feel really good about achieving our overall $500 million number, our $130 million number for this year and really have this built into our overall culture. But, again, it's just too early for us to make comments on 2021 and beyond, but we feel that we are not only getting after our cost structure, but investing for growth, which is really important.\nKevin Moran: Next question.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee of Cowen. Please go ahead.\nCharles Rhyee: With Cowen. Yeah. Hey, thanks for taking the questions, Mike. Just one going back to the opioids real quickly. Your comments \u2013 and one of your peers today sounds a lot more positive, I would say, maybe than the comments from many other companies the other week. Anything kind of change in the last week or two that kind of increased the sort of the optimism here in terms of getting towards a global settlement here?\nMike Kaufmann: Wouldn't say anything changed. Let me just step back and make sure that we're on the same page. As you know, a few weeks ago, we settled with two Ohio counties, which, by doing that, enabled us to move forward with this framework. That was an important component of being able to get that behind this, so all of the parties involved in the global framework could move forward and begin working on. So, that's an important thing to know. We clearly have a global settlement framework and structure with the $18 billion over 18 years with our component being $5.56 billion. We've also agreed upon distributing the free treatment medications for 10 years and we've agreed that, when we get this behind us, we can all work together to look at the way state, federal government, distributors, everybody work together to monitor opioid shipments and uses, so that we can work together. We think the desire and \u2013 if we can get this behind us, how we'll bring meaningful relief in both funds and distribution of treatment medication to the people that need it is important, and so we feel positive that folks will work hard on this to get this going. So, again, nothing specific, but our belief is that the way this is structured that this is the right accounting for us at this point in time.\nCharles Rhyee: And if I could just follow-up, obviously, if you look at the number of plaintiffs \u2013 I forget the last count. It's upwards of 2,000 or so. Obviously, the states are a big component of it, but you have a lot of smaller plaintiffs. As I read some of the comments from AmeriSys as well as who speaks to it, it kind of suggests that not only state AGs, but also a lot of the other plaintiffs. Can you kind of discuss like the participation of the smaller entities in this? In other words, if you get this framework done, do we still have a long tail of small plaintiffs kind of coming after the players here? Or is it kind of \u2013 this is structured in a way, would you think, that this will achieve [indiscernible] looking forward?\nMike Kaufmann: Yeah, good question. I would say this. You could probably put them in many, many buckets. Well, let me put them in three broad buckets. There's state, there's the political subdivisions, the counties, the cities and then this will become more private plaintiffs, which might be pension funds or individuals and those things. This global framework is put together to settle on the first two, all of the state claims as well as the cities and all the political subdivisions. And the accrual that we put on the books is to represent the global framework we did for those first two buckets. That third bucket, which there is also still suits out there, are very different and it's a mixture of different things and those are still out there and will be things that we will have to address going forward.\nKevin Moran: Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Steven Valiquette of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSteven Valiquette: Great, thanks. Good morning, Mike and Dave. So, kind of following up a little bit on that last question. One of your peers had some very different language in their press release this morning about when they make accruals and when they don't. But without getting too much into that, I guess, the question is, is there any possibility that Cardinal's further along or closer to a settlement agreement than some of your distributor peers? Is there any scenario where Cardinal may reach a global settlement, but your peers may not? Or is it kind of all three year or none around the global settlement? Just curious to get your extra thoughts on that. Thanks.\nMike Kaufmann: Yeah, thanks for the question. No, I would say that Cardinal is not doing anything different. This is just our understanding and belief of the way the global framework is set up that we believe the accounting that we've done is appropriate for the circumstances in our \u2013 on that. \nSteven Valiquette: And one of your peers talked about a settlement maybe still being months away and that seemed to be different than what some investors were thinking. To me, I think that's still a pretty short time horizon given the number of parties involved, but is there any extra color on when do you think the timing could be nailed down on a settlement?\nMike Kaufmann: Yeah, it's really hard to actually predict timing, but it's not something that we think is going to get done tomorrow. There is work to be done. And as I mentioned, we believe settling the two counties, getting that behind us and allowing the state AGs to begin the process of working with the political subdivisions, plaintiffs, attorneys, et cetera, that that process has begun and we're fully supportive and we'll do what we can to help in that process. And it will take some amount of time, but it's really hard to predict what that will be.\nKevin Moran: Next question.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Lisa Gill from JP Morgan.\nLisa Gill: Thanks very much. Good morning, Mike. As we think about the global settlement, how do I think about it from a tax perspective? I'm just trying to figure out what the impact will be to cash flow. You talked about the fact that there'll be some impact, but really shouldn't change how you think about capital deployment? So, that would just be my first question, was how do we think about the tax implications.\nDavid Evans: Yeah, Lisa. This is Dave. Thanks for the question. Look, the intent of this is consistent with the public policy and guidelines of the IRS and the state tax authorities to make this tax deductible. Having said that, the details and specifics of this agreement really just aren't there right now, to provide the level of precision that, ultimately, we'll have, nor is the complete clarity of the tax code there at this stage. So, from an accounting perspective, we just followed accounting guidance and established what we believe is an appropriate reserve for what will be tax deductible. But that, I would say, will continue to become more clear as time marches on and the specifics of both the tax code and the settlement offer become more clear.\nMike Kaufmann: And as far as the cash flow impact goes, Lisa, as you said, while it's spread over 18 years specifically, how it will be paid and funded each year is still being worked out. So, it's hard for us to give you any real color on the exact timing and impact of cash flows. But as you can imagine, we spread it out over time in order to be able to still manage our business effectively going forward.\nLisa Gill: And then, Mike, if I could just sneak one in on policy. Thoughts around re-importation and the potential impact that that could have to Cardinal and drug distribution in general?\nMike Kaufmann: Yeah, it's an interesting question. It's one of those things that it's probably a little too early to get into a lot of detail. This is something that I can remember working on 15 years ago when we thought it was going to be imminent and working on setting up all of the capabilities internally to help make sure that, if it did happen, there would be a safe supply chain. And I think the focus on re-importation has to be on patient safety. And I think that Cardinal was as well-positioned as anybody that, if this were to get some legs, that we would be able to work with folks to help make sure that any re-importation was done on a safe basis. It's hard to imagine that it could be material in any way to affect our businesses, but if it did happen, I think Cardinal was well-positioned to help any of the folks that would do that.\nKevin Moran: Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs.\nRobert Jones: Great, thanks for the questions. Mike, I just want to go back to some comments from the prepared remarks around the financial distress of certain customers. I guess, first, I'm assuming that's some retail independents, but wanted to confirm that. And then, could you talk a little bit about what you think is driving this? Was it kind of a one-off related to a certain pocket of customers or is there anything more systemic you're seeing in the marketplace around the health of some of your maybe perhaps smaller customers?\nMike Kaufmann: No, those comments were not meant \u2013 so I'm really glad you asked, were not meant to talk about the small customers. This was really about the bankruptcy of Fred's and the continuing restructuring of the Kmart account \u2013 two accounts that we've had that we've been managing over time that were both generic buyers of ours. And as those volumes declined due to their financial situation, that has had some impact on us. But that's really what we were referring to in those comments.\nRobert Jones: Got it. Got it. No, thanks for the clarification. And, I guess, just one follow up on the Medical guidance, you guys mentioned that you're monitoring the med device tax and tariffs as it relates to guidance. And, clearly, the guidance would imply a deceleration over the course of the year. So, I just wanted to maybe get a better sense of what maybe the guidance looks like if in fact those items don't, in fact, come to fruition. And just one point related to Medical. I wanted to make sure I was thinking about this right. I believe you're lapping a fairly meaningful headwind from a supplier charge in 4Q. Wanted to confirm that that was right as we just think about the cadence around the Medical guide for the rest of the year.\nDavid Evans: Yeah, Bob. That's absolutely correct in terms of the second half of your statement. We will be lapping in the fourth quarter a reasonable charge that should be non-recurring.  With respect to the balance of the year, we have not built in \u2013 as we said last quarter with the full-year guidance, we've built in nothing with respect to the med device tax. So, if it doesn't come to fruition, then that's consistent with the guidance we provided. And, clearly, if it does, then that's going to be a headwind we're going to have to manage through. Tariffs are just such a dynamic topic that we've done our best to offset the tariffs that are in effect now. But that, again, is changing. So, I'd say if that would completely cease any further dialog around tariffs, then what's been announced today, we've more or less been able to manage through that. What I would say is there are still a lot of other SG&A initiatives that Mike talked about that do have a longer runway and, therefore, they aren't necessarily all \u2013 the cadence isn't equally distributed amongst four quarters.  I'd really highlight some of the supply chain initiatives that have a long runway and won't necessarily bear fruit for \u2013 it could be two, three years, but we are incurring costs to begin to plan for those this year. And as well, the sales force restructuring that we've discussed as well is kind of in-flight through the course of the year. So, that's not something you can just kind of ratably divide it by four and say it's going to be equal in terms of the cost or the benefits. So, look, you're right in that the fourth quarter does have a tailwind this year and the fact that this is non-recurrence of a charge, but we just \u2013 we feel, I guess, I'd say, cautiously optimistic for the year based on the first quarter, but feels too early at this stage, given all these variables that are out there to call anything up at this early stage.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Eric Percher from Nephron Research.\nDolph Warburton: Hi, this is Dolph on for Eric. Question about the in kind portion of the potential settlement. If we take $1 billion of value, is that $1 billion of revenue? And if so, are you able to determine kind of the costs? Or, I guess, the better question is, what does an in-kind service really look like for Cardinal?\nMike Kaufmann: Yeah, it's a great question. That would be an area that is still looking to be defined yet, but, essentially, they're one of the folks that's settling in the case, is contributing free goods is the essential idea here. And the thought is that the three distributors would agree to distribute those free goods to the people that need it. None of the actual cost of distributing those free goods, because we don't have enough information on that, are included in our overall accrual. That being said, we at this time don't think that would be material, but don't have enough information to know. But the concept is just being able to take those drugs and then using the efficiency of our overall supply chain of the distributors to get those to the folks that need them most.\nDolph Warburton : Great, thank you. And then, just a follow-up. The difference between the charge listed in the text of the release and what's listed as an add back pre-tax, it looks like about $40 million. I assume that's legal services in the quarter? Or is there something else causing the difference?\nMike Kaufmann: No, the breakdown\u2026\nDavid Evans: We've got two components. The primary two components. Of course, our pro rata share of $18 billion and then there's the pro rata share of the two Ohio county settlements. The remaining small difference relates to \u2013 I believe we may have spoken in the past about, which is in our med supply business, our Cordis business, the IVS product, which we continue to accrue for a loss, continue to see on that as well. It's a fairly small number, but that \u2013 if you get to the third decimal digit, that's where you're going to find, is the IVS\u2026\nMike Kaufmann:\nKevin Moran: Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. We will take our next question from Stephen Baxter from Wolfe Research.\nStephen Baxter: Thanks for the question. I wanted to follow-up on the opioid discussion. Really appreciate all the color and insight you've provided thus far. I wanted to come back to the outlook for share repurchase. So, if we were to treat the settlement like debt, this settlement would point to trailing leverage approaching 4.5 times. So, it sounds like you're saying that the settlement framework, as currently proposed, would not be a limitation on capital deployment. So, I'm hoping you can help us square your comfort level with this implied leverage. How you think the debt rating agencies are going to look at this issue and the importance of maintaining an investment grade rate to the company? Thanks.\nMike Kaufmann: Yeah. First of all, I would say that \u2013 I wouldn't say that \u2013 remember, this is a consideration. So, we don't see it necessarily as a limitation, but, clearly, once we understand the flows of the cash over the 18-year period, we're going to have to take that in consideration in all of our capital deployment pieces. But let me turn it over to Dave to give you a little color on our thoughts around the rating agencies and what we could talk about.\nDavid Evans: Look, first of all, we've got good relationships with the rating agencies and we stay in close contact with them. So, it's continuous dialog.  Second, our investment grade credit rating is very important to us. So, it's something that we value and we'll continue to monitor and manage \u2013 to maintain that.  Let's say, when you look at the leverage, the numbers that you're citing, a couple of factors. One, recall, this year, we've committed externally to de-levering by at least $1 billion. So, as we look forward on this, that number will be coming down. And second of all, I'm not sure \u2013 I'm not going to speculate on the credit rating agencies or opine on where they're going to land, but I think there's multiple scenarios between saying this is zero liability or it's the book accounting accrual liability. For example, you could look at \u2013 it's just a discount in future cash flow of all the future years' payments, which nets you a number that's quite a bit smaller than the headline $5.6 billion. So, we'll see how the credit rating agencies opine on this, where they land. But at this point, I'd say we'll be focused on this. We will make a substantial bite of the apple this year and we'll continue to monitor this in the broader scheme of our capital allocation policy in the years ahead.\nStephen Baxter: Great, thanks. One quick follow-up. Just given how you started out the year on cash flow, can your remind us what you're expecting for the full year for operating cash flow, or at least some directional context relative for the past couple of years? Thanks.\nDavid Evans: Yeah. Look, we have not provided cash flow guidance in the past and we didn't provide it this year. So, I'm not going to speak to that. It's just \u2013 I'd say, if you look at the fundamentals, the fundamentals are not structurally different than last year. We continue to work on our working capital efficiency initiatives. We continue to drive strong cash flow. You will see anomalies based on a point in time, but I wouldn't say we expect anything materially different year-over-year without providing a finer point to it in terms of giving you any specific guidance.\nKevin Moran: Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from John Ransom from Raymond James.\nJohn Ransom: Hey, good morning. Just going back to the stuff we used to talk about a lot, Mike. I know you've probably answered this question 18,000 times over your career. But it's interesting to us what's happening with the generic cycle, in that the pricing at a manufacturer level has certainly firmed. So, we calculate deflation having dropped from the high teens to something like the mid-single digits, whereas at the pharmacy level reimbursement pressure just continues. So, you're seeing an accelerated squeeze at the Pharmacy. So, I just wonder you guys being a student of the pharmacy and you're already talking about Fred's and Kmart, how long can this go on without just continued chaos in the independent pharmacy channel?\nMike Kaufmann: Well, that's a tough question to really talk about. So, I'll give you a little bit of color. A few things come to mind. I'll talk about it from both sides. First of all, I think our \u2013 all of our customers are \u2013 are there a few one-offs like a Fred's and a Kmart? Yeah. But as we look, our retail independents, in general, have stayed at roughly the same number over several years now. They continue to find not only ways to work through the reimbursement challenges, but to continue to find other ways to compete in the marketplace, whether it be through packaging, through additional services, through front end, through just the high quality service that they give every day. And I think the chains continue to do the same through automation and other programs themselves. So, I think that the chains, including the independents, all of the retail pharmacies, continue to be an important component of getting pharmaceuticals to patients. And so, it's something we're always going to keep our eyes on, but I think they've learned how to compete in this marketplace. As far as on our side, we have seen some improvement as we said in the market dynamics around the sell side pricing side. Remember, our generics program is made up of four components and we've always said it's sell side, buy side, launches and overall volumes with our customers. Because of some of the customers we've mentioned, we've seen a little bit of weakness on the volume side than we expected. And the new item launches, as you know, are always highly fluctuating and can change. That's been a little less than we expected so far this year. And all that netting together, our generics program came in about as expected.. \nJohn Ransom: Okay. And just switching gears. A philosophical question. We're all kind of scratching our heads about how to treat this settlement. But if this is going to \u2013 if it's an 18-year settlement and it's just an annual cash outlay, why would that be added back to adjusted earnings? It's not something like amortization, it's non-cash or it's not a one-year one-time. Isn't this just best thought of as a reduction in adjusted earnings for almost 20 years? Why would we add this back?\nDavid Evans: So, the way I'd answer that is, this isn't going to be a charge to the P&L over 18 years. It's a cash cost. But from a GAAP accounting P&L expense perspective, the charge is recognized initially once and that was what you saw recorded this quarter. And so, recognizing a 18-year charge, we did call out as a GAAP to non-GAAP adjustment, appropriately so. So, I think we might be mixing and matching cash and expense charges. Does that answer your question?\nJohn Ransom: I mean, if I could just push back on that, it seems like we want to have it both ways in terms of \u2013 if it's helpful, we add it back. Yeah, I get, you can take the charge year one, but it's going to be a reduction of what I would call cash earnings. And so, yeah, add back amortization, that's not cash. I get that. Or a one-time. But this is an actual reduction. So, it just seems like we're having it both ways to take this big accounting charge, but then add it back to adjusted earnings. So, yeah, the mismatch, seems like we're a little bit having it both ways. That's all.\nDavid Evans: Yeah, I understand your question. I think what I \u2013 look, when we make GAAP, non-GAAP adjustments, that's for when we have an expense or a credit in the current period P&L that we add back or subtract out to get to non-GAAP. In the case of this opioid accrual, we won't have a P&L charge in future periods. So, there won't be anything to add back to get to non-GAAP earnings. Now, I suppose \u2013 I think you will look at this from a cash perspective and certainly everyone can model the cash flow impact for the next 18 years, but that's separate from \u2013 it just won't really be in the equation in terms of a GAAP versus non-GAAP adjustment because it won't be a charge in future P&Ls. So, it won't be anything to add back .\nKevin Moran: Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Eric Coldwell of Baird. Please go ahead.\nEric Coldwell: Thanks. Good morning. All of my snazzy questions have been asked already, but I have a couple of technical ones. I think it was Bob that asked about the medical device tax. You admitted it's not in guidance. It could come back. What would be the actual impact or best estimate of the impact if it does come back in dollar terms? Secondarily, commodity cost inputs and FX in the Medical segment. I'm curious if you can give us some sense of the impact those had on profit in Medical. Thank you so much.\nDavid Evans: Yeah. So, first, with respect to the medical device tax, we don't have complete clarity on this. So, I don't have a precise answer for you. But I would say that, on an annualized basis, we believe it could be in the neighborhood of $40 million to $50 million on an annual basis. Okay? So, if we look at for \u2013 if it's effective in January, the second half of the year, you'd pro rate that. Again, I'll just kind of caution that that's based on a lack of perfect clarity and information. And so, if that were to actually happen, we'd be prepared to provide a more precise answer to that at that stage. The second question was related to FX. Look, we have FX that shows up in different areas of our P&L. We have some that's showing up in the segments. And then, you may have noticed in interest and other, we have other changed a bit, and that's principally driven by FX. I would say that, on a net basis, FX in the first quarter was reasonably neutral, was not a material driver positive or negative. I think the team is doing an excellent job in managing this and navigating through this as appropriate.\nEric Coldwell: And the commodity costs?\nDavid Evans: Oh, I'm sorry commodity costs.\nEric Coldwell: [indiscernible] pointed that out yesterday, yeah.\nDavid Evans: Yeah, I know. I apologize. So, commodities, for us, in the first quarter, I'd describe them as a small headwind. They were a headwind, but not in a material way.\nEric Coldwell: Thanks very much.\nKevin Moran: Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our final question from Kevin Caliendo from UBS.\nKevin Caliendo: Great. Thanks for getting me in, guys. So, my question on the opioids is just how much confidence do you have \u2013 that $18 billion over 18 years \u2013 that this will be the final layout between the level 3 \u2013 or the tier 3 groupings that you mentioned earlier, that this is really going to be the final number for the MDL and for everybody else and that you can really put this to bed with this kind of settlement?\nMike Kaufmann: Yeah, thanks for the question, Kevin. Look, it's still too early to tell. As I said, this global framework does only impact the first two buckets. There is no accrual or ability to even estimate and understand the size of the last bucket that we talked about. But as far as the global framework, we have to separate both the accounting and the likelihood of this getting done in our mind and this framework is something that we support. We like that it's being supported by a bipartisan group of AGs and it's something that we're behind, but it's still too early to tell you whether or not it will be successful. But we do think not only is it something that we can support, and it has the support of them, but it's something that's important to the people that need it most because it will get dollars, free drugs and some potentially new processes out there that I think all benefit the country.\nKevin Caliendo: Sure. And just one quick follow-up, when are out visiting you guys, you talked about a restructuring of the Medical sales force compensation. Did that impact 3Q in any way? And how are you thinking about the impact of what the incentive program for sales force might have or have had on Medical going forward?\nMike Kaufmann: Yeah, that's something \u2013 it's one of the really key things going on in Medical that Steve and the team are leading. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, this restructure is a component of not only compensation and sales incentives, but also around how we go to market to best address selling to the customers they want \u2013 to our customers, the way they want to be sold to. So, we did a lot of work out talking to and understanding the way our customer base would like us to come to them and how they would like to be serviced. And so, this restructuring was highly defined by a lot of detailed work. We started to \u2013 we put it in place in our Q1. And as far as incentives go, changing the jobs, interviewing folks for roles, both internally and deciding that, in some roles, we needed to go externally for the right level of talent the way we want to work and we would expect that that entire restructuring will be done and behind us by the end of our Q3 and that we would start to see benefits from that next year in FY 2021. So, we're really excited about it and like the progress we're making.\nKevin Moran: So, next question.\nOperator: There are no further questions. So, I'd like to hand back to your host for any additional or closing remarks.\nMike Kaufmann: Well, thank you all for joining us this morning. We're really pleased to be off to a solid start to our FY 2020 and we look forward to seeing many of you in the coming months. Take care, everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mike Kaufmann",
            "content": "Thanks, Kevin. And congratulations on your new role. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I am here with Dave Evans and I'd like to welcome him to his first call as our interim CFO. Dave has done a great job getting up to speed over the past few months. I'm grateful for his leadership and experience as we conduct our search for a permanent CFO. This morning, we'll cover our progress and our path forward. I'll start with a few high-level thoughts on the quarter and then Dave will cover the financials. I'll close with some thoughts on how we will build on the solid start to the year. We remain confident in our strategic direction as we focus on driving both efficiency and growth. Our Q1 performance validates our short-term progress and longer-term path. At the enterprise-level, our disciplined cost management is enabling strategic reinvestment across both segments as well as in critical, functional areas. In the Pharma segment, we're seeing early signs of positive trends. And although we still have work to do, we are making progress in key areas. In Medical, we're encouraged by early traction from our improvement efforts, as well as the initial returns from ongoing investments in our growth platforms. I'll share more about this work in both segments later in my remarks. But, first, I'll turn to Dave to walk you through our results and specific milestones we achieved in Q1. Thanks, Dave. This settlement with the two Ohio counties enables the discussions around the global settlement framework to proceed. The global framework, which is supported by a bipartisan group of state attorneys general, is designed to resolve all pending and potential opioid lawsuits by states and political subdivisions. Importantly, with the commitment of both funds and the distribution of treatment medications, this framework provides an immediate solution to the communities and families that need it most. As you know, we have an important, but limited role, in the pharmaceutical supply chain. We take that role and the responsibility that comes with it seriously. We remain committed to being part of the solution to this epidemic and that is why we are committed to the global framework and continue to be actively involved in its progression. With that said, if this framework is not successful, we are prepared to vigorously defend ourselves. Shifting now to our strategic direction in the focus areas I mentioned last quarter. I said on our last call that, in Pharma, we're focused on two things \u2013 further enhancing our core distribution business and fueling sustained growth in key areas. Regarding our core distribution business, we are focused on continuously enhancing the customer experience, improving pricing and contract discipline, and reducing costs. We are making significant investments throughout the segment with a longer-term view of the business. For example, we're implementing digital technologies that will improve visibility and enhance our pricing capabilities. In addition, we recently began a program to improve our e-commerce capabilities and enhance the experience for our customers. Beyond investing in our core businesses, we are focused on investing to drive growth in rapidly-evolving spaces in healthcare and identifying ways to further differentiate ourselves and shape the future. For example, in Specialty, we recently made a multi-million dollar investment to establish a new distribution center outside of Nashville, Tennessee with a state-of-the-art, cold chain complex including deep frozen technology. This new facility will enable us to combine two existing distribution centers, streamline technologies to drive operational efficiencies and support continued growth in rapidly evolving areas of the Specialty industry. We're also investing in our higher margin services businesses, which we call our connected care offering, to build greater connectivity between manufacturers, payers, pharmacies and patients. We will continue to purposely redeploy capital in these and other areas that align to our strategy. Moving on the Medical, we are building out our commercial and operational capabilities across the segment and continuing investment in key areas. Dave shared some of these activities, which include enhancing our commercial approach, streamlining our supply chain, and rationalizing our footprint, are showing early signs of success. Commercially, we are more closely aligning ourselves with the needs of our customers and incentivizing our sales force to sell Cardinal brand products. We expect these enhancements to be complete by Q3 and their benefit will begin to materialize in FY 2021. As part of our supply chain work, we are reconfiguring our North American network. For example, in California, we are consolidating two of our distribution centers into a modern flagship center, which will enhance customer experience at a lower cost to serve and position the segment for growth. Additionally, with respect to our global supply chain, we more than doubled our manufacturing footprint with the patient recovery acquisition. We are already leveraging some synergies, but we see a path to capture significantly more. To that end, within the next quarter, we will finalize plans to reduce cost and deliver industry-leading service across our global network. These plans will take some time to execute. So, we have a strong governance structure in place and are committed to diligently managing our costs to realize the greatest long-term benefit. As in Pharma, we're making significant investments across the Medical segment to improve the customer experience and drive growth in both the products and services spaces. For example, as Patient Care shifts more toward the home, we continue to capture growth opportunities through Cardinal Health at Home solutions. We are committed to further developing this business and are redeploying some of our cost savings benefits in this area to improve the customer, healthcare professional and patient experiences. In Medical services, another business unit in the segment with sustained growth and strong results, we're building additional digital and data capabilities, modernizing our operating systems and streamlining clinical and operational workflows. This will reduce costs for both us and for our customers and, importantly, will improve patient safety. We recognize the components of the work across our products and services spaces will take time to translate into sustained growth and results. We remain committed to fueling this momentum. On the enterprise level, as Dave and I shared earlier, our cost savings initiatives are producing tangible benefits across the company. We expect to meet or exceed our $130 million commitment for the year, primarily through SG&A-related activities. Our initiatives to improve gross margin, like those in Medical to right-size our manufacturing and distribution footprint, will contribute more significantly to our five-year, $500 million savings goal as they will ramp up over the next few years. With these initiatives, leaders across the company are evaluating internal operating models and identifying opportunities to leverage automation, analytics and additional technologies that not only drive efficiencies and contribute to our savings goals, but to improve insights. One example is our recent partnership with Genpact, a global professional services firm focused on digital business transformation, who will help us transform our finance operating model. As part of this partnership, Genpact will create a data analytics and FP&A hub here in Central Ohio to drive industry-leading innovation. About 200 current Cardinal Health FP&A and data analytics employees are transitioning to the Genpact hub next week, alongside a team of Genpact's process, finance and data analytics experts. This is just one of the many initiatives across the company to streamline our processes, leverage our scale and enhance our data capabilities. We will share additional updates on these initiatives as they develop. As we drive these type of efficiencies across the company, we will fuel growth through balanced capital allocation. This includes reinvesting in the business, returning cash to shareholders and improving our financial flexibility, while maintaining our investment grade status. We remain committed to paying down at least $1 billion of long-term debt this fiscal year, which includes the $450 million of debt maturing in Q2. To close, in Q1, we generated positive momentum across the company. We are pleased with this start to the year and recognize that there is more work ahead. We have a strong foundation of scale and industry knowledge. With our talented and dedicated employees, we're committed to building on this foundation to adapt, innovate and lead as our industry evolves. With that, I'll now open it up for questions. Go ahead. I'll let Dave start. Thanks. Yeah, thanks for the question. I feel really good about the Med segment. They performed a little better than we expected in Q1 and really happy with the transition of Steve Mason in his role. He's done an excellent job of getting up to speed so far and really surrounded himself with a solid team. SG&A clearly was a component of our performance in the quarter. But there are multiple areas where we are working through various performance improvement. For one example, service levels now are not only back to where they were at the acquisition of patient recovery products, but are actually better than at any time while we've held the business. So, we've made a lot of progress in service levels. We're making solid progress on both SG&A and items that will really drive COGS. And we're in different innings on each one of those, but really happy so far with what we saw in the first quarter of Medical. Yeah, thanks for the question. It broke up a little bit, Ricky. So, if I don't quite get the answer right, feel free to follow-up on that, particularly. I can't provide a lot of details on it. But, first of all, the settlement is spread over 18 years. And so, that's important to know. We continue to believe that that settlement is something that will be a consideration as we look at capital deployment, but not a limitation as to when we look at capital employment or investments. We do believe that the overall settlement framework is something that is supported by a bipartisan group of state attorneys general and it does provide a framework by which hopefully we can continue to not only get this behind us, but also get meaningful funds to the people that need it, begin looking at the distribution of the free goods that are out there and also look at other ways that the industry can work together to improve the overall monitoring of opioids. So, I'll stop right there and see if I was able to answer your question or not. Yeah. Thanks for the question. It's too early for us to give any real comments on 2021 and beyond. I would just say that we feel really good about the progress that we made this quarter, both in investing in the growth areas that we've talked about, Specialty at Home and our services businesses, but also getting after our cost structure. I think Dave made a comment that's really important, is this isn't just a cost reduction, this is taking entire cost structures out in a way that they won't come back, that the culture and the way the leadership is working is really driving at prioritizing and focusing us on the right things, so we're spending dollars in the right space, taking advantage of digital technologies, robotic automation, AI, et cetera, in order to really drive our cost structure down. So, we feel really good about achieving our overall $500 million number, our $130 million number for this year and really have this built into our overall culture. But, again, it's just too early for us to make comments on 2021 and beyond, but we feel that we are not only getting after our cost structure, but investing for growth, which is really important. Wouldn't say anything changed. Let me just step back and make sure that we're on the same page. As you know, a few weeks ago, we settled with two Ohio counties, which, by doing that, enabled us to move forward with this framework. That was an important component of being able to get that behind this, so all of the parties involved in the global framework could move forward and begin working on. So, that's an important thing to know. We clearly have a global settlement framework and structure with the $18 billion over 18 years with our component being $5.56 billion. We've also agreed upon distributing the free treatment medications for 10 years and we've agreed that, when we get this behind us, we can all work together to look at the way state, federal government, distributors, everybody work together to monitor opioid shipments and uses, so that we can work together. We think the desire and \u2013 if we can get this behind us, how we'll bring meaningful relief in both funds and distribution of treatment medication to the people that need it is important, and so we feel positive that folks will work hard on this to get this going. So, again, nothing specific, but our belief is that the way this is structured that this is the right accounting for us at this point in time. Yeah, good question. I would say this. You could probably put them in many, many buckets. Well, let me put them in three broad buckets. There's state, there's the political subdivisions, the counties, the cities and then this will become more private plaintiffs, which might be pension funds or individuals and those things. This global framework is put together to settle on the first two, all of the state claims as well as the cities and all the political subdivisions. And the accrual that we put on the books is to represent the global framework we did for those first two buckets. That third bucket, which there is also still suits out there, are very different and it's a mixture of different things and those are still out there and will be things that we will have to address going forward. Yeah, thanks for the question. No, I would say that Cardinal is not doing anything different. This is just our understanding and belief of the way the global framework is set up that we believe the accounting that we've done is appropriate for the circumstances in our \u2013 on that. Yeah, it's really hard to actually predict timing, but it's not something that we think is going to get done tomorrow. There is work to be done. And as I mentioned, we believe settling the two counties, getting that behind us and allowing the state AGs to begin the process of working with the political subdivisions, plaintiffs, attorneys, et cetera, that that process has begun and we're fully supportive and we'll do what we can to help in that process. And it will take some amount of time, but it's really hard to predict what that will be. And as far as the cash flow impact goes, Lisa, as you said, while it's spread over 18 years specifically, how it will be paid and funded each year is still being worked out. So, it's hard for us to give you any real color on the exact timing and impact of cash flows. But as you can imagine, we spread it out over time in order to be able to still manage our business effectively going forward. Yeah, it's an interesting question. It's one of those things that it's probably a little too early to get into a lot of detail. This is something that I can remember working on 15 years ago when we thought it was going to be imminent and working on setting up all of the capabilities internally to help make sure that, if it did happen, there would be a safe supply chain. And I think the focus on re-importation has to be on patient safety. And I think that Cardinal was as well-positioned as anybody that, if this were to get some legs, that we would be able to work with folks to help make sure that any re-importation was done on a safe basis. It's hard to imagine that it could be material in any way to affect our businesses, but if it did happen, I think Cardinal was well-positioned to help any of the folks that would do that. No, those comments were not meant \u2013 so I'm really glad you asked, were not meant to talk about the small customers. This was really about the bankruptcy of Fred's and the continuing restructuring of the Kmart account \u2013 two accounts that we've had that we've been managing over time that were both generic buyers of ours. And as those volumes declined due to their financial situation, that has had some impact on us. But that's really what we were referring to in those comments. Yeah, it's a great question. That would be an area that is still looking to be defined yet, but, essentially, they're one of the folks that's settling in the case, is contributing free goods is the essential idea here. And the thought is that the three distributors would agree to distribute those free goods to the people that need it. None of the actual cost of distributing those free goods, because we don't have enough information on that, are included in our overall accrual. That being said, we at this time don't think that would be material, but don't have enough information to know. But the concept is just being able to take those drugs and then using the efficiency of our overall supply chain of the distributors to get those to the folks that need them most. No, the breakdown... Kevin Moran: Next question please. Yeah. First of all, I would say that \u2013 I wouldn't say that \u2013 remember, this is a consideration. So, we don't see it necessarily as a limitation, but, clearly, once we understand the flows of the cash over the 18-year period, we're going to have to take that in consideration in all of our capital deployment pieces. But let me turn it over to Dave to give you a little color on our thoughts around the rating agencies and what we could talk about. Well, that's a tough question to really talk about. So, I'll give you a little bit of color. A few things come to mind. I'll talk about it from both sides. First of all, I think our \u2013 all of our customers are \u2013 are there a few one-offs like a Fred's and a Kmart? Yeah. But as we look, our retail independents, in general, have stayed at roughly the same number over several years now. They continue to find not only ways to work through the reimbursement challenges, but to continue to find other ways to compete in the marketplace, whether it be through packaging, through additional services, through front end, through just the high quality service that they give every day. And I think the chains continue to do the same through automation and other programs themselves. So, I think that the chains, including the independents, all of the retail pharmacies, continue to be an important component of getting pharmaceuticals to patients. And so, it's something we're always going to keep our eyes on, but I think they've learned how to compete in this marketplace. As far as on our side, we have seen some improvement as we said in the market dynamics around the sell side pricing side. Remember, our generics program is made up of four components and we've always said it's sell side, buy side, launches and overall volumes with our customers. Because of some of the customers we've mentioned, we've seen a little bit of weakness on the volume side than we expected. And the new item launches, as you know, are always highly fluctuating and can change. That's been a little less than we expected so far this year. And all that netting together, our generics program came in about as expected.. Yeah, thanks for the question, Kevin. Look, it's still too early to tell. As I said, this global framework does only impact the first two buckets. There is no accrual or ability to even estimate and understand the size of the last bucket that we talked about. But as far as the global framework, we have to separate both the accounting and the likelihood of this getting done in our mind and this framework is something that we support. We like that it's being supported by a bipartisan group of AGs and it's something that we're behind, but it's still too early to tell you whether or not it will be successful. But we do think not only is it something that we can support, and it has the support of them, but it's something that's important to the people that need it most because it will get dollars, free drugs and some potentially new processes out there that I think all benefit the country. Yeah, that's something \u2013 it's one of the really key things going on in Medical that Steve and the team are leading. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, this restructure is a component of not only compensation and sales incentives, but also around how we go to market to best address selling to the customers they want \u2013 to our customers, the way they want to be sold to. So, we did a lot of work out talking to and understanding the way our customer base would like us to come to them and how they would like to be serviced. And so, this restructuring was highly defined by a lot of detailed work. We started to \u2013 we put it in place in our Q1. And as far as incentives go, changing the jobs, interviewing folks for roles, both internally and deciding that, in some roles, we needed to go externally for the right level of talent the way we want to work and we would expect that that entire restructuring will be done and behind us by the end of our Q3 and that we would start to see benefits from that next year in FY 2021. So, we're really excited about it and like the progress we're making. Well, thank you all for joining us this morning. We're really pleased to be off to a solid start to our FY 2020 and we look forward to seeing many of you in the coming months. Take care, everyone."

            "name": "David Evans",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. And thanks everyone for being with us today. I'm pleased to join you on my first call. I'll walk through the numbers and highlight a few actions taken in Q1 to demonstrate our commitment to long-term growth. Overall, I'm happy to report that we delivered earnings of $1.27 per share in the first quarter, which were ahead of our expectations. Total company revenue increased 6% versus last year to $37.3 billion. Consolidated gross margin increased 1% from last year to about $1.7 billion. The decline gross margin rate principally reflects year-over-year Pharma distribution contract renewals and products and distribution mix. SG&A, which includes variable distribution related expenses, improved 2% despite higher revenue. This improvement reflects sustained organization-wide efforts to streamline our cost structure. Mike might elaborate more on some of these efforts in a few minutes, but I'd like to say that just in the few months that I've been here, I've already seen this effort evolve from a cost reduction initiative to a broader cultural mindset of efficiency and improvement. Total operating earnings were $577 million, a 6% increase from the prior year, driven by performance in the Medical segment. Interest and other expenses were roughly flat versus prior year at $80 million. This reflects a decline in interest expense. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24%. This compares to last year's rate of 14%, which was impacted by changes to our international legal entity structure. Average diluted shares outstanding were $297 million, about $9 million fewer than last year. During the quarter, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program to opportunistically buy back $359 million of stock. We tired 80% of these shares in Q1 and expect to complete the program in our second quarter. Combining share repurchases, we returned well over $400 million to shareholders in the first quarter, demonstrating our continued commitment to look to deploying capital on a balanced, disciplined and shareholder-friendly way. Moving on to cash flow, operating cash for the quarter was a use of $653 million. As a reminder, timing, in particular, the day of the week in which the quarter ends, affects point in time cash flows. This dynamic negatively impacted our year-over-year cash flow for Q1, but will reverse in Q2. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.2 billion, which includes about $700 million held outside the US. So, I'll now transition to segment results, starting with Pharma. Revenue increased 6% to $33 billion, driven by sales growth in our Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty Solutions divisions. Segment profit decreased 3% to $398 million, which reflects the impact from Pharma distribution customer contract renewals. This was partially offset by the benefits of our ongoing cost savings initiatives and performance in our Specialty Solutions business. As a reminder, we record opioid related litigation expenses in the Pharma segment.  Before I leave Pharma, I want to note that our generics program performed roughly as expected. While we continue to see improvements in the market dynamics for generics, I would remind you that several variables impact the net performance of our generics program, including sourcing, volume, new item launches and sell side pricing. Overall, we're seeing positive trends and good progress in the Pharma segment. Mike will discuss our ongoing efforts to maintain this momentum. Transitioning to Medical, segment revenue for Q1 increased 3% to about $4 billion. This was due to organic growth across the segment led by products and distribution as well as in Cardinal Health at Home, one of our strategic growth areas. This growth was partially offset by the divestiture of naviHealth in August 2018. Segment profit increased 26% to $170 million. This reflects benefits from our cost savings initiatives, as well as growth in products and distribution services and Cardinal Health at Home. As with revenue, these benefits were partially offset by the divestiture of the naviHealth business. To provide some additional clarity, products and distribution includes both Cardinal Health brand and national brand products, as well as costs from our global supply chain.  Our work across the Medical segment to integrate our infrastructure, streamline our footprint and improve the customer experience is progressing as planned. Mike will discuss how this work will transition into growth over the longer term. Moving now to our full-year outlook, with one quarter's worth of results behind us, we've increased confidence in our full-year guidance. At the same time, we continue to monitor external factors and key assumptions that could impact our forecast. We also continue to track the timing and evolution of internal investment initiatives. Examples of external factors could be headwinds, which include tariffs and medical device tax. Examples of key assumptions we closely monitor include brand inflation and our generics program. Considering the potential fluctuation of these and other items, we are reaffirming our guidance along with our corporate and segment assumptions. While we generally don't provide quarterly guidance, I will say that, directionally, we expect operating earnings in Q2 to be modestly lower than Q1. So, before I turn it back over to Mike, I'd like to mention a significant item included in our GAAP results. In connection with a recent opioid-related settlement with Cuyahoga and Summit counties and the agreement in principle amongst the parties involved to a global settlement framework, we accrued $5.1 billion after-tax in the first quarter. We believe this global settlement framework will serve as the basis for definitive settlement terms and documentation. And for this reason, from a legal and accounting perspective, this accrual is prudent. For Cardinal Health, the cash component of the settlement framework is up to $5.6 billion over 18 years. If factors change, we'll adjust the accrual appropriately. Let me now turn it back over to Mike to provide further remarks. George. Thanks for the question. Look, I think the way we're thinking about this is, we're really pleased with the first quarter results. I'll start with that. It certainly gives us increased confidence in the full year. At the same time, I'd say we're very cautious and that we're only one quarter into the year. So, we've got some pretty significant assumptions out there that are still left open \u2013 for example, brand inflation \u2013 and there's also a lot of other key kind of environmental assumptions that we're making that could change. So, our view is, at this early stage in the year, there's just no reason to be changing our full year guidance. We'll certainly be in a much better position to do that after our next quarter earnings call. We did see the full quarter. And we have not provided any specificity in terms of the annual impact of that contract renewal. Yeah, absolutely. So, I'd say \u2013 first of all, we said modestly lower. And we think about that, we think about a variety of factors that could change from quarter to quarter. One, for example, would be our SG&A spend. We've got a large inventory of investment opportunities to drive long-term improvements, and those are ramping up. And so, the level of the spend, the pace of that spend, we expect to increase in our second quarter.  Further, we've talked about the CVS and the Kroger's contract renewal being effective July 1st, we do have other contract renewals in much smaller scale, but yet other contract renewals will be occurring in the second quarter and throughout the year. And finally, I would also say that we have some customers that have experienced difficulty either through bankruptcy or other financial distress where we're expecting some modestly lower volume in the second quarter than the first quarter. And as that volume declines, we'll capture our fair share of that, but we'll only capture our fair share of that is our current assumption. So, there's a lot more depth in that, but I'd say those are some of the headlines that give us some reason to believe that Q2 won't be just simply a mirror image of Q1. Yeah, Lisa. This is Dave. Thanks for the question. Look, the intent of this is consistent with the public policy and guidelines of the IRS and the state tax authorities to make this tax deductible. Having said that, the details and specifics of this agreement really just aren't there right now, to provide the level of precision that, ultimately, we'll have, nor is the complete clarity of the tax code there at this stage. So, from an accounting perspective, we just followed accounting guidance and established what we believe is an appropriate reserve for what will be tax deductible. But that, I would say, will continue to become more clear as time marches on and the specifics of both the tax code and the settlement offer become more clear. Yeah, Bob. That's absolutely correct in terms of the second half of your statement. We will be lapping in the fourth quarter a reasonable charge that should be non-recurring.  With respect to the balance of the year, we have not built in \u2013 as we said last quarter with the full-year guidance, we've built in nothing with respect to the med device tax. So, if it doesn't come to fruition, then that's consistent with the guidance we provided. And, clearly, if it does, then that's going to be a headwind we're going to have to manage through. Tariffs are just such a dynamic topic that we've done our best to offset the tariffs that are in effect now. But that, again, is changing. So, I'd say if that would completely cease any further dialog around tariffs, then what's been announced today, we've more or less been able to manage through that. What I would say is there are still a lot of other SG&A initiatives that Mike talked about that do have a longer runway and, therefore, they aren't necessarily all \u2013 the cadence isn't equally distributed amongst four quarters.  I'd really highlight some of the supply chain initiatives that have a long runway and won't necessarily bear fruit for \u2013 it could be two, three years, but we are incurring costs to begin to plan for those this year. And as well, the sales force restructuring that we've discussed as well is kind of in-flight through the course of the year. So, that's not something you can just kind of ratably divide it by four and say it's going to be equal in terms of the cost or the benefits. So, look, you're right in that the fourth quarter does have a tailwind this year and the fact that this is non-recurrence of a charge, but we just \u2013 we feel, I guess, I'd say, cautiously optimistic for the year based on the first quarter, but feels too early at this stage, given all these variables that are out there to call anything up at this early stage. We've got two components. The primary two components. Of course, our pro rata share of $18 billion and then there's the pro rata share of the two Ohio county settlements. The remaining small difference relates to \u2013 I believe we may have spoken in the past about, which is in our med supply business, our Cordis business, the IVS product, which we continue to accrue for a loss, continue to see on that as well. It's a fairly small number, but that \u2013 if you get to the third decimal digit, that's where you're going to find, is the IVS... Look, first of all, we've got good relationships with the rating agencies and we stay in close contact with them. So, it's continuous dialog.  Second, our investment grade credit rating is very important to us. So, it's something that we value and we'll continue to monitor and manage \u2013 to maintain that.  Let's say, when you look at the leverage, the numbers that you're citing, a couple of factors. One, recall, this year, we've committed externally to de-levering by at least $1 billion. So, as we look forward on this, that number will be coming down. And second of all, I'm not sure \u2013 I'm not going to speculate on the credit rating agencies or opine on where they're going to land, but I think there's multiple scenarios between saying this is zero liability or it's the book accounting accrual liability. For example, you could look at \u2013 it's just a discount in future cash flow of all the future years' payments, which nets you a number that's quite a bit smaller than the headline $5.6 billion. So, we'll see how the credit rating agencies opine on this, where they land. But at this point, I'd say we'll be focused on this. We will make a substantial bite of the apple this year and we'll continue to monitor this in the broader scheme of our capital allocation policy in the years ahead. Yeah. Look, we have not provided cash flow guidance in the past and we didn't provide it this year. So, I'm not going to speak to that. It's just \u2013 I'd say, if you look at the fundamentals, the fundamentals are not structurally different than last year. We continue to work on our working capital efficiency initiatives. We continue to drive strong cash flow. You will see anomalies based on a point in time, but I wouldn't say we expect anything materially different year-over-year without providing a finer point to it in terms of giving you any specific guidance. So, the way I'd answer that is, this isn't going to be a charge to the P&L over 18 years. It's a cash cost. But from a GAAP accounting P&L expense perspective, the charge is recognized initially once and that was what you saw recorded this quarter. And so, recognizing a 18-year charge, we did call out as a GAAP to non-GAAP adjustment, appropriately so. So, I think we might be mixing and matching cash and expense charges. Does that answer your question? Yeah, I understand your question. I think what I \u2013 look, when we make GAAP, non-GAAP adjustments, that's for when we have an expense or a credit in the current period P&L that we add back or subtract out to get to non-GAAP. In the case of this opioid accrual, we won't have a P&L charge in future periods. So, there won't be anything to add back to get to non-GAAP earnings. Now, I suppose \u2013 I think you will look at this from a cash perspective and certainly everyone can model the cash flow impact for the next 18 years, but that's separate from \u2013 it just won't really be in the equation in terms of a GAAP versus non-GAAP adjustment because it won't be a charge in future P&Ls. So, it won't be anything to add back . Yeah. So, first, with respect to the medical device tax, we don't have complete clarity on this. So, I don't have a precise answer for you. But I would say that, on an annualized basis, we believe it could be in the neighborhood of $40 million to $50 million on an annual basis. Okay? So, if we look at for \u2013 if it's effective in January, the second half of the year, you'd pro rate that. Again, I'll just kind of caution that that's based on a lack of perfect clarity and information. And so, if that were to actually happen, we'd be prepared to provide a more precise answer to that at that stage. The second question was related to FX. Look, we have FX that shows up in different areas of our P&L. We have some that's showing up in the segments. And then, you may have noticed in interest and other, we have other changed a bit, and that's principally driven by FX. I would say that, on a net basis, FX in the first quarter was reasonably neutral, was not a material driver positive or negative. I think the team is doing an excellent job in managing this and navigating through this as appropriate. Oh, I'm sorry commodity costs. Yeah, I know. I apologize. So, commodities, for us, in the first quarter, I'd describe them as a small headwind. They were a headwind, but not in a material way."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Cardinal Health, Inc. Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Kevin Moran. Please go ahead, sir.\nKevin Moran: Good morning and welcome. Today, we will discuss Cardinal Health's fourth quarter fiscal 2021 results, along with guidance for fiscal year 2022. You can find today's press release and presentation on the IR section of our Web site at ir.cardinalhealth.com. Joining me today are Mike Kaufmann, Chief Executive Officer; and Jason Hollar, Chief Financial Officer. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in these statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statement slide at the beginning of our presentation for a description of these risks and uncertainties. Please note that during the discussion today, our comments will be on a non-GAAP basis, unless they are specifically called out as GAAP. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for all relevant periods can be found in the schedule attached to our press release. During the Q&A portion of today's call, we please ask that you try and limit yourself to one question, so that we can try and give everyone an opportunity. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Kaufmann: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I will start my comments today by acknowledging that our fourth quarter results were below our expectation and yours, primarily due to an inventory reserve adjustment of $197 million. This reserve adjustment was driven by changing market conditions related to COVID-19 on certain highly commoditized PPE products. To meet our customer commitments during the pandemic, we carried higher levels of inventory in certain PPE categories during a period of significantly increased demand, higher prices, and longer than normal supply chains. Our analysis at the quarter-end of both the anticipated customer demand and projected sale prices for these products resulted in a sizable inventory reserve that affected a subset of our medical products inventory. In addition, there were a few other unexpected items that affected our results, which Jason will cover in his remarks. Throughout the past year, we have been taking action to drive performance, and we will continue to move forward with urgency. For example, we divested the Cordis business, extended our Red Oak Sourcing agreement with CVS Health, identified $250 million of additional cost savings opportunities, restructured parts of our organization to increase accountability, and made important leadership changes. We are continually reviewing our business, and seeking areas to improve. With the actions we've taken to date, and our plans for FY'22, we feel confident in our strategy and are encouraged by the tailwinds behind our growth areas and strong cash flow generation. In FY'21, we grew revenue 6% versus the prior year, and despite an estimated $200 million year-over-year operating earnings headwind related to COVID-19, we grew EPS. We continue to aggressively streamline our cost structure, and surpassed our enterprise cost savings target for the third consecutive year. We generated strong operating cash flow; prioritized returning cash to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases, and took actions to further strengthen our balance sheet. As I reflect on the unprecedented events of the past year, our team has prioritized our customers, maintained continuous operations, partnered with governmental agencies to support vaccine administration and protect patients, and further improve the resiliency of our supply chain. Before turning it over to Jason, I want to highlight last week's announcement, that we have negotiated a comprehensive proposed settlement agreement and settlement process designed to achieve broad resolution of governmental opioid claims. If all conditions are satisfied, this agreement would result in the settlement of a substantial majority of opioid lawsuits filed by state and local governmental entities, and depending on the level of state and subdivision participation, we would pay up to $6.4 billion over 18 years. This is an important step forward for our company. As we've consistently said, we remain committed to being part of the solution for the U.S. opioid epidemic, and believe a settlement would be a prudent way to provide necessary relief for our community, and certainty for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Jason to further discuss our results and FY'22 guidance.\nJason Hollar: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we delivered EPS of $0.77, which as Mike mentioned, included a $197 million inventory reserve on certain PPE in the Medical segment. Turning to the Pharma segment, on slide six, fourth quarter revenue increased 15% to $38 billion, driven primarily by sales growth from large pharmaceutical distribution and specialty solutions customers. As a reminder, the fourth quarter fiscal '20 included reduced pharmaceutical demand related to COVID-19, which to a lesser extent contributed to the growth in the quarter. Pharma segment profit was flat in the fourth quarter, at $358 million. This reflects COVID-19 related volume recovery in our nuclear business, offset by pharmaceutical distribution customer contract renewals. This impact in renewals was in line with our expectations, and generally consistent with prior quarters. However, there were some other items, including inventory adjustments and opioid-related legal costs that are higher than previously assumed. As we've mentioned, we continue to prioritize investing for growth and optimizing our core operations. In the fourth quarter, the deployment of some of these technology enhancements results in incremental costs for implementation and depreciation, which we also expect the next several quarters as we continue to deploy new capabilities. I will further discuss our investments as we look to fiscal year '22. As we highlighted last quarter, we continued to experience softer volumes in certain therapeutic classes within our generics program. Our generics program continue to see generally consistent market dynamics. With respect to other product types, including brand, specialty, and consume health, we largely saw volumes at or above pre-pandemic levels during the fourth quarter. In Medical, depicted on slide seven, revenue increased 23% to $4.2 billion in the fourth quarter. This revenue increase was driven by a net positive impact from COVID-19 on products and distribution primarily due to a recovery in elected procedure volumes, and a positive PPE pricing impact. Medical segment loss, of $63 million in the fourth quarter, was due to an adverse impact from COVID-19 primarily due to the previously mentioned inventory reserve, partially offset by a recovery in elected procedure volumes. Additionally, benefits from cost savings initiatives were offset by elevated supply chain costs. During the quarter, we were encouraged to see elected procedure volumes effectively return to near pre-COVID-19 levels. While our team continued to execute on our cost savings and efficiency initiatives within our global manufacturing and supply chain, we did experience elevated supply chain costs, particularly in the areas of freight, labor, and commodities. We are taking actions to help mitigate these impacts, but as we look forward, we do expect some of these higher costs to continue into next year. Now, I'll turn your attention to full-year results, beginning with the enterprise. Total company revenue increased 6% to $162 billion, with strong top line growth in both segments. Consolidated gross margin decreased 2%, to $6.8 billion. Despite sales growth, SG&A decreased 1%, reflecting the benefits of our enterprise-wide cost savings measures. Operating earnings decreased 5%, reflecting a headwind of approximately $200 million year-over-year related to COVID-19, which was split fairly evenly between the segments. Including COVID-19 operating earnings would have grown in the low-single digits in fiscal 2021. Moving below line, interest and other decreased 44% to $133 million driven by multiple items, including lower interest expense from debt reduction actions and increasing the value of our deferred compensation plan and one-time investment gains. As a reminder, deferred compensation gains or losses reported an interest in other are fully offset in corporate SG&A and net neutral to our bottom line. Our annual effective tax rate finished at 22.8% benefiting from discrete items. We finished the year with EPS of $5.57, reflecting growth of 2% despite the net COVID-19 headwind. Turning to the balance sheet, we continued to operate with high networking capital efficiency generating robust operating cash flow of $2.4 billion for the full-year. We finished the year with a strong cash position of $3.4 billion with no outstanding borrowings on our credit facilities. As a reminder, the day of the week in which the quarter ends effects point in time cash flows. We continued to deploy capital according to our priorities, investing $400 million back into the business and CapEx to drive organic growth, strengthening our balance sheet through approximately $550 million in debt pay down, which occurred primarily in the fourth quarter and returning nearly $800 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As for the segments full-year results, beginning with Pharma on slide 10, Pharma revenue increased 6% to $146 million driven by sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution and specialty solutions customers. Pharma segment profit decreased 4% to $1.7 billion due to volume declines in the company's generics program, including the impact of COVID-19. This was partially offset by favorable brand sales mix. Excluding COVID-19, we estimate the Pharma segment would have grown low-single digits in fiscal 2021. Turning to Medical on slide 11, full-year Medical revenue increased 8% to $16.7 billion driven by a net positive impact from COVID-19 on products and distribution. As we saw throughout the year, this increase was primarily due to the impact of PPE sales and higher volumes in our lab business. Medical segment profit decreased 13% to $577 million due to an adverse impact from COVID-19 on products and distribution. This was primarily due to the fourth quarter inventory reserve on certain PPE products, partially offset by higher volumes in our lab business. Additionally, the team delivered strong cost savings with putting global manufacturing efficiencies on the year. When adjusting for COVID-19 related impacts in Medical, we estimate the segment would have grown mid-single digits for the full-year. While our fiscal 2021 results fell short of our expectations. The underline growth we saw in both segments, excluding COVID-19 is this competence as we move into next year and the pandemics effects on our businesses continue to dissipate. Turning to our guidance for fiscal 2022 on slide 13, we expect earnings per share in the range of $5.60 to $5.90. This reflects incremental technology investments of approximately $120 million to drive growth in efficiencies across the enterprise, the Cordis divestiture and other assumptions by we will detail momentarily. We expect interest in other in the range of $150 million to $180 million. We anticipate continued reduction in interest expense with the increase or the prior year, primarily result of the fiscal 2021 capability in deferred compensation, not expected to repeat. We're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate in the range of 23.5% to 25.5%. We expect alluded weighted average shares outstanding in the range of $287 million to $292 million and CapEx of $400 million to $450 million. Transitioning to the segments beginning with Pharma on slide 14, we expect high-single digit revenue growth driven by growth from large customers and continued COVID-19 recovery and mid-single digit segment profit growth. We anticipate COVID-19 will be an overall tailwind of approximately $100 million to Pharma segment profit compared to the prior year. While we will likely continue to see some choppiness, we expect volume recovery in certain generic therapeutic classes by the end of the calendar year. As mentioned, we are investing in technology enhancements to drive growth and efficiencies, which we expect will lead to an $80 million segment profit headwind in fiscal 2022, including the annualization of the investments made in the fourth quarter. Adjusting for the COVID-19 related impacts and the incremental technology investments, we see Pharma normalized growth in the low-to-mid single digit range. We believe normalizing for these impacts provides a better approximation for the long range growth trajectory of the business. As for other assumptions, we continue to expect consistent market dynamics and our generics program. We expect increased contributions from our growth areas, specialty including biosimilars, nuclear and outcomes. We anticipate a similar contingent brand inflation rate as in fiscal '21 with continued left dollar contribution each year. And we expect opioid related legal costs of approximately $125 million, an increase of $10 million versus fiscal '21. For Medical on slide 15, we expect revenue to be approximately flat in fiscal '22, primarily due to the prior year COVID-19 comparison with low double-digits segment profit growth. With respect to COVID-19, we expect an approximate $100 million year-over-year tailwind to Medical segment profit. We are assuming elective procedures will remain at or near pre-COVID levels for the duration of the year. We expect modern headwinds in fiscal '22 related to timing of selling higher costs PPE products and lower lab testing utilization versus the prior year. And we anticipate a year-over-year comparison benefit related to the PPE inventory reserve. Outside of COVID-19, we expect an approximate $80 million impact segment profit due to the Cordis divestiture. Note, the anticipated reported impact for fiscal '22 is higher than previously communicated, primarily due to the exchange rate capability and other operating improvements within the business in the prior year. Additionally, we expected investment incremental $20 million in technology enhancements in our at-home business to drive growth and efficiencies. Adjusting for these items, we see normalized medical segment profit growth of mid-to-high single digits in fiscal '22. Finally, as seen in the fourth quarter, we expect elevated supply chain costs to persist, particularly in the first-half of the year. We anticipate these elevated costs will be partially offset by the continued benefits from our global manufacturing and supply chain transformation, which will ramp up throughout the year. Now a few additional comments on the expected cadence next year, we expect profit growth to be significantly back halfway to in both segments. In Pharma, this is primarily driven by the timing of the previously mentioned incremental technology investments being more weighted towards the front half, as well as stronger expected second-half performance in our generics program including the impact of COVID-19. In Medical, in addition to the elevated supply chain costs, we also anticipate the total unfavorable fiscal '22 COVID-19 impact of approximately $50 million to occur primarily in the first-half of the year. As a reminder, we also experienced favorable COVID-19 impact in the first-half of fiscal '21, which was of a similar magnitude. Throughout the organization, we continue to place a high priority on cash flow generation, as well as allocating capital in a balanced, disciplined, and shareholder friendly manner. Our strong cash flow and improving capital position will enable our capital allocation priorities support our company's obligations and provide increased flexibility and the ability to be more opportunistic in our capital deployment. Along those lines, we anticipate deploying the Cordis proceeds through a combination of share repurchases and debt paid down, which is expected to offset the earnings dilution on a pro forma basis. We expect share repurchases in the range of $500 million to $1 billion in fiscal '22. In addition, we expect total debt pay down of approximately $850 million reflecting the completion of the remaining June 2022 dead tower at or before maturity. With that, I'll now turn it over to Mike.\nMike Kaufmann: Thanks, Jason. To be clear, we are disappointed with this finish to the year and are moving forward with a sense of urgency to improve our operation and execute our strategy. We're prioritizing investment in our strategic growth areas and expect these businesses to collectively realize double-digit growth as FY'22. And across our business, we're enhancing our IT infrastructure in key areas to increase capabilities and digitization that improve the customer experience and drive productivity. While we expect the benefit from these investments this fiscal year, the majority of these benefits will materialize and FY'23 and beyond. In Pharma, we're investing an additional $80 million in technology infrastructure to create additional operational efficiencies, improve data insights, and drive cost synergies to enhance our ability to grow and generate better outcomes for our customers. Our generics program remains a critical priority. This week, we extended our Red Oak agreement with CVS Health for an additional five years, which takes the term of our generic sourcing joint venture through June 30, 2029. This ensures that we can continue to deliver best-in-class sourcing capabilities for our customers well into the future. We are also investing in data and analytics including our pricing capabilities, as we continue to focus on managing all components of our generics program and expect market dynamics consistent with the last few years. We remain committed to supporting the retail pharmacy community, and our recent annual retail business conference, we connected virtually with over 4,000 retail independent pharmacy customers and launched two new digital offering, NavixRx and E-Commerce Storefront to help independent pharmacies expand their services and improve healthcare outcomes. In Specialty, we're investing in our Sonexus patient hub where our technology solutions help biopharma customers remove barriers to patient care. And then our third party logistics business, we're extending our cold chain storage space to accommodate the growing number of temperature sensitive products, including cell and gene therapies. In Nuclear, we received FDA approval to use our radioactive diagnostic agent, LYMPHOSEEK in pediatric patients one-month and older. We continue to build out our multi-million dollar center for Theranostics advancement in Indianapolis, and are also investing to expand our pet capabilities. We expect double-digit profit growth in nuclear over the next several years, and in outcomes, we also expect double-digit profit growth as we expand our direct to patient digital footprint and implement new patient adherence programs. Turning to Medical, we've been taking quick decisive action throughout the fiscal year to streamline and simplify our medical business. And this work remains a top priority heading into FY'22. We've recently restructured our organization to establish clear lines of ownership and accountability and made some management changes including appointing a single leader to manage U.S. medical products and distribution as well as the single leader to manage international. With the divestiture of quarter, we plan to significantly reduce our international commercial footprint and have initially identified 36 markets we intend to exit. So we can focus on locations where we have a competitive advantage and can generate sustained long-term growth. We're laser-focused on enhancing supply chain resiliency, improving business continuity and investing in advanced planning capabilities to drive forward-looking insights to better serve our customers and their patients. In addition, our medical services businesses OptiFreight Logistics and WaveMark continue to enable clinically integrated and digitally automated supply chains. Our at-home business continues to focus on enabling and supporting comfortable home-based care for patients with acute and chronic conditions. We continue to see volume growth as care is rapidly shifting to the home. For FY'22, we're investing an additional $20 million in technology infrastructure to create operational efficiencies and better data visibility. With respect to the enterprise, we're aggressively reviewing our cost structure to continue streamlining our operations and processes and intend to reinvest a portion of these savings to fuel future growth. In FY'22, we plan to launch initiatives that will deliver at least an additional $250 million savings by FY'23. As Jason discussed earlier, we take a balanced disciplined and shareholder friendly approach to capital deployment with a focus on investing in the business, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders. In closing, I want to thank our employees for their hard work and contributions that make it possible for Cardinal Health to fulfill its mission of improving the lives of people every day. And now, Jason and I will take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cherny: Good morning. Thanks so much for the question. I want to dive a little bit more into the capital deployment priorities you think about into '22. Obviously, you have the Cordis proceeds that are coming in of [$1 billion] [Ph], I believe the [indiscernible] agreement, if I recall, is about $1 billion or so, and I could double-check that in the last quarter's transcript. When you think about that, think about your cash position as you sit now and the free cash that you're going to generate this year, even with the investments that you're making, do you think there's an opportunity to be a bit more aggressive, either on the buyback given where your stock sits in the market, on M&A, given that you talked about a number of growth priorities, of which I assume there's some bolt-on transactions. Just curious about that philosophy, where you sit now, given that the company is in as strong a balance sheet position as I can recall seeing in a while?\nMike Kaufmann: Thanks, Mike. I appreciate the question. And we are really excited about the work we've done around that. But I'm going to have Jason give you a little bit more color on it.\nJason Hollar: Yes, thanks, Mike. And first of all, yes, I think we had some really great cash flow this last year, so $2.4 billion of operating cash flow. And that resulted in $3.4 billion ending cash balance, which does include the $500 million debt paydown that we completed in the fourth quarter. So, as you indicated perfectly, we're stepping into this year with a lot of flexibility even before the Cordis transaction closed, which was just a few days ago. We're still to add another $1 billion to that balance. As we highlighted in some of those comments this morning, we do expect to pay down the $815 million that's coming due by the end of the fiscal year or before end of the fiscal year. So that will be some of those uses. And then, of course, we guided towards the $500 million to $1 billion for the share repurchases, which is a fairly wide range, and reflective of some of the flexibility that we talked about. And as I think about the Cordis proceeds, of course cash is somewhat fungible, but essentially that $1 billion, how we're thinking about it is accelerating some of that debt paydown, and a portion of that $500 million to $1 billion. So, we feel real good about that as we entered into the first quarter here. You referenced the tax receivable, and I don't think we provided any updated comments on that so far. The last quarter, I'd referenced that we expect it by the end of the calendar year. It's still our expectation, like I think a lot of different organizations throughout the world right now; I think COVID has impacted some of the processes, and a little bit less certainty as to the precise timing. But we still feel pretty good that that's a good approximate timeframe. But when you think about receiving those proceeds perhaps late in the calendar year, there will less time to actually deploy those to the balance of this year. So, it's certainly still a potential opportunity to get us maybe to some of the higher end of that range. But, nonetheless, there's a lot of flexibility that goes along with that. As you indicated, when we talk about the opportunistic uses, essentially we have increased flexibility here. M&A is always on that list, and it depends on the opportunity, the valuation, and what we see delivering to us strategically. And so that will be another thing that we evaluate along the year. Thanks for question.\nOperator: Up next, we'll hear from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Please go ahead.\nKevin Caliendo: Great, thanks. I just want to expand on that a little bit. I guess I don't understand why you're not being more aggressive with the buybacks. Given the settlement, looks like it's largely done, the cash on hand is greater, the stock is going to come under pretty meaningful pressure today, most likely. What's stopping you from going out and buying $2 billion of stock or more? I mean are there any credit issues or anything else that you're concerned about? And also, on the buyback, if I'm doing the math right, it feels like the numbers don't entirely jive to get to that $0.21. Is there -- is it just simply the timing that it would happen so late in the year is why the buyback wouldn't cover the sort of $0.21 of dilution from Cordis?\nMike Kaufmann: Yes, let me start, Kevin. And then I'll turn it back over to Jason. I'll just comment specifically on the opioid piece, and then let Jason give you a little bit more information. The opioid, as we said, we're pleased to get to the point where we right now, where we have a comprehensive settlement out there. But it does have a few more steps left in it. So, we do have to wait and see if we get the states, and cities, and counties to sign on to get enough critical mass in order to make a final decision. And so, we do have some time left on that to make sure we understand exactly with clarity where that's going to be. But we're pleased with where we are as far as an initial step of finally getting something out there for people to consider. And then let me now turn it over to Jason to go into a little bit more the other detail that you asked about.\nJason Hollar: Yes, and as it relates to the [indiscernible] on the Cordis that was implied or referenced within there, it's just a matter of the timing of which you assume when we pay down the debt and when we would complete the share repurchases. And so, there's an opportunity for that to have a reasonable range. And that that guidance range, we think, reflects what we think that possibility may be. And -- but the key thing, on a pro forma basis, is that extra $1 billion will be deployed in some manner. And we will see, and certainly within fiscal '23 run rate, there will not be dilution expected that divestiture. And as it relates to the [the other] [Ph] question, and somewhat as it relates to credit issues, there's nothing there. I mean, we're on a guidance -- a glide path to getting to our targeted leverage ratio. A key part that I referenced last quarter is that this remaining debt that's come due at the end of this fiscal year is a key part of getting us towards those targets. And I indicated, last quarter, that I would anticipate the level of debt paydown to begin to diminish after this fiscal year. That continues to be our expectation. There's a lot of factors, as Mike just referenced, that would play into that. But overall, that remains our viewpoint, and there's nothing here that is, I'll say, overly constrictive from that point. Just a little bit of prudence until we get some of these risks and uncertainties defined. And we also need to see underlying performance in cash flow over the course of the year. And then, as I mentioned before, we do have some additional flexibility as it relates to the precise timing of the tax receivable.\nOperator: And up next, we will take a question from Jailendra Singh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nJailendra Singh: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I want to go back to your just inventory impact on PPE in the quarter. Can you elaborate a little bit more what products this relates to? And is there a potential that you might have another write-down in fiscal '22, and what kind of initiatives you're putting in place to ensure that this does not happen again?\nJason Hollar: Sure. Yes, so I'll go and start it and -- so, as Mike mentioned, the key thing here is there's been a lot of uncertainties with the pandemic. And we were first and foremost going to put our customer commitments in front of us. And that resulted in a higher level of inventory that we carried over that period time. And that happened while there was; obviously, increasing demand, higher prices, and longer than normal types of supply chains. And then we step back, at every quarter we step back and do our analysis and determine what the net realizable value that is, and then make any adjustments that may be necessary. So, as Mike highlighted, there were some highly commoditized products, so [indiscernible] is a subset of our PPE, that think of it as those products that would have more volatile type of pricing. We saw that move more dramatically over the period. And given it was a subset of our inventory, it was relatively defined. It was a relatively large percentage reduction within that, but it was contained to a certain subset. And again, we're not getting into all the details product by product, but it was that type of product that had a little bit of the value add, and therefore as a little bit easier to get more supply into the market, and that drove the prices down quicker than other products. Anything else to add, Mike?\nMike Kaufmann: Only, I'd reiterate that our focus has always been and will continue to be on our customer. And it was important to, us from the very beginning of this pandemic, to acquire critical PPE for our customers. And as Jason says, we did ramp up during a period of higher demand and higher prices, and longer supply chains.\nKevin Moran: Next question, please.\nOperator: And next, we will hear from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yes, hi, good morning. And thanks for all the details you provided in the prepared remarks. Just a couple of follow-up questions to understand sort of the moving parts into guidance, so specifically, you talked about the customer renewal, seems like it's CVS, can you maybe help us quantify what the impact is in 2022, and also is there any other renewals that we should be considering in the next 12 to 18 months? And then, the second question in terms of the moving parts are on the investment that you're making, should we think about them as sort of a one-time investment in 2022, or should we now factor just kind of like ongoing resource of investments to support future growth?\nMike Kaufmann: Yes, I'll start talk about the renewals, and then I'll have Jason make a comment on the investment. The renewal that we're talking about at the Red Oak renewal is not at all included in what Jason was talking about on customer renewals. That's considered in our overall generics program performance, which we expect to be something that we would expect to be a tailwind next year. We feel really good about where we're headed with all the various components of our generics program and excited to continue to partner with CVS moving forward with on Red Oak. What Jason was talking about in renewals was just the normal renewals. There is nothing unexpected in the fourth quarter customer renewals, they basically came in as planned, and so that was not anything I would consider it as we look for. We don't see customer goals being any different or unusual for us in FY'22.\nJason Hollar: Yes. It's relates to the other moving pieces for Pharma that are a part of that underlying guidance. Our growth businesses we expect to contribute. As Mike mentioned, we expect double-digit growth for our growth businesses top line as well as bottom line, and for the Pharma business that would be of course specialty nuclear and outcomes. And then we have the year-over-year COVID benefit that I mentioned would be a key part of that. But as Mike mentioned that the customer renewals is not something that we would anticipate to be significantly different year-over-year. And then your question regarding investments, those investments are next year of -- we've spent quite heavily over the last couple of several years on the capital side of getting these IT systems in place. We are finalizing a multi-year journey now, and are starting to depreciate those assets. So there will be elevated appreciation that of course is more fixed in nature, but there's also a component of the final testing and rollout launch of the system tends to be more expensive versus capital. And so, as we're riding that roll out stage that expense will be elevated. And that far we would expect to reduce longer term certainly beyond fiscal '22, but for the balance of this year, we would expect it to be elevated and then thereafter some portion of that will come down later on.\nKevin Moran: Next question?\nOperator: And up next, we'll hear from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nEric Percher: Thank you. I wanted to ask about the generic volume commentary around certain classes. I know that we saw a clear increase in acute volumes from March into April on the quarter. So what are the classes where you're seeing this and any other specifics on how that's impacting the generic program?\nMike Kaufmann: Yes, thanks for the question. So, a couple things on that, we did see some sequential growth from Q3 to Q4 on generic volumes. So that continues to be a positive sign. We do expect our impact from COVID-19 on all generic volumes to be back at pre-COVID levels by the end of the calendar year or by the end of our Q2. What we're referring to here is, we're still seeing again ramping up, but we're still seeing some less than pre-COVID volumes on areas like anti-infectives, antibacterials, antibiotics, antivirals, and some pain medications that we've not seen. Our thoughts are as life continues to get more and more back to normal if that's the right word, kids are back in school, et cetera. We would start to see those drugs being needed more than they probably have historically been needed. So again, expect them to be back to pre-COVID levels by the end of the year, but that's really what we're talking about. Very similar to the exact same thing we talked about last quarter. And it's kind of continuing to play out as we should back then.\nKevin Moran: Next question please.\nOperator: And next we'll hear from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSteven Valiquette: [Technical difficulty] -- The categories that are trending above baseline, I'm curious if you're seeing those same trends as well. Thanks.\nKevin Moran: Mr. Valiquette?\nMike Kaufmann: I'm sorry. We didn't catch the beginning of your question. So if you could try it again. Thank you.\nSteven Valiquette: Yes. So I knew at some point it would happen. I would get paying to ask two questions on two calls at the same time. That just happened. So, I guess I'm curious to -- curious to if you could provide more color on the elevated supply chain costs, you mentioned for the Medical segment and fiscal 4Q, you cited that in the press release. I guess I'm curious geographically is this cost pressure mainly in the U.S. or the international as well, in addition to some other color, just that mechanically what's happening there and that's a sale of Cordis alleviate this in any way into a fiscal 2022. Thanks.\nMike Kaufmann: Thanks. I'll start with your second piece first. Really, I don't see Cordis alleviating that at least towards the -- what the guidance we said, of course, there could have been a elevated costs on some of their raw materials and products and Cordis being more international. Obviously it had more aspects, potential fluctuation, but don't see Cordis being a factor there. As far as the elevated supply chain cost, what we started seeing in the fourth quarter is I think what you're hearing a lot of companies talking about, we're seeing increased fuel costs. We're starting to see the cost of, for instance, containers can be three to 10x. What they cost to should have been prior to COVID just due to where it's being blocked things like that. So we're just wages, et cetera. So it's just those types of things that we're seeing general elevated supply chain across the board. Again, saw that in Q4, we expect that to continue in for the first couple of quarters. And then as we think things get back to more normal, we'll be able to see some either reductions in those or we'll be able to take some of those costs and where possible that appropriately pass it through the customers, if it's a more permanent type of thing. So we'll be monitoring that and keeping our eyes on that.\nOperator: All right, and our next question will come from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nEduardo Mestre: Hi, good morning. This is Eduardo on for Elizabeth. Can you guys maybe provide some more color on the $250 million of additional cost savings opportunities? And I guess what areas of the enterprise they expect to generate those savings from?\nJason Hollar: Sure. Yes, I would say it's very much continuation of what we've done to date, as you certainly recall our initial target was the $500 million and we've come close to accomplishing that after the -- just the first three years. And that was in varied areas everywhere from manufacturing, our footprint worked there to our distribution work all the way up to our functional areas. As we go forward, what we're seeing this next stage is the ability to go from more of the transactional first order benefits of like rate negotiation in areas like transportation and going further into really redesigning networks and getting into more augmented intelligence and things of that nature. We have one area that is allowing us to unlock additional value in this next stage is the Cordis divestiture. We talked about the simplification of our international operating structure. That's a -- that's an enabler for us to continue to go after additional opportunities there and then just continue on and all fronts given that we've got good momentum in place already for the existing initiatives.\nMike Kaufmann: Only thing I would add is that just to emphasize something Jason mentioned is around the use of digital to really get after being able to use bots, AI, RPA, et cetera, to get after our cost structure. We've been investing a lot of time on that. Our IT team has done a nice job of building out both people, resources and our businesses and functions are all embracing this as well as making sure we're doing work in the right locations are all other important factors that we see being able to give us some tailwinds going forward and cost savings.\nKevin Moran: Next question please.\nOperator: And next we'll hear from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nLisa Gill: Thanks so much. Good morning. I just really want to understand as we think about normalization in your Pharma segment, so beyond the renewal. Do you see low-single digit to mid-single digit normalization in Pharma segment profits growth over the longer term, and where are our specific opportunity that you see to maybe further accelerate that growth beyond 2022 at that'd be kind of my first question, and do things like specialty and nuclear that you talk about returning to double-digit. I know they're on the smaller side. Did they help to accelerate that, that low-single digit to mid-single digit normalization? Just any drivers or help you can get around that on a longer-term basis.\nMike Kaufmann: Yes. Thanks, Lisa. Appreciate it. Actually you hit a lot of it right there in your question is that we did want to provide a normalized growth so that we could share with you what we do believe are achievable longer-term growth rates for both of the businesses that we provided the normalized growth on, specifically the Pharma, I think you said it well, we do expect continued double-digit growth from nuclear and specialty in our outcomes businesses. We see all of them next year being able to grow the top and bottom lines by double-digits. And we continue to see those businesses continue to be a bigger and bigger portion of the overall Pharma segment. So, as they continue to grow at those rates and are a bigger portion of the segment obviously they're going to continue to have more and more impact. We feel really good about the pipeline of products in nuclear and what the work we're doing in our -- the center for advancement of Theranostics. We already have a significant amount of manufacturers committed to joining us in that center when we opened it and working together on some new both treatments and diagnostics for cancer and other areas. So we feel good about all of those businesses. And then, as far as the core PD business goes, we think we are well-positioned with some very large and important customers that, that you're aware of. We've got eight more years now on our agreement related to Red Oak, and we feel good about that partnership and that continued positive impact on our generics program. And so those are some of the things I would say, make us feel good about that growth going forward.\nKevin Moran: Next question please.\nOperator: And next we'll hear from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Hill: Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the questions. I guess, Mike first, I would ask you, with the renewal of the Red Oak agreement, are there any substantive changes to the economics of that agreement? And then number two, you guys called out contingent brand inflation in the pressure -- I'm sorry, in the presentation as the business is starting to mix back towards brand growth. Are you seeing any changes in the underlying economics of the brand relationships and the amount of profits exposed to our brand price inflation?\nMike Kaufmann: Yes. Two very good questions, so first of all, on brand, what we're seeing there is we're expecting overall inflation rates to just be similar to the last couple of years. So we're not seeing any real changes there. And that's as Jason mentioned, the reason he said getting less dollars is because more of the suppliers that were contingent to inflation have moved to non-contingent and we've renegotiated a couple of those DSAs over the last year, so that we will no longer be contingent to inflation. As far as overall rates go, I would say we continue to feel very good about our overall value proposition. We have very strong relationships with manufacturers. And as you know, when anytime there's changes in their portfolios, sometimes that means they should get a lower price when they have higher cost drugs coming out. And sometimes they need to pay more fees when they loosen and say high priced item to a patent expiration. And so those types of moving parts in terms of volume and average line extension are taken into account with each negotiation and the team has done an excellent job working with our manufacturer partners and continue to have what I consider to be a fair market rate for that, and feel very good about that being able to be something that we can continue going forward. As far as the Red Oak renewal, we won't be able to get into any specifics there, but as you can imagine, it's been an excellent seven-year relationship. The team there continues to remain intact. They have decades generic buying experience. The leadership there in the team has just a great group of individuals again with experience that continues to bring new ideas together to the market, to be able to help us continue to get the best cost in the marketplace. And we continue to partner well with CVS at Board Meetings, et cetera, to continue to drive that. So we feel that the both companies took into in the context, on the market conditions on generics, then we renegotiate it and we feel very good about where we are with our Red Oak extension. Take one last question.\nOperator: And the last question will come from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nCharles Rhyee: Yes, thanks. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Maybe Mike, maybe a question on opioids in the settlement here, and I think there's like 150 days or so that for the plaintiffs to accept the terms of the settlement. What's the minimum participation that's required under this settlement for it to go into effect? So in other words, is it like half the participants have to at least participate and then it's my understanding that the amount that you would pay out would scale down depending on the number of participants. So just wondered what that minimum requirement is. And then what happens if you don't hit that threshold. Thanks.\nMike Kaufmann: Yes. Thanks for the question. So you're right. And so the total number that is accrued assumes all 50 states, cities and counties are in. So if any single state or cities and counties within states do not elect to be part of it. The number will come down based on agreed upon proration by states. So it will decline that states not -- and cities and counties do not participate. Second thing to your point, it is multi-steps, there's a point where we get some insights to where the states are. Then there'll be another point where we'll get to understand what about cities and counties and the subdivisions are. And after all of that, we will take a look at what we'll call -- we're calling critical mass. There is no set number. So there's no minimum. Our goal has been and continues to be to get 100% participation on all 50 states in order to have the most clarity, that may not happen in anything less than that, then we as a group, we'll have to sit down and determine if that's enough clarity and participation. It's highly dependent on the states that do and don't participate. So we'll have to really step back and look at it as an overall -- from an overall standpoint, and make a decision on whether or not to move forward.\nJason Hollar: One thing I'd like to just clarify, as Mike indicated, if not all 50 states choose, or we come to an arrangement to join that would mean the cash payments would be lower under that structure. It does not necessarily mean the accrual would change. And that would we look at the facts and circumstances of the situation is determined what their proper accounting would be at that time. There could certainly be a difference there that we would need to evaluate.\nMike Kaufmann: Good clarification. And that concludes our Q&A session for today. I will now turn the conference back to Mike Kaufmann for closing remarks.\nMike Kaufmann: Yes. I want to thank everybody for taking the time to be on the call and for the very helpful questions. I know there was a lot of noise in this quarter, but I just wanted to end with a few thoughts to keep in mind. We did see -- first, we did see underlying growth in FY 2021 in both of our segments, if you exclude COVID-19, which gives us confidence as we move forward -- going forward with the impacts of the pandemic, hopefully beginning to dissipate. Our guidance is for growth next year in each segment. And also if you take normalized growth in each segment, when you normalize for noise, like COVID and Cordis divestiture, we will grow in both segments. We have tailwinds behind our growth businesses. We really expect all of our growth businesses as a group to really grow at least double-digits on the top and bottom line. And we have taken some significant actions such as getting after an additional $250 million in cost savings, closing the Cordis transaction, which will enable us to simplify our operating model and extending our agreement with CVS or just a few of the examples, and it's the first question was in Jason's comment, we do have very strong cash flow generation, which gives us a lot of flexibility to be more opportunistic in our capital deployment. So with that, thanks again, and have a good day.\nOperator: And this concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mike Kaufmann",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I will start my comments today by acknowledging that our fourth quarter results were below our expectation and yours, primarily due to an inventory reserve adjustment of $197 million. This reserve adjustment was driven by changing market conditions related to COVID-19 on certain highly commoditized PPE products. To meet our customer commitments during the pandemic, we carried higher levels of inventory in certain PPE categories during a period of significantly increased demand, higher prices, and longer than normal supply chains. Our analysis at the quarter-end of both the anticipated customer demand and projected sale prices for these products resulted in a sizable inventory reserve that affected a subset of our medical products inventory. In addition, there were a few other unexpected items that affected our results, which Jason will cover in his remarks. Throughout the past year, we have been taking action to drive performance, and we will continue to move forward with urgency. For example, we divested the Cordis business, extended our Red Oak Sourcing agreement with CVS Health, identified $250 million of additional cost savings opportunities, restructured parts of our organization to increase accountability, and made important leadership changes. We are continually reviewing our business, and seeking areas to improve. With the actions we've taken to date, and our plans for FY'22, we feel confident in our strategy and are encouraged by the tailwinds behind our growth areas and strong cash flow generation. In FY'21, we grew revenue 6% versus the prior year, and despite an estimated $200 million year-over-year operating earnings headwind related to COVID-19, we grew EPS. We continue to aggressively streamline our cost structure, and surpassed our enterprise cost savings target for the third consecutive year. We generated strong operating cash flow; prioritized returning cash to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases, and took actions to further strengthen our balance sheet. As I reflect on the unprecedented events of the past year, our team has prioritized our customers, maintained continuous operations, partnered with governmental agencies to support vaccine administration and protect patients, and further improve the resiliency of our supply chain. Before turning it over to Jason, I want to highlight last week's announcement, that we have negotiated a comprehensive proposed settlement agreement and settlement process designed to achieve broad resolution of governmental opioid claims. If all conditions are satisfied, this agreement would result in the settlement of a substantial majority of opioid lawsuits filed by state and local governmental entities, and depending on the level of state and subdivision participation, we would pay up to $6.4 billion over 18 years. This is an important step forward for our company. As we've consistently said, we remain committed to being part of the solution for the U.S. opioid epidemic, and believe a settlement would be a prudent way to provide necessary relief for our community, and certainty for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Jason to further discuss our results and FY'22 guidance. Thanks, Jason. To be clear, we are disappointed with this finish to the year and are moving forward with a sense of urgency to improve our operation and execute our strategy. We're prioritizing investment in our strategic growth areas and expect these businesses to collectively realize double-digit growth as FY'22. And across our business, we're enhancing our IT infrastructure in key areas to increase capabilities and digitization that improve the customer experience and drive productivity. While we expect the benefit from these investments this fiscal year, the majority of these benefits will materialize and FY'23 and beyond. In Pharma, we're investing an additional $80 million in technology infrastructure to create additional operational efficiencies, improve data insights, and drive cost synergies to enhance our ability to grow and generate better outcomes for our customers. Our generics program remains a critical priority. This week, we extended our Red Oak agreement with CVS Health for an additional five years, which takes the term of our generic sourcing joint venture through June 30, 2029. This ensures that we can continue to deliver best-in-class sourcing capabilities for our customers well into the future. We are also investing in data and analytics including our pricing capabilities, as we continue to focus on managing all components of our generics program and expect market dynamics consistent with the last few years. We remain committed to supporting the retail pharmacy community, and our recent annual retail business conference, we connected virtually with over 4,000 retail independent pharmacy customers and launched two new digital offering, NavixRx and E-Commerce Storefront to help independent pharmacies expand their services and improve healthcare outcomes. In Specialty, we're investing in our Sonexus patient hub where our technology solutions help biopharma customers remove barriers to patient care. And then our third party logistics business, we're extending our cold chain storage space to accommodate the growing number of temperature sensitive products, including cell and gene therapies. In Nuclear, we received FDA approval to use our radioactive diagnostic agent, LYMPHOSEEK in pediatric patients one-month and older. We continue to build out our multi-million dollar center for Theranostics advancement in Indianapolis, and are also investing to expand our pet capabilities. We expect double-digit profit growth in nuclear over the next several years, and in outcomes, we also expect double-digit profit growth as we expand our direct to patient digital footprint and implement new patient adherence programs. Turning to Medical, we've been taking quick decisive action throughout the fiscal year to streamline and simplify our medical business. And this work remains a top priority heading into FY'22. We've recently restructured our organization to establish clear lines of ownership and accountability and made some management changes including appointing a single leader to manage U.S. medical products and distribution as well as the single leader to manage international. With the divestiture of quarter, we plan to significantly reduce our international commercial footprint and have initially identified 36 markets we intend to exit. So we can focus on locations where we have a competitive advantage and can generate sustained long-term growth. We're laser-focused on enhancing supply chain resiliency, improving business continuity and investing in advanced planning capabilities to drive forward-looking insights to better serve our customers and their patients. In addition, our medical services businesses OptiFreight Logistics and WaveMark continue to enable clinically integrated and digitally automated supply chains. Our at-home business continues to focus on enabling and supporting comfortable home-based care for patients with acute and chronic conditions. We continue to see volume growth as care is rapidly shifting to the home. For FY'22, we're investing an additional $20 million in technology infrastructure to create operational efficiencies and better data visibility. With respect to the enterprise, we're aggressively reviewing our cost structure to continue streamlining our operations and processes and intend to reinvest a portion of these savings to fuel future growth. In FY'22, we plan to launch initiatives that will deliver at least an additional $250 million savings by FY'23. As Jason discussed earlier, we take a balanced disciplined and shareholder friendly approach to capital deployment with a focus on investing in the business, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders. In closing, I want to thank our employees for their hard work and contributions that make it possible for Cardinal Health to fulfill its mission of improving the lives of people every day. And now, Jason and I will take your questions. Thanks, Mike. I appreciate the question. And we are really excited about the work we've done around that. But I'm going to have Jason give you a little bit more color on it. Yes, let me start, Kevin. And then I'll turn it back over to Jason. I'll just comment specifically on the opioid piece, and then let Jason give you a little bit more information. The opioid, as we said, we're pleased to get to the point where we right now, where we have a comprehensive settlement out there. But it does have a few more steps left in it. So, we do have to wait and see if we get the states, and cities, and counties to sign on to get enough critical mass in order to make a final decision. And so, we do have some time left on that to make sure we understand exactly with clarity where that's going to be. But we're pleased with where we are as far as an initial step of finally getting something out there for people to consider. And then let me now turn it over to Jason to go into a little bit more the other detail that you asked about. Only, I'd reiterate that our focus has always been and will continue to be on our customer. And it was important to, us from the very beginning of this pandemic, to acquire critical PPE for our customers. And as Jason says, we did ramp up during a period of higher demand and higher prices, and longer supply chains. Yes, I'll start talk about the renewals, and then I'll have Jason make a comment on the investment. The renewal that we're talking about at the Red Oak renewal is not at all included in what Jason was talking about on customer renewals. That's considered in our overall generics program performance, which we expect to be something that we would expect to be a tailwind next year. We feel really good about where we're headed with all the various components of our generics program and excited to continue to partner with CVS moving forward with on Red Oak. What Jason was talking about in renewals was just the normal renewals. There is nothing unexpected in the fourth quarter customer renewals, they basically came in as planned, and so that was not anything I would consider it as we look for. We don't see customer goals being any different or unusual for us in FY'22. Yes, thanks for the question. So, a couple things on that, we did see some sequential growth from Q3 to Q4 on generic volumes. So that continues to be a positive sign. We do expect our impact from COVID-19 on all generic volumes to be back at pre-COVID levels by the end of the calendar year or by the end of our Q2. What we're referring to here is, we're still seeing again ramping up, but we're still seeing some less than pre-COVID volumes on areas like anti-infectives, antibacterials, antibiotics, antivirals, and some pain medications that we've not seen. Our thoughts are as life continues to get more and more back to normal if that's the right word, kids are back in school, et cetera. We would start to see those drugs being needed more than they probably have historically been needed. So again, expect them to be back to pre-COVID levels by the end of the year, but that's really what we're talking about. Very similar to the exact same thing we talked about last quarter. And it's kind of continuing to play out as we should back then. I'm sorry. We didn't catch the beginning of your question. So if you could try it again. Thank you. Thanks. I'll start with your second piece first. Really, I don't see Cordis alleviating that at least towards the -- what the guidance we said, of course, there could have been a elevated costs on some of their raw materials and products and Cordis being more international. Obviously it had more aspects, potential fluctuation, but don't see Cordis being a factor there. As far as the elevated supply chain cost, what we started seeing in the fourth quarter is I think what you're hearing a lot of companies talking about, we're seeing increased fuel costs. We're starting to see the cost of, for instance, containers can be three to 10x. What they cost to should have been prior to COVID just due to where it's being blocked things like that. So we're just wages, et cetera. So it's just those types of things that we're seeing general elevated supply chain across the board. Again, saw that in Q4, we expect that to continue in for the first couple of quarters. And then as we think things get back to more normal, we'll be able to see some either reductions in those or we'll be able to take some of those costs and where possible that appropriately pass it through the customers, if it's a more permanent type of thing. So we'll be monitoring that and keeping our eyes on that. Only thing I would add is that just to emphasize something Jason mentioned is around the use of digital to really get after being able to use bots, AI, RPA, et cetera, to get after our cost structure. We've been investing a lot of time on that. Our IT team has done a nice job of building out both people, resources and our businesses and functions are all embracing this as well as making sure we're doing work in the right locations are all other important factors that we see being able to give us some tailwinds going forward and cost savings. Yes. Thanks, Lisa. Appreciate it. Actually you hit a lot of it right there in your question is that we did want to provide a normalized growth so that we could share with you what we do believe are achievable longer-term growth rates for both of the businesses that we provided the normalized growth on, specifically the Pharma, I think you said it well, we do expect continued double-digit growth from nuclear and specialty in our outcomes businesses. We see all of them next year being able to grow the top and bottom lines by double-digits. And we continue to see those businesses continue to be a bigger and bigger portion of the overall Pharma segment. So, as they continue to grow at those rates and are a bigger portion of the segment obviously they're going to continue to have more and more impact. We feel really good about the pipeline of products in nuclear and what the work we're doing in our -- the center for advancement of Theranostics. We already have a significant amount of manufacturers committed to joining us in that center when we opened it and working together on some new both treatments and diagnostics for cancer and other areas. So we feel good about all of those businesses. And then, as far as the core PD business goes, we think we are well-positioned with some very large and important customers that, that you're aware of. We've got eight more years now on our agreement related to Red Oak, and we feel good about that partnership and that continued positive impact on our generics program. And so those are some of the things I would say, make us feel good about that growth going forward. Yes. Two very good questions, so first of all, on brand, what we're seeing there is we're expecting overall inflation rates to just be similar to the last couple of years. So we're not seeing any real changes there. And that's as Jason mentioned, the reason he said getting less dollars is because more of the suppliers that were contingent to inflation have moved to non-contingent and we've renegotiated a couple of those DSAs over the last year, so that we will no longer be contingent to inflation. As far as overall rates go, I would say we continue to feel very good about our overall value proposition. We have very strong relationships with manufacturers. And as you know, when anytime there's changes in their portfolios, sometimes that means they should get a lower price when they have higher cost drugs coming out. And sometimes they need to pay more fees when they loosen and say high priced item to a patent expiration. And so those types of moving parts in terms of volume and average line extension are taken into account with each negotiation and the team has done an excellent job working with our manufacturer partners and continue to have what I consider to be a fair market rate for that, and feel very good about that being able to be something that we can continue going forward. As far as the Red Oak renewal, we won't be able to get into any specifics there, but as you can imagine, it's been an excellent seven-year relationship. The team there continues to remain intact. They have decades generic buying experience. The leadership there in the team has just a great group of individuals again with experience that continues to bring new ideas together to the market, to be able to help us continue to get the best cost in the marketplace. And we continue to partner well with CVS at Board Meetings, et cetera, to continue to drive that. So we feel that the both companies took into in the context, on the market conditions on generics, then we renegotiate it and we feel very good about where we are with our Red Oak extension. Take one last question. Yes. Thanks for the question. So you're right. And so the total number that is accrued assumes all 50 states, cities and counties are in. So if any single state or cities and counties within states do not elect to be part of it. The number will come down based on agreed upon proration by states. So it will decline that states not -- and cities and counties do not participate. Second thing to your point, it is multi-steps, there's a point where we get some insights to where the states are. Then there'll be another point where we'll get to understand what about cities and counties and the subdivisions are. And after all of that, we will take a look at what we'll call -- we're calling critical mass. There is no set number. So there's no minimum. Our goal has been and continues to be to get 100% participation on all 50 states in order to have the most clarity, that may not happen in anything less than that, then we as a group, we'll have to sit down and determine if that's enough clarity and participation. It's highly dependent on the states that do and don't participate. So we'll have to really step back and look at it as an overall -- from an overall standpoint, and make a decision on whether or not to move forward. Good clarification. And that concludes our Q&A session for today. I will now turn the conference back to Mike Kaufmann for closing remarks. Yes. I want to thank everybody for taking the time to be on the call and for the very helpful questions. I know there was a lot of noise in this quarter, but I just wanted to end with a few thoughts to keep in mind. We did see -- first, we did see underlying growth in FY 2021 in both of our segments, if you exclude COVID-19, which gives us confidence as we move forward -- going forward with the impacts of the pandemic, hopefully beginning to dissipate. Our guidance is for growth next year in each segment. And also if you take normalized growth in each segment, when you normalize for noise, like COVID and Cordis divestiture, we will grow in both segments. We have tailwinds behind our growth businesses. We really expect all of our growth businesses as a group to really grow at least double-digits on the top and bottom line. And we have taken some significant actions such as getting after an additional $250 million in cost savings, closing the Cordis transaction, which will enable us to simplify our operating model and extending our agreement with CVS or just a few of the examples, and it's the first question was in Jason's comment, we do have very strong cash flow generation, which gives us a lot of flexibility to be more opportunistic in our capital deployment. So with that, thanks again, and have a good day."

            "name": "Jason Hollar",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we delivered EPS of $0.77, which as Mike mentioned, included a $197 million inventory reserve on certain PPE in the Medical segment. Turning to the Pharma segment, on slide six, fourth quarter revenue increased 15% to $38 billion, driven primarily by sales growth from large pharmaceutical distribution and specialty solutions customers. As a reminder, the fourth quarter fiscal '20 included reduced pharmaceutical demand related to COVID-19, which to a lesser extent contributed to the growth in the quarter. Pharma segment profit was flat in the fourth quarter, at $358 million. This reflects COVID-19 related volume recovery in our nuclear business, offset by pharmaceutical distribution customer contract renewals. This impact in renewals was in line with our expectations, and generally consistent with prior quarters. However, there were some other items, including inventory adjustments and opioid-related legal costs that are higher than previously assumed. As we've mentioned, we continue to prioritize investing for growth and optimizing our core operations. In the fourth quarter, the deployment of some of these technology enhancements results in incremental costs for implementation and depreciation, which we also expect the next several quarters as we continue to deploy new capabilities. I will further discuss our investments as we look to fiscal year '22. As we highlighted last quarter, we continued to experience softer volumes in certain therapeutic classes within our generics program. Our generics program continue to see generally consistent market dynamics. With respect to other product types, including brand, specialty, and consume health, we largely saw volumes at or above pre-pandemic levels during the fourth quarter. In Medical, depicted on slide seven, revenue increased 23% to $4.2 billion in the fourth quarter. This revenue increase was driven by a net positive impact from COVID-19 on products and distribution primarily due to a recovery in elected procedure volumes, and a positive PPE pricing impact. Medical segment loss, of $63 million in the fourth quarter, was due to an adverse impact from COVID-19 primarily due to the previously mentioned inventory reserve, partially offset by a recovery in elected procedure volumes. Additionally, benefits from cost savings initiatives were offset by elevated supply chain costs. During the quarter, we were encouraged to see elected procedure volumes effectively return to near pre-COVID-19 levels. While our team continued to execute on our cost savings and efficiency initiatives within our global manufacturing and supply chain, we did experience elevated supply chain costs, particularly in the areas of freight, labor, and commodities. We are taking actions to help mitigate these impacts, but as we look forward, we do expect some of these higher costs to continue into next year. Now, I'll turn your attention to full-year results, beginning with the enterprise. Total company revenue increased 6% to $162 billion, with strong top line growth in both segments. Consolidated gross margin decreased 2%, to $6.8 billion. Despite sales growth, SG&A decreased 1%, reflecting the benefits of our enterprise-wide cost savings measures. Operating earnings decreased 5%, reflecting a headwind of approximately $200 million year-over-year related to COVID-19, which was split fairly evenly between the segments. Including COVID-19 operating earnings would have grown in the low-single digits in fiscal 2021. Moving below line, interest and other decreased 44% to $133 million driven by multiple items, including lower interest expense from debt reduction actions and increasing the value of our deferred compensation plan and one-time investment gains. As a reminder, deferred compensation gains or losses reported an interest in other are fully offset in corporate SG&A and net neutral to our bottom line. Our annual effective tax rate finished at 22.8% benefiting from discrete items. We finished the year with EPS of $5.57, reflecting growth of 2% despite the net COVID-19 headwind. Turning to the balance sheet, we continued to operate with high networking capital efficiency generating robust operating cash flow of $2.4 billion for the full-year. We finished the year with a strong cash position of $3.4 billion with no outstanding borrowings on our credit facilities. As a reminder, the day of the week in which the quarter ends effects point in time cash flows. We continued to deploy capital according to our priorities, investing $400 million back into the business and CapEx to drive organic growth, strengthening our balance sheet through approximately $550 million in debt pay down, which occurred primarily in the fourth quarter and returning nearly $800 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As for the segments full-year results, beginning with Pharma on slide 10, Pharma revenue increased 6% to $146 million driven by sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution and specialty solutions customers. Pharma segment profit decreased 4% to $1.7 billion due to volume declines in the company's generics program, including the impact of COVID-19. This was partially offset by favorable brand sales mix. Excluding COVID-19, we estimate the Pharma segment would have grown low-single digits in fiscal 2021. Turning to Medical on slide 11, full-year Medical revenue increased 8% to $16.7 billion driven by a net positive impact from COVID-19 on products and distribution. As we saw throughout the year, this increase was primarily due to the impact of PPE sales and higher volumes in our lab business. Medical segment profit decreased 13% to $577 million due to an adverse impact from COVID-19 on products and distribution. This was primarily due to the fourth quarter inventory reserve on certain PPE products, partially offset by higher volumes in our lab business. Additionally, the team delivered strong cost savings with putting global manufacturing efficiencies on the year. When adjusting for COVID-19 related impacts in Medical, we estimate the segment would have grown mid-single digits for the full-year. While our fiscal 2021 results fell short of our expectations. The underline growth we saw in both segments, excluding COVID-19 is this competence as we move into next year and the pandemics effects on our businesses continue to dissipate. Turning to our guidance for fiscal 2022 on slide 13, we expect earnings per share in the range of $5.60 to $5.90. This reflects incremental technology investments of approximately $120 million to drive growth in efficiencies across the enterprise, the Cordis divestiture and other assumptions by we will detail momentarily. We expect interest in other in the range of $150 million to $180 million. We anticipate continued reduction in interest expense with the increase or the prior year, primarily result of the fiscal 2021 capability in deferred compensation, not expected to repeat. We're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate in the range of 23.5% to 25.5%. We expect alluded weighted average shares outstanding in the range of $287 million to $292 million and CapEx of $400 million to $450 million. Transitioning to the segments beginning with Pharma on slide 14, we expect high-single digit revenue growth driven by growth from large customers and continued COVID-19 recovery and mid-single digit segment profit growth. We anticipate COVID-19 will be an overall tailwind of approximately $100 million to Pharma segment profit compared to the prior year. While we will likely continue to see some choppiness, we expect volume recovery in certain generic therapeutic classes by the end of the calendar year. As mentioned, we are investing in technology enhancements to drive growth and efficiencies, which we expect will lead to an $80 million segment profit headwind in fiscal 2022, including the annualization of the investments made in the fourth quarter. Adjusting for the COVID-19 related impacts and the incremental technology investments, we see Pharma normalized growth in the low-to-mid single digit range. We believe normalizing for these impacts provides a better approximation for the long range growth trajectory of the business. As for other assumptions, we continue to expect consistent market dynamics and our generics program. We expect increased contributions from our growth areas, specialty including biosimilars, nuclear and outcomes. We anticipate a similar contingent brand inflation rate as in fiscal '21 with continued left dollar contribution each year. And we expect opioid related legal costs of approximately $125 million, an increase of $10 million versus fiscal '21. For Medical on slide 15, we expect revenue to be approximately flat in fiscal '22, primarily due to the prior year COVID-19 comparison with low double-digits segment profit growth. With respect to COVID-19, we expect an approximate $100 million year-over-year tailwind to Medical segment profit. We are assuming elective procedures will remain at or near pre-COVID levels for the duration of the year. We expect modern headwinds in fiscal '22 related to timing of selling higher costs PPE products and lower lab testing utilization versus the prior year. And we anticipate a year-over-year comparison benefit related to the PPE inventory reserve. Outside of COVID-19, we expect an approximate $80 million impact segment profit due to the Cordis divestiture. Note, the anticipated reported impact for fiscal '22 is higher than previously communicated, primarily due to the exchange rate capability and other operating improvements within the business in the prior year. Additionally, we expected investment incremental $20 million in technology enhancements in our at-home business to drive growth and efficiencies. Adjusting for these items, we see normalized medical segment profit growth of mid-to-high single digits in fiscal '22. Finally, as seen in the fourth quarter, we expect elevated supply chain costs to persist, particularly in the first-half of the year. We anticipate these elevated costs will be partially offset by the continued benefits from our global manufacturing and supply chain transformation, which will ramp up throughout the year. Now a few additional comments on the expected cadence next year, we expect profit growth to be significantly back halfway to in both segments. In Pharma, this is primarily driven by the timing of the previously mentioned incremental technology investments being more weighted towards the front half, as well as stronger expected second-half performance in our generics program including the impact of COVID-19. In Medical, in addition to the elevated supply chain costs, we also anticipate the total unfavorable fiscal '22 COVID-19 impact of approximately $50 million to occur primarily in the first-half of the year. As a reminder, we also experienced favorable COVID-19 impact in the first-half of fiscal '21, which was of a similar magnitude. Throughout the organization, we continue to place a high priority on cash flow generation, as well as allocating capital in a balanced, disciplined, and shareholder friendly manner. Our strong cash flow and improving capital position will enable our capital allocation priorities support our company's obligations and provide increased flexibility and the ability to be more opportunistic in our capital deployment. Along those lines, we anticipate deploying the Cordis proceeds through a combination of share repurchases and debt paid down, which is expected to offset the earnings dilution on a pro forma basis. We expect share repurchases in the range of $500 million to $1 billion in fiscal '22. In addition, we expect total debt pay down of approximately $850 million reflecting the completion of the remaining June 2022 dead tower at or before maturity. With that, I'll now turn it over to Mike. Yes, thanks, Mike. And first of all, yes, I think we had some really great cash flow this last year, so $2.4 billion of operating cash flow. And that resulted in $3.4 billion ending cash balance, which does include the $500 million debt paydown that we completed in the fourth quarter. So, as you indicated perfectly, we're stepping into this year with a lot of flexibility even before the Cordis transaction closed, which was just a few days ago. We're still to add another $1 billion to that balance. As we highlighted in some of those comments this morning, we do expect to pay down the $815 million that's coming due by the end of the fiscal year or before end of the fiscal year. So that will be some of those uses. And then, of course, we guided towards the $500 million to $1 billion for the share repurchases, which is a fairly wide range, and reflective of some of the flexibility that we talked about. And as I think about the Cordis proceeds, of course cash is somewhat fungible, but essentially that $1 billion, how we're thinking about it is accelerating some of that debt paydown, and a portion of that $500 million to $1 billion. So, we feel real good about that as we entered into the first quarter here. You referenced the tax receivable, and I don't think we provided any updated comments on that so far. The last quarter, I'd referenced that we expect it by the end of the calendar year. It's still our expectation, like I think a lot of different organizations throughout the world right now; I think COVID has impacted some of the processes, and a little bit less certainty as to the precise timing. But we still feel pretty good that that's a good approximate timeframe. But when you think about receiving those proceeds perhaps late in the calendar year, there will less time to actually deploy those to the balance of this year. So, it's certainly still a potential opportunity to get us maybe to some of the higher end of that range. But, nonetheless, there's a lot of flexibility that goes along with that. As you indicated, when we talk about the opportunistic uses, essentially we have increased flexibility here. M&A is always on that list, and it depends on the opportunity, the valuation, and what we see delivering to us strategically. And so that will be another thing that we evaluate along the year. Thanks for question. Yes, and as it relates to the [indiscernible] on the Cordis that was implied or referenced within there, it's just a matter of the timing of which you assume when we pay down the debt and when we would complete the share repurchases. And so, there's an opportunity for that to have a reasonable range. And that that guidance range, we think, reflects what we think that possibility may be. And -- but the key thing, on a pro forma basis, is that extra $1 billion will be deployed in some manner. And we will see, and certainly within fiscal '23 run rate, there will not be dilution expected that divestiture. And as it relates to the [the other] [Ph] question, and somewhat as it relates to credit issues, there's nothing there. I mean, we're on a guidance -- a glide path to getting to our targeted leverage ratio. A key part that I referenced last quarter is that this remaining debt that's come due at the end of this fiscal year is a key part of getting us towards those targets. And I indicated, last quarter, that I would anticipate the level of debt paydown to begin to diminish after this fiscal year. That continues to be our expectation. There's a lot of factors, as Mike just referenced, that would play into that. But overall, that remains our viewpoint, and there's nothing here that is, I'll say, overly constrictive from that point. Just a little bit of prudence until we get some of these risks and uncertainties defined. And we also need to see underlying performance in cash flow over the course of the year. And then, as I mentioned before, we do have some additional flexibility as it relates to the precise timing of the tax receivable. Sure. Yes, so I'll go and start it and -- so, as Mike mentioned, the key thing here is there's been a lot of uncertainties with the pandemic. And we were first and foremost going to put our customer commitments in front of us. And that resulted in a higher level of inventory that we carried over that period time. And that happened while there was; obviously, increasing demand, higher prices, and longer than normal types of supply chains. And then we step back, at every quarter we step back and do our analysis and determine what the net realizable value that is, and then make any adjustments that may be necessary. So, as Mike highlighted, there were some highly commoditized products, so [indiscernible] is a subset of our PPE, that think of it as those products that would have more volatile type of pricing. We saw that move more dramatically over the period. And given it was a subset of our inventory, it was relatively defined. It was a relatively large percentage reduction within that, but it was contained to a certain subset. And again, we're not getting into all the details product by product, but it was that type of product that had a little bit of the value add, and therefore as a little bit easier to get more supply into the market, and that drove the prices down quicker than other products. Anything else to add, Mike? Yes. It's relates to the other moving pieces for Pharma that are a part of that underlying guidance. Our growth businesses we expect to contribute. As Mike mentioned, we expect double-digit growth for our growth businesses top line as well as bottom line, and for the Pharma business that would be of course specialty nuclear and outcomes. And then we have the year-over-year COVID benefit that I mentioned would be a key part of that. But as Mike mentioned that the customer renewals is not something that we would anticipate to be significantly different year-over-year. And then your question regarding investments, those investments are next year of -- we've spent quite heavily over the last couple of several years on the capital side of getting these IT systems in place. We are finalizing a multi-year journey now, and are starting to depreciate those assets. So there will be elevated appreciation that of course is more fixed in nature, but there's also a component of the final testing and rollout launch of the system tends to be more expensive versus capital. And so, as we're riding that roll out stage that expense will be elevated. And that far we would expect to reduce longer term certainly beyond fiscal '22, but for the balance of this year, we would expect it to be elevated and then thereafter some portion of that will come down later on. Sure. Yes, I would say it's very much continuation of what we've done to date, as you certainly recall our initial target was the $500 million and we've come close to accomplishing that after the -- just the first three years. And that was in varied areas everywhere from manufacturing, our footprint worked there to our distribution work all the way up to our functional areas. As we go forward, what we're seeing this next stage is the ability to go from more of the transactional first order benefits of like rate negotiation in areas like transportation and going further into really redesigning networks and getting into more augmented intelligence and things of that nature. We have one area that is allowing us to unlock additional value in this next stage is the Cordis divestiture. We talked about the simplification of our international operating structure. That's a -- that's an enabler for us to continue to go after additional opportunities there and then just continue on and all fronts given that we've got good momentum in place already for the existing initiatives. One thing I'd like to just clarify, as Mike indicated, if not all 50 states choose, or we come to an arrangement to join that would mean the cash payments would be lower under that structure. It does not necessarily mean the accrual would change. And that would we look at the facts and circumstances of the situation is determined what their proper accounting would be at that time. There could certainly be a difference there that we would need to evaluate."

During the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call, we please ask that you try and limit yourself to one question so that we can try and give everyone an opportunity. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Kaufmann: Thanks Kevin and good morning everyone. Before I turn it over to Jason, I will provide a few high-level thoughts. We remain focused on serving our customers and their patients and continue to advance our strategic priorities. With our resilient business model, we are navigating the effects of the pandemic on our businesses. In the quarter, we continued to see strong demand for lab and PPE products and volume recovery in our nuclear business. Medical elective procedure utilization experienced some volatility, and we saw our ongoing COVID-19 related softness in generics volumes, which we now expect to extend into the next fiscal year. With this updated assumptions, we have revised our Pharma segment outlook. Despite the impacts of COVID-19, our business fundamentals are strong, demonstrated by the underlying growth we are seeing in both segments, and we continue to advance our strategic priorities including optimizing our supply chain and portfolio. As you saw in our recently announced agreement to sell the Cordis business. As we navigate the pandemic, our customer focus remains central to our activities. We deeply appreciate that it is our responsibility to serve health care providers, their patients and those on the front lines. Although the operating environment remains dynamic, it has reinforced our critical role in the supply chain. And it highlights opportunities for us to enhance our operations and evolve for future growth. I'll discuss some of the changes we are making later in my comments. But first I\u2019ll turn it over to Jason to provide additional details on our results and outlook.\nJason Hollar: Thanks Mike. Good morning everyone. Before I dive into the current quarter as a reminder, we are now comparing against a prior year quarter that included a benefit from accelerated pharmaceutical sales and increase PPE demand due to the onset of COVID-19. Now for our consolidated third quarter results, total company revenue of $39.3 billion was in line with the prior year, consolidated gross margin for the period was $1.8 billion. SG&A decreased nearly 4% to $1.1 billion, demonstrating our enterprise-wide commitment to disciplined expense management. The net result for the quarter was operating earnings of $689 million, a decrease a 4%, 4% due to the impact of COVID-19, primarily concentrated in the Pharma segment. Adjusted for COVID-19, we estimate operating earnings would have grown mid-single digits in the quarter Moving below the line, interest and other income and expense, decreased significantly in the quarter, driven by multiple items, including an increase from the value of our deferred compensation plan investments, lower interest expense from prior period debt reduction and one-time investment gains. As we previously mentioned, deferred compensation gains or losses reported in interest and other are fully offset in corporate SG&A and net neutral to our bottom line. Average diluted shares outstanding were $294 million. Of note, during the quarter we repurchased $200 million of shares. Third quarter EPS was $1.53, which reflects an effective tax rate of 31.2%, approximately 5.5 percentage points above the prior year, due to the timing of discrete items. This includes adjustments for the resolution of all open issues with the IRS for fiscal years 2008 to 2010, as well as certain transfer pricing matters for fiscal years 2011 to 2014, which also impacted reserves for later years. Turning to cash flow in the balance sheet. We generated operating cash flow of $277 million, bringing our year-to-date operating cash flow to $1.8 billion. As a reminder, the day of the week in which the quarter ends affects point-in-time cash flows. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.5 billion, and no outstanding borrowings on our credit facilities. Now for the segment results, beginning with Pharma on slide 5. Pharma segment revenue was flat at $35.1 billion. This reflects sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution and specialty solutions customers compared against the previously mentioned COVID-19 related sales acceleration in the prior year. Segment profit decreased 4% to $511 million, primarily due to COVID-19 related volume declines in our generics program, which was partially offset by a higher contribution from brand sales mix. Excluding the volume impacts, our generics program continued to see generally consistent market dynamics. Additionally, we were encouraged to see our Nuclear business continue its recovery as we saw an improvement in volumes as we exited the quarter. In Specialty, we continue to see year-over-year growth and our excited about recent wins in our 3PL and Hub business. And the Pharma team remained focused on diligent expense management, delivering strong cost savings in the quarter. Now, I'm transitioning to Medical on slide six. Medical segment revenue increased 3% to $4.2 billion, driven primarily by a net positive impact from COVID-19 on products and distribution. As in prior quarters, we saw higher selling prices and volumes and PPE, as well as higher volumes in our Lab business partially offset by lower demand for surgical products resulting from reduced elective procedures. Segment profit decreased 2% to $174 million. During the quarter cost savings, including global manufacturing efficiencies were offset by a decline in products and distribution. Additionally, segment profits experienced a slight net negative impact due to COVID-19, driven by the sell-through of PPE safety stock in the prior year. Now, let me step back to help frame our performance sequentially within the context of the previously discussed factors. During the third quarter, demand for surgical products used in elective procedures average approximately 90% of pre-COVID-19 levels compared to the 95% average in the prior quarter. We saw choppiness, especially early in the quarter, consistent with the evolution of the virus in various geographies. But as we exited the third quarter, collect the volumes rebounded back to around 95%. Our Lab business continued to experience a tailwind from increased demand for COVID-19 testing products. So, as expected, not quite at the peak level seen last quarter. Regarding PPE, we continue to see elevated volumes. In the quarter, we were successful in managing the significant cost increases that we've incurred to procure select PPE products. As we previously mentioned, many of our customers have chosen to leverage our supply assurance program to manage market uncertainties and we continue to expect timing variability, as we support our customers through this dynamic environment. Next, on slide eight, I will review updates to our fiscal 2021 outlook. Based on our performance to-date and increased visibility for the balance of the fiscal year, we are narrowing our EPS guidance to $5.90 to $6.05, which continues to reflect 10% EPS growth at the midpoint. We are making the following changes to our corporate assumptions. We now expect interest and other in the range of $145 million to $160 million, driven primarily by the deferred compensation favorability to-date, which as a reminder is all set above the line. We are narrowing our effective tax rate to 23.5% to 25%, reflecting the previously mentioned IRS resolutions. We expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 294 million shares, which includes the repurchases completed during the quarter. Additionally, capital expenditures are now expected in the range of $400 million to $430 million. Moving to the segment outlooks on slide nine, we are updating our Pharma segment profit outlook to flat to down low single-digits due to updated expectations for COVID-19. Based on our third quarter exit rates and what we saw on April, we still expect brand pharmaceutical volumes to be at or near pre-COVID-19 levels as we exit the fiscal year, but we now expect the volume recovery of certain therapeutic classes within generics to extend into the end of calendar year 2021. As for the Medical segment, we continue to expect elective procedures to be at/or near pre-COVID levels by the end of the fiscal year, as well as segment profit growth in the low to mid 20s percentage range for fiscal 2021 With respect to the enterprise, we now expect COVID-19 to be a minimal net year-over-year driver. This guidance assumes a meaningful year-over-year COVID-19 headwind for the Pharma segment, and a similar tailwind for the Medical segments. Before I conclude, let me take a moment to provide an update on capital allocation. We continue to manage our portfolio, and the balance sheet in a prudent manner, consistent with our priorities, while at the same time driving improved financial flexibility. We expect the sale of Cordis to close in the first quarter of our fiscal 2022. This transaction, along with a previously announced tax receivable is expected to generate nearly $2 billion of incremental proceeds in the first half of our fiscal 2022. We expect to utilize these proceeds in a manner consistent with our stated capital allocation priorities, investing in the business, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and returning cash to shareholders. With respect to our first priority, investing in the business to enable our strong pipeline of organic growth opportunities, we continue to be excited by the projects implied. We expect this to remain our highest focus for capital deployment and to continue to prioritize investments in these areas. Regarding the balance sheet, as previously communicated, we expect to repay $1.4 billion of debt on/or before June 2022. Combined with prior repayments, this would represent a total debt reduction of nearly $5 billion over five years. While we will continue to evaluate additional opportunities to reduce debt, we anticipate our future repayments will be more modest as we approach our leverage target. At the same time, we are committed to our dividend, which remains an important component of our capital allocation strategy. With that in mind, our Board recently approved a 1% dividend increase for fiscal 2022. Outside of these three key priorities, we'll continue to evaluate tuck-in M&A within our strategic growth areas, an opportunistic share repurchases. As I mentioned, our improving financial flexibility enabled the deployment of capital for share repurchases during the third quarter. With that I'll turn it back over to Mike.\nMike Kaufmann: Thanks Jason. As I mentioned earlier, the last year has highlighted certain opportunities for growth, transformation and innovation. And we're confident that our strategic direction will deliver both short and long-term success. In Pharma, we are excited about the mid to long-term trajectory of the segment. Our business model is resilient. We're expecting strong, long-term growth in key areas like specialty and nuclear, both of which are rebounding well from prior COVID related impacts. And we are executing a robust pipeline of initiatives and PD to support our customers, evolving needs. We also continue to invest in new technology solutions that enhance the customer experience and improved patient care. In specialty, our recently launched Navista Tech Solutions uses artificial intelligence to identify and match cancer patients to clinical trials. These insights enable oncologists to improve outcomes and reduce costs as they transition to value-based care. We are also offering digital solutions in the connected care businesses that we recently branded collectively as outcomes. Each year, medication non-adherence costs, the U.S. healthcare system over $500 billion and contributes to around 275,000 avoidable patient death. With Outcomes, we've created a digital ecosystem that unites pharmacists, payers and pharmaceutical companies to improve medication adherence, drive better outcomes and lower the cost of care. Outcomes currently supports a network of 23 million patients and more than 60,000 pharmacy sites nationwide and through continued growth is positioned to address the challenge of medication adherence. As I look towards the future, I am excited about these innovations across the segment that combine our heritage and strengths with new technologies to create unique solutions that support our customers' ever-changing needs and create long-term value across the continuum of care. Turning to Medical, we continue to enhance our operations to better serve our customers and their patients. For example, we continue to diversify the geographic concentration of our sourcing and invest in our self-manufacturing capabilities. This includes producing 15 million more safety needles and syringes, 20 million more isolation gowns, and 150 million more surgical and procedure masks annually in our own North American facilities. We are also supporting customers' inventory needs with stockpile as-a-service storage solution in partnering with the strategic national stockpile to store and distribute 80,000 pallets of critical PPE. We are incorporating robotics, automation and data analytics across our warehouse and distribution process. We are piloting various technologies and being thoughtful about how and where to scale them across our network. We also continue to invest in key areas across the segment. For example, we are expanding our lab kitting services to support home collection for a broad array of lab tests from wellness to infectious disease, and we are coupling these services with capabilities in our Cardinal Health at Home and OptiFreight businesses to maximize value and create differentiated solutions. By meeting the patient where they are, our lab kitting supports testing protocol adherence and detection of early onset disease, ultimately, lowering the cost of care. And in Medical Services, our OptiFreight Logistics business is launching innovative and comprehensive health care logistics offerings like our same-day solutions, which is being scaled nationally to support the time-critical logistics of our customers. Together, these work streams across medical position us to support our customers and drive long-term growth. Along with these work streams in each segment, we are also focused on enterprise-wide investments as well as advancing our capital allocation, portfolio optimization, and ESG priorities. We continue to invest in our delivery networks, cold chain capabilities and supply chain capacity and visibility. For example, we are partnering with Four Kites, the largest predictive supply chain visibility platform to create a cognitive network spanning both pharma and medical that combines real-time supply chain visibility, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. This network facilitates inventory flow and gives our customers end-to-end visibility to see products in transit, enabling us to make any necessary adjustments for our customers in real time, so they can better serve their patients. Regarding our capital allocation priorities, we have strong momentum. We remain committed to investing for future growth, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders. We are on track to exceed our savings targets and are continuing to use some of these savings to reinvest in the business. We also remain focused on optimizing our portfolio. The pending sale of Cordis is progressing as expected and this divestiture enables us to simplify our operating model, further optimize our infrastructure and focus on our strategic growth areas where we are an advantaged owner. We are committed to our strategy as a global medical products and distribution leader and are focused on conducting business in markets and areas that align with our priorities. Finally, we're also advancing our environmental, social and governance activities. We recently partnered with AEP to power our global headquarters and our National Logistics Center with clean energy, and we remain deeply committed to advancing diversity, equity and inclusion at every level to ensure all of our employees can bring 100% of themselves to work every day. To close, I want to thank each of our employees whose commitment and ingenuity enable us to support our customers, their patients and our collective communities. With that, I'll pause to open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go ahead and take our first question from Michael Cherny from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cherny: Good morning and thanks for taking the question. I want to dive in a little bit to a comment you made about your expected growth on the EBIT ex COVID. I believe you said that would be mid-single digits. By my simple math, if you assume it's 5%, that gets you to roughly $66 million headwind versus the base line. So along those lines, can you break down a little bit within that area, what some of the biggest drivers were of the underperformance? And then in particular, with regards to that question and the generic volumes, any more color you can give us on some of the classes that you expect to continue to contribute to weakness over the next couple of quarters?\nJason Hollar: Sure. Yeah, this is Jason. Let me start with your first question there. And your math is very accurate. That would represent right around $60 million of overall enterprise impact due to COVID. That is entirely in the Pharma segment. Within Medical, there was a very insignificant impact in the quarter due to COVID. Now there were a lot of moving pieces, pluses and minuses, but netted out for no significant impact within the quarter. As it relates to the Pharma business, that driver is driven by the generic volumes that Mike referenced in his comments and I referenced in my comments. And I think maybe, Mike, you can provide a little bit more color behind the second part of that question.\nMike Kaufmann: Yeah. Michael, thanks for the question. And as it relates to the generics, remember, we have -- what we always talk about is our overall generics program and what we're seeing here in our overall generics program is that market dynamics are generally consistent. The only thing that has any real material impact on the program right now is generic volumes in certain therapeutic classes related to COVID-19, and it's probably not hard to think about if you've been following the IQVIA data and the other data, there are certain classes, particularly around acute scripts, where we don't see those, getting back to pre-COVID levels prior to our fiscal year and we think as you know, kids get back to school, more people are unmasking, and all those types of things, we would expect the environment to generally return, but we don't now seeing that set of certain therapeutic classes within generics returning to more of pre-COVID levels until the end of the calendar year. So, overall, again good market -- consistent market dynamics in the generic program really just focused on those few classes related to COVID.\nJason Hollar: And I'd just like to add one more thing that $60 million, remember, there was a pull ahead last year. So, only about half of it is an adverse impact in the current year The other half is related to the comparison to the prior year.\nMichael Cherny: Got it. Thanks.\nKevin Moran: Next question.\nOperator: And we'll go ahead and move on to our next question from Charles Rhyee from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nCharles Rhyee: Yes, thanks for taking the question. If I could follow-up on that. When you say certain therapeutic classes related to COVID, so are we talking like cold, cough, and flu like kind of flu and antibiotics, these kind of generic that might have been -- we're not seeing it because we had a weak flu season and you wouldn't expect that until maybe this coming flu season?\nMike Kaufmann: Yes, it's a great question, and I'll try to be helpful here. Yes, I would say flu season, as we know, has been light. But we've also said in the past, generally, if it were just flu season itself and just flu specific, like focused on just like a Tama flu in some of those, it wouldn't be that big of a driver. It would be a negative for us, but it wouldn't be probably a material driver that we would call out. But you said it well at the beginning; it's really the broader list of categories. So, it's antibacterials, antibiotics, antivirals and pain meds, those generics and those categories are what we're seeing that are -- have just not returned the pre-COVID levels. And if you look at the IQVIA data in these categories, what we're seeing both in our own data per, as you can imagine, a lot of conversations across the various classes of trade, it's very consistent in what we're seeing in terms of those volumes coming back.\nCharles Rhyee: Thanks. And if I could just follow-up real quick. Were we seeing these dynamics last quarter? And is it more that -- more of this was prescribed last year during COVID versus this year? And so that's what we -- or is it the depression that people haven't been going to the doctors and you don't see people still really going back to the doctor as much that that's driving this? Thanks.\nMike Kaufmann: Yes, it's hard to know for sure, but I'll give you a couple of thoughts. One is I think it is somewhat related to the physician office visits. Second of all, people are masking, social distancing, washing hands. You don't have the people playing like sports at the same level and all those things and having the injuries related to pain meds and all of those things. So, I think it's a combination of a lot of those things adding up. We've been seeing this in monitoring all the categories. And we've been saying since the beginning of the year, our assumption for guidance for both Pharma and the overall company has been about getting back to pre-COVID -- at or near pre-COVID levels by June 30. And it's good to know that we're seeing that in brand. We're still expecting that. We're seeing that in the majority of generics, particularly the chronic generics. Those are coming back. But we were hoping to see more of a ramp than these other ones. We're just not seeing it. So we believe that it's important not only through March, but we also looked at our April data. So it drove us to make a decision to change our Pharma guidance for this year.\nCharles Rhyee: Great. Thank you.\nMike Kaufmann: Next question.\nOperator: We'll go ahead and move on to our next question from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yeah. Hi, good morning. So my question is still on generic about on pricing, clearly it's a big debate for investors now. So Mike, what are you seeing in terms of generic pricing, are you seeing accelerated deflation or any other trends, and also if you can talk a little bit about the sell, buy-side spread?\nMike Kaufmann: Yeah. Thanks, Ricky. Thanks for the question. As you know, it's really hard to get into individual components of the generics program, because as we've said for a while now, just calling out sell-side deflation without talking about the buy-side, the cost improvements or launches or overall volumes, it's -- you're really not giving a complete story. And that's why we've really been focused on just discussing how we see our overall generics program performing. And we really are seeing market dynamics are generally consistent with the only driver in the programs I just mentioned being COVID-related volumes in certain categories.\nRicky Goldwasser: Okay. And a follow-up question there. When we think about the sell-side, I think we also need to think about contract renewals that could change dynamics. Are there any contract renewals either for your book of business or across the industry that either renewed recently or there are upcoming that you can point us to, if there any?\nMike Kaufmann: Yeah. As far as contract renewals go, on the ones that we specifically talk about our three largest ones, which we have disclosed, those still have a couple of years left on them before there's any renewals of those contracts. And everything else as it relates to contract renewals for this year is generally tracking as expected. It's always one of those headwinds as a year-over-year basis, but everything is tracking as we expected at the beginning of this year.\nRicky Goldwasser: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll move on to our next question from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRobert Jones: Great. Thanks for the question. I guess maybe just to move over to medical, Mike. Obviously, COVID has created a couple cross currents in that business as far as PPE and then the lack of utilization. Could you maybe just tell us where we are today as we think about those two broad buckets, the benefits that obviously you had and probably continue to see from PPE and testing versus the core business coming back as utilization starts to become more normal?\nJason Hollar: Yes. This is Jason. Thanks for the question. I'll start. Within -- let's just step back from a COVID perspective overall for the medical business. As I mentioned in my prior answer, overall, for the quarter, there was an insignificant impact in the quarter related to COVID, a lot of moving pieces, and I'll get into a couple of the key drivers. As a reminder, just like the Pharma comment earlier, there was a prior year pull-forward for PPE volume that we sold out of inventory we do have a slight negative year over year impact which is related to the prior year tailwind that did not repeat in the current quarter. So the pieces within the quarter that we saw was ongoing elective volume headwinds. And what we did see in the quarter was a little bit of a deterioration from the prior quarter. So we saw -- in my comments in the prepared remarks, we saw that the utilization went down from 95% in the second quarter to closer to 90% in the third. But as I highlighted, it did improve at a tail end and back to the 90%. And that was very consistent with what we saw with the surge in the virus. And so, we feel better about how we exited that quarter. And why we did not change our guidance for the medical business as it relates to this topic as well, just that we expected to be at or near pre-COVID levels by the end of the year. We did continue to see strength in our lab business, although it was a little bit less than what we had in the prior quarter, but still strength. And that was an offset. And then we continue to see strong volumes with PPE. But again, you're comparing against a strong volume quarter last year. And we did have some favorability still for the timing of the recognition of the pricing cost associated with the much higher cost with PPE. And those dynamics continue to be somewhat fluid, but we do definitely still see higher costs, higher prices for some of the PPE products, especially gloves, some moderation, but generally still elevated and anything else to add, Mike?\nMike Kaufmann: No that sums it up well.\nRobert Jones: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: And we'll move on to our next question from Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSteven Valiquette: Hey, thanks good morning guys. So -- usually, when there is some negative supply/demand imbalance on commoditized products, it can impact price. So with the softer generic volume on those categories that you mentioned, the antibacterials, antibiotics, etcetera, I guess for me, I would just visualize that both the buy side and the sell-side pricing would maybe come down simultaneously on those products in conjunction with the softer Rx demand. I'm just curious if that's consistent with what you saw. I just want to confirm that one way or the other. So not to beat this topic to death, but just wanted to get some confirmation around that? Thanks.\nMike Kaufmann: Yes. That's a hard question to answer in the sense of the level of detail of looking at all of our -- both our buy side and sell side for all those individual categories. Nothing pops out to me related to that component of the driver. As I said, really, overall, the generic program market dynamics were generally consistent. It was more just a volume-related item on those categories. Nothing stands out in pricing, whether it be buy or sell that I would call out.\nSteven Valiquette: Okay. All right, thanks.\nMike Kaufmann: Thanks.\nOperator: And we'll move on to our next question from Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. \nLisa Gill: Hey, thanks very much and good morning, Mike and Jason. Just really want to try to understand the puts and takes as we think about COVID going into 2022 from a comp perspective. Can you just remind us what the benefit or what the headwind has been for medical and pharmacy as we think about trying to model that going into next year?\nMike Kaufmann: Sure. Yes. I can start and then turn it over to -- turn it over to Jason. As you know, our practice is that we're -- we're not -- we don't provide formal guidance on 2022 until August, but we'll try to give you a little bit of color to be helpful. I'll start with the fact that we still feel really good about our growth areas. So when we think about specialty, at home, nuclear, medical services and outcomes, we feel really good about all of these businesses. We think they all have strong industry trends, strong outlooks, complementary capabilities to our businesses and our -- we continue to adapt their offerings to focus on our customers' needs. So, I would say, we would still expect all of those growth areas to be positive drivers for next year. And then, let me have Jason give you a little bit of color on maybe a few of the other dynamics.\nJason Hollar: Sure. Thanks, Mike. Yeah. And to enable -- let me just start with, to enable those types of growth areas, we are making investments in our business, and we'll continue to make investments in those businesses. One thing to highlight is, as we've invested more capital over the last couple or several years, that will ultimately result in increased depreciation that we would expect to flow through. But, of course, we would also expect the benefits of the programs, but we'll have some varying pieces there going forward. Beyond that element, again, investing our business being our highest capital deployment priority, we have the other areas like debt reduction and returning capital to shareholders, some of which will be through share repurchases that should have a tailwind associated with it also. Getting into your question around COVID. That is, of course, where we'll see a lot of movement from a year-over-year perspective. As a reminder, we highlighted in fiscal 2020 that we had roughly $100 million headwind associated with COVID, which was more than all in the fourth quarter. Now this year, and then just in this -- today's script, today's prepared remarks, we commented that it was a relatively consistent flat impact year-over-year from a COVID perspective now in this update. So that implies roughly $100 million included in fiscal 2021. Now the key question is, exactly how does that roll off down to 2022? And I would first go back and highlight that a number of the areas we anticipate getting at or near pre-COVID levels by the end of the fiscal year, like the medical elective volumes, nuclear to a similar extent. The brand volumes we've highlighted are also similar. It's those very specific therapeutic drugs within generics will be deferred then until more like the middle of our fiscal 2022. So there will be some offset there that will continue on into the next year. Now there's going to be a lot of other moving pieces with COVID. We would expect there still to be some elevated demand for areas like PPE and the lab business. But we also have the timing elements associated with PPE pricing costs that we continue to track very closely, and it will really be a function of those pricing and cost dynamics, as we go forward. So when I think about the two different segments, what that really comes down to is that certainly, the greatest impact, we have a headwind built into this guidance and that $100 million associated with the pharma business, and we have now more of a tailwind for the medical business. And so, we highlighted that from a year-over-year perspective as well in the prepared remarks that it's a meaningful impact in both this year. And so they will behave then differently next year. And then, of course, the other key piece to think about the puts and takes is the announcement of the sale of Cordis. So we do anticipate that being in the first quarter, hopefully, earlier in the first quarter and we disclosed prior that, that business carries about a $60 million to $70 million annualized earnings rate. And so as we get more specific to exact timing and other details around that, we will provide more color as to what the impact will be for our fiscal 2022.\nLisa Gill: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll move on to our next question from Eric Percher from Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nEric Percher: Thank you. Question on the Specialty business, It sounds like you're expecting that trend to normalizing in that business. I want to ask how the profitability levels have been running in that business, whether you're seeing benefits from biosimilars. And of late, there's been a call out of maybe some of the oral solid products that are more specialty generic and biosimilars. Are you participating in economics on those?\nMike Kaufmann: Yes, I would say there's nothing I would call out that's dramatically changing in our Specialty, particularly as it relates to the sales of drugs into the physician office space that we're seeing generally consistent profitability. We are participating in the various different opportunities in there, whether it be actual generics that are in Specialty, the biosimilars. We're participating in all of those activities. We're seeing increased volumes on certain key drugs. And as you know, we've been saying for a while, we have seen oncology come back more quickly than the other areas, but we do expect all the classes of the trade at this point in time within Specialty to be at or near pre-COVID levels by the end of our fiscal year. And then as it goes to our upstream services businesses like our 3PL, our hub and other businesses, those businesses continue to perform well and compete very effectively in the marketplace.\nKevin Moran: Next question please.\nOperator: And we'll move on to our next question from Jailendra Singh from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nJailendra Singh: Thanks and good morning. I was wondering if you could double click into manufacturing efficiencies you highlighted in the Medical segment. Can you provide some details there? And are any of those efficiencies in the Cordis business that will be rolling off versus your core business?\nMike Kaufmann: Yes, I mean we've clearly had manufacturing efficiencies in our Cordis business, like all of our manufacturing businesses. The team there has just done an excellent job across all of our 30 or more global manufacturing plants at driving efficiencies. There's nothing in particular about the Cordis efficiencies that would change the estimate that Jason just gave you that, that business, when it rolls off, hopefully, in our -- early in our first quarter of next year would have about a $60 million or $70 million earnings associated with it.\nJailendra Singh: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll move on to our next question from George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Hill: Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. Jason, you kind of alluded to this already, but have you been able to fully capture the pricing gap that occurred earlier this year as it related to PPE and supplies and the bed business? And I guess also, could you update us on the supply side as we think about your things like access to gloves and gowns to provide for your customers? And then I tack on at the end to relate to Jailendra's question, are there any dissynergies from the Cordis divestiture?\nJason Hollar: Sure. Yes. So, yes, we have captured the cost increases. The supply assurance program that we've referenced was created to do exactly that, to provide certainty to supply for our customers, but working with them closely to ensure that we're able to cover those costs. What I have referenced, I think, fairly consistently the last couple of quarters is that the timing of when that cost is recognized versus when the price is recognized can be uncertain, can be relatively volatile and that\u2019s what we continue to look at and to manage. But the overall economics of the program are as expected and intended, which is to cover that cost. And then as it relates to -- I think your question was about access to the products. It continues to improve, but especially on the glove side, it's still constrained, but improving day-by-day. There's clearly capacity that's being worked in to provide more supply. But especially in gloves, it just takes -- it's a longer process to get that supply to market. As it relates to Cordis and any dissynergies, I wouldn't call it dissynergies. There are -- certainly, when we look at just our overall cost structure and stranded costs; there's things of that nature. But when we estimate the $60 million to $70 million, that's the all-in impact that's associated with that. We would not anticipate that there are other issues. In fact, I'd go the opposite way. Part of what we've highlighted before about this transaction is that it allows us to focus and to simplify our operating structure around the remaining businesses. And so we think it will create some opportunities for additional synergies more of -- than more of a dissynergies by being more focused on the cost efficiencies of what remains.\nMike Kaufmann: The only thing I would add to that, too, to be helpful is we have really invested in our overall own global manufacturing capabilities. And if you remember in my script, for instance, we're a large manufacturer of syringes. We've increased our capacity there by 15 million units on an annual basis. On gowns, we've added capacity to add 20 million-some manufacturers gowns a year. And our mask were at 150 million more masks a year annually; all in our own facilities, which are all either US or near US, they're all North American types of facilities. So, we've been done, I think, a very excellent job in the Medical segment of increasing our capacity and which what really, I think, strengthens our supply chain. And we've also invested in our sourcing capabilities and broadened our relationships with suppliers. So, we feel really good about some of the changes in developments we've made in our overall supply chain in Medical.\nGeorge Hill: Thank you.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Please go ahead.\nKevin Caliendo: Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to go back to the sort of the headwinds and tailwinds for fiscal 2022. If I'm sort of netting everything out, it sounds like COVID impact for Medical is going to be incremental -- like you considered an incremental negative. Did I think about that right? Can we just go through that one more time?\nJason Hollar: Yes. For the Medical business, I would anticipate that the impact of COVID in the fiscal year, so not a year-over-year comparison, but just what's the impact of COVID will be a tailwind for this year. So, the question is, well, what are those same types of dynamics next year? Do we see more permanent longer-lasting PPE volumes, lab volumes? I've referenced the timing associated with the price and cost of PPE that could carry over into next year. But if it goes all -- if everything goes back to what a pre-COVID world looked like, it would imply a headwind. Of course, we expect there to be a more significant tailwind opportunity on the Pharma side, but specifically to the Med business, that's the right way to look at it. And just one thing to add additional color to where I'm sure you're trying to go with the question, is that when we think about our full year guidance of the low to mid-20s percentage growth, obviously, we have within that, some of that benefit I'm talking about. And just to be real clear, even if you back that out, we do have growth in the Medical business, but it is a key part of the growth that we're seeing this year as well.\nKevin Caliendo: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And with that, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mike Hoffman for closing remarks.\nMike Kaufmann: Yes, I just want to thank everyone for joining us today. And we and the entire Cardinal Health team hope you and your family stay safe and well, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon.\nOperator: And with that, that does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Mike Kaufmann",
            "content": "Thanks Kevin and good morning everyone. Before I turn it over to Jason, I will provide a few high-level thoughts. We remain focused on serving our customers and their patients and continue to advance our strategic priorities. With our resilient business model, we are navigating the effects of the pandemic on our businesses. In the quarter, we continued to see strong demand for lab and PPE products and volume recovery in our nuclear business. Medical elective procedure utilization experienced some volatility, and we saw our ongoing COVID-19 related softness in generics volumes, which we now expect to extend into the next fiscal year. With this updated assumptions, we have revised our Pharma segment outlook. Despite the impacts of COVID-19, our business fundamentals are strong, demonstrated by the underlying growth we are seeing in both segments, and we continue to advance our strategic priorities including optimizing our supply chain and portfolio. As you saw in our recently announced agreement to sell the Cordis business. As we navigate the pandemic, our customer focus remains central to our activities. We deeply appreciate that it is our responsibility to serve health care providers, their patients and those on the front lines. Although the operating environment remains dynamic, it has reinforced our critical role in the supply chain. And it highlights opportunities for us to enhance our operations and evolve for future growth. I'll discuss some of the changes we are making later in my comments. But first I'll turn it over to Jason to provide additional details on our results and outlook. Thanks Jason. As I mentioned earlier, the last year has highlighted certain opportunities for growth, transformation and innovation. And we're confident that our strategic direction will deliver both short and long-term success. In Pharma, we are excited about the mid to long-term trajectory of the segment. Our business model is resilient. We're expecting strong, long-term growth in key areas like specialty and nuclear, both of which are rebounding well from prior COVID related impacts. And we are executing a robust pipeline of initiatives and PD to support our customers, evolving needs. We also continue to invest in new technology solutions that enhance the customer experience and improved patient care. In specialty, our recently launched Navista Tech Solutions uses artificial intelligence to identify and match cancer patients to clinical trials. These insights enable oncologists to improve outcomes and reduce costs as they transition to value-based care. We are also offering digital solutions in the connected care businesses that we recently branded collectively as outcomes. Each year, medication non-adherence costs, the U.S. healthcare system over $500 billion and contributes to around 275,000 avoidable patient death. With Outcomes, we've created a digital ecosystem that unites pharmacists, payers and pharmaceutical companies to improve medication adherence, drive better outcomes and lower the cost of care. Outcomes currently supports a network of 23 million patients and more than 60,000 pharmacy sites nationwide and through continued growth is positioned to address the challenge of medication adherence. As I look towards the future, I am excited about these innovations across the segment that combine our heritage and strengths with new technologies to create unique solutions that support our customers' ever-changing needs and create long-term value across the continuum of care. Turning to Medical, we continue to enhance our operations to better serve our customers and their patients. For example, we continue to diversify the geographic concentration of our sourcing and invest in our self-manufacturing capabilities. This includes producing 15 million more safety needles and syringes, 20 million more isolation gowns, and 150 million more surgical and procedure masks annually in our own North American facilities. We are also supporting customers' inventory needs with stockpile as-a-service storage solution in partnering with the strategic national stockpile to store and distribute 80,000 pallets of critical PPE. We are incorporating robotics, automation and data analytics across our warehouse and distribution process. We are piloting various technologies and being thoughtful about how and where to scale them across our network. We also continue to invest in key areas across the segment. For example, we are expanding our lab kitting services to support home collection for a broad array of lab tests from wellness to infectious disease, and we are coupling these services with capabilities in our Cardinal Health at Home and OptiFreight businesses to maximize value and create differentiated solutions. By meeting the patient where they are, our lab kitting supports testing protocol adherence and detection of early onset disease, ultimately, lowering the cost of care. And in Medical Services, our OptiFreight Logistics business is launching innovative and comprehensive health care logistics offerings like our same-day solutions, which is being scaled nationally to support the time-critical logistics of our customers. Together, these work streams across medical position us to support our customers and drive long-term growth. Along with these work streams in each segment, we are also focused on enterprise-wide investments as well as advancing our capital allocation, portfolio optimization, and ESG priorities. We continue to invest in our delivery networks, cold chain capabilities and supply chain capacity and visibility. For example, we are partnering with Four Kites, the largest predictive supply chain visibility platform to create a cognitive network spanning both pharma and medical that combines real-time supply chain visibility, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. This network facilitates inventory flow and gives our customers end-to-end visibility to see products in transit, enabling us to make any necessary adjustments for our customers in real time, so they can better serve their patients. Regarding our capital allocation priorities, we have strong momentum. We remain committed to investing for future growth, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders. We are on track to exceed our savings targets and are continuing to use some of these savings to reinvest in the business. We also remain focused on optimizing our portfolio. The pending sale of Cordis is progressing as expected and this divestiture enables us to simplify our operating model, further optimize our infrastructure and focus on our strategic growth areas where we are an advantaged owner. We are committed to our strategy as a global medical products and distribution leader and are focused on conducting business in markets and areas that align with our priorities. Finally, we're also advancing our environmental, social and governance activities. We recently partnered with AEP to power our global headquarters and our National Logistics Center with clean energy, and we remain deeply committed to advancing diversity, equity and inclusion at every level to ensure all of our employees can bring 100% of themselves to work every day. To close, I want to thank each of our employees whose commitment and ingenuity enable us to support our customers, their patients and our collective communities. With that, I'll pause to open it up for questions. Yeah. Michael, thanks for the question. And as it relates to the generics, remember, we have -- what we always talk about is our overall generics program and what we're seeing here in our overall generics program is that market dynamics are generally consistent. The only thing that has any real material impact on the program right now is generic volumes in certain therapeutic classes related to COVID-19, and it's probably not hard to think about if you've been following the IQVIA data and the other data, there are certain classes, particularly around acute scripts, where we don't see those, getting back to pre-COVID levels prior to our fiscal year and we think as you know, kids get back to school, more people are unmasking, and all those types of things, we would expect the environment to generally return, but we don't now seeing that set of certain therapeutic classes within generics returning to more of pre-COVID levels until the end of the calendar year. So, overall, again good market -- consistent market dynamics in the generic program really just focused on those few classes related to COVID. Yes, it's a great question, and I'll try to be helpful here. Yes, I would say flu season, as we know, has been light. But we've also said in the past, generally, if it were just flu season itself and just flu specific, like focused on just like a Tama flu in some of those, it wouldn't be that big of a driver. It would be a negative for us, but it wouldn't be probably a material driver that we would call out. But you said it well at the beginning; it's really the broader list of categories. So, it's antibacterials, antibiotics, antivirals and pain meds, those generics and those categories are what we're seeing that are -- have just not returned the pre-COVID levels. And if you look at the IQVIA data in these categories, what we're seeing both in our own data per, as you can imagine, a lot of conversations across the various classes of trade, it's very consistent in what we're seeing in terms of those volumes coming back. Yes, it's hard to know for sure, but I'll give you a couple of thoughts. One is I think it is somewhat related to the physician office visits. Second of all, people are masking, social distancing, washing hands. You don't have the people playing like sports at the same level and all those things and having the injuries related to pain meds and all of those things. So, I think it's a combination of a lot of those things adding up. We've been seeing this in monitoring all the categories. And we've been saying since the beginning of the year, our assumption for guidance for both Pharma and the overall company has been about getting back to pre-COVID -- at or near pre-COVID levels by June 30. And it's good to know that we're seeing that in brand. We're still expecting that. We're seeing that in the majority of generics, particularly the chronic generics. Those are coming back. But we were hoping to see more of a ramp than these other ones. We're just not seeing it. So we believe that it's important not only through March, but we also looked at our April data. So it drove us to make a decision to change our Pharma guidance for this year. Next question. Yeah. Thanks, Ricky. Thanks for the question. As you know, it's really hard to get into individual components of the generics program, because as we've said for a while now, just calling out sell-side deflation without talking about the buy-side, the cost improvements or launches or overall volumes, it's -- you're really not giving a complete story. And that's why we've really been focused on just discussing how we see our overall generics program performing. And we really are seeing market dynamics are generally consistent with the only driver in the programs I just mentioned being COVID-related volumes in certain categories. Yeah. As far as contract renewals go, on the ones that we specifically talk about our three largest ones, which we have disclosed, those still have a couple of years left on them before there's any renewals of those contracts. And everything else as it relates to contract renewals for this year is generally tracking as expected. It's always one of those headwinds as a year-over-year basis, but everything is tracking as we expected at the beginning of this year. No that sums it up well. Yes. That's a hard question to answer in the sense of the level of detail of looking at all of our -- both our buy side and sell side for all those individual categories. Nothing pops out to me related to that component of the driver. As I said, really, overall, the generic program market dynamics were generally consistent. It was more just a volume-related item on those categories. Nothing stands out in pricing, whether it be buy or sell that I would call out. Thanks. Sure. Yes. I can start and then turn it over to -- turn it over to Jason. As you know, our practice is that we're -- we're not -- we don't provide formal guidance on 2022 until August, but we'll try to give you a little bit of color to be helpful. I'll start with the fact that we still feel really good about our growth areas. So when we think about specialty, at home, nuclear, medical services and outcomes, we feel really good about all of these businesses. We think they all have strong industry trends, strong outlooks, complementary capabilities to our businesses and our -- we continue to adapt their offerings to focus on our customers' needs. So, I would say, we would still expect all of those growth areas to be positive drivers for next year. And then, let me have Jason give you a little bit of color on maybe a few of the other dynamics. Yes, I would say there's nothing I would call out that's dramatically changing in our Specialty, particularly as it relates to the sales of drugs into the physician office space that we're seeing generally consistent profitability. We are participating in the various different opportunities in there, whether it be actual generics that are in Specialty, the biosimilars. We're participating in all of those activities. We're seeing increased volumes on certain key drugs. And as you know, we've been saying for a while, we have seen oncology come back more quickly than the other areas, but we do expect all the classes of the trade at this point in time within Specialty to be at or near pre-COVID levels by the end of our fiscal year. And then as it goes to our upstream services businesses like our 3PL, our hub and other businesses, those businesses continue to perform well and compete very effectively in the marketplace. Yes, I mean we've clearly had manufacturing efficiencies in our Cordis business, like all of our manufacturing businesses. The team there has just done an excellent job across all of our 30 or more global manufacturing plants at driving efficiencies. There's nothing in particular about the Cordis efficiencies that would change the estimate that Jason just gave you that, that business, when it rolls off, hopefully, in our -- early in our first quarter of next year would have about a $60 million or $70 million earnings associated with it. The only thing I would add to that, too, to be helpful is we have really invested in our overall own global manufacturing capabilities. And if you remember in my script, for instance, we're a large manufacturer of syringes. We've increased our capacity there by 15 million units on an annual basis. On gowns, we've added capacity to add 20 million-some manufacturers gowns a year. And our mask were at 150 million more masks a year annually; all in our own facilities, which are all either US or near US, they're all North American types of facilities. So, we've been done, I think, a very excellent job in the Medical segment of increasing our capacity and which what really, I think, strengthens our supply chain. And we've also invested in our sourcing capabilities and broadened our relationships with suppliers. So, we feel really good about some of the changes in developments we've made in our overall supply chain in Medical. Yes, I just want to thank everyone for joining us today. And we and the entire Cardinal Health team hope you and your family stay safe and well, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon."

            "name": "Jason Hollar",
            "content": "Thanks Mike. Good morning everyone. Before I dive into the current quarter as a reminder, we are now comparing against a prior year quarter that included a benefit from accelerated pharmaceutical sales and increase PPE demand due to the onset of COVID-19. Now for our consolidated third quarter results, total company revenue of $39.3 billion was in line with the prior year, consolidated gross margin for the period was $1.8 billion. SG&A decreased nearly 4% to $1.1 billion, demonstrating our enterprise-wide commitment to disciplined expense management. The net result for the quarter was operating earnings of $689 million, a decrease a 4%, 4% due to the impact of COVID-19, primarily concentrated in the Pharma segment. Adjusted for COVID-19, we estimate operating earnings would have grown mid-single digits in the quarter Moving below the line, interest and other income and expense, decreased significantly in the quarter, driven by multiple items, including an increase from the value of our deferred compensation plan investments, lower interest expense from prior period debt reduction and one-time investment gains. As we previously mentioned, deferred compensation gains or losses reported in interest and other are fully offset in corporate SG&A and net neutral to our bottom line. Average diluted shares outstanding were $294 million. Of note, during the quarter we repurchased $200 million of shares. Third quarter EPS was $1.53, which reflects an effective tax rate of 31.2%, approximately 5.5 percentage points above the prior year, due to the timing of discrete items. This includes adjustments for the resolution of all open issues with the IRS for fiscal years 2008 to 2010, as well as certain transfer pricing matters for fiscal years 2011 to 2014, which also impacted reserves for later years. Turning to cash flow in the balance sheet. We generated operating cash flow of $277 million, bringing our year-to-date operating cash flow to $1.8 billion. As a reminder, the day of the week in which the quarter ends affects point-in-time cash flows. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.5 billion, and no outstanding borrowings on our credit facilities. Now for the segment results, beginning with Pharma on slide 5. Pharma segment revenue was flat at $35.1 billion. This reflects sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution and specialty solutions customers compared against the previously mentioned COVID-19 related sales acceleration in the prior year. Segment profit decreased 4% to $511 million, primarily due to COVID-19 related volume declines in our generics program, which was partially offset by a higher contribution from brand sales mix. Excluding the volume impacts, our generics program continued to see generally consistent market dynamics. Additionally, we were encouraged to see our Nuclear business continue its recovery as we saw an improvement in volumes as we exited the quarter. In Specialty, we continue to see year-over-year growth and our excited about recent wins in our 3PL and Hub business. And the Pharma team remained focused on diligent expense management, delivering strong cost savings in the quarter. Now, I'm transitioning to Medical on slide six. Medical segment revenue increased 3% to $4.2 billion, driven primarily by a net positive impact from COVID-19 on products and distribution. As in prior quarters, we saw higher selling prices and volumes and PPE, as well as higher volumes in our Lab business partially offset by lower demand for surgical products resulting from reduced elective procedures. Segment profit decreased 2% to $174 million. During the quarter cost savings, including global manufacturing efficiencies were offset by a decline in products and distribution. Additionally, segment profits experienced a slight net negative impact due to COVID-19, driven by the sell-through of PPE safety stock in the prior year. Now, let me step back to help frame our performance sequentially within the context of the previously discussed factors. During the third quarter, demand for surgical products used in elective procedures average approximately 90% of pre-COVID-19 levels compared to the 95% average in the prior quarter. We saw choppiness, especially early in the quarter, consistent with the evolution of the virus in various geographies. But as we exited the third quarter, collect the volumes rebounded back to around 95%. Our Lab business continued to experience a tailwind from increased demand for COVID-19 testing products. So, as expected, not quite at the peak level seen last quarter. Regarding PPE, we continue to see elevated volumes. In the quarter, we were successful in managing the significant cost increases that we've incurred to procure select PPE products. As we previously mentioned, many of our customers have chosen to leverage our supply assurance program to manage market uncertainties and we continue to expect timing variability, as we support our customers through this dynamic environment. Next, on slide eight, I will review updates to our fiscal 2021 outlook. Based on our performance to-date and increased visibility for the balance of the fiscal year, we are narrowing our EPS guidance to $5.90 to $6.05, which continues to reflect 10% EPS growth at the midpoint. We are making the following changes to our corporate assumptions. We now expect interest and other in the range of $145 million to $160 million, driven primarily by the deferred compensation favorability to-date, which as a reminder is all set above the line. We are narrowing our effective tax rate to 23.5% to 25%, reflecting the previously mentioned IRS resolutions. We expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 294 million shares, which includes the repurchases completed during the quarter. Additionally, capital expenditures are now expected in the range of $400 million to $430 million. Moving to the segment outlooks on slide nine, we are updating our Pharma segment profit outlook to flat to down low single-digits due to updated expectations for COVID-19. Based on our third quarter exit rates and what we saw on April, we still expect brand pharmaceutical volumes to be at or near pre-COVID-19 levels as we exit the fiscal year, but we now expect the volume recovery of certain therapeutic classes within generics to extend into the end of calendar year 2021. As for the Medical segment, we continue to expect elective procedures to be at/or near pre-COVID levels by the end of the fiscal year, as well as segment profit growth in the low to mid 20s percentage range for fiscal 2021 With respect to the enterprise, we now expect COVID-19 to be a minimal net year-over-year driver. This guidance assumes a meaningful year-over-year COVID-19 headwind for the Pharma segment, and a similar tailwind for the Medical segments. Before I conclude, let me take a moment to provide an update on capital allocation. We continue to manage our portfolio, and the balance sheet in a prudent manner, consistent with our priorities, while at the same time driving improved financial flexibility. We expect the sale of Cordis to close in the first quarter of our fiscal 2022. This transaction, along with a previously announced tax receivable is expected to generate nearly $2 billion of incremental proceeds in the first half of our fiscal 2022. We expect to utilize these proceeds in a manner consistent with our stated capital allocation priorities, investing in the business, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and returning cash to shareholders. With respect to our first priority, investing in the business to enable our strong pipeline of organic growth opportunities, we continue to be excited by the projects implied. We expect this to remain our highest focus for capital deployment and to continue to prioritize investments in these areas. Regarding the balance sheet, as previously communicated, we expect to repay $1.4 billion of debt on/or before June 2022. Combined with prior repayments, this would represent a total debt reduction of nearly $5 billion over five years. While we will continue to evaluate additional opportunities to reduce debt, we anticipate our future repayments will be more modest as we approach our leverage target. At the same time, we are committed to our dividend, which remains an important component of our capital allocation strategy. With that in mind, our Board recently approved a 1% dividend increase for fiscal 2022. Outside of these three key priorities, we'll continue to evaluate tuck-in M&A within our strategic growth areas, an opportunistic share repurchases. As I mentioned, our improving financial flexibility enabled the deployment of capital for share repurchases during the third quarter. With that I'll turn it back over to Mike. Sure. Yeah, this is Jason. Let me start with your first question there. And your math is very accurate. That would represent right around $60 million of overall enterprise impact due to COVID. That is entirely in the Pharma segment. Within Medical, there was a very insignificant impact in the quarter due to COVID. Now there were a lot of moving pieces, pluses and minuses, but netted out for no significant impact within the quarter. As it relates to the Pharma business, that driver is driven by the generic volumes that Mike referenced in his comments and I referenced in my comments. And I think maybe, Mike, you can provide a little bit more color behind the second part of that question. And I'd just like to add one more thing that $60 million, remember, there was a pull ahead last year. So, only about half of it is an adverse impact in the current year The other half is related to the comparison to the prior year. Yes. This is Jason. Thanks for the question. I'll start. Within -- let's just step back from a COVID perspective overall for the medical business. As I mentioned in my prior answer, overall, for the quarter, there was an insignificant impact in the quarter related to COVID, a lot of moving pieces, and I'll get into a couple of the key drivers. As a reminder, just like the Pharma comment earlier, there was a prior year pull-forward for PPE volume that we sold out of inventory we do have a slight negative year over year impact which is related to the prior year tailwind that did not repeat in the current quarter. So the pieces within the quarter that we saw was ongoing elective volume headwinds. And what we did see in the quarter was a little bit of a deterioration from the prior quarter. So we saw -- in my comments in the prepared remarks, we saw that the utilization went down from 95% in the second quarter to closer to 90% in the third. But as I highlighted, it did improve at a tail end and back to the 90%. And that was very consistent with what we saw with the surge in the virus. And so, we feel better about how we exited that quarter. And why we did not change our guidance for the medical business as it relates to this topic as well, just that we expected to be at or near pre-COVID levels by the end of the year. We did continue to see strength in our lab business, although it was a little bit less than what we had in the prior quarter, but still strength. And that was an offset. And then we continue to see strong volumes with PPE. But again, you're comparing against a strong volume quarter last year. And we did have some favorability still for the timing of the recognition of the pricing cost associated with the much higher cost with PPE. And those dynamics continue to be somewhat fluid, but we do definitely still see higher costs, higher prices for some of the PPE products, especially gloves, some moderation, but generally still elevated and anything else to add, Mike? Sure. Thanks, Mike. Yeah. And to enable -- let me just start with, to enable those types of growth areas, we are making investments in our business, and we'll continue to make investments in those businesses. One thing to highlight is, as we've invested more capital over the last couple or several years, that will ultimately result in increased depreciation that we would expect to flow through. But, of course, we would also expect the benefits of the programs, but we'll have some varying pieces there going forward. Beyond that element, again, investing our business being our highest capital deployment priority, we have the other areas like debt reduction and returning capital to shareholders, some of which will be through share repurchases that should have a tailwind associated with it also. Getting into your question around COVID. That is, of course, where we'll see a lot of movement from a year-over-year perspective. As a reminder, we highlighted in fiscal 2020 that we had roughly $100 million headwind associated with COVID, which was more than all in the fourth quarter. Now this year, and then just in this -- today's script, today's prepared remarks, we commented that it was a relatively consistent flat impact year-over-year from a COVID perspective now in this update. So that implies roughly $100 million included in fiscal 2021. Now the key question is, exactly how does that roll off down to 2022? And I would first go back and highlight that a number of the areas we anticipate getting at or near pre-COVID levels by the end of the fiscal year, like the medical elective volumes, nuclear to a similar extent. The brand volumes we've highlighted are also similar. It's those very specific therapeutic drugs within generics will be deferred then until more like the middle of our fiscal 2022. So there will be some offset there that will continue on into the next year. Now there's going to be a lot of other moving pieces with COVID. We would expect there still to be some elevated demand for areas like PPE and the lab business. But we also have the timing elements associated with PPE pricing costs that we continue to track very closely, and it will really be a function of those pricing and cost dynamics, as we go forward. So when I think about the two different segments, what that really comes down to is that certainly, the greatest impact, we have a headwind built into this guidance and that $100 million associated with the pharma business, and we have now more of a tailwind for the medical business. And so, we highlighted that from a year-over-year perspective as well in the prepared remarks that it's a meaningful impact in both this year. And so they will behave then differently next year. And then, of course, the other key piece to think about the puts and takes is the announcement of the sale of Cordis. So we do anticipate that being in the first quarter, hopefully, earlier in the first quarter and we disclosed prior that, that business carries about a $60 million to $70 million annualized earnings rate. And so as we get more specific to exact timing and other details around that, we will provide more color as to what the impact will be for our fiscal 2022. Sure. Yes. So, yes, we have captured the cost increases. The supply assurance program that we've referenced was created to do exactly that, to provide certainty to supply for our customers, but working with them closely to ensure that we're able to cover those costs. What I have referenced, I think, fairly consistently the last couple of quarters is that the timing of when that cost is recognized versus when the price is recognized can be uncertain, can be relatively volatile and that's what we continue to look at and to manage. But the overall economics of the program are as expected and intended, which is to cover that cost. And then as it relates to -- I think your question was about access to the products. It continues to improve, but especially on the glove side, it's still constrained, but improving day-by-day. There's clearly capacity that's being worked in to provide more supply. But especially in gloves, it just takes -- it's a longer process to get that supply to market. As it relates to Cordis and any dissynergies, I wouldn't call it dissynergies. There are -- certainly, when we look at just our overall cost structure and stranded costs; there's things of that nature. But when we estimate the $60 million to $70 million, that's the all-in impact that's associated with that. We would not anticipate that there are other issues. In fact, I'd go the opposite way. Part of what we've highlighted before about this transaction is that it allows us to focus and to simplify our operating structure around the remaining businesses. And so we think it will create some opportunities for additional synergies more of -- than more of a dissynergies by being more focused on the cost efficiencies of what remains. Yes. For the Medical business, I would anticipate that the impact of COVID in the fiscal year, so not a year-over-year comparison, but just what's the impact of COVID will be a tailwind for this year. So, the question is, well, what are those same types of dynamics next year? Do we see more permanent longer-lasting PPE volumes, lab volumes? I've referenced the timing associated with the price and cost of PPE that could carry over into next year. But if it goes all -- if everything goes back to what a pre-COVID world looked like, it would imply a headwind. Of course, we expect there to be a more significant tailwind opportunity on the Pharma side, but specifically to the Med business, that's the right way to look at it. And just one thing to add additional color to where I'm sure you're trying to go with the question, is that when we think about our full year guidance of the low to mid-20s percentage growth, obviously, we have within that, some of that benefit I'm talking about. And just to be real clear, even if you back that out, we do have growth in the Medical business, but it is a key part of the growth that we're seeing this year as well."

Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statement slide at the beginning of our presentation for a description of these risks and uncertainties. Please note that during the discussion today, our comments will be on a non-GAAP basis, unless they are specifically called out as GAAP. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for all relevant periods can be found in the schedule attached to our press release. During the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call, we please ask that you try and limit yourself to one question, so that we can try and give everyone an opportunity. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Kaufmann: Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll start our discussion with a few high level thoughts on our progress so far this year. And then, Jason will review our second quarter results and our updated fiscal \u201821 outlook. I\u2019ll close by sharing updates regarding our growth areas. We continue to make progress on our strategic plan as we navigate the rapidly changing global environment. Overall, second quarter operating results came in better than our expectation, led by the Medical segment. In addition, we saw some favorability, including timing below the operating line, enabling us to deliver EPS growth of 14% in the quarter. Due to our solid first half performance and our improved visibility into the remainder of the fiscal year, we are increasing and narrowing our EPS guidance to a range of $5.85 to $6.10 per share. In the second quarter, we saw varying effects of the pandemic on our business. Our Medical segment saw a net positive impact related to COVID-19 as our lab business and PPE products continued to experience strong demand. And in pharma, although the pandemic continued to adversely impact volumes, mainly in generics and nuclear imaging, areas like specialty and consumer health are recovering and performing very well. Across the Company, we remain focused on doing our part to support ongoing pandemic release efforts. In Pharma, we partnered with the CDC to act as a network administrator, enabling retail independent, small chain and long-term care pharmacy customers to participate in the vaccination effort. And in Medical, we partnered with the state of Ohio to support vaccine distribution through our OptiFreight Logistics business. Regarding PPE, we are utilizing our Supply Assurance program to manage costs for our customers and provide consistent long range supply in key product categories. We are seeing improving supply in some of these product categories, such as gowns and masks, but continue to see a challenging market with exam gloves. Looking ahead, we remain committed to supporting our customers, patients, government and communities through the ongoing challenges of the pandemic. And we are ready and willing to help in any way possible. Before I provide some updates on our strategic growth areas, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jason to share more details on our second quarter and outlook for the year.\nJason Hollar: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. Beginning with total Company results, second quarter ups was $1.74, reflecting a 14% increase, driven by discrete tax items and strong Medical results. Total second quarter revenue increased 5% to $41.5 billion, driven primarily by sales growth from existing customers. Total gross margin was flat at $1.8 billion. SG&A increased 2% to $1.1 billion, due to IT investments. The net result for the quarter was consolidated operating earnings of $628 million, a decrease of 3%, which reflects a modest net negative impact for the enterprise from COVID-19. The Pharma segment was adversely affected by COVID-19 during the quarter, and this was partially offset by a net positive impact in Medical. I\u2019ll discuss these segment impacts shortly. Interest and other expense decreased 33% versus the prior year to $34 million, driven primarily by lower interest expense as a result of prior year debt reduction, as well as an increase in the value of our Company\u2019s deferred compensation plan investments. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 13%, which reflects the impact of certain discrete items. Now, a quick note on the GAAP tax impact during the quarter. Primarily due to self-insurance loss in our fiscal \u201820 federal tax return, we will carry back and recover previously paid federal taxes at rates that were in effect at that time. And as such, in the quarter, we recorded a net GAAP tax benefit of $420 million associated with the recovery of prior taxes. Additionally, we have recorded a corresponding receivable of approximately $1 billion, which we expect to receive within the next 12 months. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. We generated robust operating cash flow of $1.2 billion, during the quarter. As a reminder, the day of the week, in which the quarter ends, affects point-in-time cash flows. We ended the second quarter with a cash balance at $3.7 billion, and no outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities. We remain focused on taking appropriate action to maintain our investment grade balance sheet. Our next debt maturity is in June 2022 with approximately $1.4 billion coming due. By the end of fiscal \u201822, we intend to reduce long-term debt by that amount, so the exact timing and method may vary as we continue to evaluate the economics associated with early retirement of debt. Now, turning to the segments, beginning with Medical on slide 5. Medical revenue increased 7% in the second quarter to $4.3 billion, driven by a net positive revenue impact from COVID-19 and solid execution by our team. As we have previously discussed, we saw higher selling prices and volumes regarding PPE and higher volumes in our lab business, partially offset by reduced surgical products demand, resulting from deferred and canceled elective procedures. Segment profit increased 21% to $236 million, driven by a net positive impact from COVID-19 and cost savings, which includes global manufacturing efficiencies. The net positive segment profit impact from COVID-19 was primarily due to higher lab volumes as well as increased contributions from PPE that were offset by the previously mentioned elective procedure impacts. As it relates to lab, we continue to experience a tailwind from increased demand for COVID-19 testing products. While difficult to predict, we expect this demand to remain elevated for at least the balance of fiscal \u201821. Regarding PPE, we saw both, higher volumes and timing favorability related to our cost mitigation efforts. As previously mentioned, we have incurred significantly higher procurement costs for select PPE products during the pandemic, and we expect the timing of selling the higher cost products to vary, as we continue to manage our supply assurance program for our customers. On electives, although procedure volumes continue to be choppy and still below prior year levels, second quarter volumes were generally consistent with our first quarter exit rate, down mid-single digits versus our pre-COVID-19 baseline. Finally, as in the first quarter, we continue to see savings resulting from cost containment measures during the pandemic. And outside of COVID-19 impacts, we continue to realize benefits from our efficiency initiatives, like our global manufacturing and supply chain transformation, which we expect will continue to deliver strong savings. Transitioning to the Pharma segment on slide 6. Revenue increased 4% to $37.2 billion, driven by sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution and specialty solutions customers. Pharma segment profit decreased 11% to $413 million. This was driven by COVID-19-related volume declines in our generics program and nuclear business, and was partially offset by a higher contribution from brand sales mix in the quarter. Our specialty solutions business continues to demonstrate resilience, both downstream with providers and upstream with biopharma manufacturers, and again achieved strong overall growth in the quarter. Also, our generics program when excluding the previously mentioned volume impact of COVID-19, continued to see generally consistent market dynamics. Next, on slide 8, I will review the updates to our fiscal \u201821 outlook. Due to our solid first half performance and better visibility into the back half of fiscal \u201821, we are raising and narrowing our EPS guidance range to $5.85 to $6.10 per share, which at the midpoint represents 10% year-over-year EPS growth. This improvement is driven by strong performance in our Medical segments, as well as updates below the operating line. Regarding updates to other corporate assumptions, we now expect interest and other in the range of $165 million to $185 million with the improvement primarily driven by the impact of our deferred compensation plan adjustments. As a reminder, deferred compensation adjustments are fully offsetting corporate SG&A and net neutral to our bottom line. We\u2019re lowering our non-GAAP ETR range for the year to 23% to 25%, which reflects our year-to-date effective tax rate of 18% and higher expected effective tax rate in the back half of the fiscal year, due to the timing of discrete items. We also now expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to finish the year in the range of 294 million to 295 million. Regarding the segment outlooks on slide 9. For Medical, due to the previously discussed drivers, we now expect segment profit percentage growth in the low to mid-20s and revenue growth for the year in the range of high-single to low-double digits. Regarding the Pharma segment, we are maintaining our current guidance ranges of mid-single-digit revenue growth and low-single-digit profit growth. To conclude, some comments on our enterprise COVID-19 assumptions for the back half of fiscal year as we begin to lap initial impact to the pandemic in the prior year. We continue to expect the utilization to be choppy and to exit the fiscal year at or near prepandemic levels. And for the enterprise, in fiscal \u201821, we continue to expect the year-over-year net negative impact from COVID-19, though less than originally anticipated, due to improved medical expectations. I\u2019ll now turn it back over to Mike.\nMike Kaufmann: Thanks, Jason. I\u2019d now like to take a moment to elaborate on how this unprecedented time has reinforced our critical role in healthcare and how we see this role evolving as we look toward and beyond the second half of the fiscal year. I said last quarter that we aspire to be healthcare\u2019s most trusted partner and create the greatest value for our customers, shareholders, communities, and employees. We create this value by efficiently operating resilient business models, deploying capital with discipline and investing for growth, all while prioritizing the health, safety and development of our teams. First, as we\u2019ve seen throughout the pandemic, we operate resilient business models that can address today\u2019s challenges and adapt for the future. For example, as Jason highlighted, our lab business continues to enhance its offerings throughout the pandemic. Through our Cardinal Health brand portfolio and our distribution relationships, we supply instrumentation, reagents and consumables, enabling both, independent and acute laboratories to support the health of patients. We are also enhancing our core Medical and Pharmaceutical distribution and product capabilities, as we continue to adapt these models for the future. We are making strong progress in both segments on our supply chain work streams in generating near and long-term efficiencies. For example, we began work this quarter on a new 1 million square-foot Medical segment replenishment center, near Chicago, that we expect to be operational in the fourth quarter. This facility is the second of its kind in the last year, and is part of our multi-year plan to improve the customer experience, consolidate our network and increase capacity to meet customers\u2019 requests for pandemic storage. We are also making strategic investments in our IT infrastructure to enhance our customer experience and digital capabilities. At the same time, we are investing in our differentiated portfolio to drive strategic, long-term growth in key areas and not only support, but also anticipate our customers\u2019 needs. Our investments in the areas of specialty, at home, medical services, nuclear and connected care will enable us to capture benefits from favorable industry trends and to develop specialized customer solutions, utilizing our breadth and scale. Recall, I noted at a recent conference that these five businesses represent $25 billion in total revenue, and together, they have a double digit historical three-year revenue CAGR. Let me highlight a few of these areas in greater detail. In medical services, which includes our OptiFreight Logistics and WaveMark businesses, we are investing in technologies to drive continued innovation that will meet the evolving needs of our customers. For example, with our recently announced TotalVue Analytics tool in our OptiFreight business, we are using data to help our customers drive insights and savings in their healthcare supply chain logistics management. And in WaveMark, which as a reminder, is a software-as-a-service platform, optimizing supply chain and clinical workflow processes for acute care, we have seen growth in both, our installations and our pipeline, as we continue to go live with additional customers. WaveMark has also recently initiated partnership opportunities to explore solutions to help lab managers and supply chain leaders manage the increased demand for critical test kits and lab supplies. As our nuclear business continues its recovery related to the pandemic, our team remains focused on long-term plans to further strengthen our leading industry position. We continue to build out our Center for Theranostics Advancements in Indianapolis, and are excited about the pharmaceutical innovators coming on board. From supporting manufacture development of radiopharmaceuticals to commercialization and distribution, we are working together to change the way patient care is delivered. In addition, our recent customer loyalty survey results were excellent, showcasing our differentiated value proposition in the market. Our efforts over the past six years to transform our selling model, strengthen our world class service levels, and launch new products and services are deeply appreciated by our customers. And we are excited about the mid to long-term future of this business. And finally, in Connected Care, we are making additional investments in technology solutions and actionable data tools to take advantage of the double-digit growth we are seeing, and to enable more meaningful, cost effective and outcomes-driven connections between payers, manufacturers, pharmacists and patients. Demand for these solutions continues to increase, with our services currently reaching 60,000 pharmacies, 23 million patients, and 60 payers. We are sending more than 400 million tests annually to support medication management. And in the last quarter, we have designed, developed and implemented tools to help our pharmacy customers administer the COVID-19 vaccine, with more than 2,500 locations already engaged. We will continue to share progress in each of these growth areas, and then our core capability initiatives as they materialize, over the coming year. Before I close, I want to thank the team here at Cardinal Health, who continued to do a tremendous job adapting and responding to the changing needs of our customers as we navigate the pandemic. Finally, I will reiterate that what we do matters to our customers, shareholders, employees and communities. As we move forward, we are using our breadth, scale and expertise to provide products and solutions to create value and improve lives. With that all pause to open up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Michael Cherny of Bank of America.\nMichael Cherny: Good morning, and thanks for all the color so far. If I can dive a little bit into the Pharma headwinds, as you think about the outlook for the rest of the year. How do you think about the trajectory and the visibility on nuclear, and then, also the headwinds on generic and when they could recover for you?\nMike Kaufmann: Yes. Thanks for the question, Michael. I appreciate it. I guess, really couple of things to keep in mind. We\u2019re really pleased with the resiliency of our Pharma segment, both in the pharma distribution as well as the specialty and nuclear business. We do continue to see really COVID-19 being the main driver of any headwinds we\u2019re seeing there. It\u2019s good, so far, that a lot of the things that might affect the segments, such as brand, inflation, that\u2019s kind of off the table from what we\u2019ve seen in January. We feel like we\u2019re executing really well on our initiatives. And also, from a cost savings standpoint, we\u2019re on track. And then, generics, which is, always one of the -- could be one of the swing factors, we\u2019re not seeing anything inconsistent there from what we\u2019ve seen in prior quarters. So, a lot of those swing factors are really off the table when we look at the rest of the year for Pharma. But, what we really see is, COVID being the main swing factor. The things I would say there is that we saw a lot of choppiness in the quarter. We would expect it to continue to be choppy for the second half of the year. But, we still are expecting to exit at or near pre-COVID levels. And as we said, our guidance continues to be low-single-digit growth for the segment.\nJason Hollar: And if I could just add one point, Michael, it\u2019s Jason. And your point about nuclear, we did see the headwind year-over-year be a little bit less than what we saw in the first quarter. So, kind of follows -- continuing to follow a little bit of what we\u2019re seeing with electives a little bit more than other elements of the underlying volumes. So, not a lot of new news there, but a slight improvement sequentially.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.\nRobert Jones: Hey, great. Thanks for the question. Maybe on the Medical business, I think we all understand that COVID\u2019s having significant impact across the segment. But, I was hoping maybe you could help us with what you\u2019re assuming in the back half in Medical, particularly on the EBIT line. It just seems, based on the results to-date and the updated guidance, you\u2019d have to see kind of mid-20 declines in the back half versus the front half. And I know, there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces related to COVID, but I think at a high level, Mike, I would think, as you maybe see some of the drivers of the front half potentially fade, you would obviously see the legacy kind of surgery recovery product lines pick up. Just trying to get a better sense of what you\u2019re assuming that could really drive this kind of back half decline versus what you\u2019ve seen in the front half.\nJason Hollar: Yes. This is Jason. Let me start it off. Yes. Like you said, we\u2019re really pleased with our first half performance. Certainly, two good quarters here now, as well as on top of last year\u2019s double-digit growth as well, and then still guiding to low to mid-220s for the year, we feel very good about. To the point about the trends first half versus second half, as we stated in the remarks, we did see some Q2 favorability as it relates to our cost mitigation efforts on certain PPE products. So, that\u2019s an element that was a component in addition to the volume strength that we saw in lab and the volume strength that we saw in PPE that drove medical to actually have a net tailwind associated with COVID in the quarter. And so, that\u2019s just one thing that will continue to vary quarter-to-quarter as we go forward. The other item that we talked about last quarter as well is that we continue to be very aggressive with our cost control over the first half of the year here, a lot of uncertainty in the underlying volumes. And so, we wanted to make certain that we had a lot of flexibility going into the second half of the year. And then, the third point I\u2019d make is just that we do continue to make long-term investments in our business. As we highlighted as the number one capital deployment priority is to invest in our strong pipeline of organic growth opportunities. And so, we always trade off our level of spend in that regard as well.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Jailendra Singh with Credit Suisse.\nJailendra Singh: Hi. Thank you. You mentioned a few things you\u2019re doing to help with the vaccine rollout. I realize these programs in and off themselves aren\u2019t going to move the needle for the Company. But just curious as to how this work might set the Company up for future opportunities for you guys to participate in future phases of vaccine distribution.\nMike Kaufmann: Thanks. I appreciate the question. Yes. We\u2019ve been -- continue to be involved in staying up-to-date and everything as it relates to the vaccine. As we\u2019ve said, we are working with the State of Ohio, helping them distribute the vaccine. And we\u2019re also a partner with the CDC acting as a network administrator. And so, we continue to do that. And there are some other areas where we\u2019re having some small touch in that area. At the end of the day, I believe that -- our belief is that this is one of the most important events in the country\u2019s history, and that bringing the full scale of the distribution capabilities of all the distributors to the market is going to make the most sense over the long term to be able to effectively distribute and get the vaccines to folks. And so, we continue to make sure that we\u2019re doing all the things to make our self ready to be able to participate and help out however we can.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Eric Percher with Nephron Research.\nEric Percher: Thank you. Can we dig into the PP&E price dynamics a little bit? I think, last quarter, you talked about the ability to pass on pricing. And this quarter, I expect that we were going to see some input costs increases. So, can you help square that with the pull-forward you just mentioned? And maybe more broadly, price versus cogs, Q1 to Q2, and then what to assume second half?\nJason Hollar: Sure. Yes. Thanks for the question. And let me just kind of step back and talk about PPE in general and try to loop in that piece as well. Certainly, the overall the demand dynamic here obviously continues to be quite strong, and we are seeing certain components get a little bit more in balance between supply and demand. But, certainly, cost remains elevated across all categories. It\u2019s probably even more extreme in terms of that supply and demand imbalance remaining in exam gloves. So, we continue to see that demand just far outstripping that supply, which has created some just some supply chain inconsistency, not only -- so now we\u2019re dealing with just the timing of supply, but we\u2019re also dealing with all the different timing elements of the cost increases and price increases. So, it just becomes a bit of an uncertain combination of different influences that have driven some of these costs increases to be delayed then until later quarters. So, overall, our key objective remains the same to make sure we\u2019re mitigating all these cost increases and working with our customers with the Supply Assurance program. But the timing is going to vary, as we said last quarter, and we\u2019ll continue to manage that as appropriate.\nMike Kaufmann: Yes. The only thing I would add is that while the PPE is clearly a driver, our lab business really was a big driver for us this quarter in the Medical segment. And we continue to be excited about its growth. And its ability to continue to maintain that growth, at least for the remainder of fiscal \u201821 is our current assumption.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Lisa Gill, JP Morgan.\nLisa Gill: Mike, I just wanted to get an understanding of how you\u2019re thinking about utilization, as we go into the back half of your fiscal year. One, are you seeing an impact with less cough, cold and flu? And then secondly, you talked about the RX segment in the quarter having an impact due to generics? What are you seeing, is it more of a trend? You said branding, what -- kind of came in line or was positive? Is that new prescription volumes continue to be down, at least based on the data we see with IQVIA? Is there anything going on with your buying groups? Just how do we think about utilization, and any other comments you can give us around how to think about the drug distribution -- or the Pharma distribution component of your business in the back half?\nMike Kaufmann: Yes. Thanks, Lisa. A couple things I would say. I guess, first of all, it\u2019s important to know that sequentially, there is really not a lot of difference between what we saw in volumes between Q1 and Q2 for our Pharma business. And also I would say that -- all the impact that we\u2019re seeing on volumes in generics is really from our view just related to COVID-19. So, we\u2019re not seeing any other dynamics such as buying groups or other challenges like that impacting our generics program. It\u2019s really just the volume as it relates to the COVID-19. And as we said that -- we expect that to continue to be choppy. We saw a lot of up and down over the last six months. We would expect that for the second half of the year, but do expect to still get back to at or near pre-COVID levels by the end of the year. As it relates to flu, as you know, this has become less and less of a driver in general, for us. It can be a small driver. And as far as the flu goes, we\u2019ve hardly seen much at all. So, in terms of -- vaccine distribution has been a little higher, but all of the other type of ancillary products such as the Tamiflus and those types of things, they have been down obviously. But again, it\u2019s incredibly tiny driver for us and was not something that is driving any of the concern or any challenges that we might be looking at in Pharma, which again, we just are focused on COVID.\nOperator: Thank you. We will go next to Glen Santangelo with Guggenheim.\nGlen Santangelo: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Jason, I just wanted to ask a quick question about your share count guidance and your interest expense guidance. It looks like you raised the share count guidance but you lowered the interest expense guidance. And I appreciate the comments you made with respect to the deferred comp adjustments. But, I was just curious, if you\u2019re changing at all your capital deployment priorities in the near-term? And secondly to that, is the potential opioid settlement at all a consideration in your capital deployment priorities for the balance of the year?\nJason Hollar: Okay, great. So, in terms of interest, let\u2019s start there. Yes, you\u2019re right. Consistent with my comments, the deferred comp elements is driving the guidance change. And as I highlighted, that\u2019s entirely a flip-flop between interest and other and corporate SG&A. So, there\u2019s no net EPS change associated with that. And of course, interest rates, although low, we have a substantial part of our capital structure fixed. So, we just don\u2019t see a lot of variation, as it relates to where rates have been. And so, then -- I\u2019m sorry, there were three parts. What was the second part?\nGlen Santangelo: Share count.\nJason Hollar: Okay. So, the share count, we\u2019re still within the guidance range of what we had before. It is slightly at the high end, to your point, as you can see. In the first quarter, we didn\u2019t do any share repo; we didn\u2019t do any in the second quarter as well. But the high end of that share count would imply no repo. The low end of this new range would be modest amount of repo. So, that\u2019s what\u2019s baked within that assumption. As it relates to the capital deployment, certainly, we haven\u2019t changed our priorities. Of course, we work within those priorities. And just to reinforce that, we continue to invest in our business first and foremost as we are really confident with that strong pipeline of organic growth opportunities. And you saw that this quarter with the medical global manufacturing and supply chain work, we\u2019re making some great progress there and we want to continue to feed those activities. The other point that I referenced in my commentary is consistent with the second priority was just to maintain our strong investment grade balance sheet. So, I did highlight that we intend to reduce our debt by about $1.4 billion, as it comes due at the end of our fiscal \u201822. And we think that\u2019s consistent with that priority. And then, of course, we return the cash to shareholders, primarily through the dividend as our third priority. After that, it is repo and other bolt-on strategic M&A. But, we\u2019ll continue to look at that opportunistically, as we get more confidence on variables, such as opioids is certainly one of the elements we look at all the time. And as our confidence increases, we make more progress, understanding what the framing of that looks like. Then, we\u2019ll continue to evaluate if we can be more aggressive on any of those other components. But, we continue to balance all those each and every day. \nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.\nGeorge Hill: Hey. Good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the question. I kind of wanted to go back to Eric\u2019s topic a little bit on PPE pricing. I was wondering if you guys would be willing to kind of call out the positive impact of pricing in the first half of the year. And Mike, I guess, I\u2019d be interested in your commentary on how long pricing stays elevated? Do we think this is the new normal or at some point in the future, are we going to have to worry about PPE price deflation?\nJason Hollar: Yes. So, let me start, at least with that first part. We\u2019re not going to break out explicitly the pricing separately. First of all, it\u2019s just really important to highlight that the pricing is meant to cover that cost increase. And so, that\u2019s what we\u2019re balancing there. We did, however, say in our last guidance update in Q1, that the vast majority of that revenue guidance increase for Medical was due to pricing, which was due to that cost that was increasing. With this update, it\u2019s definitely more balanced, more weighted towards volume increases in the lab business, as well as volume increases in PPE, and then, to a lesser extent, any type of price changes. So, it\u2019s -- I would just go back to the guidance increase and it gives you a better understanding of what that PPE pricing dynamic is being driven by.\nMike Kaufmann: Yes. The only thing I would emphasize, just to make sure that it\u2019s clear is, as the cost of the PPE comes down, our revenue will come down. But again, our goal has always been to maintain margin dollars and work with our customers on an assurance program. And so, you shouldn\u2019t think about declining PPE costs necessarily being a headwind for us, other than revenue. And, as Jason said -- but the timing of when you have the actual sale price and the cost as they flow through that can create a little bit of lumpiness in the recognition.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yes. Hi. Good morning. So, two questions here. One on the pharma distribution segment. When we look at the implied growth for second half, EBIT is growing faster than revenue. Now, clearly, there are some easy year-over-year comps versus the same period last year. But, as we think -- and I know it\u2019s too early to think about 2022. But really, if we think about different drivers that expectation that generic volumes are going to come back and nuclear, which is higher margin, is it sustainable for us to think that we\u2019d be able model EBIT continuing to grow faster than revenues for the distribution segment? And my other question was just if you can give us a quick update on opioids and where we stand?\nMike Kaufmann: Sure. As far as -- I\u2019ll just cover the opioids quickly. As I\u2019ve said in the past, it continues to be, as you know, complex negotiations, a lot of moving parts, but we\u2019re continuing to make progress there. As far as on the Pharma guidance goes or thoughts there, obviously, we can\u2019t talk about at this time \u201822. But, you\u2019re right on those components. First of all, we would expect, if we exit at or near pre-COVID levels that our nuclear business would continue to improve sequentially, as it goes forward. And we have a lot of confidence in that business. As you know, I highlighted it in my comments around not only how they\u2019re performing well in the current situation, but also the investments we\u2019ve made to be able to see growth in that business over the mid and long-term in the theranostics space. And then, again, as far as generics go, I guess, the main reason that we have seen that our generic volumes are off is because of COVID. And so, rest of the program continues to be -- as we expected, we continue to see that program, all the various components that we have in it are essentially working as we expected, which is COVID being the driver. So, again, as COVID begins to be less and less of an impact, we would expect to see our volumes in our generics programs to grow.\nJason Hollar: Yes. The other thing I\u2019ll add is, relative to the nuclear comment, Ricky, as it relates to the revenue and margin balance there, I think, you\u2019re on the right point that as we talked, especially in Q4 of last year, when the volumes were declining quickly, nuclear is a high-margin business. It is also a high fixed cost business. So, it creates a very high contribution margins that we saw certainly create a headwind in that fourth quarter. And so, as we anniversary that in this fourth quarter, especially if our guidance is accurate with the -- at or near pre-COVID levels, by the time we exit the fiscal year, then you would expect there to be, for that piece of it, an improvement in earnings relative to revenue as one of the key components that probably needs to be plugged into your model to make that whole thing make sense.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen.\nCharles Rhyee: Yes. Hey, thanks for taking the questions. Just on the Pharma side, can you talk about biosimilars and to the extent that they\u2019ve had an impact? Commentary from some of your peers would suggest that it\u2019s starting to become a more meaningful contributor. Just wanted to get a sense, within -- in the Pharma segment, how much that\u2019s having an impact? And then -- yes, that\u2019s basically it. Thanks.\nMike Kaufmann: Yes. Biosimilars continues to be an area we\u2019re also excited about. We are seeing positive contributions from biosimilars. It just doesn\u2019t -- it\u2019s not at the level to be calling it out as necessarily the driver at this point in time. But it\u2019s something that we do continue to participate in. We\u2019re very well-positioned to be able to help manufacturers and customers with biosimilars, and we do see that as something that should be a tailwind for us, as we look forward, going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Steven Valiquette with Barclays.\nSteven Valiquette: Great, thanks. Good morning, everybody. So, I think, in the Pharma segment, we\u2019re all just kind of looking at the trend line where the segment operating profits grew 1% year-over-year back in the fiscal first quarter, but then they were down 11% in here in fiscal 2Q. You mentioned that the nuclear pharmacy headwind was actually a little bit less in the December quarter. And I think you said in the Q&A that for the generic you\u2019re not seeing anything inconsistent there from what you saw on the prior quarter know, despite the COVID impact on generics. I guess, just the question is, is there anything else you\u2019d call out that may have gotten a little bit worse sequentially in that segment, or that just maybe there is something else that made the comp a little bit tougher in the December quarter that we overlooked? I just want to get more color on the decline in profits in fiscal 2Q versus in fiscal 1Q. Thanks.\nJason Hollar: Yes. As Mike mentioned earlier, we saw very consistent type of performance in a number of categories, sequentially Q1 to Q2. We talked about the COVID impact. We talked about generics in general, the consistent market dynamics. So, you do need to go back to look at the Q2 of the prior year, where -- that\u2019s where the generics program overall was fairly strong. And we talked at that point about not only volume, but some mixed impacts that were going on at that time. So, I think it\u2019s very much a comp as well as consistency within quarter to quarter sequentially.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore.\nElizabeth Anderson: Hi, guys. Good morning. I think, I\u2019m going to ask about a different vector. In terms of your home health business, can you talk about how that has been performing in the quarter, and maybe sort of your expectations as we move through the rest of COVID and beyond?\nMike Kaufmann: Yes. We continue to be very pleased with our at-home business. We\u2019re continuing to see growth in overall number of customers that we\u2019re serving, the types of product line that we\u2019re working with and driving our mix. All of those types of things getting after our cost structure. We are making some large investments in our IT systems that will be going online here. So, a little increased SG&A as we drive to improve our systems there to be able to improve the customer experience, and as we grow, be able to do it more effectively. But, it\u2019s a business that we continue to remain very positive on. We believe the trends are continuing to be in our favor in that business. And being one of the leaders in that space I think enables us to invest in various activities and opportunities to continue to grow that business.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Eugene Kim, Wolfe Research.\nEugene Kim: Thank you, and good morning. I would love to get some color on cost savings benefit in the Medical segment. Can you maybe quantify the benefit you saw for the quarter and share how much of that savings are more temporary in nature? And also, if you are expecting those temporary savings to come back in the back half? Thank you.\nJason Hollar: Yes. So, within the quarter, we called out two key items. One is this topic, cost savings as well as and the COVID impacts. And they were both the most significant items that are driving our year-over-year performance. So, in terms of the order of magnitude, you should think of that as a large driver of this performance and consistent with that other driver. How we break out our cost savings is that they would by their nature be largely permanent. Anything that\u2019s temporary, and only because of COVID or COVID-related matters, we would put into the COVID bucket. So, we do see this as continuous improvement and deepens our DNA, and that we aren\u2019t just squeezing out costs temporarily, but truly transformational, foundational elements. It\u2019s just within our SG&A expense, within our global manufacturing and our supply chain, and as such, we\u2019d expect it to be permanent.\nMike Kaufmann: Yes. And the only thing I would add to that is, as Jason mentioned earlier, remember that because of some of the strong performance we\u2019ve had in Medical and in the business in the first half, there are some areas in Medical expenses where we are investing in the business as we\u2019ve talked about from a capital standpoint. I just mentioned the IT business and the at-home, and we\u2019re also looking at some other areas. So, we are ramping up some of our expenses that in the area of making investments and growing the business over the mid to short-term. So, we would expect them to be a little higher in the second half. But to our $500 million five-year goal, those are seen as permanent expenses that come out. But, what we\u2019re talking about is ramping back up the type of investments based on how we feel strongly about the performance of the business for the full year.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Eric Coldwell with Baird.\nEric Coldwell: Thanks and good morning. We\u2019ve been hearing a lot about stockpile as a service or storage as a service in medical, and perhaps even in certain areas of pharma or therapeutics, mission-critical items that are often in short supply. I\u2019m just curious, it sounds like you\u2019re doing some similar things here. And I\u2019m curious what the model looks like with that business. Is this more like a 3PLC, or how exactly does that work? When does the customer buy the product from you? How are you compensated for the facilities, the capital costs, the storage, et cetera? Thanks.\nMike Kaufmann: I think, a couple things. First of all, the last thing you said is important is that we would intend to be properly compensated for that to make sure as with any investment or working with customers, to make sure that the services that we provide, we\u2019re getting compensated for not only from a income statement, but appropriately looking at our balance sheet and the return. So, that\u2019s important to know. To give you specifically on how it works, that\u2019s a little more complicated because I think it\u2019s -- we\u2019re going to see inventory changes across the entire supply chain. I think, you\u2019re obviously, one, going to see some supply changes in the way the probably the manufacturers work, and the amount of inventory they\u2019re carrying to be able to get through these types of things. The location of our supply chain and where the percentage of what we self manufacturer versus what we source, we continue to increase our capacity, for instance, manufacture our own drapes and gowns. And so, the ability to ramp that up, store inventory and managing it that way would be one. And then, as I mentioned, we are building some larger distribution centers. So, we have the capacity to do that on our end, both to make sure our service levels are where our customers expect them to be, but also in certain cases, carry that inventory for customers. But, I also believe that customers are looking at what they warehouse and don\u2019t warehouse, and that makes them what they warehouse may mean more towards these PPE-related items versus other ones. And that can create some different opportunities for us to work with them. So, I do think the entire supply chain will adjust over the next couple of years, as it relates to inventory. But, the important thing to note is that, as we work with our customers on this, we would -- and suppliers, we would expect to get compensated from both, in order to provide that type of service.\nOperator: Thank you. And, we will take our final question from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.\nBrian Tanquilut: Hey. Good morning, guys. Mike, just a question on the vaccine distribution side. I know you said you\u2019re taking care of small chain pharmacies and the independents. So, is there any sort of sizing that you can put there, or is this like what your clients are thinking in terms of the percentage of overall vaccinations that they will get as a group?\nMike Kaufmann: Yes. At this point in time, as you know, it\u2019s state-by-state. It changes on a weekly basis. So, I don\u2019t really have any good insights on how to help you on that. I would tell you that we continue to be there for our customers. We\u2019re going to continue to help them be ready to do it. It\u2019s not a driver at all for our financial statements one way or the other. So, from a financial driver, it\u2019s not material. But, it\u2019d be really hard for me to even give you anything there because of the choppiness of the amount of vaccines that we\u2019re seeing, state by state.\nOperator: Thank you. That will conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Mike Kaufmann for any additional or closing remarks.\nMike Kaufmann: Yes. I really want to thank everybody for joining us this morning. And on behalf of all of us at Cardinal Health, I hope you and your families are safe and well. And we look forward to speaking to all of you again soon.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s call. We appreciate your participation.",

            "name": "Mike Kaufmann",
            "content": "Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'll start our discussion with a few high level thoughts on our progress so far this year. And then, Jason will review our second quarter results and our updated fiscal \u201821 outlook. I'll close by sharing updates regarding our growth areas. We continue to make progress on our strategic plan as we navigate the rapidly changing global environment. Overall, second quarter operating results came in better than our expectation, led by the Medical segment. In addition, we saw some favorability, including timing below the operating line, enabling us to deliver EPS growth of 14% in the quarter. Due to our solid first half performance and our improved visibility into the remainder of the fiscal year, we are increasing and narrowing our EPS guidance to a range of $5.85 to $6.10 per share. In the second quarter, we saw varying effects of the pandemic on our business. Our Medical segment saw a net positive impact related to COVID-19 as our lab business and PPE products continued to experience strong demand. And in pharma, although the pandemic continued to adversely impact volumes, mainly in generics and nuclear imaging, areas like specialty and consumer health are recovering and performing very well. Across the Company, we remain focused on doing our part to support ongoing pandemic release efforts. In Pharma, we partnered with the CDC to act as a network administrator, enabling retail independent, small chain and long-term care pharmacy customers to participate in the vaccination effort. And in Medical, we partnered with the state of Ohio to support vaccine distribution through our OptiFreight Logistics business. Regarding PPE, we are utilizing our Supply Assurance program to manage costs for our customers and provide consistent long range supply in key product categories. We are seeing improving supply in some of these product categories, such as gowns and masks, but continue to see a challenging market with exam gloves. Looking ahead, we remain committed to supporting our customers, patients, government and communities through the ongoing challenges of the pandemic. And we are ready and willing to help in any way possible. Before I provide some updates on our strategic growth areas, I'll turn it over to Jason to share more details on our second quarter and outlook for the year. Thanks, Jason. I'd now like to take a moment to elaborate on how this unprecedented time has reinforced our critical role in healthcare and how we see this role evolving as we look toward and beyond the second half of the fiscal year. I said last quarter that we aspire to be healthcare's most trusted partner and create the greatest value for our customers, shareholders, communities, and employees. We create this value by efficiently operating resilient business models, deploying capital with discipline and investing for growth, all while prioritizing the health, safety and development of our teams. First, as we've seen throughout the pandemic, we operate resilient business models that can address today's challenges and adapt for the future. For example, as Jason highlighted, our lab business continues to enhance its offerings throughout the pandemic. Through our Cardinal Health brand portfolio and our distribution relationships, we supply instrumentation, reagents and consumables, enabling both, independent and acute laboratories to support the health of patients. We are also enhancing our core Medical and Pharmaceutical distribution and product capabilities, as we continue to adapt these models for the future. We are making strong progress in both segments on our supply chain work streams in generating near and long-term efficiencies. For example, we began work this quarter on a new 1 million square-foot Medical segment replenishment center, near Chicago, that we expect to be operational in the fourth quarter. This facility is the second of its kind in the last year, and is part of our multi-year plan to improve the customer experience, consolidate our network and increase capacity to meet customers' requests for pandemic storage. We are also making strategic investments in our IT infrastructure to enhance our customer experience and digital capabilities. At the same time, we are investing in our differentiated portfolio to drive strategic, long-term growth in key areas and not only support, but also anticipate our customers' needs. Our investments in the areas of specialty, at home, medical services, nuclear and connected care will enable us to capture benefits from favorable industry trends and to develop specialized customer solutions, utilizing our breadth and scale. Recall, I noted at a recent conference that these five businesses represent $25 billion in total revenue, and together, they have a double digit historical three-year revenue CAGR. Let me highlight a few of these areas in greater detail. In medical services, which includes our OptiFreight Logistics and WaveMark businesses, we are investing in technologies to drive continued innovation that will meet the evolving needs of our customers. For example, with our recently announced TotalVue Analytics tool in our OptiFreight business, we are using data to help our customers drive insights and savings in their healthcare supply chain logistics management. And in WaveMark, which as a reminder, is a software-as-a-service platform, optimizing supply chain and clinical workflow processes for acute care, we have seen growth in both, our installations and our pipeline, as we continue to go live with additional customers. WaveMark has also recently initiated partnership opportunities to explore solutions to help lab managers and supply chain leaders manage the increased demand for critical test kits and lab supplies. As our nuclear business continues its recovery related to the pandemic, our team remains focused on long-term plans to further strengthen our leading industry position. We continue to build out our Center for Theranostics Advancements in Indianapolis, and are excited about the pharmaceutical innovators coming on board. From supporting manufacture development of radiopharmaceuticals to commercialization and distribution, we are working together to change the way patient care is delivered. In addition, our recent customer loyalty survey results were excellent, showcasing our differentiated value proposition in the market. Our efforts over the past six years to transform our selling model, strengthen our world class service levels, and launch new products and services are deeply appreciated by our customers. And we are excited about the mid to long-term future of this business. And finally, in Connected Care, we are making additional investments in technology solutions and actionable data tools to take advantage of the double-digit growth we are seeing, and to enable more meaningful, cost effective and outcomes-driven connections between payers, manufacturers, pharmacists and patients. Demand for these solutions continues to increase, with our services currently reaching 60,000 pharmacies, 23 million patients, and 60 payers. We are sending more than 400 million tests annually to support medication management. And in the last quarter, we have designed, developed and implemented tools to help our pharmacy customers administer the COVID-19 vaccine, with more than 2,500 locations already engaged. We will continue to share progress in each of these growth areas, and then our core capability initiatives as they materialize, over the coming year. Before I close, I want to thank the team here at Cardinal Health, who continued to do a tremendous job adapting and responding to the changing needs of our customers as we navigate the pandemic. Finally, I will reiterate that what we do matters to our customers, shareholders, employees and communities. As we move forward, we are using our breadth, scale and expertise to provide products and solutions to create value and improve lives. With that all pause to open up for questions. Yes. Thanks for the question, Michael. I appreciate it. I guess, really couple of things to keep in mind. We're really pleased with the resiliency of our Pharma segment, both in the pharma distribution as well as the specialty and nuclear business. We do continue to see really COVID-19 being the main driver of any headwinds we're seeing there. It's good, so far, that a lot of the things that might affect the segments, such as brand, inflation, that's kind of off the table from what we've seen in January. We feel like we're executing really well on our initiatives. And also, from a cost savings standpoint, we're on track. And then, generics, which is, always one of the -- could be one of the swing factors, we're not seeing anything inconsistent there from what we've seen in prior quarters. So, a lot of those swing factors are really off the table when we look at the rest of the year for Pharma. But, what we really see is, COVID being the main swing factor. The things I would say there is that we saw a lot of choppiness in the quarter. We would expect it to continue to be choppy for the second half of the year. But, we still are expecting to exit at or near pre-COVID levels. And as we said, our guidance continues to be low-single-digit growth for the segment. Thanks. I appreciate the question. Yes. We've been -- continue to be involved in staying up-to-date and everything as it relates to the vaccine. As we've said, we are working with the State of Ohio, helping them distribute the vaccine. And we're also a partner with the CDC acting as a network administrator. And so, we continue to do that. And there are some other areas where we're having some small touch in that area. At the end of the day, I believe that -- our belief is that this is one of the most important events in the country's history, and that bringing the full scale of the distribution capabilities of all the distributors to the market is going to make the most sense over the long term to be able to effectively distribute and get the vaccines to folks. And so, we continue to make sure that we're doing all the things to make our self ready to be able to participate and help out however we can. Yes. The only thing I would add is that while the PPE is clearly a driver, our lab business really was a big driver for us this quarter in the Medical segment. And we continue to be excited about its growth. And its ability to continue to maintain that growth, at least for the remainder of fiscal \u201821 is our current assumption. Yes. Thanks, Lisa. A couple things I would say. I guess, first of all, it's important to know that sequentially, there is really not a lot of difference between what we saw in volumes between Q1 and Q2 for our Pharma business. And also I would say that -- all the impact that we're seeing on volumes in generics is really from our view just related to COVID-19. So, we're not seeing any other dynamics such as buying groups or other challenges like that impacting our generics program. It's really just the volume as it relates to the COVID-19. And as we said that -- we expect that to continue to be choppy. We saw a lot of up and down over the last six months. We would expect that for the second half of the year, but do expect to still get back to at or near pre-COVID levels by the end of the year. As it relates to flu, as you know, this has become less and less of a driver in general, for us. It can be a small driver. And as far as the flu goes, we've hardly seen much at all. So, in terms of -- vaccine distribution has been a little higher, but all of the other type of ancillary products such as the Tamiflus and those types of things, they have been down obviously. But again, it's incredibly tiny driver for us and was not something that is driving any of the concern or any challenges that we might be looking at in Pharma, which again, we just are focused on COVID. Yes. The only thing I would emphasize, just to make sure that it's clear is, as the cost of the PPE comes down, our revenue will come down. But again, our goal has always been to maintain margin dollars and work with our customers on an assurance program. And so, you shouldn't think about declining PPE costs necessarily being a headwind for us, other than revenue. And, as Jason said -- but the timing of when you have the actual sale price and the cost as they flow through that can create a little bit of lumpiness in the recognition. Sure. As far as -- I'll just cover the opioids quickly. As I've said in the past, it continues to be, as you know, complex negotiations, a lot of moving parts, but we're continuing to make progress there. As far as on the Pharma guidance goes or thoughts there, obviously, we can't talk about at this time \u201822. But, you're right on those components. First of all, we would expect, if we exit at or near pre-COVID levels that our nuclear business would continue to improve sequentially, as it goes forward. And we have a lot of confidence in that business. As you know, I highlighted it in my comments around not only how they're performing well in the current situation, but also the investments we've made to be able to see growth in that business over the mid and long-term in the theranostics space. And then, again, as far as generics go, I guess, the main reason that we have seen that our generic volumes are off is because of COVID. And so, rest of the program continues to be -- as we expected, we continue to see that program, all the various components that we have in it are essentially working as we expected, which is COVID being the driver. So, again, as COVID begins to be less and less of an impact, we would expect to see our volumes in our generics programs to grow. Yes. Biosimilars continues to be an area we're also excited about. We are seeing positive contributions from biosimilars. It just doesn't -- it's not at the level to be calling it out as necessarily the driver at this point in time. But it's something that we do continue to participate in. We're very well-positioned to be able to help manufacturers and customers with biosimilars, and we do see that as something that should be a tailwind for us, as we look forward, going forward. Yes. We continue to be very pleased with our at-home business. We're continuing to see growth in overall number of customers that we're serving, the types of product line that we're working with and driving our mix. All of those types of things getting after our cost structure. We are making some large investments in our IT systems that will be going online here. So, a little increased SG&A as we drive to improve our systems there to be able to improve the customer experience, and as we grow, be able to do it more effectively. But, it's a business that we continue to remain very positive on. We believe the trends are continuing to be in our favor in that business. And being one of the leaders in that space I think enables us to invest in various activities and opportunities to continue to grow that business. Yes. And the only thing I would add to that is, as Jason mentioned earlier, remember that because of some of the strong performance we've had in Medical and in the business in the first half, there are some areas in Medical expenses where we are investing in the business as we've talked about from a capital standpoint. I just mentioned the IT business and the at-home, and we're also looking at some other areas. So, we are ramping up some of our expenses that in the area of making investments and growing the business over the mid to short-term. So, we would expect them to be a little higher in the second half. But to our $500 million five-year goal, those are seen as permanent expenses that come out. But, what we're talking about is ramping back up the type of investments based on how we feel strongly about the performance of the business for the full year. I think, a couple things. First of all, the last thing you said is important is that we would intend to be properly compensated for that to make sure as with any investment or working with customers, to make sure that the services that we provide, we're getting compensated for not only from a income statement, but appropriately looking at our balance sheet and the return.

And that can create some different opportunities for us to work with them. So, I do think the entire supply chain will adjust over the next couple of years, as it relates to inventory.

            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. Beginning with total Company results, second quarter ups was $1.74, reflecting a 14% increase, driven by discrete tax items and strong Medical results. Total second quarter revenue increased 5% to $41.5 billion, driven primarily by sales growth from existing customers. Total gross margin was flat at $1.8 billion. SG&A increased 2% to $1.1 billion, due to IT investments. The net result for the quarter was consolidated operating earnings of $628 million, a decrease of 3%, which reflects a modest net negative impact for the enterprise from COVID-19. The Pharma segment was adversely affected by COVID-19 during the quarter, and this was partially offset by a net positive impact in Medical. I'll discuss these segment impacts shortly. Interest and other expense decreased 33% versus the prior year to $34 million, driven primarily by lower interest expense as a result of prior year debt reduction, as well as an increase in the value of our Company's deferred compensation plan investments. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 13%, which reflects the impact of certain discrete items. Now, a quick note on the GAAP tax impact during the quarter. Primarily due to self-insurance loss in our fiscal \u201820 federal tax return, we will carry back and recover previously paid federal taxes at rates that were in effect at that time. And as such, in the quarter, we recorded a net GAAP tax benefit of $420 million associated with the recovery of prior taxes. Additionally, we have recorded a corresponding receivable of approximately $1 billion, which we expect to receive within the next 12 months. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. We generated robust operating cash flow of $1.2 billion, during the quarter. As a reminder, the day of the week, in which the quarter ends, affects point-in-time cash flows. We ended the second quarter with a cash balance at $3.7 billion, and no outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities. We remain focused on taking appropriate action to maintain our investment grade balance sheet. Our next debt maturity is in June 2022 with approximately $1.4 billion coming due. By the end of fiscal \u201822, we intend to reduce long-term debt by that amount, so the exact timing and method may vary as we continue to evaluate the economics associated with early retirement of debt. Now, turning to the segments, beginning with Medical on slide 5. Medical revenue increased 7% in the second quarter to $4.3 billion, driven by a net positive revenue impact from COVID-19 and solid execution by our team. As we have previously discussed, we saw higher selling prices and volumes regarding PPE and higher volumes in our lab business, partially offset by reduced surgical products demand, resulting from deferred and canceled elective procedures. Segment profit increased 21% to $236 million, driven by a net positive impact from COVID-19 and cost savings, which includes global manufacturing efficiencies. The net positive segment profit impact from COVID-19 was primarily due to higher lab volumes as well as increased contributions from PPE that were offset by the previously mentioned elective procedure impacts. As it relates to lab, we continue to experience a tailwind from increased demand for COVID-19 testing products. While difficult to predict, we expect this demand to remain elevated for at least the balance of fiscal \u201821. Regarding PPE, we saw both, higher volumes and timing favorability related to our cost mitigation efforts. As previously mentioned, we have incurred significantly higher procurement costs for select PPE products during the pandemic, and we expect the timing of selling the higher cost products to vary, as we continue to manage our supply assurance program for our customers. On electives, although procedure volumes continue to be choppy and still below prior year levels, second quarter volumes were generally consistent with our first quarter exit rate, down mid-single digits versus our pre-COVID-19 baseline. Finally, as in the first quarter, we continue to see savings resulting from cost containment measures during the pandemic. And outside of COVID-19 impacts, we continue to realize benefits from our efficiency initiatives, like our global manufacturing and supply chain transformation, which we expect will continue to deliver strong savings. Transitioning to the Pharma segment on slide 6. Revenue increased 4% to $37.2 billion, driven by sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution and specialty solutions customers. Pharma segment profit decreased 11% to $413 million. This was driven by COVID-19-related volume declines in our generics program and nuclear business, and was partially offset by a higher contribution from brand sales mix in the quarter. Our specialty solutions business continues to demonstrate resilience, both downstream with providers and upstream with biopharma manufacturers, and again achieved strong overall growth in the quarter. Also, our generics program when excluding the previously mentioned volume impact of COVID-19, continued to see generally consistent market dynamics. Next, on slide 8, I will review the updates to our fiscal \u201821 outlook. Due to our solid first half performance and better visibility into the back half of fiscal \u201821, we are raising and narrowing our EPS guidance range to $5.85 to $6.10 per share, which at the midpoint represents 10% year-over-year EPS growth. This improvement is driven by strong performance in our Medical segments, as well as updates below the operating line. Regarding updates to other corporate assumptions, we now expect interest and other in the range of $165 million to $185 million with the improvement primarily driven by the impact of our deferred compensation plan adjustments. As a reminder, deferred compensation adjustments are fully offsetting corporate SG&A and net neutral to our bottom line. We're lowering our non-GAAP ETR range for the year to 23% to 25%, which reflects our year-to-date effective tax rate of 18% and higher expected effective tax rate in the back half of the fiscal year, due to the timing of discrete items. We also now expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to finish the year in the range of 294 million to 295 million. Regarding the segment outlooks on slide 9. For Medical, due to the previously discussed drivers, we now expect segment profit percentage growth in the low to mid-20s and revenue growth for the year in the range of high-single to low-double digits. Regarding the Pharma segment, we are maintaining our current guidance ranges of mid-single-digit revenue growth and low-single-digit profit growth. To conclude, some comments on our enterprise COVID-19 assumptions for the back half of fiscal year as we begin to lap initial impact to the pandemic in the prior year. We continue to expect the utilization to be choppy and to exit the fiscal year at or near prepandemic levels. And for the enterprise, in fiscal \u201821, we continue to expect the year-over-year net negative impact from COVID-19, though less than originally anticipated, due to improved medical expectations. I'll now turn it back over to Mike. And if I could just add one point, Michael, it's Jason. And your point about nuclear, we did see the headwind year-over-year be a little bit less than what we saw in the first quarter. So, kind of follows -- continuing to follow a little bit of what we're seeing with electives a little bit more than other elements of the underlying volumes. So, not a lot of new news there, but a slight improvement sequentially. Yes. This is Jason. Let me start it off. Yes. Like you said, we're really pleased with our first half performance. Certainly, two good quarters here now, as well as on top of last year's double-digit growth as well, and then still guiding to low to mid-220s for the year, we feel very good about. To the point about the trends first half versus second half, as we stated in the remarks, we did see some Q2 favorability as it relates to our cost mitigation efforts on certain PPE products. So, that's an element that was a component in addition to the volume strength that we saw in lab and the volume strength that we saw in PPE that drove medical to actually have a net tailwind associated with COVID in the quarter. And so, that's just one thing that will continue to vary quarter-to-quarter as we go forward. The other item that we talked about last quarter as well is that we continue to be very aggressive with our cost control over the first half of the year here, a lot of uncertainty in the underlying volumes. And so, we wanted to make certain that we had a lot of flexibility going into the second half of the year. And then, the third point I'd make is just that we do continue to make long-term investments in our business. As we highlighted as the number one capital deployment priority is to invest in our strong pipeline of organic growth opportunities. And so, we always trade off our level of spend in that regard as well. Sure. Yes. Thanks for the question. And let me just kind of step back and talk about PPE in general and try to loop in that piece as well. Certainly, the overall the demand dynamic here obviously continues to be quite strong, and we are seeing certain components get a little bit more in balance between supply and demand. But, certainly, cost remains elevated across all categories. It's probably even more extreme in terms of that supply and demand imbalance remaining in exam gloves. So, we continue to see that demand just far outstripping that supply, which has created some just some supply chain inconsistency, not only -- so now we're dealing with just the timing of supply, but we're also dealing with all the different timing elements of the cost increases and price increases. So, it just becomes a bit of an uncertain combination of different influences that have driven some of these costs increases to be delayed then until later quarters. So, overall, our key objective remains the same to make sure we're mitigating all these cost increases and working with our customers with the Supply Assurance program. But the timing is going to vary, as we said last quarter, and we'll continue to manage that as appropriate. Okay, great. So, in terms of interest, let's start there. Yes, you're right. Consistent with my comments, the deferred comp elements is driving the guidance change. And as I highlighted, that's entirely a flip-flop between interest and other and corporate SG&A. So, there's no net EPS change associated with that. And of course, interest rates, although low, we have a substantial part of our capital structure fixed. So, we just don't see a lot of variation, as it relates to where rates have been. And so, then -- I'm sorry, there were three parts. What was the second part? Okay. So, the share count, we're still within the guidance range of what we had before. It is slightly at the high end, to your point, as you can see. In the first quarter, we didn't do any share repo; we didn't do any in the second quarter as well. But the high end of that share count would imply no repo. The low end of this new range would be modest amount of repo. So, that's what's baked within that assumption. As it relates to the capital deployment, certainly, we haven't changed our priorities. Of course, we work within those priorities. And just to reinforce that, we continue to invest in our business first and foremost as we are really confident with that strong pipeline of organic growth opportunities. And you saw that this quarter with the medical global manufacturing and supply chain work, we're making some great progress there and we want to continue to feed those activities. The other point that I referenced in my commentary is consistent with the second priority was just to maintain our strong investment grade balance sheet. So, I did highlight that we intend to reduce our debt by about $1.4 billion, as it comes due at the end of our fiscal \u201822. And we think that's consistent with that priority. And then, of course, we return the cash to shareholders, primarily through the dividend as our third priority. After that, it is repo and other bolt-on strategic M&A. But, we'll continue to look at that opportunistically, as we get more confidence on variables, such as opioids is certainly one of the elements we look at all the time. And as our confidence increases, we make more progress, understanding what the framing of that looks like. Then, we'll continue to evaluate if we can be more aggressive on any of those other components. But, we continue to balance all those each and every day. Yes. So, let me start, at least with that first part. We're not going to break out explicitly the pricing separately. First of all, it's just really important to highlight that the pricing is meant to cover that cost increase. And so, that's what we're balancing there. We did, however, say in our last guidance update in Q1, that the vast majority of that revenue guidance increase for Medical was due to pricing, which was due to that cost that was increasing. With this update, it's definitely more balanced, more weighted towards volume increases in the lab business, as well as volume increases in PPE, and then, to a lesser extent, any type of price changes. So, it's -- I would just go back to the guidance increase and it gives you a better understanding of what that PPE pricing dynamic is being driven by. Yes. The other thing I'll add is, relative to the nuclear comment, Ricky, as it relates to the revenue and margin balance there, I think, you're on the right point that as we talked, especially in Q4 of last year, when the volumes were declining quickly, nuclear is a high-margin business. It is also a high fixed cost business. So, it creates a very high contribution margins that we saw certainly create a headwind in that fourth quarter. And so, as we anniversary that in this fourth quarter, especially if our guidance is accurate with the -- at or near pre-COVID levels, by the time we exit the fiscal year, then you would expect there to be, for that piece of it, an improvement in earnings relative to revenue as one of the key components that probably needs to be plugged into your model to make that whole thing make sense. Yes. As Mike mentioned earlier, we saw very consistent type of performance in a number of categories, sequentially Q1 to Q2. We talked about the COVID impact. We talked about generics in general, the consistent market dynamics. So, you do need to go back to look at the Q2 of the prior year, where -- that's where the generics program overall was fairly strong. And we talked at that point about not only volume, but some mixed impacts that were going on at that time. So, I think it's very much a comp as well as consistency within quarter to quarter sequentially. Yes. So, within the quarter, we called out two key items. One is this topic, cost savings as well as and the COVID impacts. And they were both the most significant items that are driving our year-over-year performance. So, in terms of the order of magnitude, you should think of that as a large driver of this performance and consistent with that other driver. How we break out our cost savings is that they would by their nature be largely permanent. Anything that's temporary, and only because of COVID or COVID-related matters, we would put into the COVID bucket. So, we do see this as continuous improvement and deepens our DNA, and that we aren't just squeezing out costs temporarily, but truly transformational, foundational elements. It's just within our SG&A expense, within our global manufacturing and our supply chain, and as such, we'd expect it to be permanent."

With that, I will now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Kaufmann: Thanks, Kevin and good morning to everyone joining us. I will begin with a few high level thoughts on our first quarter then have Jason review our results and updated fiscal \u201821 outlook. I will close with an update on strategic actions we are taking to carry our positive momentum forward. Our strong first quarter results were due to great execution on key strategic priorities and additional aggressive cost controls in response to the uncertainties of the pandemic. Regarding COVID-19, we saw continued utilization improvement in the quarter, particularly in elective procedures. These dynamics, along with the disciplined execution I mentioned, contributed to better than expected performance in our medical segment, we saw significant year-over-year growth. And in pharma, we continue to be encouraged by the resilience of our business, which grew in the first quarter despite volume softness related to the pandemic. As a result of the strong start to our fiscal year, we have increased confidence in the full year and we are raising both our EPS guidance range and our medical segment outlook. Overall, we remain focused on serving our customers and their patients as we optimize our core businesses and invest for growth to fulfill our critical role in healthcare now and into the future. With that, I will now turn it over to Jason.\nJason Hollar: Thanks Mike and good morning everyone. I will review our first quarter performance and updated expectations for fiscal \u201821. Beginning with consolidated company results, our first quarter EPS came in at $1.51, growing 19% versus the prior year and exceeding our expectations. Total first quarter revenue increased 5% to $39.1 billion driven primarily by sales growth from existing customers. Total gross margin grew 2% to $1.7 billion. Despite higher revenue, SG&A was flat at $1.1 billion demonstrating our enterprise-wide commitment to disciplined expense management. Total operating earnings grew 7% to $618 million driven primarily by strong medical segment performance. Interest and other expense decreased 52% versus the prior year to $38 million driven by lower interest expense as a result of our ongoing commitment to reduce debt as well as multiple other favorable items such as tax and deferred compensation. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23%, which includes a few small favorable discrete items. Although discrete adjustments may cause our quarterly tax rate to deviate from our guidance range of 24% to 26%, at this time, we still believe this range is appropriate for the full year. Average diluted shares outstanding were $295 million, about 2 million fewer shares than the prior year, reflecting repurchases completed last year. We generated an operating cash flow of $270 million during the quarter. As a reminder, the day of the week in which the quarter ends affects point-in-time cash flows. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $2.7 billion and no outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities. Now, turning to the segments, beginning with medical on Slide 6, medical revenue increased 1% in the first quarter to $4 billion driven by sales growth in our At-Home Solutions business. Segment profit increased 36% to $230 million driven by cost savings, including global manufacturing efficiencies. The following factors contributed to first quarter medical performance above our expectations. First, while elective procedure volumes were still below prior year levels, they ramped up more quickly and unexpected. Given our portfolio\u2019s general orientation around the OR, this volume improvement resulted in increased demand from many of our higher margin offerings, including our custom surgical kits and patient recovery products. Second, our lab business, which has grown consistently over the past few years to product portfolio expansion and favorable market trends, experienced a tailwind from increased demand for COVID-19 testing products. And finally, as Mike mentioned, our team delivered strong expense management in response to uncertainties related to COVID-19. These measures position us to operate in the best in the business for continued growth. As we have previously discussed, we continue to incur significantly higher procurement costs for certain PPE product categories due to global supply challenges during the pandemic. To help mitigate these cost increases, we implemented price increases on select PPE products with the goal of maintaining neutral margin dollars. PPE cost increases and corresponding mitigation efforts did not have a material net impact on our results for the quarter. I will discuss the potential effects of these dynamics on the segment for the full year when I share our updated assumptions. Now, transitioning to the pharma segment on Slide 5, revenue increased 5% to $35.1 billion, driven by sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution and specialty solutions customers. Despite expected COVID-19 related volume declines, segment profit increased 1% to $402 million driven by a higher contribution from brand sales ix. Additionally, the pharma team remained focused on diligent expense management. During the quarter, we saw improving pharmaceutical demand, enabling us to finish generally in line with our COVID-19 expectations for this point in the fiscal year. Our specialty solutions business also demonstrated improvement in the quarter resulting in strong overall growth. Our nuclear business as expected was down year-over-year, but experienced significant volume recovery in the quarter. We have mentioned nuclear then particularly affected by the pandemic due to the mix of higher margin products and the businesses\u2019 higher fixed cost structures. We continue to believe we are well positioned to capture long-term value in the radiopharmaceutical industry. Finally, we are encouraged to see another quarter of consistent market dynamics within our generics program, which excluding the impact of COVID-19, was net tailwind in the quarter. Next on Slide 8, I will move to our updated fiscal \u201821 outlook. As a result of our strong first quarter performance, we are raising our earnings guidance range to $5.65 to $5.95 per share, which at the midpoint represents 6% EPS growth from the prior year. We are reaffirming the guidance ranges for each of our other corporate assumptions. This increased EPS guidance is driven by an improved outlook for our medical segment depicted on Slide 9. Because of our strong execution on cost savings, including increased global manufacturing efficiencies and the lower impact of COVID-19 related volume declines, we now expect low double-digit profit growth in the segment. With one quarter of additional insight, we are updating our segment revenue growth to mid to high single-digits for the full year. To be clear, the increase in our revenue guidance relates to better clarity on the impact of PPE pricing and we expect this increased revenue to be more than offset by the higher cost of procuring PPE products, which will adversely impact our margin rate. Mike will provide more color on our PPE supply assurance efforts for our customers later in his remarks. As it relates to the pharma segments, we are reiterating our assumptions of mid single-digit revenue growth and low single-digit profit growth. With respect to our enterprise COVID-19 assumptions, we are not assuming that the virus triggers another wave of widespread reductions in elective procedures or physician office visits. However, we are closely monitoring virus trends, patient utilization and the health of the global economy, including unemployment trends, all of which currently have varying degrees of uncertainty. At this time, we anticipate the total net impacts from COVID-19 in the second quarter to be relatively consistent to what we experienced in the first quarter. This is primarily due to the improved utilization environment offset by cost absorption on our self-manufactured products and the previously mentioned higher costs of procuring PPE. We continue to expect a lower total COVID-19 impact in the second half of the year and we assume utilization will exit the year at or near pre-pandemic levels. Furthermore, we continue to explore opportunities to mitigate these impacts in our business through cost controls and more permanent improvements to our operational cost structure. Now, I want to mention a notable item included in our GAAP results. Recall that in the first quarter of fiscal \u201820, we increased $5.6 billion pre-tax related to an agreement in principle amongst our leadership group of State Attorneys General to resolve pending and future opioid litigation claims by states, cities and counties. While the definitive terms for settlement continue to be negotiated with better visibility into a potential outcome, we accrued an additional $1 billion pre-tax in the quarter. The estimated total cash component for Cardinal Health would be $6.6 billion, with the majority currently expected to be paid over a period of 18 years. Considering this accrual update in the dynamic global environment, let me remind you of our capital allocation approach, which we are prioritizing in the following manner. First, we are investing in key areas of our business to enable our strong pipeline of organic growth opportunities. Second, we are focused on taking appropriate action to maintain our investment grade balance sheet. And third, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders primarily through our dividends. We believe this prioritization of capital does position us to both maintain flexibility and generate significant value over the long-term. I will now turn it back over to Mike.\nMike Kaufmann: Thanks, Jason. We aspire to be healthcare\u2019s most trusted partner by delivering products and solutions that improve the lives of people everyday. To achieve this mission, we leverage our scale and expertise to excel in our traditional spaces and expand into adjacencies. I will share how we are doing both, while simultaneously addressing the challenges of the ongoing pandemic through targeted investments in pursuit of this mission. First, we are enhancing our IT infrastructure in key areas to increase capabilities, simplify processes, and improve the customer experience. These multiyear initiatives will generate significant benefits in the future, some of which we are beginning to realize. For example, in our pharmaceutical distribution business, our teams are preparing to deploy the next iteration of our technology platform enhancements, creating greater operational efficiencies and better data visibility. Also, initiatives in our corporate functions will harness the potential of AI and machine learning to enable stronger insights both for our business and for our customers. In medical, our work to streamline our global supply chain network and processes continues and we are seeing significant efficiencies. We are also strategically investing to expand in high growth areas to support new technologies and therapies and to drive innovative care delivery. For example, in specialty, we are developing partnerships and making thoughtful investments that combine the technology, scale and expertise of our business with new innovations in cell and gene therapy, biosimilars, and value-based care models. Our 3PL continues its strong growth, with recent launches in traditional markets as well as emerging markets. Also, we recently made an investment in Vineti, the first commercial cloud-based platform to integrate logistics, manufacturing and clinical data for cell and gene therapies. In our at-Home Solutions business as trends and technologies accelerate in the increasingly virtual world of the pandemic, we are focused on optimizing our product portfolio and enhancing the customer experience. We are deepening partnerships with patients, payers and manufacturers to meet their evolving needs and expand our capabilities. We are also investing in our operating systems and digital commercialization capabilities with a pipeline of AI initiatives to lower our cost to serve and provide fully integrated medical and pharmacy billing solutions for our customers. These work streams will make us uniquely positioned to lead in the developing interconnected health and home space. Across the company, we are working diligently to meet our customers\u2019 current needs, while also looking ahead to what they might need in the future. While doing all of this, we remain highly focused on our internal and external responses to the pandemic. In medical, we implemented multiple measures to address ongoing supply challenges for PPE product categories. For example, we established our supply assurance program to provide consistent long range supply for our products, including exam gloves, gowns and mask. The program has been positively received. And this collaboration with our customers will enable us to collectively navigate supply volatility and deliver critical products for patient care. In pharma, we are constantly monitoring evolving treatment patterns, collaborating with the team at Red Oak to ensure supply, and focusing on delivering the industry\u2019s highest service levels. And across the company, we continue to aggressively control our expenses to ensure we deliver on all of our commitments and create long-term value. As I said earlier, we aspire to be healthcare\u2019s most trusted partner and create the greatest value for our customers, shareholders, communities and employees. I want to thank our employees around the globe for their integrity, adaptability and persistent dedication to this mission. We are confronting today\u2019s challenges and developing tomorrow\u2019s solutions with the tenacity, agility and innovation that makes Cardinal Health essential to care. With that, I will pause to open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will begin Q&A with Mike Cherny of Bank of America.\nMike Cherny: Good morning. Congratulations on the good quarter. Yes, I guess on question for Mike or Jason, but I just want to dive in a little bit to the medical performance in the quarter and the strength you saw especially against the backdrop of some of the PPE dynamics. If you can even parse out a little further, was there anything that was more short-term in nature in terms of what you saw on the quarter? And as you think about the risk weighting of the various different tailwinds, headwinds you have tied to the guidance increase, where do you think are the most sources for potential upside downside or what I guess maybe on the downside of the most concerning or most risky in terms of how to achieve the various levels of that cost expectation?\nMike Kaufmann: Yes, thanks for the question. I will start and then I will turn it over to Jason. First of all, I would just emphasize we are really excited about the efforts we are seeing in our medical segment. The team did a really good job this quarter of staying not only focused on driving expenses for the quarter in relation to the uncertainty of the pandemic, but also continuing to get after the longer term expense initiatives we had and working on a lot of the other strategic initiatives we talked about, like our commercial work. So, a lot of really good progress with Steve and his team, but I am going to turn it over to Jason, so he can give you a little bit more of some of the color you would like to hear.\nJason Hollar: Sure. Thanks Mike. Yes. And first of all, we should start with the COVID impacts. And the key point is that within the quarter, there was a relatively minimal impact on the business on a net basis. Of course, there is a lot going on within that. So, there is still a headwind year-over-year as it relates to the lower elective volume. However, that was offset in part by some of those COVID-specific costs that Mike had referenced, but also increased volume in our lab testing business. So, all those items came together in a way that effectively offset one another. Another key point that you referenced and I didn\u2019t reference here is PPE. For the quarter, we saw that the increased cost that we did recognize were mitigated through price increases that also happened in the quarter. So, for the first quarter that all kind of offset. I will come back to that point in a second, but for the rest of the performance within medical for the segment for the quarter, there were also additional cost savings. As Mike indicated, this was led by the ongoing multi-year effort and building healthier future initiative that\u2019s really getting after global manufacturing and supply chain transformation. So, that was very much consistent with our expectations. But as Mike highlighted there are also some additional aggressive cost controls that we put in place due to the uncertainties in the quarter. And we saw some really great flow through of those actions, in terms of delaying some open positions and managing third party spend, that may be a bit more temporary in nature, and is something that will continue to work to see if we can make more permanent. So we have a good balance included within our guidance for all those items. Going back to PPE as it relates to the rest of the year. That is the one area that we do anticipate having higher costs in the second quarter higher net costs in the second quarter versus the first quarter. And that is just due to the timing, we have procured these higher costs, PPE inventory items, but it is in transit, a lot of that that volume is in transit. So we know that we will be incurring those costs. A lot of it\u2019s already on our balance sheet and our inventory. And we will recognize that higher costs in the second and across third and fourth quarter as we sell those items. And of course, we are also raising prices consistent with that. However, there are some timing elements that don\u2019t line up perfectly between the two. So that\u2019s the one element from Q1 to Q2 for the medical business that we would see a bit of additional headwind. Now on the flip side, we would expect that in the pharma business, there is a little bit of a, lesser of a headwind from Q1 to Q2, as that environment is a little bit more normalized, but I would not call that significant.\nMike Cherny: Great, thanks.\nOperator: We will now take a question from Steven Valiquette with Credit Suisse.\nSteven Valiquette: Yes, it\u2019s Steve Valiquette from Barclays. Nothing has changed there. Hey, just want to mention, on the opioid litigation and extra charge that you took, one of your peers also took a charge this morning and they made a note of \u2013 a point of press release that it includes not only the states, but also the counties and municipalities and other government entities as well. So I am just curious with your total charge that you have now, do you \u2013 what percent of your total liability do you think that would cover? Is that pretty comprehensive or would there still be other cases to limit, just share some more color around that? Thanks.\nMike Kaufmann: Sure. Thanks, Steve. I will give you a little bit of color here. Our view has always been that it is a global settlement that takes into account, all of the states as well as the political subdivisions in the state. So that accrual represents our assumption around that what is not in there is any private party plaintiff cases, individual or some other non political subdivision or state. Those are still out there. We intend to defend our self vigorously against those but that accrual takes into account all both the states and the political subdivisions.\nSteven Valiquette: Okay. And also a few questions is found from investors on the run rate of medical profits on a quarterly basis. Obviously, this fiscal first quarter was very strong. Any additional thoughts on kind of quarterly run rates from here might be helpful as well? Thanks.\nJason Hollar: Yes, I don\u2019t think there is too much more to add than what I just went through where, again, from a Q1 to Q2 perspective, we definitely anticipate there being a greater headwind related to the PPE recognition of that cost. But for the other elements, we continue to see relatively consistent types of dynamics there. And then, as I also mentioned and Mike touched on as well, as it relates to the underlying cost controls, we feel really good about our performance in the first quarter. Some of those were absolutely permanent and part of those structural cost reductions that we have been putting in the place for the last several years. But other elements were very specific to the pandemic and really tightly managing our costs and then perhaps and a little bit of a shorter term, we will continue to evaluate those initiatives and see if we can make them more permanent by changing the way in which we do on certain things, which is very consistent with our building healthier future initiatives elsewhere. But we need a little more time to work that through.\nMike Kaufmann: The only other thing I would add is that we did exit the quarter, roughly mid single digits down on electives. And so that was better than our expectation. And as Jason said, we expect to finish the year, near pre COVID level. So a lot of the upward trajectory already has occurred in the first quarter. So you wouldn\u2019t see that sequential is not as big as maybe it was historically, when we were first thinking about this. I think that is one component, also to keep in mind. Next question, please.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Jailendra Singh from Credit Suisse.\nAdamHeussner: Hi, this is Adam on for Jailendra today. In terms of the cost savings, which were partially contributing to the EPS raise, just curious of how much of the improvement there had already been planned versus if you expedited those cost initiatives? Thanks.\nJason Hollar: Yes. So, as I think about the \u2013 let\u2019s just step back and think about the raise for the full year guidance that is entirely due to the medical performance and you saw that we raised the outlook there as well. And so within that, we had two key components, first of all, COVID is being \u2013 is better, less of a headwind than what we had anticipated, although it\u2019s still a headwind for the year and that is the most meaningful impact, but also significant within that not insignificant is the underlying cost reductions that we have been referencing. So, both go into it, but I would say COVID is a little bit more of a benefit there versus the cost savings, but still very meaningful.\nMike Kaufmann: And then I would just add, we have also seen really good performance on our lab business, in the first quarter that we would expect to continue through the rest of the year and so some of our other components of our business performed very strong too.\nJason Hollar: And one other item, maybe just to make sure we referenced is tax rate for the first quarter was a couple of 100 basis points lower than the midpoint and lower than the range that we have. That is just the timing of some discrete items that were all anticipated when we established our guidance range. So we will continue to have some fluctuations there, but that does look like an impact in the first quarter that we would expect to revert more to the mean by the time we get to the end of the year.\nAdamHeussner: Thanks.\nOperator: Now we will move to Kevin Caliendo with UBS.\nAdam Noble: Great. Thanks for the question. This is actually Adam Noble on for Kevin. Just wanted to go back to the lab business, curious if you guys can kind of size how big a business that is within the overall medical segment than you are just curious is that mainly the hospital channel or do you have a significant presence with outpatient labs in other areas of the lab testing to universe?\nMike Kaufmann: Yes, our lab business has been a business that we have had for a really long time. It always has been a consistent grower for us both on the top and bottom line for a lot of years. It\u2019s main customers are basically the outpatient labs and other hospital lab type of businesses. So, those are who we are supplying, we have a very robust product line, some of which is our self-manufactured or sourced items as well as we work with all of the national brand players. And so while it\u2019s always been a business that has performed well and grown nicely for us with the increase in COVID testing, that business has had some additional growth this year. They have also been a real leader in getting reagents out, testing equipment, working with folks on helping on the swap supply early on. So at the business, we are really proud of the team there and continue to feel good about their growth this year. And we actually are evaluating how much of that might continue on going forward as we continue to look at that business going forward, but really strong performance by the lab business.\nAdam Noble: Got it. That\u2019s super helpful. With regards to the medical business overall, I am just curious if you can talk about the recovery in utilization there between the U.S. as well as some of your international footprint then your comments around not expecting to see a real drop in elective procedures, probably most likely in the U.S. in COVID, I am just curious given some of the lockdowns that have recently been implemented in Europe, whether there is any pipe insert there that you can do?\nMike Kaufmann: Yes, it\u2019s a great question. I think the first thing I think we all need to keep in mind is it will probably be very choppy over the next 6 to 12 months, it\u2019s hard to know how long, but I do think it will be choppy. We are even seeing small shutdowns here and there in the U.S. and then obviously potentially in Europe in different spots. As far as our \u2013 the majority of our product is going through our U.S. channels. And as I said, it relates to electives, we exited Q1 down mid single-digits and expect to get at or near pre-COVID levels by the end of the year. And while that\u2019s not a huge sequential growth, we do expect it to be somewhat choppy and it\u2019s hard to exactly predict on a quarterly basis. But we feel good about our current guidance, as it relates again assuming there is no major shutdown, if we had everybody shutting down again like in our Q4 that would create some different types of concerns. But as long as we received spotty types of \u2013 lumpy type of shutdowns, we would expect the \u2013 we can manage through that. As far as in Europe, again, that is just product sales, you don\u2019t do distribution over there and our current guidance does assume and get some choppiness over there and we are not looking for major shutdowns over there either.\nAdam Noble: Great. Thanks for the question.\nMike Kaufmann: Next question.\nOperator: We will now take a question from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.\nLisa Gill: Thanks very much. Good morning, Mike and Jason. Just as we think about the pharmaceutical distribution business, on a go forward basis, Mike, can you talk about maybe what you saw in the quarter around new prescription volume trends and expectations, we understand that people are starting to go back to the physician office, but just looking at IQVIA data, it doesn\u2019t look like trends for new prescriptions are back to what they were historically. So you can talk about what trend you are seeing there. And then secondly, we think about your guidance and think about your pharmaceutical distribution component, can you talk about your expectation for biosimilars in your numbers? Do you have an expectation that that\u2019s going to be a positive for you for this fiscal year and how do we think about potential margin differentials?\nMike Kaufmann: Yes, I will just start with the biosimilars first and then move on to the RX trend. We do continue to see biosimilars gain momentum with increased adoptions across multiple sites of care. And we have been successful working with the suppliers and our customers. In this area, we think we are really well positioned to distribute and provide services both upstream and downstream to the biosimilar players. Generally, biosimilar margins are similar to branded margins. It depends on the individual supplier and the product. There are some opportunities when you are able to move share through your GPOs and stuff to make some potential extra margins on that. But generally, as I said in the past, the real margin opportunity for us in biosimilars over the mid to long-term would be as if they get an interchangeable designation. And then now I think that will increase the opportunities for us to really make what I would say more meaningful contributions to our bottom line. So, while we continue to be very excited about the future potential for biosimilars they have really not at this time reached a level of materiality for us. And then flipping to your other question around RX trends, I think the first comment I would make is the real resilience of the pharma segment in general. This is a business that it seems like whenever we go through large challenges in the U.S., it\u2019s a business that continues to, while it may have some headwinds, continues to be very resilient to the overall marketplace. Now, we also know in our pharma segment that includes our nuclear business, which as Jason mentioned, was coming back nicely in the quarter and tracking well. So, we are glad that we maintain both the people and the resources and commitments there, because we did see that bounce back still below prior levels, but bouncing back nicely. As far as your comment around the IQVIA data, actually I would say that what we are seeing is that our general business tracks pretty closely to it around both new RX generics etcetera. So we are not really seeing any trends within our business that I would call out that are much different than what we are seeing in the overall IQVIA data.\nLisa Gill: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Now, moving to Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is [indiscernible] for Elizabeth. Just a quick question on Cardinal Health at-Home, could you give us a sense for kind of how you see demand trending as you progress through 2021? Thanks.\nMike Kaufmann: Yes, this is a business we continue to be super excited about. As we have said a couple of different times, it\u2019s one of those areas that we have called out as one of our strategic growth areas with both specialty, our services businesses and Cardinal Health at-Home, we are a leader in the space and we intend to stay that going forward. And so we did see very nice revenue trends in that business, we continue to make investments in that business specifically to continue to grow and have a very nice both mid and long-term view of that business. So, we remain excited about the team, our resources, the pipeline of opportunities we are working on feels really good in that business. Next question please.\nOperator: We will now move to our next question and we\u2019ll hear from Eric Percher with Nephron Research.\nEric Percher: Thank you. I want to ask for a little bit more detail on the nuclear business. And I am curious to hear if some of that strength has been in specific areas across cardio or neuro or onco? And has that been a pretty good forward indicator for upticks in volume and maybe getting back to the new scripts you are talking about?\nMike Kaufmann: Yes, it\u2019s a great question. We have seen a little bit of difference between onco coming back faster than cardio. So, we do a lot of work in both those phases in our nuclear business. And really, as we expect it, it has bounced back nicely. But to your point, what we have seen both in nuclear and in our specialty business is that onco has bounced back much faster than other ologies whether it be cardiology, rheumatology, nephrology, but particularly to nuclear, our cardio business has bounced back a little bit slower than oncology.\nEric Percher: And was there cost reduction there that may come back as you get back to full speed?\nMike Kaufmann: Actually, it\u2019s a business that is pretty fixed cost business. And so we did not take any \u2013 we took appropriate cost reductions. But I wouldn\u2019t say we took aggressive cost reductions, because we really believe in that business over the long-term. We think it has a very nice pipeline of projects we are working on with manufacturers for clinical trials the theranostics area we think is a real growth area for us. So we decided essentially as we kind of talked about last quarter, just to hold on to both \u2013 our people, because the rest of our assets, being whether it\u2019s our manufacturing facilities with our cyclotrons or individual pharmacies, which still needed to be staffed. We didn\u2019t make extra aggressive cost reductions there. And so it\u2019s nice to see it bounced back and delivered the type of results that we saw in our Q1.\nEric Percher: Thank you.\nMike Kaufmann: Next question.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yes. Hi, good morning. One question related to specialty, obviously, there was some big news on Biogen yesterday and we are getting questions from investors and how should we think about drugs like that is potential contributors to your business? Should we think about it as flowing through core distribution through specialty? And then also any thoughts about a potential role for Cardinal in distribution of COVID vaccine once it\u2019s available for the general population?\nMike Kaufmann: Yes. As far as the specialty products, I would say this is \u2013 what I really like about our position is we can manage both. We have the capabilities for a manufacturer to choose going through our pharma distribution business. Obviously, we serve one of the largest chains, the largest grocery chain, largest mail order insurer. So we have got a lot of strong customer base as well as a strong presence in the acute space that our pharma distribution business has the reach to be able to match specialty drugs that way and then also with our specialty business, they can go that way. So, that\u2019s something that we feel really good about that. We talk to manufacturers all the time and can work with them in either way. A lot of manufacturers, it depends on who the ultimate customer is and who they are trying to reach on which one they may choose. And sometimes that they will choose both, depending on certain customers will go one way and other ones will go the other. So, it\u2019s hard to specifically talk about any individual drugs. We don\u2019t really like to do that. But in terms of having the capabilities, I am confident that we can do that anywhere, even up until including, if it\u2019s a smaller company that\u2019s launching a drug and need services all the way from soup to nuts. The third-party logistics business we have is from performing incredibly well in our specialty space. So, someone that needs customer service, shipping, billing collections, etcetera we can do that too. As far as the COVID vaccine, as you know, as far as Phase 1 has been, one of our competitors has been chosen to do that in Phase 1. We continue to have daily conversations with the folks in the government around being part of it. We have the absolute capabilities to do it. We have been shipping many different types of vaccines for years. So, we have both ambient and cold chain storage capabilities and shipping capabilities to do that. And my belief at least from what I think is probably best from making sure that the product is available for our customers and the fact that we are going to our customers every day is that down the line, I think it would make the most sense for all the key distributors to be part of the Phase 2 of this when the products become more readily available and we stand ready to do that when that happens.\nRicky Goldwasser: Thank you.\nJason Hollar: Next question?\nOperator: And our last question today will come from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.\nGeorge Hill: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for sneaking me in. And Mike, I apologize if you touched on this already, but as you think about the guidance for the balance of the fiscal year, can you quantify what your guidance implies in the core drugs business I guess as a percent of return to baseline from pre-COVID like I guess the guidance assume that we get 95% back, 98% back, just be interested in any color you could provide around that?\nMike Kaufmann: Specifically, well, I can talk specifically to pharma, we really feel like we are tracking very similar to the IQVIA data and that RX trends, remember our year end being June 30 would be at or near pre-COVID levels by the time we exit the year. And so that\u2019s kind of how we would see it progressing over the next three quarters, again with the caution of being some potential lumpiness as things happen specific to RX\u2019s. Does that answer your question, George? \nGeorge Hill: Yes, it does. And maybe if I could just do a quick follow-up, one of the things that we have also seen from the IQVIA data that flu vaccine volumes have been strong, I guess have you guys participated in that and the kind of the derivative follow-up there, have you seen any change in mix as we think about kind of what is been going on in the drug business over the last 3 to 6 months?\nMike Kaufmann: Yes, it\u2019s an interesting question. It\u2019s flu vaccines have been significantly up this year and we do distribute those and we have distributed significant more blue vaccines this year than we have in historical years. Probably, for the combination of the fact that more people are getting vaccinated as well as practicing distancing, wearing masks, washing hands, etcetera, we would expect much lighter flu season this year than historically, but we are not seeing any big necessary mix changes in our pharma business at this time, but we are keeping an eye on it, because as different physicians get back into work and people start visiting them, we may see a little bit of mix, but right now, nothing I would call out as material. But again, I just keep focused on that where we do expect it to be nonlinear, a little bit lumpy over the rest of the year.\nGeorge Hill: Helpful. Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude your question-and-answer session. I will turn the call back over to Mike Kaufmann for any closing remarks.\nMike Kaufmann: Yes, I want to thank all of you for joining us this morning and then on behalf of all of us at Cardinal Health, I hope you and your family stay safe and well and we look forward to speaking to all of you that sometime soon. Take care.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude your conference for today. We do thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mike Kaufmann",
            "content": "Thanks, Kevin and good morning to everyone joining us. I will begin with a few high level thoughts on our first quarter then have Jason review our results and updated fiscal \u201821 outlook. I will close with an update on strategic actions we are taking to carry our positive momentum forward. Our strong first quarter results were due to great execution on key strategic priorities and additional aggressive cost controls in response to the uncertainties of the pandemic. Regarding COVID-19, we saw continued utilization improvement in the quarter, particularly in elective procedures. These dynamics, along with the disciplined execution I mentioned, contributed to better than expected performance in our medical segment, we saw significant year-over-year growth. And in pharma, we continue to be encouraged by the resilience of our business, which grew in the first quarter despite volume softness related to the pandemic. As a result of the strong start to our fiscal year, we have increased confidence in the full year and we are raising both our EPS guidance range and our medical segment outlook. Overall, we remain focused on serving our customers and their patients as we optimize our core businesses and invest for growth to fulfill our critical role in healthcare now and into the future. With that, I will now turn it over to Jason. Thanks, Jason. We aspire to be healthcare's most trusted partner by delivering products and solutions that improve the lives of people everyday. To achieve this mission, we leverage our scale and expertise to excel in our traditional spaces and expand into adjacencies. I will share how we are doing both, while simultaneously addressing the challenges of the ongoing pandemic through targeted investments in pursuit of this mission. First, we are enhancing our IT infrastructure in key areas to increase capabilities, simplify processes, and improve the customer experience. These multiyear initiatives will generate significant benefits in the future, some of which we are beginning to realize. For example, in our pharmaceutical distribution business, our teams are preparing to deploy the next iteration of our technology platform enhancements, creating greater operational efficiencies and better data visibility. Also, initiatives in our corporate functions will harness the potential of AI and machine learning to enable stronger insights both for our business and for our customers. In medical, our work to streamline our global supply chain network and processes continues and we are seeing significant efficiencies. We are also strategically investing to expand in high growth areas to support new technologies and therapies and to drive innovative care delivery. For example, in specialty, we are developing partnerships and making thoughtful investments that combine the technology, scale and expertise of our business with new innovations in cell and gene therapy, biosimilars, and value-based care models. Our 3PL continues its strong growth, with recent launches in traditional markets as well as emerging markets. Also, we recently made an investment in Vineti, the first commercial cloud-based platform to integrate logistics, manufacturing and clinical data for cell and gene therapies. In our at-Home Solutions business as trends and technologies accelerate in the increasingly virtual world of the pandemic, we are focused on optimizing our product portfolio and enhancing the customer experience. We are deepening partnerships with patients, payers and manufacturers to meet their evolving needs and expand our capabilities. We are also investing in our operating systems and digital commercialization capabilities with a pipeline of AI initiatives to lower our cost to serve and provide fully integrated medical and pharmacy billing solutions for our customers. These work streams will make us uniquely positioned to lead in the developing interconnected health and home space. Across the company, we are working diligently to meet our customers' current needs, while also looking ahead to what they might need in the future. While doing all of this, we remain highly focused on our internal and external responses to the pandemic. In medical, we implemented multiple measures to address ongoing supply challenges for PPE product categories. For example, we established our supply assurance program to provide consistent long range supply for our products, including exam gloves, gowns and mask. The program has been positively received. And this collaboration with our customers will enable us to collectively navigate supply volatility and deliver critical products for patient care. In pharma, we are constantly monitoring evolving treatment patterns, collaborating with the team at Red Oak to ensure supply, and focusing on delivering the industry's highest service levels. And across the company, we continue to aggressively control our expenses to ensure we deliver on all of our commitments and create long-term value. As I said earlier, we aspire to be healthcare's most trusted partner and create the greatest value for our customers, shareholders, communities and employees. I want to thank our employees around the globe for their integrity, adaptability and persistent dedication to this mission. We are confronting today's challenges and developing tomorrow's solutions with the tenacity, agility and innovation that makes Cardinal Health essential to care. With that, I will pause to open it up for questions. Yes, thanks for the question. I will start and then I will turn it over to Jason. First of all, I would just emphasize we are really excited about the efforts we are seeing in our medical segment. The team did a really good job this quarter of staying not only focused on driving expenses for the quarter in relation to the uncertainty of the pandemic, but also continuing to get after the longer term expense initiatives we had and working on a lot of the other strategic initiatives we talked about, like our commercial work. So, a lot of really good progress with Steve and his team, but I am going to turn it over to Jason, so he can give you a little bit more of some of the color you would like to hear. Sure. Thanks, Steve. I will give you a little bit of color here. Our view has always been that it is a global settlement that takes into account, all of the states as well as the political subdivisions in the state. So that accrual represents our assumption around that what is not in there is any private party plaintiff cases, individual or some other non political subdivision or state. Those are still out there. We intend to defend our self vigorously against those but that accrual takes into account all both the states and the political subdivisions. The only other thing I would add is that we did exit the quarter, roughly mid single digits down on electives. And so that was better than our expectation. And as Jason said, we expect to finish the year, near pre COVID level. So a lot of the upward trajectory already has occurred in the first quarter. So you wouldn't see that sequential is not as big as maybe it was historically, when we were first thinking about this. I think that is one component, also to keep in mind. Next question, please. And then I would just add, we have also seen really good performance on our lab business, in the first quarter that we would expect to continue through the rest of the year and so some of our other components of our business performed very strong too. Yes, our lab business has been a business that we have had for a really long time. It always has been a consistent grower for us both on the top and bottom line for a lot of years. It's main customers are basically the outpatient labs and other hospital lab type of businesses. So, those are who we are supplying, we have a very robust product line, some of which is our self-manufactured or sourced items as well as we work with all of the national brand players. And so while it's always been a business that has performed well and grown nicely for us with the increase in COVID testing, that business has had some additional growth this year. They have also been a real leader in getting reagents out, testing equipment, working with folks on helping on the swap supply early on. So at the business, we are really proud of the team there and continue to feel good about their growth this year. And we actually are evaluating how much of that might continue on going forward as we continue to look at that business going forward, but really strong performance by the lab business. Yes, it's a great question. I think the first thing I think we all need to keep in mind is it will probably be very choppy over the next 6 to 12 months, it's hard to know how long, but I do think it will be choppy. We are even seeing small shutdowns here and there in the U.S. and then obviously potentially in Europe in different spots. As far as our \u2013 the majority of our product is going through our U.S. channels. And as I said, it relates to electives, we exited Q1 down mid single-digits and expect to get at or near pre-COVID levels by the end of the year. And while that's not a huge sequential growth, we do expect it to be somewhat choppy and it's hard to exactly predict on a quarterly basis. But we feel good about our current guidance, as it relates again assuming there is no major shutdown, if we had everybody shutting down again like in our Q4 that would create some different types of concerns. But as long as we received spotty types of \u2013 lumpy type of shutdowns, we would expect the \u2013 we can manage through that. As far as in Europe, again, that is just product sales, you don't do distribution over there and our current guidance does assume and get some choppiness over there and we are not looking for major shutdowns over there either. Next question. Yes, I will just start with the biosimilars first and then move on to the RX trend. We do continue to see biosimilars gain momentum with increased adoptions across multiple sites of care. And we have been successful working with the suppliers and our customers. In this area, we think we are really well positioned to distribute and provide services both upstream and downstream to the biosimilar players. Generally, biosimilar margins are similar to branded margins. It depends on the individual supplier and the product. There are some opportunities when you are able to move share through your GPOs and stuff to make some potential extra margins on that. But generally, as I said in the past, the real margin opportunity for us in biosimilars over the mid to long-term would be as if they get an interchangeable designation. And then now I think that will increase the opportunities for us to really make what I would say more meaningful contributions to our bottom line. So, while we continue to be very excited about the future potential for biosimilars they have really not at this time reached a level of materiality for us. And then flipping to your other question around RX trends, I think the first comment I would make is the real resilience of the pharma segment in general. This is a business that it seems like whenever we go through large challenges in the U.S., it's a business that continues to, while it may have some headwinds, continues to be very resilient to the overall marketplace. Now, we also know in our pharma segment that includes our nuclear business, which as Jason mentioned, was coming back nicely in the quarter and tracking well. So, we are glad that we maintain both the people and the resources and commitments there, because we did see that bounce back still below prior levels, but bouncing back nicely. As far as your comment around the IQVIA data, actually I would say that what we are seeing is that our general business tracks pretty closely to it around both new RX generics etcetera. So we are not really seeing any trends within our business that I would call out that are much different than what we are seeing in the overall IQVIA data.

As we have said a couple of different times, it's one of those areas that we have called out as one of our strategic growth areas with both specialty, our services businesses and Cardinal Health at-Home, we are a leader in the space and we intend to stay that going forward. And so we did see very nice revenue trends in that business, we continue to make investments in that business specifically to continue to grow and have a very nice both mid and long-term view of that business. So, we remain excited about the team, our resources, the pipeline of opportunities we are working on feels really good in that business. Next question please. Yes, it's a great question. We have seen a little bit of difference between onco coming back faster than cardio. So, we do a lot of work in both those phases in our nuclear business. And really, as we expect it, it has bounced back nicely. But to your point, what we have seen both in nuclear and in our specialty business is that onco has bounced back much faster than other ologies whether it be cardiology, rheumatology, nephrology, but particularly to nuclear, our cardio business has bounced back a little bit slower than oncology. Actually, it's a business that is pretty fixed cost business. And so we did not take any \u2013 we took appropriate cost reductions. But I wouldn't say we took aggressive cost reductions, because we really believe in that business over the long-term. We think it has a very nice pipeline of projects we are working on with manufacturers for clinical trials the theranostics area we think is a real growth area for us. So we decided essentially as we kind of talked about last quarter, just to hold on to both \u2013 our people, because the rest of our assets, being whether it's our manufacturing facilities with our cyclotrons or individual pharmacies, which still needed to be staffed.

Specifically, well, I can talk specifically to pharma, we really feel like we are tracking very similar to the IQVIA data and that RX trends, remember our year end being June 30 would be at or near pre-COVID levels by the time we exit the year. And so that's kind of how we would see it progressing over the next three quarters, again with the caution of being some potential lumpiness as things happen specific to RX's. Does that answer your question, George? Yes, it's an interesting question. It's flu vaccines have been significantly up this year and we do distribute those and we have distributed significant more blue vaccines this year than we have in historical years. Probably, for the combination of the fact that more people are getting vaccinated as well as practicing distancing, wearing masks, washing hands, etcetera, we would expect much lighter flu season this year than historically, but we are not seeing any big necessary mix changes in our pharma business at this time, but we are keeping an eye on it, because as different physicians get back into work and people start visiting them, we may see a little bit of mix, but right now, nothing I would call out as material. But again, I just keep focused on that where we do expect it to be nonlinear, a little bit lumpy over the rest of the year. Yes, I want to thank all of you for joining us this morning and then on behalf of all of us at Cardinal Health, I hope you and your family stay safe and well and we look forward to speaking to all of you that sometime soon. Take care."

            "content": "Thanks Mike and good morning everyone. I will review our first quarter performance and updated expectations for fiscal \u201821. Beginning with consolidated company results, our first quarter EPS came in at $1.51, growing 19% versus the prior year and exceeding our expectations. Total first quarter revenue increased 5% to $39.1 billion driven primarily by sales growth from existing customers. Total gross margin grew 2% to $1.7 billion. Despite higher revenue, SG&A was flat at $1.1 billion demonstrating our enterprise-wide commitment to disciplined expense management. Total operating earnings grew 7% to $618 million driven primarily by strong medical segment performance. Interest and other expense decreased 52% versus the prior year to $38 million driven by lower interest expense as a result of our ongoing commitment to reduce debt as well as multiple other favorable items such as tax and deferred compensation. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23%, which includes a few small favorable discrete items. Although discrete adjustments may cause our quarterly tax rate to deviate from our guidance range of 24% to 26%, at this time, we still believe this range is appropriate for the full year. Average diluted shares outstanding were $295 million, about 2 million fewer shares than the prior year, reflecting repurchases completed last year. We generated an operating cash flow of $270 million during the quarter. As a reminder, the day of the week in which the quarter ends affects point-in-time cash flows. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $2.7 billion and no outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities. Now, turning to the segments, beginning with medical on Slide 6, medical revenue increased 1% in the first quarter to $4 billion driven by sales growth in our At-Home Solutions business. Segment profit increased 36% to $230 million driven by cost savings, including global manufacturing efficiencies. The following factors contributed to first quarter medical performance above our expectations. First, while elective procedure volumes were still below prior year levels, they ramped up more quickly and unexpected. Given our portfolio's general orientation around the OR, this volume improvement resulted in increased demand from many of our higher margin offerings, including our custom surgical kits and patient recovery products. Second, our lab business, which has grown consistently over the past few years to product portfolio expansion and favorable market trends, experienced a tailwind from increased demand for COVID-19 testing products. And finally, as Mike mentioned, our team delivered strong expense management in response to uncertainties related to COVID-19. These measures position us to operate in the best in the business for continued growth. As we have previously discussed, we continue to incur significantly higher procurement costs for certain PPE product categories due to global supply challenges during the pandemic. To help mitigate these cost increases, we implemented price increases on select PPE products with the goal of maintaining neutral margin dollars. PPE cost increases and corresponding mitigation efforts did not have a material net impact on our results for the quarter. I will discuss the potential effects of these dynamics on the segment for the full year when I share our updated assumptions. Now, transitioning to the pharma segment on Slide 5, revenue increased 5% to $35.1 billion, driven by sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution and specialty solutions customers. Despite expected COVID-19 related volume declines, segment profit increased 1% to $402 million driven by a higher contribution from brand sales ix. Additionally, the pharma team remained focused on diligent expense management. During the quarter, we saw improving pharmaceutical demand, enabling us to finish generally in line with our COVID-19 expectations for this point in the fiscal year. Our specialty solutions business also demonstrated improvement in the quarter resulting in strong overall growth. Our nuclear business as expected was down year-over-year, but experienced significant volume recovery in the quarter. We have mentioned nuclear then particularly affected by the pandemic due to the mix of higher margin products and the businesses' higher fixed cost structures. We continue to believe we are well positioned to capture long-term value in the radiopharmaceutical industry. Finally, we are encouraged to see another quarter of consistent market dynamics within our generics program, which excluding the impact of COVID-19, was net tailwind in the quarter. Next on Slide 8, I will move to our updated fiscal \u201821 outlook. As a result of our strong first quarter performance, we are raising our earnings guidance range to $5.65 to $5.95 per share, which at the midpoint represents 6% EPS growth from the prior year. We are reaffirming the guidance ranges for each of our other corporate assumptions. This increased EPS guidance is driven by an improved outlook for our medical segment depicted on Slide 9. Because of our strong execution on cost savings, including increased global manufacturing efficiencies and the lower impact of COVID-19 related volume declines, we now expect low double-digit profit growth in the segment. With one quarter of additional insight, we are updating our segment revenue growth to mid to high single-digits for the full year. To be clear, the increase in our revenue guidance relates to better clarity on the impact of PPE pricing and we expect this increased revenue to be more than offset by the higher cost of procuring PPE products, which will adversely impact our margin rate. Mike will provide more color on our PPE supply assurance efforts for our customers later in his remarks. As it relates to the pharma segments, we are reiterating our assumptions of mid single-digit revenue growth and low single-digit profit growth. With respect to our enterprise COVID-19 assumptions, we are not assuming that the virus triggers another wave of widespread reductions in elective procedures or physician office visits. However, we are closely monitoring virus trends, patient utilization and the health of the global economy, including unemployment trends, all of which currently have varying degrees of uncertainty. At this time, we anticipate the total net impacts from COVID-19 in the second quarter to be relatively consistent to what we experienced in the first quarter. This is primarily due to the improved utilization environment offset by cost absorption on our self-manufactured products and the previously mentioned higher costs of procuring PPE. We continue to expect a lower total COVID-19 impact in the second half of the year and we assume utilization will exit the year at or near pre-pandemic levels. Furthermore, we continue to explore opportunities to mitigate these impacts in our business through cost controls and more permanent improvements to our operational cost structure. Now, I want to mention a notable item included in our GAAP results. Recall that in the first quarter of fiscal \u201820, we increased $5.6 billion pre-tax related to an agreement in principle amongst our leadership group of State Attorneys General to resolve pending and future opioid litigation claims by states, cities and counties. While the definitive terms for settlement continue to be negotiated with better visibility into a potential outcome, we accrued an additional $1 billion pre-tax in the quarter. The estimated total cash component for Cardinal Health would be $6.6 billion, with the majority currently expected to be paid over a period of 18 years. Considering this accrual update in the dynamic global environment, let me remind you of our capital allocation approach, which we are prioritizing in the following manner. First, we are investing in key areas of our business to enable our strong pipeline of organic growth opportunities. Second, we are focused on taking appropriate action to maintain our investment grade balance sheet. And third, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders primarily through our dividends. We believe this prioritization of capital does position us to both maintain flexibility and generate significant value over the long-term. I will now turn it back over to Mike. Sure. Thanks Mike. Yes. And first of all, we should start with the COVID impacts. And the key point is that within the quarter, there was a relatively minimal impact on the business on a net basis. Of course, there is a lot going on within that. So, there is still a headwind year-over-year as it relates to the lower elective volume. However, that was offset in part by some of those COVID-specific costs that Mike had referenced, but also increased volume in our lab testing business. So, all those items came together in a way that effectively offset one another. Another key point that you referenced and I didn't reference here is PPE. For the quarter, we saw that the increased cost that we did recognize were mitigated through price increases that also happened in the quarter. So, for the first quarter that all kind of offset. I will come back to that point in a second, but for the rest of the performance within medical for the segment for the quarter, there were also additional cost savings. As Mike indicated, this was led by the ongoing multi-year effort and building healthier future initiative that's really getting after global manufacturing and supply chain transformation. So, that was very much consistent with our expectations. But as Mike highlighted there are also some additional aggressive cost controls that we put in place due to the uncertainties in the quarter. And we saw some really great flow through of those actions, in terms of delaying some open positions and managing third party spend, that may be a bit more temporary in nature, and is something that will continue to work to see if we can make more permanent. So we have a good balance included within our guidance for all those items. Going back to PPE as it relates to the rest of the year. That is the one area that we do anticipate having higher costs in the second quarter higher net costs in the second quarter versus the first quarter. And that is just due to the timing, we have procured these higher costs, PPE inventory items, but it is in transit, a lot of that that volume is in transit. So we know that we will be incurring those costs. A lot of it's already on our balance sheet and our inventory. And we will recognize that higher costs in the second and across third and fourth quarter as we sell those items. And of course, we are also raising prices consistent with that. However, there are some timing elements that don't line up perfectly between the two. So that's the one element from Q1 to Q2 for the medical business that we would see a bit of additional headwind. Now on the flip side, we would expect that in the pharma business, there is a little bit of a, lesser of a headwind from Q1 to Q2, as that environment is a little bit more normalized, but I would not call that significant. Yes, I don't think there is too much more to add than what I just went through where, again, from a Q1 to Q2 perspective, we definitely anticipate there being a greater headwind related to the PPE recognition of that cost. But for the other elements, we continue to see relatively consistent types of dynamics there. And then, as I also mentioned and Mike touched on as well, as it relates to the underlying cost controls, we feel really good about our performance in the first quarter. Some of those were absolutely permanent and part of those structural cost reductions that we have been putting in the place for the last several years. But other elements were very specific to the pandemic and really tightly managing our costs and then perhaps and a little bit of a shorter term, we will continue to evaluate those initiatives and see if we can make them more permanent by changing the way in which we do on certain things, which is very consistent with our building healthier future initiatives elsewhere. But we need a little more time to work that through. Yes. So, as I think about the \u2013 let's just step back and think about the raise for the full year guidance that is entirely due to the medical performance and you saw that we raised the outlook there as well. And so within that, we had two key components, first of all, COVID is being \u2013 is better, less of a headwind than what we had anticipated, although it's still a headwind for the year and that is the most meaningful impact, but also significant within that not insignificant is the underlying cost reductions that we have been referencing. So, both go into it, but I would say COVID is a little bit more of a benefit there versus the cost savings, but still very meaningful. And one other item, maybe just to make sure we referenced is tax rate for the first quarter was a couple of 100 basis points lower than the midpoint and lower than the range that we have. That is just the timing of some discrete items that were all anticipated when we established our guidance range. So we will continue to have some fluctuations there, but that does look like an impact in the first quarter that we would expect to revert more to the mean by the time we get to the end of the year. Next question?"

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Moran, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nKevin Moran: Good morning, and welcome. Today, we will discuss Cardinal Health's Quarter and year-end fiscal 2022 results along with our outlook for fiscal year 2023. You can find today's press release and earnings presentation on the IR section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com.  Joining me today are Mike Kauffmann, Chief Executive Officer; Jason Hollar, Chief Financial Officer; and Chief Accounting Officer. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in the statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statement slide at the beginning of our presentation for a full description of these risks and uncertainties.  Please note that during our discussion today, our comments will be on a non-GAAP basis unless they are specifically called out as GAAP. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for all relevant periods can be found in schedules attached to our press release. During the Q&A portion of today's call, we kindly ask that you please limit yourself to one question so that we can try and give everyone an opportunity.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to Mike.\nMichael Kaufmann: Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. As I am sure many of you have seen, a short time ago, we issued a press release, announcing that I am stepping down as CEO and as a Board member of Cardinal Health, but will continue to serve through August 31. Effective September 1, Jason will become Cardinal's new CEO. He has also been appointed as a board member effective today. They say timing is everything, and I believe as we start a new fiscal year, the time is right for me to step away as CEO and open the door for a new leader to take Cardinal Health forward over the coming years. I have been blessed to be part of the Cardinal Health family for 32 years. In that time, I've seen our company grow and evolve in many ways. We are truly essential to care, and I'm honored to have been part of it. Jason has been a tremendous partner over the past 2-plus years, and has been instrumental in many of our strategic initiatives. He deeply understands our business, priorities and industry landscape. And the board and I are confident that he is the right person for the job.  With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jason.\nJason Hollar: Thanks, Mike. I really appreciate the kind words and the opportunity to work closely with you these past few years. Let me start by saying how excited I am to be taking on this new responsibility. I am grateful for the trust and the confidence the Board of Directors is placing me. I would also like to thank you, Mike, for the leadership and the many contributions to the company over the years. I hope to preserve the culture that you've helped ingrain into the fabric of our organization, and I look forward to what I know will be a smooth transition. I also want to welcome Trish English, who will be serving as our Interim Chief Financial Officer. Trish most recently served as our Chief Accounting Officer and has been a valuable member of the Cardinal Health family for over 16 years. I look forward to continuing to work with her in this new capacity while we conduct an external search for a permanent CFO.  Before stepping into the details of our financial performance for the quarter, let me step back and summarize the key points this past year. Within our Pharma segment, while we experienced the effects of industry-wide inflation and incurred incremental technology investments. We grew the business 5%, consistent with both our original guidance for the year as well as our long-term growth targets. The Medical business was more significantly impacted by these inflationary dynamics, which drove a significant impact on our results. However, we have strong mitigation actions in place, including pricing and will present a plan to you today that mitigates all of the inflationary and global supply chain constraint impacts plus an additional 8% of compounded annual growth by fiscal '25.  Underlying these operating results this past year was a significant focus on cash flow, which results in increased financial flexibility. We are absolutely focused on shareholder value and intend to deploy these incremental funds to additional share repurchases for fiscal '23. While we remain in a dynamic environment, I'm excited to share further details of our plans with you today, and commit to continue to provide increased [indiscernible] drivers and the key metrics underlying our performance. So let's now turn to some of the details driving our results in the fourth quarter, beginning with the Pharma segment on Slide 6. Fourth quarter revenue increased 13% to $43 billion, driven by branded pharmaceutical sales growth from existing and net new PD and specialty customers. Segment profit increased 26% to $451 million driven by generics program performance and a higher contribution from brand sales mix, partially offset by inflationary supply chain costs.  As we've previously noted, this also reflects a favorable comparison due to the prior year inventory adjustments. During the quarter, our generics program, including Red Oak, saw strong performance and continued to experience consistent market dynamics. Regarding the inflationary supply chain costs, we saw impacts in areas that expectation and labor, which we expect to continue into next year. We also incurred higher cost supporting sales growth. And with ongoing progress in opioid litigation matters, we saw a decrease of approximately $15 million in opioid-related legal costs.  Turning to Medical on Slide 7. Fourth quarter revenue decreased 11% to $3.8 billion due to the divestiture of the Cordis business and lower products and distribution volumes. Medical segment loss of $16 million in the fourth quarter was due to net inflationary impacts on global supply chain constraints and products and distribution. On a year-over-year basis, the favorable comparison to the prior year of $197 million PPE inventory reserve was mostly offset by the net inflationary and global supply chain constraint impacts, a lower contribution from PPE and the Cordis divestiture.  During the quarter, our products and distribution business saw an approximate $100 million impact from net incremental inflation and supply chain constraints. This reflects a gross impact of approximately $125 million and approximate $25 million offset from our mitigation actions, which includes our initial wave of price increases on 5 Cardinal Health brand categories that went into effect back in March. I'll elaborate on our plans for further mitigation in fiscal '23 and beyond shortly.  As mentioned, it continues to be a highly dynamic medical environment, and our Q4 results came in lower than we had previously expected. This primarily reflects overall volume softness in our products and distribution business, including a lower contribution from PPE. Stepping back, Demand for PPE has fluctuated significantly over the past couple of years. We saw lower volumes as we exited Q3 and the fourth quarter experienced further declines. We believe this primarily reflects customers' higher inventory levels and to a lesser extent, some PPE category-specific customer losses driven by supply constraints during the pandemic. We continue to have strong conviction in our overall value proposition, which includes leading brands and clinically differentiated products. For context, PPE represents approximately 15% of sales in our overall Cardinal Health brand portfolio, as you'll see on Slide 20.  Moving below line. Interest and other increased by $36 million to $64 million due to a decrease in the value of our deferred compensation plan investments compared to gains in the prior year. As [indiscernible] deferred compensation gains or losses reported in interest and other are fully offsetting corporate SG&A and net neutral to our bottom line. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, a onetime write-down of an equity investment impacted EPS by $0.06 per share. The increase in other expense was partially offset by lower interest due to debt reduction actions. As indicated, we repaid the $280 million of remaining June 2022 notes at maturity. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate finished at 25.4%, approximately 3 percentage points higher than the prior year. The net result was fourth quarter EPS of $1.05, an increase of 36%, primarily reflecting the growth in pharma segment profit.  Now transitioning to our consolidated results for the year. Fiscal '22 revenues increased 12% to $181 million, driven by the Pharma segment. Gross margin decreased 3% to due to the Cordis divestiture. Total company SG&A increased 1%, reflecting inflationary supply chain costs, our previously mentioned IT investments and higher costs to support sales growth, mostly offset by the Cordis divestiture and benefits from cost savings initiatives.  Operating earnings decreased 12%, which primarily reflects a year-over-year headwind of approximately $300 million related to net inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints in medical, partially offset by Pharma segment profit growth. Interest and other increased 24% to $165 million, largely due to the items affecting the fourth quarter. Of note, this came in higher than our guidance primarily due to equity investment write-down in the quarter. Our annual effective tax rate finished at 22.1%. The net result was fiscal '22 EPS of $5.06.  Now turning to the balance sheet. In fiscal '22, we generated robust operating cash flow of $3.1 billion. This includes the previously defined tax refund of nearly $1 billion and favorable timing of working capital. Additionally, in fiscal '22, we made approximately $500 million in litigation payments, primarily related to opioid settlements. In July, we made our second annual payment under the national opioid settlement agreement of approximately $375 million, which will be reflected in Q1 fiscal '23 operating cash flow. We are focused on deploying capital in a balanced, disciplined and shareholder-friendly manner. This year, we invested approximately $385 million of CapEx back into the business to drive future growth, paid down approximately $850 million in debt to reduce leverage and returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.  We ended the year with a cash position of $4.7 billion, which does reflect some timing favorability with no outstanding borrowings on our credit facilities. As for the segment's full year results, beginning with Pharma on Slide 10. Pharma revenue increased 14% to $165 billion, reflecting consistent drivers with the fourth quarter. Pharma segment profit increased 5% to $1.8 billion, driven primarily by generics program performance and an improvement in volumes compared to the prior year. This was partially offset by investments in technology enhancements and inflationary supply chain costs. To be helpful, the tailwind from improved volumes and the headwind from incremental IT investments effectively offset in fiscal '22, each approximately $80 million on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, we saw an approximate $50 million headwind from inflationary supply chain costs, primarily in the second half of the year.  Moving to Medical on Slide 11. Fiscal 22 medical revenue decreased 5% to , primarily due to the divestiture of the Cordis business. To a lesser extent, lower products and distribution volumes were partially offset by growth in at-home solutions. Segment profit decreased 63% to $216 million, primarily due to the net inflationary impacts in global supply chain constraints in products and distribution. Additionally, the favorable comparison to the prior year PPE inventory reserve was offset by a lower contribution from PPE and the divestiture of the Cordis business.  Now for our fiscal '23 guidance. On Slide 13, we expect earnings per share in the range of $5.05 to $5.40, which reflects the following assumptions: First, for the enterprise, we expect interest and other between $140 million to $170 million, which assumes approximately $550 million in debt paydown for the March 2023 notes at or before maturity. We are assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate in the range of 23% to 25%. We anticipate diluted weighted average shares outstanding between $262 million and $266 million, reflecting our plan to complete between $1.5 billion to $2 billion in share repurchases over the course of the year. And supporting our capital allocation priorities, we expect to adjust free cash flow in the range of $1.5 billion to $2 billion, which excludes litigation payments and any other significant and unusual or nonrecurring items.  As for the segments, beginning with Pharma on Slide 14, we expect revenue growth in the range of 10% to 14%, driven by growth in existing and net new PD and specialty customers. We expect segment profit growth in the range of 2% to 5% based on the following key assumptions. We expect continued stability in overall pharmaceutical volumes along with consistent market dynamics within our generics program. Continuation of the inflationary supply chain costs we've seen in the last 2 quarters should result in approximate $50 million headwind primarily in the first half of the year. The completion of ERP technology enhancements should be an approximate $30 million tailwind. We expect opioid-related legal costs, including initial costs for implementation of the settlements in adjunctive relief terms of approximately $80 million in fiscal '23, a $20 million tailwind. And we see increased contributions from our growth areas, primarily specialty, including biosimilars.  Before moving to Medical, a couple of points from the Pharma fiscal '23 . Similar to last year, we expect the year-over-year segment profit growth to be significantly back-half weighted, which primarily reflects the year-over-year impact of inflationary supply chain costs in the first half. Specifically, in the first quarter of next year, we expect segment profit between $400 million and $420 million. While we do not typically provide quarterly guidance, we thought additional color may be helpful given the puts and takes over the last several quarters.  Now turning to Medical on Slide 15. We expect revenue to decline in the range of 3% to 6% due to lower PPE sales and lab testing volumes. We expect segment profit ranging from a decline of 10% to growth of 10%, reflecting the following assumptions. We expect a similar net impact of approximately $300 million from inflation, global supply chain constraints and mitigation actions in fiscal '23 or a minimal impact on a year-over-year basis. This assumes an approximate $475 million gross impact from inflation and global supply chain constraints, partially offset by $175 million of mitigation actions, including pricing and evolving our commercial contracting.  While still significantly elevated relative to historical levels, we're encouraged by the recent improvements in spot rates of certain cost drivers such as international freight and some commodities. As a reminder, these product costs are capitalized and have historically been reflected in our P&L results on a 1 to 2 quarter delay. However, in the current period of elongated supply chains, it is closer to 2 quarters. Our current assumption is that the impact of inflation in global supply chain constraints will peak in the first quarter of fiscal '23 and gradually decrease over the next couple of years. Additionally, along with the pricing actions that went into effect at the start of the year, we are implementing additional ways of increases over the course of fiscal '23. We continue to expect that as we exit fiscal '23, the run rate of our mitigation actions will offset at least 50% of the gross impact from inflation and global supply chain constraints.  In terms of other key assumptions for medical and fiscal '23. As the operating environment continues to normalize, we expect an approximate $50 million tailwind from an improvement in PPE margins. We plan to sell through the majority of higher-cost PPE in the first half of the year and for PPE margins to normalize as we exit the year. We expect the PPE tailwind to be offset by a similar headwind from lower lab testing volumes. We also anticipate a headwind of approximately $50 million from re-baseline incentive compensation following fiscal '22 underperformance. And finally, we expect increased contributions from our strategic growth areas, primarily at Home Solutions.  On Medical's quarterly cadence, while we are assuming a similar segment profit total in fiscal '23 versus fiscal '22, we do expect the cadence to be the reverse of the prior year. Specifically, in the first quarter, we expect segment profit ranging from a loss of $20 million to profit of $20 million. We expect the gross impact of inflation and global supply chain constraints in the first quarter to be approximately $150 million, approximately 25% of this offset through our mitigation actions. As for the rest of the year, we expect the substantial majority of segment profit to come in the second half of fiscal '23, particularly in the fourth quarter. This sequencing primarily reflects our assumptions around inflation, global supply chain constraints, inflation mitigation and PPE. While there are many moving parts in fiscal '23, we are confident in our long-term outlook and our reiterating our previously announced long-term targets for our businesses and for double-digit combined EPS growth and dividend yield over longer normalized periods. Additionally, we are introducing a new target for at least $650 million in Medical segment profit by fiscal '25, driven by the medical improvement plan that we are introducing today.  Slide 17 highlights our 4 areas of focus to improve medical performance. Number one, mitigate inflation and global supply chain constraints. We plan to fully address the impact of inflation and global supply chain constraints through mitigation initiatives by the time we exit fiscal '24 and are targeting to exit fiscal '23 offsetting at least half of the gross impact on our business. Our second wave of price increases went to effect on July 1 on 4 more categories. We plan on the next wave commencing on October 1. In addition, we've executed distribution fee increases for certain suppliers, and we are actively working with customers and GPOs to adjust language in our product and distribution contracts as they renew, allowing for greater price flexibility to respond to current and future macroeconomic dynamics. Two, optimize and grow the Cardinal Health brand portfolio. Our $4.6 billion Cardinal Health brand portfolio, which includes nearly $4 billion of non-PPE categories, offers leading brands and clinically differentiated products. Plan to grow Cardinal Health brand sales by a compounded annual growth rate of at least 3%, which will generate $75 million or more of incremental segment profit over the next 3 years.  This growth will be achieved through 2 key areas of focus. First, R&D and new product innovation. We see opportunities in key categories such as new nutritional delivery, where we will be launching the next-generation Kangaroo [indiscernible] feeding platform. Second is increased product availability as a result of investments within targeted categories such as surgical gloves and electrodes. For example, in our surgical glove portfolio, we are investing $125 million for construction of a new manufacturing facility dedicated to increased supply for leading for Texas brand gloves. Third area of focus is to accelerate our our growth businesses, primarily at Home Solutions. These businesses have growth rates in excess of our core, along with a higher margin opportunity, and we've been making investments to drive at least $60 million of total segment profit by fiscal '25.  At Home Solutions, for example, is now a $2.4 billion business that has consistently grown top line at around 10% as patient care continues to shift into the home. And finally, our fourth area of focus is to continue our simplification and cost optimization efforts. We expect actions that increased productivity in our manufacturing plants, distribution centers, supply chain and back office to yield at least $50 million of net cost savings by fiscal '25.  Going forward, we are focused on driving simplification through value improvement projects, transportation management and further optimizing our sourcing and manufacturing footprint where possible. We expect these initiatives to contribute towards exceeding our existing enterprise $750 million cost savings goal by fiscal '23. While on the topic of our supply chain, let me take a moment to share some additional color where we have received a number of investor questions. We operate a highly diverse global supply chain with approximately 2/3 of our Cardinal Health brand revenue coming from self-manufactured products. We have invested in additional self-manufacturing capabilities, many in our own North American facilities. And today, approximately half of our Cardinal Health brand revenue comes from North America in total. To best serve our customers, we continue to believe in the importance of a diverse global supply chain, and we are focused on responding to any global supply chain disruptions with resilience and agility. In summary, we believe the introduction of measurable proof points in each of these 4 areas of focus provides visibility to measure progress against our plans going forward.  Now let's turn to the Pharmaceutical segment where we continue to focus on strengthening our core PV business and investing in our growth businesses, primarily specialty. In Pharma Distribution, with our significant technology enhancements that we've been working on over the past several years, substantially completed, we now focus our attention on increasing productivity, maximizing working capital efficiency and prioritizing the customer experience. With our generics program anchored by the scale and expertise of Red Oak, we continue to further enhance our capabilities as we focus on share of wallet and maximizing margins. We recently held our Retail Business Conference where over 4,000 customers attended live for the first time in 3 years and had an opportunity to see and experience our latest innovations. We also had the chance to register for services that would help them create an online shopping portal, advisory support to optimize reimbursement and central fill compliance packaging services.  In specialty, we are continuing to see downstream momentum in oncology and emerging therapeutic areas driven by our offerings, including the Vista TS. We announced a tuck-in acquisition of the Bank care GPO and investment in their main services organization. These will further strengthen Specialty Solutions cornerstone rheumatology GPO, which offers innovative office management solutions and robust specialty drug access to over 1,300 rheumatology providers nationwide.  Upstream with biopharma manufacturers, we are investing for future growth in our 3PL business as evidenced through our cold chain storage expansion, which increases our current capacity by 200%. We also continue to see strong growth in SynXis our patient hub where our technology solutions help biopharma customers remove barriers to patient care. And with biosimilars, we are proactively addressing common barriers to adoption by investing in education campaigns to build awareness, clinical comfort and ensure accessibility. We continue to be excited about the future growth in the space and remain well positioned as new biosimilars come to market. In closing, while there's a lot of work to be done, I'm excited to work with our 44,000 teammates and executing our plans to grow in fiscal '23 and beyond. With that, I will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question today from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan.\nLisa Gill: I want to say best of luck to you, Mike Kaufmann, it's been great working with you all these years. And I look forward to hopefully staying in touch. And congratulations, Jason, on becoming CEO. I really want to start with -- obviously, you talked about this huge ramp getting the medical side of the business back to $650 million of profit. And Jason, you just talked about 4 different areas. I really want to just focus on the first area, and that's growing Cardinal brand products. And obviously, for someone like myself that's followed the company for a long time, has kind of ebbed and flowed as far as the focus of the company? Can you talk about, one, why now you think that you can really accelerate that? Two, I think you talked about nutritional. We've had others that have had problems in that area, right? Why do you think that, that's a good area for Cardinal to go into? And then secondly, when we think about physician preference, et cetera, what are you hearing in the market around private label product to give you some of the insights as to the opportunities that you see here specific to Cardinal brand products. So I'll stop there.\nJason Hollar: Yes. Great less to start off the discussion. Thanks, Lisa. So first of all, let's start with your first one there about why now. So ebbs and flows. I understand what you mean. And of course, I think what you're referring to is we especially talked about the sales force right before the pandemic. We've made a significant restructuring to have that team very much focused on driving our Cardinal brand mix and then COVID occurred and it went from a sales-focused challenge to now a supply chain challenge. And of course, our sales team as well as our customers were very much focused on PPE and in giving care to COVID patients and the change in the mix was not exactly the highest priority.  So I think it's always been a focus of Cardinal, but we recognize that we needed to change our priorities to align with our customers' priority over the last couple of years. But behind the scenes, especially with the pandemic, our medical team realized that we needed to invest in our own supply chain capability, our own products and a lot of the capacity that is necessary for the manufacturing, either whether it's our own products or source products to ensure further resiliency.  So now that we are getting a little bit more normalized, and we see that we have to invest in that supply chain, it not only helps provide resiliency to our customers, but also allows us to grow high-margin products where we have the right to win and expand our margins further. So now is the right time as we start to move on and allow our sales team to get reengaged and focus on driving that volume. But of course, we need the capacity and the products to allow them to be successful.  You asked a specific question about nutritional. That's just one area, right? We have a very broad, diverse product when we are successful in the category today. The King Group brand is a market leader. So this is not necessary we're getting into it. In fact, that's what gets me so excited about this item, it's opportunity. The 2 items I referenced, the surgical gloves and nutritional are already areas were significant leaders we are with good margins, good growth. We have the opportunity to just get our leadership through additional products and additional capacity. So it's actually a lower with risk strategy than entering in separately.  As it relates to your last question, again, we have a very broad, diverse products, and we can manufacture. We can source and we are to use all tools available to us and use that diverse capability, internal external with partners or ourselves and continue to adapt and evolve as the market demands and when we look at the supply chain state that go behind that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from George Hill of Deutsche Bank.\nGeorge Hill: And Mike, I'll echo Lisa's comments and wishing you well. And I guess, Jason, I don't mean this question to sound insensitive, but I guess given the company's recent performance, could you talk about why the Board choose to not run a process to replace Mike? And why you guys kind of went with an internal promotion? And just kind of -- I don't know if you're able to comment at all, just kind of on the board's perception of company performance and how it kind of wants to evaluate management going forward?\nJason Hollar: I certainly will not attempt to speak for the Board, but what I will say is that my time both here as well as elsewhere in industry, I'm very focused, very tenured on driving operational performance within the business. I have made a mark within this organization. I've been very focused on capital deployment, driving cash in the company and have made that impact. When I think about what -- why I feel like I'm the right person going forward here, we have a lot of great assets within the organization. We have a wonderful culture. We have wonderful products, leading positions, great growth areas. But with the pandemic has shown us is that we need to go back to some level of basics here in terms of the operational core and driving efficiency, driving simplification, so probably doing fewer things, but doing them better. And that focus and that attention to derisking the model and driving this profit improvement plan for the Medical business.  The pharma business has been very resilient. We hit our both short- and long-term goals this year. We need to keep doing more of the same, while also continuing to grow those growth areas, of which, of course, specialty is the largest one. So we're in a very different phase there. And then with this plan today, we're really highlighting how aggressive we're going to be with our capital deployment that when we generate that cash, $3.1 billion in '22, we're going to deploy it effectively. I'm well positioned to take us through those challenges that we've been faced with and I am going to be absolutely focused on taking the next steps here.\nOperator: We now move to A.J. Rice of Credit Suisse.\nUnidentified Analyst: It's [indiscernible] on for A.J. I just want to echo my congrats on Jason and Mike as well. So you mentioned the various costs have been coming down within the Medical segment and understanding there is a lag between when the spot prices come down versus when it flows through your P&L. Should we take it that any further decline in the spot prices would be upside to the medical outlook for FY '23 and beyond? And then alongside that, you talked about the 3% revenue CAGR for the Cardinal Health brand products. I guess what are you assuming in terms of pricing growth moving forward and alongside that utilization?\nJason Hollar: Okay. So to start with the spot prices. Well, that's why we always talk about the net impact is because obviously, there's a gross impact and the pricing and other contracting items that create that net. And so as I think about that dynamic in the short term, as I think you indicated and understand, it depends on what it is, right? It's inventory costs like the freight -- international freight, the product freight or the commodities that will be rolled in and that will be more of that 2-quarter lag.  But as it relates to the domestic transportation, that piece, which hasn't moved very much in either direction, that is a little bit more real time. So it kind of depends on what costs you're talking about. Long term, we believe there's going to be a parity to pre-pandemic levels for this. So if costs weaken, get lower then some of the pricing actions may change. In the near term, I don't think pricing is going to change. Under all these pricing scenarios, we're still not covering -- expected to cover more than half of that impact. So overall, we think in the short term, yes, the costs are going to flow more to minimizing the impact of what we have. But again, that would be most likely in the second half of the year.  In terms of the 3% CAGR I'm not sure I fully understand the price question there. But within our Cardinal Health, it's specifically related to that $4 billion bucket that I referenced in my comments that the underlying volume is what that's related to. There is pricing that goes along with that. But I would say it's more on the volume side and the pricing side that's driving that type of CAGR. It's not double dipping on the pricing actions. That is presuming a normalized level of inflation in pricing, and so then it would be more a volume driving that incremental value\nOperator: Moving to Michael Cherny of Bank of America.\nMichael Cherny: And Mike, obviously, same here, but I wish you best wishes as you move on. It's been a pleasure working with you over the years. maybe, Jason, to dive a little bit also into the medical transformation plan as you think about the totality of Cardinal as you step into the CEO seat. As you think about the moving pieces that you have and the drivers to push back towards growth, can you give us a sense as well on how much the linkage between the pharma and medical side will be able to help allow you to hit these targets that you've laid out? And how do you view the synergies, especially among this revamped medical outlook between these 2 segments going forward?\nJason Hollar: Yes. So when I step back and think about that plan, the area that is -- there's a couple of areas that could be impacted that have connectivity there. Probably the first one is the simplification and continued cost optimization. Those types of initiatives are wide ranging. And as we implement a particular project to reduce cost. It's a lot of cherry picking between the segments and the corporate functions, when one person has a good idea, we push those across all of them. And in some cases, we're leveraging that scale. We're doing a lot of centralization of work to standardize and offshore back-office activities, things of that nature, using digital tools that when we can invest in those types of technologies and capabilities essentially and blow that out to the whole organization. So that's certainly a piece of it. And then when we talk about the -- growing our Cardinal Health brand portfolio, while there's not a lot of crossover selling, we do have the same customers. And so those relationships, those discussions can spot into a variety of different opportunities. So that's not a huge enabler of that type of item, but it could be a component of it. And I would say that, that's probably the areas that there's the most overlap.\nOperator: We move now to Elizabeth Anderson of Evercore.\nElizabeth Anderson: Best wishes, Mike and excited to where we see in your new role. As I have a question just in terms of -- you talked about, I think, on the last call that you had gotten sort of 50% of SKUs sort of at a higher you've been able to pass through higher costs there. I was wondering if you could update that because I know you said in your slides, obviously, you were going to have offset about 50% of that gross impact exiting '23, and I know there are a variety of things in there. So I was just wondering if you could update us on that.\nJason Hollar: Yes. So that reference to 50% of SKUs was reflective of the expected July 1 price increases. So that is effective July 1. Now since then, we've now discussed and are informing everyone of the October 1 increases. I didn't provide that exact number. But remember, that's just the percentage of SKUs that we're touching. I think the more important way to think about it is the percentage of mitigation that we're targeting. So let me kind of walk through the flow and how I think you should think about it for this upcoming year. So as an anchor point, I just walked through in the prepared comments, in Q4 '22, what we just finished is about a 20% mitigation. So we indicated there was a $125 million gross impact with $25 million of pricing. So a 20% mitigation.  We expect that 20% with the July increases and phasing in over the quarter, that's going to increase that to 25% average for the first quarter of '23. Now we would expect that to continue to increase each and every quarter over the course of the year as we roll through various other increases. I mean these are the big ways, but there's always going to be other increases along the way and our supplier fees that go along with this, too. And then that 25%, we expect to double by the time we exit fiscal '23. So we expect a run rate of about 50% by the time we exit fiscal '23. And then as I indicated in my comments, we would expect to exit fiscal '24 with 100% mitigation. By the time you get to the end of '24, we would expect that part of this inflation continues to come down. So our growth impact in '24 would trend lower and then our pricing would trend higher until effectively, those 2 numbers offset.\nOperator: We now move to Steven Valiquette of Barclays.\nSteven Valiquette: I also just want to congratulate Mike on rewarding 30-plus years at Cardinal. And Jason here, so you hoping you'll have 30-plus years at Cardinal's well I think it put you in your late 70s, but I think you can do it.\nJason Hollar: [Indiscernible].\nSteven Valiquette: Just the 10% to 14% revenue growth in pharma jumped out is pretty high. I guess I was curious for more color on the drivers of growth within that as for fiscal '23, obviously, more color around the double-digit top line within the pharma\nJason Hollar: Sure. Well, yes, no, yes, okay. Got it. I think there's a couple of key points. First of all, it's very consistent with what we've done this past year and that was driven by a couple of key drivers. And I think you should think about the drivers as being similar because one of the drivers we've referenced a few times is some net new business that we referenced team in beginning in the third quarter of '22. So that would be a little bit more of a front-end loaded type of revenue benefit as we see fiscal '23. And then we've also been highlighting the strength in our large customers large book PD specialty. And we've seen some really good volume in the brand category. And so as you know, some of that larger customers and some of the brand volume doesn't always bring with it a tremendous amount of margin, but that's one of the reasons why you see very robust revenue growth and still profit growth well within the range of what we've indicated for both our short- and long-term goals. But those are the biggest drivers.\nOperator: Next, we move to Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley.\nRivka Goldwasser: And Mike, on my very best wishes and Jason, congrats and good luck. So a couple of follow-up questions here. So just to get a sense -- and Jason, thank you for clarifying the $150 million in a headwind -- in gross headwind in the first quarter versus the $125 million. So as we think about it seems like you're -- in your guidance, right, you're assuming that the headwinds are going to get worse in the first quarter versus the run rate, the run rate? I just want to make sure that I'm thinking about this correctly, and then we'll will slowly improve throughout the year. As we think about the mitigation, I think your numbers imply about $38 million, right, in mitigation from better pricing in the first quarter. When you're saying 50%, should we assume basically double from that to $75 million. I just wanted to kind of like understand the reference of that 50%.  And then an additional question on the the Cardinal brand because it seems that that's a really important part of sort of the longer-term plan. It seems that it's about 29% of revenue for the segment that comes from Cardinal Health brand. So one, how do you envision this revenue mix, what it will be by 2025? And then -- how should we think about sort of the EBIT mix? It's 29% of revenue? What percent is it of profits today?\nJason Hollar: Okay. Okay. So starting with the pricing. I think you got it fairly close, but let me clarify a few points. Yes, on -- you got the math right for Q1 that would be pretty close to how you should think about it. So yes, the gross impact is increasing a little bit from the $125 million in Q4 to the $150 million in Q1. And that is -- just to make sure we connect all the dots. Yes, spot prices, we see are starting to soften in a few areas, not all areas of some going dose direction too. But generally speaking, there's some benefit there, which but it's not impacting our P&L because it's got that 2-quarter lag. So when you think about when the international trade specifically it started reducing dramatically about 2 months ago -- 2, 3 months ago, there was a really big reduction. So you wouldn't expect that and it didn't reduce -- there's been a consistent reduction over the last several weeks. So it's going to take some time for that to flow through. So certainly, Q1 can see any of that benefit. And that's why you see the growth impact still increasing is because that's from 5, 6 months ago as well. As we think about the exit and you're trying to get the math on the pricing, is the pricing double from that probably not because what you're missing, I think, in your math is that, that $150 million should come down over the course of the year. We are anticipating it will come down in part because of that international freight. So that will begin to come down and then pricing will continue to go up. But by the time we exit, again, that exit rate would be around that 50%. But but lower than the $150 million and higher than the $37 million, $38 million from the first quarter.  As it relates to the revenue mix, that's hard to say. I I'm not ready to answer that specifically. The one thing I'll highlight is, as we indicated, $2.4 billion of revenue for at Home is a meaningful number when you look at that. So as a matter of -- are you doing calculations on the full segment or only on medical products and distribution at $2.4 billion of revenue, it's been growing consistently at 10%. We expect to continue growing robustly. And so that will, in a way, have a mix effect, so a percentage of revenue in the total segment, that will be a bigger piece of medical product distribution, most likely the smaller piece. So we'll need a little bit more math before we can respond more clearly on that one.\nOperator: We now move to Eric Percher of Nephron Research. We move to our next question, Charles Rhyee of Cowen.\nCharles Rhyee: Mike, congratulations and best wishes with everything and Jason, I look forward to working -- continuing working with you. I wanted just to maybe follow up, Jason, you talked about really using the cash and deploying it. And obviously, you outlined an amount for share repurchase. When you think about getting to the $650 million sort of target in medical operating profit. Can you talk about maybe sort of M&A or other kind of capabilities that you might want to add? I know that we spent the last few years actually divesting assets. But is part of that growth inorganic as well? And then secondly, producer price index kind of fell below -- was below what people expected. When we think about the gross impact from inflationary pressures, are you starting to see some of that ease as well given sort of this July report?\nJason Hollar: Okay. So the short answer for the medical improvement plan is no, M&A is not a cornerstone of that plan. We will be looking to always augment, especially our growth businesses. So when I -- when we talk about that second point, accelerating our growth business primarily at Home Solutions, that is very much an organic investment story. We are investing in distribution capacity, that 10% growth does mean that we have some constraints and we need to invest in that to ensure that, that business can continue to grow profitably. So that is not a cornerstone. In fact, I would say maybe a little bit of the opposite. A lot of what this plan is, is very focused on the core. It's very focused on -- we have -- we just increased our CapEx guidance this year from where it's been in the past.  That was hinted at and signaled last quarter where we talked about some of these capacity investments that, again, we still are relatively low risk and a good return. So it's more of that type of investment that we're focused on and that we believe is a better balance of risk and return as we drive this plan forward. We won't ever ignore it, and it could be a pillar -- or I'm sorry, it could be an enabler at some point later on, but it's not the focus and not necessary for what we're doing.  As it relates to PPI, I think just one maybe I kind of talked about a lot of the pieces, but one area that is often referenced as a key driver for a lot of our cost is just oil in general. That has come down. So PPI in general, I don't pay much attention to. I do look at the price of oil at least 2, 3 times today. It does have an impact on a lot of input costs and we talk about polypropylene, polyethylene, polystylene, all these poles have some input costs that are petroleum based that does impact it.  But the supply demand dynamics are so wonky right now that it's hard to see a one-for-one transition of these input costs. And I think at some point, that will come through, but we're really not seeing it that much. We are seeing lower diesel costs. So that's going in the right direction. That I would expect at some point will help with the transportation rates, but we're not necessarily seeing those elements, where it is most striking is the international freight. And that continues to be the one that is clearly running lower but it's just going to take time for that to run through our P&L. But I wouldn't call that an inflation-driven or input cost-driven point, the cost of diesel fuel for a freight as small. It's the supply and demand dynamics that we're all out of whack early on the pandemic that appear to be getting a bit more in line. That's why at this point, I believe that, that cost will maybe not keep going down at the pace of that going down, but it does feel like we're seeing more flat and down days for those costs than updates everything else, we're going to have to get more data to be able to provide additional input.\nOperator: We now move to Kevin Caliendo of UBS.\nKevin Caliendo: Again, congrats to both you, Mike and Jason. I guess my question is going back to the Medical segment. There's a lot of execution that needs to take place between now and 2025 to hit these targets. Are you happy with the team in place? How do you enhance your probability of success here internally? Is it bringing in new people, more people? Or do you feel the team in place can do it?  And the second part of that question is a lot of this is price increases, which you've talked about, how are you competitively position now when it comes to price? You talked earlier about losing some share in medical because of PPE capacity and availability earlier. How are you now positioned competitively when it comes to pricing? And are customers asking for any offsets anywhere else? I know you talked about some guarantees and the like, but I just want to understand the competitive positioning as well.\nJason Hollar: Yes, I am happy with the team in place. This is our plan. They've been working on this for quite some time. We have shared elements of it conceptually with our investors with you all in the past. What this is doing is putting a finer point on this plan and making it more visible the commitments that we're making. We are leaning into some of the investments I mentioned before, especially on the CapEx. I do think that we need to continue to augment some of the capabilities. We have several very key new team members on that team that when you think about a lot of the supply chain challenges that we're talking about over -- especially this past year and even with last quarter, we have augmented the team significantly with terrific talent, industry relevant talent, but most importantly, product talent, talent that knows the supply chain knows manufacturing that was able to make an immediate impact in finalizing this plan and allowing us to take it over line.  So I would not be presenting it this way if I didn't have the confidence that we have the people behind it to actually execute it. The other thing I'll say about a plan like this is I absolutely understand the intent of your question. because there are several things that need to happen here. And one thing I've learned in my 2 years here is that it's not what's on the piece of paper that ends up taking a sideways. It's the things that are unforeseen, like COVID and like inflation. And so with that said, that's why you see after every single one of these actions, at least or $60 million plus or $50 million plus is because our internal plans are definitely more aggressive than this. And we know that there's going to be some unforeseen things that are going to make us exceed some of these items so that we can hit it.  So yes, a lot of execution, but we have the team and we have the plan in place, and that's where we have to start. As it relates to your question on competitiveness, I think I'd like to answer that maybe a little bit more broadly because let's just talk about inflation. As long as we have a cost competitive sourcing, manufacturing footprint, then inflation that we incur absolutely needs to be pushed down to the final customer. By its nature, inflation in most industries, the most periods of time, don't get absorbed in the supply chain, there's not -- especially in distribution, there's not the margin to absorb inflation. And so when that higher cost with the industry's cost over a longer period of time, we would expect that to flow generally speaking. But how you get there is a very choppy type of process. That's why this is taking 2, 3 years. It's also certainly because of the contracting nature where a lot of this is rolling over into more permanent contracts in addition to shorter-term actions.  So there's nothing about industry dynamics. There's nothing about our competitiveness that indicates that we should be losing margin here. We have to be versatile and move our supply chain if we're uncompetitive in a particular area. But if we're competitive on a cost perspective, there's no reason we can go back to historical margins.\nOperator: We now take our last question today from Eric Percher of Nephron Research.\nEric Percher: Am I coming through this time?\nMichael Kaufmann: Yes.\nEric Percher: Perfect. So Jason, as you take on the new role, I think a couple of questions came down to what you will do different. And what I heard during the call was you've had a desire to be more aggressive on returning capital to shareholders and opioid settlement behind you, strong balance sheet. We're going to see that I heard the focus on cost management. I want to ask if there are other elements that you think are important for us to understand. And then I want to also ask pointedly, will you reassess the portfolio and consider what hedging needs to be together long term?\nJason Hollar: Yes. So let me start. Whenever I step into any project let alone a role, it is always about defining we're the best opportunity to create value. Where is the opportunities, what are the challenges? And what is clear to me is that until we can get better evidence of the progress on our medical business, we're going to be challenged. And so that is why I'm so focused on this medical improvement plan, why we provided such clarity on it is that it is absolutely one of, if not my greatest focus especially in the near term.  And when you think about kind of any type of process to fix anything, it has to be, first and foremost, defining what the challenge is. And I do want to step back for a moment. When you think about the challenges in the medical, I know there's been a lot of adjustments. I know there's been a lot of noise. But when you think about the vast majority of the issues, they do stem from one very common theme, it is related to the supply chain.  Now I can start and highlight all the external influences with that and blame things that have happened to us, and then it's very, very true. But when you think about where we were pre-COVID, this type of business, this type of industry was extremely stable. Our volume is predictable, especially in areas like PPE to think about going up 5x, 10x in terms of demand overnight and then not having a supply chain that could adjust with that, it really impacted our ability to execute in that environment in our diverse, low-cost global footprint what went from a strength to a challenge pretty much overnight. So now we've learned from that. That's what this plan is talking about. It's building in resiliency and capacity into our system so we can be a lot more flexible. We can derisk the model while also growing profitable categories.  So this is very much a cornerstone of what needs to be the focus, but it's not not just cost. It's simplification to reduce cost. It's also about driving the right time, driving organic binding high-margin volume in simplifying everything about how we operate so that we can be more nimble and we can derisk. And then, again, within both segments, there is an absolute need to continue to grow our growth businesses. What you heard me say today was more of an emphasis on specialty and on at home. Of course, we love all of our growth businesses. But what I'm really indicating here is for us to achieve the $650 million what we need are those 2 businesses to continue to grow the top line and to have a good flow-through on that incremental volume that comes with it. And with that, then we have high confidence that we'll be able to get the pieces of growth for both segments necessary to hit their longer-term objectives.  So that is very much a growth-based story, but it's about, again, prioritization and being really, really focused on the core of both businesses so that these 2 growth businesses can build from there. In terms of the portfolio, it's something that I believe in continually evaluating our portfolio for all of our businesses. And the company has demonstrated this in the past. You know about China and not of health and more recently, ports. We've monetized several billion dollars over the last several years through those activities and was responsible with the capital deployment thereafter. I'm not going to attempt to define what the appropriate long-term course of action is for this business for the medical business. But under all scenarios, what's really, really clear to me that the near-term actions need to be very focused on this improvement plan and then that will set us up for the best actions thereafter.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Mike Kaufmann for any additional or closing remarks.\nMichael Kaufmann: Thank you. Before Jason ends the call, I would like to say that I appreciate all of your congratulations and comments and enjoyed working with all of you. I look forward to a smooth transition with Jason, and have complete confidence in his leadership. Jason, to you.\nJason Hollar: Yes. Thanks, Mike. I want to also thank everybody for taking the time to be on the call today and for all your questions. In addition to the leadership succession, I acknowledge that we drew a lot out of you today, including new disclosures, various puts and takes and examples of incremental actions that we are taking. We did all this in an effort to provide additional visibility as we are confident and excited about these opportunities to drive growth. But there are 3 key takeaways I want to make sure that you have,  First, we are committed to improving our results as demonstrated by the introduction of our medical improvement plan. Second, we continue to be encouraged by the resiliency of our Pharma segment, which continues to meet both our short and long-term objectives. And third, that we continue to take actions that are in our shareholders' best interest.

            "content": "Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. As I am sure many of you have seen, a short time ago, we issued a press release, announcing that I am stepping down as CEO and as a Board member of Cardinal Health, but will continue to serve through August 31. Effective September 1, Jason will become Cardinal's new CEO. He has also been appointed as a board member effective today. They say timing is everything, and I believe as we start a new fiscal year, the time is right for me to step away as CEO and open the door for a new leader to take Cardinal Health forward over the coming years. I have been blessed to be part of the Cardinal Health family for 32 years. In that time, I've seen our company grow and evolve in many ways. We are truly essential to care, and I'm honored to have been part of it. Jason has been a tremendous partner over the past 2-plus years, and has been instrumental in many of our strategic initiatives. He deeply understands our business, priorities and industry landscape. And the board and I are confident that he is the right person for the job.  With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jason. Yes. Thank you. Before Jason ends the call, I would like to say that I appreciate all of your congratulations and comments and enjoyed working with all of you. I look forward to a smooth transition with Jason, and have complete confidence in his leadership. Jason, to you."

            "content": "Thanks, Mike. I really appreciate the kind words and the opportunity to work closely with you these past few years. Let me start by saying how excited I am to be taking on this new responsibility. I am grateful for the trust and the confidence the Board of Directors is placing me. I would also like to thank you, Mike, for the leadership and the many contributions to the company over the years. I hope to preserve the culture that you've helped ingrain into the fabric of our organization, and I look forward to what I know will be a smooth transition. I also want to welcome Trish English, who will be serving as our Interim Chief Financial Officer. Trish most recently served as our Chief Accounting Officer and has been a valuable member of the Cardinal Health family for over 16 years. I look forward to continuing to work with her in this new capacity while we conduct an external search for a permanent CFO.  Before stepping into the details of our financial performance for the quarter, let me step back and summarize the key points this past year. Within our Pharma segment, while we experienced the effects of industry-wide inflation and incurred incremental technology investments. We grew the business 5%, consistent with both our original guidance for the year as well as our long-term growth targets. The Medical business was more significantly impacted by these inflationary dynamics, which drove a significant impact on our results. However, we have strong mitigation actions in place, including pricing and will present a plan to you today that mitigates all of the inflationary and global supply chain constraint impacts plus an additional 8% of compounded annual growth by fiscal '25.  Underlying these operating results this past year was a significant focus on cash flow, which results in increased financial flexibility. We are absolutely focused on shareholder value and intend to deploy these incremental funds to additional share repurchases for fiscal '23. While we remain in a dynamic environment, I'm excited to share further details of our plans with you today, and commit to continue to provide increased [indiscernible] drivers and the key metrics underlying our performance. So let's now turn to some of the details driving our results in the fourth quarter, beginning with the Pharma segment on Slide 6. Fourth quarter revenue increased 13% to $43 billion, driven by branded pharmaceutical sales growth from existing and net new PD and specialty customers. Segment profit increased 26% to $451 million driven by generics program performance and a higher contribution from brand sales mix, partially offset by inflationary supply chain costs.  As we've previously noted, this also reflects a favorable comparison due to the prior year inventory adjustments. During the quarter, our generics program, including Red Oak, saw strong performance and continued to experience consistent market dynamics. Regarding the inflationary supply chain costs, we saw impacts in areas that expectation and labor, which we expect to continue into next year. We also incurred higher cost supporting sales growth. And with ongoing progress in opioid litigation matters, we saw a decrease of approximately $15 million in opioid-related legal costs.  Turning to Medical on Slide 7. Fourth quarter revenue decreased 11% to $3.8 billion due to the divestiture of the Cordis business and lower products and distribution volumes. Medical segment loss of $16 million in the fourth quarter was due to net inflationary impacts on global supply chain constraints and products and distribution. On a year-over-year basis, the favorable comparison to the prior year of $197 million PPE inventory reserve was mostly offset by the net inflationary and global supply chain constraint impacts, a lower contribution from PPE and the Cordis divestiture.  During the quarter, our products and distribution business saw an approximate $100 million impact from net incremental inflation and supply chain constraints. This reflects a gross impact of approximately $125 million and approximate $25 million offset from our mitigation actions, which includes our initial wave of price increases on 5 Cardinal Health brand categories that went into effect back in March. I'll elaborate on our plans for further mitigation in fiscal '23 and beyond shortly.  As mentioned, it continues to be a highly dynamic medical environment, and our Q4 results came in lower than we had previously expected. This primarily reflects overall volume softness in our products and distribution business, including a lower contribution from PPE. Stepping back, Demand for PPE has fluctuated significantly over the past couple of years. We saw lower volumes as we exited Q3 and the fourth quarter experienced further declines. We believe this primarily reflects customers' higher inventory levels and to a lesser extent, some PPE category-specific customer losses driven by supply constraints during the pandemic. We continue to have strong conviction in our overall value proposition, which includes leading brands and clinically differentiated products. For context, PPE represents approximately 15% of sales in our overall Cardinal Health brand portfolio, as you'll see on Slide 20.  Moving below line. Interest and other increased by $36 million to $64 million due to a decrease in the value of our deferred compensation plan investments compared to gains in the prior year. As [indiscernible] deferred compensation gains or losses reported in interest and other are fully offsetting corporate SG&A and net neutral to our bottom line. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, a onetime write-down of an equity investment impacted EPS by $0.06 per share. The increase in other expense was partially offset by lower interest due to debt reduction actions. As indicated, we repaid the $280 million of remaining June 2022 notes at maturity. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate finished at 25.4%, approximately 3 percentage points higher than the prior year. The net result was fourth quarter EPS of $1.05, an increase of 36%, primarily reflecting the growth in pharma segment profit.  Now transitioning to our consolidated results for the year. Fiscal '22 revenues increased 12% to $181 million, driven by the Pharma segment. Gross margin decreased 3% to due to the Cordis divestiture. Total company SG&A increased 1%, reflecting inflationary supply chain costs, our previously mentioned IT investments and higher costs to support sales growth, mostly offset by the Cordis divestiture and benefits from cost savings initiatives.  Operating earnings decreased 12%, which primarily reflects a year-over-year headwind of approximately $300 million related to net inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints in medical, partially offset by Pharma segment profit growth. Interest and other increased 24% to $165 million, largely due to the items affecting the fourth quarter. Of note, this came in higher than our guidance primarily due to equity investment write-down in the quarter. Our annual effective tax rate finished at 22.1%. The net result was fiscal '22 EPS of $5.06.  Now turning to the balance sheet. In fiscal '22, we generated robust operating cash flow of $3.1 billion. This includes the previously defined tax refund of nearly $1 billion and favorable timing of working capital. Additionally, in fiscal '22, we made approximately $500 million in litigation payments, primarily related to opioid settlements. In July, we made our second annual payment under the national opioid settlement agreement of approximately $375 million, which will be reflected in Q1 fiscal '23 operating cash flow. We are focused on deploying capital in a balanced, disciplined and shareholder-friendly manner. This year, we invested approximately $385 million of CapEx back into the business to drive future growth, paid down approximately $850 million in debt to reduce leverage and returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.  We ended the year with a cash position of $4.7 billion, which does reflect some timing favorability with no outstanding borrowings on our credit facilities. As for the segment's full year results, beginning with Pharma on Slide 10. Pharma revenue increased 14% to $165 billion, reflecting consistent drivers with the fourth quarter. Pharma segment profit increased 5% to $1.8 billion, driven primarily by generics program performance and an improvement in volumes compared to the prior year. This was partially offset by investments in technology enhancements and inflationary supply chain costs. To be helpful, the tailwind from improved volumes and the headwind from incremental IT investments effectively offset in fiscal '22, each approximately $80 million on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, we saw an approximate $50 million headwind from inflationary supply chain costs, primarily in the second half of the year.  Moving to Medical on Slide 11. Fiscal 22 medical revenue decreased 5% to , primarily due to the divestiture of the Cordis business. To a lesser extent, lower products and distribution volumes were partially offset by growth in at-home solutions. Segment profit decreased 63% to $216 million, primarily due to the net inflationary impacts in global supply chain constraints in products and distribution. Additionally, the favorable comparison to the prior year PPE inventory reserve was offset by a lower contribution from PPE and the divestiture of the Cordis business.  Now for our fiscal '23 guidance. On Slide 13, we expect earnings per share in the range of $5.05 to $5.40, which reflects the following assumptions: First, for the enterprise, we expect interest and other between $140 million to $170 million, which assumes approximately $550 million in debt paydown for the March 2023 notes at or before maturity. We are assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate in the range of 23% to 25%. We anticipate diluted weighted average shares outstanding between $262 million and $266 million, reflecting our plan to complete between $1.5 billion to $2 billion in share repurchases over the course of the year. And supporting our capital allocation priorities, we expect to adjust free cash flow in the range of $1.5 billion to $2 billion, which excludes litigation payments and any other significant and unusual or nonrecurring items.  As for the segments, beginning with Pharma on Slide 14, we expect revenue growth in the range of 10% to 14%, driven by growth in existing and net new PD and specialty customers. We expect segment profit growth in the range of 2% to 5% based on the following key assumptions. We expect continued stability in overall pharmaceutical volumes along with consistent market dynamics within our generics program. Continuation of the inflationary supply chain costs we've seen in the last 2 quarters should result in approximate $50 million headwind primarily in the first half of the year. The completion of ERP technology enhancements should be an approximate $30 million tailwind. We expect opioid-related legal costs, including initial costs for implementation of the settlements in adjunctive relief terms of approximately $80 million in fiscal '23, a $20 million tailwind. And we see increased contributions from our growth areas, primarily specialty, including biosimilars.  Before moving to Medical, a couple of points from the Pharma fiscal '23 . Similar to last year, we expect the year-over-year segment profit growth to be significantly back-half weighted, which primarily reflects the year-over-year impact of inflationary supply chain costs in the first half. Specifically, in the first quarter of next year, we expect segment profit between $400 million and $420 million. While we do not typically provide quarterly guidance, we thought additional color may be helpful given the puts and takes over the last several quarters.  Now turning to Medical on Slide 15. We expect revenue to decline in the range of 3% to 6% due to lower PPE sales and lab testing volumes. We expect segment profit ranging from a decline of 10% to growth of 10%, reflecting the following assumptions. We expect a similar net impact of approximately $300 million from inflation, global supply chain constraints and mitigation actions in fiscal '23 or a minimal impact on a year-over-year basis. This assumes an approximate $475 million gross impact from inflation and global supply chain constraints, partially offset by $175 million of mitigation actions, including pricing and evolving our commercial contracting.  While still significantly elevated relative to historical levels, we're encouraged by the recent improvements in spot rates of certain cost drivers such as international freight and some commodities. As a reminder, these product costs are capitalized and have historically been reflected in our P&L results on a 1 to 2 quarter delay. However, in the current period of elongated supply chains, it is closer to 2 quarters. Our current assumption is that the impact of inflation in global supply chain constraints will peak in the first quarter of fiscal '23 and gradually decrease over the next couple of years. Additionally, along with the pricing actions that went into effect at the start of the year, we are implementing additional ways of increases over the course of fiscal '23. We continue to expect that as we exit fiscal '23, the run rate of our mitigation actions will offset at least 50% of the gross impact from inflation and global supply chain constraints.  In terms of other key assumptions for medical and fiscal '23. As the operating environment continues to normalize, we expect an approximate $50 million tailwind from an improvement in PPE margins. We plan to sell through the majority of higher-cost PPE in the first half of the year and for PPE margins to normalize as we exit the year. We expect the PPE tailwind to be offset by a similar headwind from lower lab testing volumes. We also anticipate a headwind of approximately $50 million from re-baseline incentive compensation following fiscal '22 underperformance. And finally, we expect increased contributions from our strategic growth areas, primarily at Home Solutions.  On Medical's quarterly cadence, while we are assuming a similar segment profit total in fiscal '23 versus fiscal '22, we do expect the cadence to be the reverse of the prior year. Specifically, in the first quarter, we expect segment profit ranging from a loss of $20 million to profit of $20 million. We expect the gross impact of inflation and global supply chain constraints in the first quarter to be approximately $150 million, approximately 25% of this offset through our mitigation actions. As for the rest of the year, we expect the substantial majority of segment profit to come in the second half of fiscal '23, particularly in the fourth quarter. This sequencing primarily reflects our assumptions around inflation, global supply chain constraints, inflation mitigation and PPE. While there are many moving parts in fiscal '23, we are confident in our long-term outlook and our reiterating our previously announced long-term targets for our businesses and for double-digit combined EPS growth and dividend yield over longer normalized periods. Additionally, we are introducing a new target for at least $650 million in Medical segment profit by fiscal '25, driven by the medical improvement plan that we are introducing today.  Slide 17 highlights our 4 areas of focus to improve medical performance. Number one, mitigate inflation and global supply chain constraints. We plan to fully address the impact of inflation and global supply chain constraints through mitigation initiatives by the time we exit fiscal '24 and are targeting to exit fiscal '23 offsetting at least half of the gross impact on our business. Our second wave of price increases went to effect on July 1 on 4 more categories. We plan on the next wave commencing on October 1. In addition, we've executed distribution fee increases for certain suppliers, and we are actively working with customers and GPOs to adjust language in our product and distribution contracts as they renew, allowing for greater price flexibility to respond to current and future macroeconomic dynamics. Two, optimize and grow the Cardinal Health brand portfolio. Our $4.6 billion Cardinal Health brand portfolio, which includes nearly $4 billion of non-PPE categories, offers leading brands and clinically differentiated products. Plan to grow Cardinal Health brand sales by a compounded annual growth rate of at least 3%, which will generate $75 million or more of incremental segment profit over the next 3 years.  This growth will be achieved through 2 key areas of focus. First, R&D and new product innovation. We see opportunities in key categories such as new nutritional delivery, where we will be launching the next-generation Kangaroo [indiscernible] feeding platform. Second is increased product availability as a result of investments within targeted categories such as surgical gloves and electrodes. For example, in our surgical glove portfolio, we are investing $125 million for construction of a new manufacturing facility dedicated to increased supply for leading for Texas brand gloves. Third area of focus is to accelerate our our growth businesses, primarily at Home Solutions. These businesses have growth rates in excess of our core, along with a higher margin opportunity, and we've been making investments to drive at least $60 million of total segment profit by fiscal '25.  At Home Solutions, for example, is now a $2.4 billion business that has consistently grown top line at around 10% as patient care continues to shift into the home. And finally, our fourth area of focus is to continue our simplification and cost optimization efforts. We expect actions that increased productivity in our manufacturing plants, distribution centers, supply chain and back office to yield at least $50 million of net cost savings by fiscal '25.  Going forward, we are focused on driving simplification through value improvement projects, transportation management and further optimizing our sourcing and manufacturing footprint where possible. We expect these initiatives to contribute towards exceeding our existing enterprise $750 million cost savings goal by fiscal '23. While on the topic of our supply chain, let me take a moment to share some additional color where we have received a number of investor questions. We operate a highly diverse global supply chain with approximately 2/3 of our Cardinal Health brand revenue coming from self-manufactured products. We have invested in additional self-manufacturing capabilities, many in our own North American facilities. And today, approximately half of our Cardinal Health brand revenue comes from North America in total. To best serve our customers, we continue to believe in the importance of a diverse global supply chain, and we are focused on responding to any global supply chain disruptions with resilience and agility. In summary, we believe the introduction of measurable proof points in each of these 4 areas of focus provides visibility to measure progress against our plans going forward.  Now let's turn to the Pharmaceutical segment where we continue to focus on strengthening our core PV business and investing in our growth businesses, primarily specialty. In Pharma Distribution, with our significant technology enhancements that we've been working on over the past several years, substantially completed, we now focus our attention on increasing productivity, maximizing working capital efficiency and prioritizing the customer experience. With our generics program anchored by the scale and expertise of Red Oak, we continue to further enhance our capabilities as we focus on share of wallet and maximizing margins. We recently held our Retail Business Conference where over 4,000 customers attended live for the first time in 3 years and had an opportunity to see and experience our latest innovations. We also had the chance to register for services that would help them create an online shopping portal, advisory support to optimize reimbursement and central fill compliance packaging services.  In specialty, we are continuing to see downstream momentum in oncology and emerging therapeutic areas driven by our offerings, including the Vista TS. We announced a tuck-in acquisition of the Bank care GPO and investment in their main services organization. These will further strengthen Specialty Solutions cornerstone rheumatology GPO, which offers innovative office management solutions and robust specialty drug access to over 1,300 rheumatology providers nationwide.  Upstream with biopharma manufacturers, we are investing for future growth in our 3PL business as evidenced through our cold chain storage expansion, which increases our current capacity by 200%. We also continue to see strong growth in SynXis our patient hub where our technology solutions help biopharma customers remove barriers to patient care. And with biosimilars, we are proactively addressing common barriers to adoption by investing in education campaigns to build awareness, clinical comfort and ensure accessibility. We continue to be excited about the future growth in the space and remain well positioned as new biosimilars come to market. In closing, while there's a lot of work to be done, I'm excited to work with our 44,000 teammates and executing our plans to grow in fiscal '23 and beyond. With that, I will now take your questions. Yes. Great less to start off the discussion. Thanks, Lisa. So first of all, let's start with your first one there about why now. So ebbs and flows. I understand what you mean. And of course, I think what you're referring to is we especially talked about the sales force right before the pandemic. We've made a significant restructuring to have that team very much focused on driving our Cardinal brand mix and then COVID occurred and it went from a sales-focused challenge to now a supply chain challenge. And of course, our sales team as well as our customers were very much focused on PPE and in giving care to COVID patients and the change in the mix was not exactly the highest priority.  So I think it's always been a focus of Cardinal, but we recognize that we needed to change our priorities to align with our customers' priority over the last couple of years. But behind the scenes, especially with the pandemic, our medical team realized that we needed to invest in our own supply chain capability, our own products and a lot of the capacity that is necessary for the manufacturing, either whether it's our own products or source products to ensure further resiliency.  So now that we are getting a little bit more normalized, and we see that we have to invest in that supply chain, it not only helps provide resiliency to our customers, but also allows us to grow high-margin products where we have the right to win and expand our margins further. So now is the right time as we start to move on and allow our sales team to get reengaged and focus on driving that volume. But of course, we need the capacity and the products to allow them to be successful.  You asked a specific question about nutritional. That's just one area, right? We have a very broad, diverse product when we are successful in the category today. The King Group brand is a market leader. So this is not necessary we're getting into it. In fact, that's what gets me so excited about this item, it's opportunity. The 2 items I referenced, the surgical gloves and nutritional are already areas were significant leaders we are with good margins, good growth. We have the opportunity to just get our leadership through additional products and additional capacity. So it's actually a lower with risk strategy than entering in separately.  As it relates to your last question, again, we have a very broad, diverse products, and we can manufacture. We can source and we are to use all tools available to us and use that diverse capability, internal external with partners or ourselves and continue to adapt and evolve as the market demands and when we look at the supply chain state that go behind that. I certainly will not attempt to speak for the Board, but what I will say is that my time both here as well as elsewhere in industry, I'm very focused, very tenured on driving operational performance within the business. I have made a mark within this organization. I've been very focused on capital deployment, driving cash in the company and have made that impact. When I think about what -- why I feel like I'm the right person going forward here, we have a lot of great assets within the organization. We have a wonderful culture. We have wonderful products, leading positions, great growth areas. But with the pandemic has shown us is that we need to go back to some level of basics here in terms of the operational core and driving efficiency, driving simplification, so probably doing fewer things, but doing them better. And that focus and that attention to derisking the model and driving this profit improvement plan for the Medical business.  The pharma business has been very resilient. We hit our both short- and long-term goals this year. We need to keep doing more of the same, while also continuing to grow those growth areas, of which, of course, specialty is the largest one. So we're in a very different phase there. And then with this plan today, we're really highlighting how aggressive we're going to be with our capital deployment that when we generate that cash, $3.1 billion in '22, we're going to deploy it effectively. I'm well positioned to take us through those challenges that we've been faced with and I am going to be absolutely focused on taking the next steps here. Okay. So to start with the spot prices. Well, that's why we always talk about the net impact is because obviously, there's a gross impact and the pricing and other contracting items that create that net. And so as I think about that dynamic in the short term, as I think you indicated and understand, it depends on what it is, right? It's inventory costs like the freight -- international freight, the product freight or the commodities that will be rolled in and that will be more of that 2-quarter lag.  But as it relates to the domestic transportation, that piece, which hasn't moved very much in either direction, that is a little bit more real time. So it kind of depends on what costs you're talking about. Long term, we believe there's going to be a parity to pre-pandemic levels for this. So if costs weaken, get lower then some of the pricing actions may change. In the near term, I don't think pricing is going to change. Under all these pricing scenarios, we're still not covering -- expected to cover more than half of that impact. So overall, we think in the short term, yes, the costs are going to flow more to minimizing the impact of what we have. But again, that would be most likely in the second half of the year.  In terms of the 3% CAGR I'm not sure I fully understand the price question there. But within our Cardinal Health, it's specifically related to that $4 billion bucket that I referenced in my comments that the underlying volume is what that's related to. There is pricing that goes along with that. But I would say it's more on the volume side and the pricing side that's driving that type of CAGR. It's not double dipping on the pricing actions. That is presuming a normalized level of inflation in pricing, and so then it would be more a volume driving that incremental value Yes. So when I step back and think about that plan, the area that is -- there's a couple of areas that could be impacted that have connectivity there. Probably the first one is the simplification and continued cost optimization. Those types of initiatives are wide ranging. And as we implement a particular project to reduce cost. It's a lot of cherry picking between the segments and the corporate functions, when one person has a good idea, we push those across all of them. And in some cases, we're leveraging that scale. We're doing a lot of centralization of work to standardize and offshore back-office activities, things of that nature, using digital tools that when we can invest in those types of technologies and capabilities essentially and blow that out to the whole organization. So that's certainly a piece of it. And then when we talk about the -- growing our Cardinal Health brand portfolio, while there's not a lot of crossover selling, we do have the same customers. And so those relationships, those discussions can spot into a variety of different opportunities. So that's not a huge enabler of that type of item, but it could be a component of it. And I would say that, that's probably the areas that there's the most overlap. Yes. So that reference to 50% of SKUs was reflective of the expected July 1 price increases. So that is effective July 1. Now since then, we've now discussed and are informing everyone of the October 1 increases. I didn't provide that exact number. But remember, that's just the percentage of SKUs that we're touching. I think the more important way to think about it is the percentage of mitigation that we're targeting. So let me kind of walk through the flow and how I think you should think about it for this upcoming year. So as an anchor point, I just walked through in the prepared comments, in Q4 '22, what we just finished is about a 20% mitigation. So we indicated there was a $125 million gross impact with $25 million of pricing. So a 20% mitigation.  We expect that 20% with the July increases and phasing in over the quarter, that's going to increase that to 25% average for the first quarter of '23. Now we would expect that to continue to increase each and every quarter over the course of the year as we roll through various other increases. I mean these are the big ways, but there's always going to be other increases along the way and our supplier fees that go along with this, too. And then that 25%, we expect to double by the time we exit fiscal '23. So we expect a run rate of about 50% by the time we exit fiscal '23. And then as I indicated in my comments, we would expect to exit fiscal '24 with 100% mitigation. By the time you get to the end of '24, we would expect that part of this inflation continues to come down. So our growth impact in '24 would trend lower and then our pricing would trend higher until effectively, those 2 numbers offset. [Indiscernible]. Sure. Well, yes, no, yes, okay. Got it. I think there's a couple of key points. First of all, it's very consistent with what we've done this past year and that was driven by a couple of key drivers. And I think you should think about the drivers as being similar because one of the drivers we've referenced a few times is some net new business that we referenced team in beginning in the third quarter of '22. So that would be a little bit more of a front-end loaded type of revenue benefit as we see fiscal '23. And then we've also been highlighting the strength in our large customers large book PD specialty. And we've seen some really good volume in the brand category. And so as you know, some of that larger customers and some of the brand volume doesn't always bring with it a tremendous amount of margin, but that's one of the reasons why you see very robust revenue growth and still profit growth well within the range of what we've indicated for both our short- and long-term goals. But those are the biggest drivers. Okay. Okay. So starting with the pricing. I think you got it fairly close, but let me clarify a few points. Yes, on -- you got the math right for Q1 that would be pretty close to how you should think about it. So yes, the gross impact is increasing a little bit from the $125 million in Q4 to the $150 million in Q1. And that is -- just to make sure we connect all the dots. Yes, spot prices, we see are starting to soften in a few areas, not all areas of some going dose direction too. But generally speaking, there's some benefit there, which but it's not impacting our P&L because it's got that 2-quarter lag. So when you think about when the international trade specifically it started reducing dramatically about 2 months ago -- 2, 3 months ago, there was a really big reduction. So you wouldn't expect that and it didn't reduce -- there's been a consistent reduction over the last several weeks. So it's going to take some time for that to flow through. So certainly, Q1 can see any of that benefit. And that's why you see the growth impact still increasing is because that's from 5, 6 months ago as well. As we think about the exit and you're trying to get the math on the pricing, is the pricing double from that probably not because what you're missing, I think, in your math is that, that $150 million should come down over the course of the year. We are anticipating it will come down in part because of that international freight. So that will begin to come down and then pricing will continue to go up. But by the time we exit, again, that exit rate would be around that 50%. But but lower than the $150 million and higher than the $37 million, $38 million from the first quarter.  As it relates to the revenue mix, that's hard to say. I I'm not ready to answer that specifically. The one thing I'll highlight is, as we indicated, $2.4 billion of revenue for at Home is a meaningful number when you look at that. So as a matter of -- are you doing calculations on the full segment or only on medical products and distribution at $2.4 billion of revenue, it's been growing consistently at 10%. We expect to continue growing robustly. And so that will, in a way, have a mix effect, so a percentage of revenue in the total segment, that will be a bigger piece of medical product distribution, most likely the smaller piece. So we'll need a little bit more math before we can respond more clearly on that one. Okay. So the short answer for the medical improvement plan is no, M&A is not a cornerstone of that plan. We will be looking to always augment, especially our growth businesses. So when I -- when we talk about that second point, accelerating our growth business primarily at Home Solutions, that is very much an organic investment story. We are investing in distribution capacity, that 10% growth does mean that we have some constraints and we need to invest in that to ensure that, that business can continue to grow profitably. So that is not a cornerstone. In fact, I would say maybe a little bit of the opposite. A lot of what this plan is, is very focused on the core. It's very focused on -- we have -- we just increased our CapEx guidance this year from where it's been in the past.  That was hinted at and signaled last quarter where we talked about some of these capacity investments that, again, we still are relatively low risk and a good return. So it's more of that type of investment that we're focused on and that we believe is a better balance of risk and return as we drive this plan forward. We won't ever ignore it, and it could be a pillar -- or I'm sorry, it could be an enabler at some point later on, but it's not the focus and not necessary for what we're doing.  As it relates to PPI, I think just one maybe I kind of talked about a lot of the pieces, but one area that is often referenced as a key driver for a lot of our cost is just oil in general. That has come down. So PPI in general, I don't pay much attention to. I do look at the price of oil at least 2, 3 times today. It does have an impact on a lot of input costs and we talk about polypropylene, polyethylene, polystylene, all these poles have some input costs that are petroleum based that does impact it.  But the supply demand dynamics are so wonky right now that it's hard to see a one-for-one transition of these input costs. And I think at some point, that will come through, but we're really not seeing it that much. We are seeing lower diesel costs. So that's going in the right direction. That I would expect at some point will help with the transportation rates, but we're not necessarily seeing those elements, where it is most striking is the international freight. And that continues to be the one that is clearly running lower but it's just going to take time for that to run through our P&L. But I wouldn't call that an inflation-driven or input cost-driven point, the cost of diesel fuel for a freight as small. It's the supply and demand dynamics that we're all out of whack early on the pandemic that appear to be getting a bit more in line. That's why at this point, I believe that, that cost will maybe not keep going down at the pace of that going down, but it does feel like we're seeing more flat and down days for those costs than updates everything else, we're going to have to get more data to be able to provide additional input. Yes, I am happy with the team in place. This is our plan. They've been working on this for quite some time. We have shared elements of it conceptually with our investors with you all in the past. What this is doing is putting a finer point on this plan and making it more visible the commitments that we're making. We are leaning into some of the investments I mentioned before, especially on the CapEx. I do think that we need to continue to augment some of the capabilities. We have several very key new team members on that team that when you think about a lot of the supply chain challenges that we're talking about over -- especially this past year and even with last quarter, we have augmented the team significantly with terrific talent, industry relevant talent, but most importantly, product talent, talent that knows the supply chain knows manufacturing that was able to make an immediate impact in finalizing this plan and allowing us to take it over line.  So I would not be presenting it this way if I didn't have the confidence that we have the people behind it to actually execute it. The other thing I'll say about a plan like this is I absolutely understand the intent of your question. because there are several things that need to happen here. And one thing I've learned in my 2 years here is that it's not what's on the piece of paper that ends up taking a sideways. It's the things that are unforeseen, like COVID and like inflation. And so with that said, that's why you see after every single one of these actions, at least or $60 million plus or $50 million plus is because our internal plans are definitely more aggressive than this. And we know that there's going to be some unforeseen things that are going to make us exceed some of these items so that we can hit it.  So yes, a lot of execution, but we have the team and we have the plan in place, and that's where we have to start. As it relates to your question on competitiveness, I think I'd like to answer that maybe a little bit more broadly because let's just talk about inflation. As long as we have a cost competitive sourcing, manufacturing footprint, then inflation that we incur absolutely needs to be pushed down to the final customer. By its nature, inflation in most industries, the most periods of time, don't get absorbed in the supply chain, there's not -- especially in distribution, there's not the margin to absorb inflation. And so when that higher cost with the industry's cost over a longer period of time, we would expect that to flow generally speaking. But how you get there is a very choppy type of process. That's why this is taking 2, 3 years. It's also certainly because of the contracting nature where a lot of this is rolling over into more permanent contracts in addition to shorter-term actions.  So there's nothing about industry dynamics. There's nothing about our competitiveness that indicates that we should be losing margin here. We have to be versatile and move our supply chain if we're uncompetitive in a particular area. But if we're competitive on a cost perspective, there's no reason we can go back to historical margins. Yes. So let me start. Whenever I step into any project let alone a role, it is always about defining we're the best opportunity to create value. Where is the opportunities, what are the challenges? And what is clear to me is that until we can get better evidence of the progress on our medical business, we're going to be challenged. And so that is why I'm so focused on this medical improvement plan, why we provided such clarity on it is that it is absolutely one of, if not my greatest focus especially in the near term.  And when you think about kind of any type of process to fix anything, it has to be, first and foremost, defining what the challenge is. And I do want to step back for a moment. When you think about the challenges in the medical, I know there's been a lot of adjustments. I know there's been a lot of noise. But when you think about the vast majority of the issues, they do stem from one very common theme, it is related to the supply chain.  Now I can start and highlight all the external influences with that and blame things that have happened to us, and then it's very, very true. But when you think about where we were pre-COVID, this type of business, this type of industry was extremely stable. Our volume is predictable, especially in areas like PPE to think about going up 5x, 10x in terms of demand overnight and then not having a supply chain that could adjust with that, it really impacted our ability to execute in that environment in our diverse, low-cost global footprint what went from a strength to a challenge pretty much overnight. So now we've learned from that. That's what this plan is talking about. It's building in resiliency and capacity into our system so we can be a lot more flexible. We can derisk the model while also growing profitable categories.  So this is very much a cornerstone of what needs to be the focus, but it's not not just cost. It's simplification to reduce cost. It's also about driving the right time, driving organic binding high-margin volume in simplifying everything about how we operate so that we can be more nimble and we can derisk. And then, again, within both segments, there is an absolute need to continue to grow our growth businesses. What you heard me say today was more of an emphasis on specialty and on at home. Of course, we love all of our growth businesses. But what I'm really indicating here is for us to achieve the $650 million what we need are those 2 businesses to continue to grow the top line and to have a good flow-through on that incremental volume that comes with it. And with that, then we have high confidence that we'll be able to get the pieces of growth for both segments necessary to hit their longer-term objectives.  So that is very much a growth-based story, but it's about, again, prioritization and being really, really focused on the core of both businesses so that these 2 growth businesses can build from there. In terms of the portfolio, it's something that I believe in continually evaluating our portfolio for all of our businesses. And the company has demonstrated this in the past. You know about China and not of health and more recently, ports. We've monetized several billion dollars over the last several years through those activities and was responsible with the capital deployment thereafter. I'm not going to attempt to define what the appropriate long-term course of action is for this business for the medical business. But under all scenarios, what's really, really clear to me that the near-term actions need to be very focused on this improvement plan and then that will set us up for the best actions thereafter. Yes. Thanks, Mike. I want to also thank everybody for taking the time to be on the call today and for all your questions. In addition to the leadership succession, I acknowledge that we drew a lot out of you today, including new disclosures, various puts and takes and examples of incremental actions that we are taking. We did all this in an effort to provide additional visibility as we are confident and excited about these opportunities to drive growth. But there are 3 key takeaways I want to make sure that you have,  First, we are committed to improving our results as demonstrated by the introduction of our medical improvement plan. Second, we continue to be encouraged by the resiliency of our Pharma segment, which continues to meet both our short and long-term objectives. And third, that we continue to take actions that are in our shareholders' best interest.  With that, thank you, and have a great day."

Our third quarter results reflect continued inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints. As we continue to manage through the current macroeconomic environment, we remain focused on both near-term priority and long-term strategies to drive growth and momentum across our businesses. At an enterprise level, we're maintaining our focus on our three strategic priorities, optimizing our core businesses, investing for growth and innovation, and deploying capital efficiently. In pharma, despite the quarter being a little lower, due to higher operations costs, we remain encouraged by the trajectory of the business. We saw resiliency and overall pharmaceutical demand, strong performance in our generics program and continue to expect pharma to realize mid-single digit profit growth in FY '22. In medical, our core U.S. medical products and distribution business continues to experience unprecedented inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints. We continue to take action to mitigate the effects of these global challenges on our business, including taking pricing actions, evolving our commercial contracting strategies, and investing in additional supply chain capacity. While we remain confident these actions will deliver value and are encouraged by the other areas of our medical business and our opportunities for long-term growth, the current environment remains highly dynamic. Our updated outlook for FY '22 reflects our most current expectation. I'll elaborate on the actions we're taking to drive performance, particularly in medical after Jason reviews our third quarter results and updated outlook. Before turning the discussion over to Jason, it's important to note that the opioid settlement agreement was finalized during the quarter and became effective on April 2. This is an important and significant step forward for our company. We build a settlement is the best way to deliver relief to communities across the United States and allow our company to move forward by putting 1000s of lawsuits behind us. 46 of 49 eligible states, all six eligible territories and over 98% of litigating political subdivisions are part of the national agreement. This comprehensive agreement will settle the vast majority of the opioid lawsuits filed by state and local governmental entities. Additionally, we recently reached an agreement with the State of Washington and its participating subdivisions to resolve opioid-related claims on similar terms to the broader settlement, bringing the total number of states with which we have settled the 47 out of 49. While the settlements do not cover all opioid related claims, these comprehensive agreements are a significant milestone toward achieving broad resolution of governmental opioid claims, and include injunctive relief terms designed, in part to increase transparency for the supply chain to these products and demonstrate our commitment to the safety of the pharmaceutical supply chain. With that, I'll turn it over to Jason.\nJason Hollar: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with total company results, third quarter revenue increased 14% to $45 billion driven by sales growth from existing and net new pharma customers. Total gross margin was $1.7 billion a decrease of 7% due to the elevated supply chain costs in medical and the Cordis divestiture partially offset by generic program performance. Consolidated SG&A increased 2% to $1.1 billion reflecting higher operations expenses and previously anticipated IT investments, partially offset by the Cordis divestiture in cost savings initiatives. Third quarter operating earnings decreased 21% to $545 million, primarily reflecting the elevated supply chain costs in medical. Moving below the line, interest and other increased by $8 million, which reflects one-time gains and other income in the prior year, partially offset by lower interest expense from debt reduction actions. The third quarter effective tax rate finished at 20.1%, 11 percentage points lower than the prior year due to certain discrete items affecting both periods. Average diluted shares outstanding were 277 million, 6% lower than a year ago due to share repurchases. During the quarter, we initiated a $200 million share repurchase program which was completed in April and brings our year-to-date repurchases to $1 billion. The net result for the quarter was EPS of $1.45, a decline of 5%. In the quarter, we also recorded a $474 million non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge related to the medical segment, which is excluded from our non-GAAP results. This accounting charge reflects an increase in the discount rate used in our goodwill impairment analysis. Third quarter operating cash flow was a use of $490 million and we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.4 billion and no outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, in addition to expecting strong operating cash flow generation, we received the previously defined tax receivable of approximately $1 billion in April. Timing, including the day of the week in which any period ends, affects point in time cash flows and fiscal '22 is unfavorably affected by this dynamic. Additionally, we expect approximately $550 million in total litigation payments this year, primarily related to opioid settlements, which includes the initial payments for the national settlement already made. Now turning into segments beginning with pharma on Slide five. Revenue increased 17% to $41 billion, driven by branded pharmaceutical sales growth from existing and net new pharmaceutical distribution and specialty customers. Segment profit decreased 5% to $487 million driven by higher operations expenses and previously anticipated investments in technology enhancements, partially offset by generics program performance. During the quarter, we incurred higher costs supporting sales growth, including some initial customer onboarding costs and inflationary impacts in areas like transportation and labor. Importantly, we also completed the launch for our planned technology enhancements. As Mike mentioned, we continue to see resiliency in pharmaceutical demand and our generics program continued to experience generally consistent market dynamics including strong performance from Red Oak. Turning to medical on Slide six. Third quarter revenue decreased 7% to $3.9 billion due to the divestiture of the Cordis business and lower products and distribution volumes, which includes the impact of global supply chain constraints. Segment profit decreased 66% to $59 million, primarily due to net inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints in products and distribution. During the quarter, our U.S. medical products and distribution business continued to experience significant inflationary impacts across the global supply chain, particularly in the areas of international and domestic transportation and commodities. Additionally, increased pressures from global supply chain constraints affected the volume of some of our higher margin Cardinal Health brand products. To a lesser extent, the third quarter decline in segment profit also reflected a lower contribution from PPE as well as the Cordis divestiture. On PPE, we saw unfavorable price cost timing in the quarter as well as lower volumes as we exited the quarter. We were encouraged, however, by the resiliency in surgical product demand related to elective procedures, which was generally consistent with recent quarters and improved from a year ago. And we continue to see strong performance from our lab business. We continue to take actions to address the inflationary cost challenges and manage through the temporary supply disruptions including pricing adjustments, cutting costs throughout the organization, and investing in our supply chain network which Mike will elaborate on momentarily. Now, transitioning to our updated fiscal '22 outlook on Slide eight. We now expect EPS in the range of $5.15 to $5.25 per share, reflecting updated expectations for medical and a few of our corporate assumptions. With the favorability seem to-date from discrete items, we now expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 23%. We expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 281 million which reflects the $1 billion in share repurchases completed to-date. And with one quarter to go, we expect CapEx of approximately $400 million. We continue to expect interest and other in the range of $140 million to $160 million. As for the segments on Slide nine. For pharma, no changes to our outlook. We continue to expect low double-digit revenue growth, mid-single digit segment profit growth, and as previously indicated a strong fourth quarter segment profit growth. With the combination of our planned technology enhancements, we will now be lapping elevated expense levels from the initial deployment a year ago, which has been a year-over-year headwind last several quarters. We are also lapping a few one-time items that we called out last year, which will create a favorable fourth quarter comparison and we expect strong underlying performance in the quarter. For medical, we now expect revenue at the low end of our previous range down mid-single digits and segment profit to be down 45% to 55% in fiscal '22, which includes a net incremental headwind of nearly $300 million due to inflationary and global supply chain constraints. Additionally, based on volume trends, the update from our previous medical outlook primarily reflects a lower contribution from PPE. Now, let me spend some time sharing a few high-level thoughts on fiscal '23 from our vantage point today, ahead of providing our usual guidance in early August. In pharma, the business is tracking consistent with our long-term targets of low to mid-single digits segment profit growth. With respect to a couple of other notable pharma puts and takes for next year, we do anticipate higher operations expenses based on recent inflationary trends, particularly in the first half of the fiscal year. Additionally, with the finalization of the global opioid settlement, we anticipate lower opioid related legal costs partially offset by higher costs for implementation of the settlement\u2019s injunctive relief terms. Together, we expect these litigation items to be a modest net tailwind in fiscal '23. For reference, we are currently estimating opioid related legal costs of approximately $115 million in fiscal '22. We expect a further reduction in opioid related legal costs in subsequent years. In medical, we are highly focused on the inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints affecting our U.S. medical products and distribution business. At this time, we expect a similar to modestly higher net impact from inflation and global supply chain constraints in fiscal '23 as in fiscal '22. Embedded in these are two key assumptions. First, with visibility generally limited to the first half of the year, we are assuming key cost drivers such as international freight and commodities have flattened and will begin to decrease slowly over the course of the next fiscal year, affecting our results in a one to two quarter delay. This would result in a greater absolute impact from inflation and global supply chain constraints in fiscal '23 due to the amortization of higher costs in the second half of fiscal '22. Second, we also expect a greater impact for mitigation initiatives with various waves of price increases going into effect throughout the year. In total, these two assumptions result in a similar to modestly higher net impact from inflation and global supply chain constraints as in the current year. As we exit fiscal '23, we anticipate a run rate where our pricing actions will offset approximately half of the gross impact. Though these inflationary impacts are persisting for much longer than originally anticipated, we remain committed to mitigating the effects on our medical business over time. We continue to believe the majority of these impacts will prove temporary once global supply chain pressures eventually abate or pricing will adjust accordingly. Below the line, we anticipate a year-over-year headwind in our fiscal '23 effective tax rate with the discrete favorability seen in fiscal '22 not expected to repeat. And with our strong balance sheet, we see the potential for accretive capital deployment through a similar level of share repurchases over the course of the year, supported by the $2.7 billion of authorization remaining on our existing share repurchase program expiring at the end of 2024. In summary, while there's obviously moving parts for fiscal '23, or any particular year, we continue to believe our previously announced long-term targets for our businesses and for double-digit combined EPS growth and dividend yield are achievable over normalized longer periods. With that I'll turn it back over to Mike.\nMike Kaufmann: Thanks Jason. Let me elaborate on the actions we are taking to drive medical performance and maximize our differentiated strength. First, we're taking pricing actions, evolving our commercial contracting strategies, and focusing on driving mix across our global business. We have implemented a series of initial customer price increases on nine Cardinal Health brand product categories. We've also implemented fee increases for certain medical national brands suppliers, offset some of the elevated supply chain costs. We provide the most efficient and effective way for manufacturers to reach our customers and believe these increases help compensate us for the increased cost of providing this value. We have and will continue to be transparent and fair with customers and suppliers and focused on delivering on our service. As it relates to our products and distribution contracts, we are focusing on future pricing flexibility for factors beyond our control. To drive changes in mix, we're investing in new and innovative products to increase the breadth of our Cardinal Health brand product portfolio. One example of increased breadth is our recent launch of the first surgical incise drape using Avery Dennison\u2019s patented BeneHold CHG adhesive, which reduces risk of surgical site contamination, yet still removes easily after surgery without harming a patient's skin. Another example is our recently announced collaboration with the Innara Health, the industry leader in feeding development for newborns and premature infants to design our next generation NTrainer System, making it smaller, more intuitive, and easier to integrate into NICU feeding protocols. We are also investing to increase supply capacity, particularly within our protective surgical glove line, where we have increased our existing capacity by over 30% with a focus on long-term growth. We expect to invest over $125 million to expand our manufacturing footprint with the construction of a new facility dedicated to increase supply of our Protexis brand gloves and drive innovation in this important product portfolio. Second, we are simplifying our operating model and optimizing our international footprint. A year ago, we announced our intention to exit 36 market and those exits are now complete. We have also decided to exit another 10 markets where we see limited opportunity for long-term growth. Once complete, these actions will reduce our international commercial footprint by 50%, allowing us to focus on approximately 45 remaining markets where we are best positioned to serve. We are also optimizing our distribution network by consolidating less efficient facilities into larger modern, more efficient distribution centers to deliver improved service to our customers. For example, we recently announced plans to build a new approximately 600,000 square foot medical distribution center in Central Ohio, replacing a smaller facility nearby. This new facility along with others we have planning will improve service and quality, deliver operational efficiency and better support fluctuation in volume and labor. Additionally, our lab business is consolidating manufacturing and warehouse space into a new, larger 100,000 square foot facility. This move centralizes our high growth lab kitting services and supports significant expansion of our direct-to-consumer kitting capabilities. Third, in addition to investing in our core medical business, we continue to invest in our growth businesses at-Home Solution and Medical Services, which are aligned with industry trends. In at-Home Solutions, we continue to see strong demand as care continue to shift into the home. We recently partnered with Kinaxis to optimize digital supply chain planning, increased medical product visibility and supply chain agility. We're focusing initial implementation of Kinaxis rapid response platform with at home solutions with an expected completion date this summer. Furthermore, we've invested in a new warehouse management system across our at-Home Solutions Network, which we expect to roll out next week. This new infrastructure will improve labor planning based on demand, increased operating efficiencies to deliver on our commitments and streamline and standardize processes across our at-Home network. We're initiating a multi-year strategy to grow our warehouse footprint to our at-Home Solutions in target markets and we'll announce details for a new warehouse opening later this calendar year. And in our higher margin, technology enabled medical services businesses, OptiFreight Logistics and WaveMark, we've invested in additional technology capabilities to expand our offerings in both businesses. Turning to pharma, we continue to make progress on our two primary objectives. First, strengthening our core pharma distribution business. We have completed all deployments of our multi-year investment to modernize our pharmaceutical IT infrastructure in order to standardize operations, drive efficiencies and enhance the customer experience. These investments, including the automation of business procedures and real-time line of sight transparency for our employees and customers, will result in operational efficiencies and a more connected pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. We expect to benefit from the conversion in FY \u201923 and beyond. We're fueling our growth businesses, specialty, nuclear and outcomes. Especially, we continue to experience momentum in our oncology physician office business, driven in part by the Navista TS, our technology platform for value-based care. In March, we further expanded our Navista TS offering with the launch of decision path, a digital solution to help oncology practices lower costs, improve patient care and drive success and transitioning to value based care. Created by Fuse, our internal innovation engine, decision path is built into electronic health record workflow allowing oncologists easily compare cancer treatment options, both by clinical indication and cost at the point of care. And with biosimilars, we are well positioned to support the next phase of growth over the next several years as biosimilars expand into new therapeutic areas incisive care. We believe the next phase of growth in the biosimilars market will predominantly come from products with a greater retail or specialty pharmacy presence as more retail products with interchangeability come to market. Our significant scale and capabilities designed to support retail pharmacies uniquely positioned us to support and empower those pharmacists as they navigate the important operational complexities of managing multiple biosimilar launches against major reference products. Our Kinaxis digital services portal offers tailored solutions to help patients get on and stay on therapy. Patients who interact with our Kinaxis portal experience shorter time therapy for new patients and no gaps in therapy for existing patients. Digital reenrollment via the patient portal increased approvals within the first 30 days by 10% and delivered a retention rate greater than 90%. In our third-party logistics business, we have 166 manufactured contracts this fiscal year. So far, we have successfully launched 27 manufacturers and we expect [five to eight] [ph] additional launches by the end of the fiscal year. And specific to cell and gene therapy, we continue to win opportunities and have plans to launch five manufacturers in the coming years based on FDA approval and manufacture readiness. In Nuclear, we continue to see the benefits of our investments in Theranostics. Our center for Theranostics advancement and in Indianapolis continues to be in high demand with a number of new innovators and products we are collaboratively doubling in FY '22 versus the prior year. Our outcomes business continues to add new payers, PBM pharmaceutical manufacturers and expand clinical solutions for both independent pharmacies and retail chains. We have combined a reimbursement consulting solution and outcomes connect platforms into a single unified platform that offers reimbursement assistance, decision support and scheduling to identify and complete clinical opportunities. Across the enterprise, we continue to aggressively review our cost structure as we work to streamline, simplify, and strengthen our operations and execute our digital transformation. We're pairing these cost reduction efforts with balanced discipline and shareholder friendly capital allocation according to our priorities. Looking ahead, we're confident in our ability to achieve our long-term targets. Now let me give a little color on injunctive relief as part of the national opioid settlement. Injunctive relief relates to controlled substance anti-diversion efforts and includes enhancements to governance, independence and training of personnel, due diligence for new and existing customers, ordering limits for certain products and suspicious order monitoring. In addition, we and the two other settling distributors will engage a third-party vendor to act as a clearinghouse for data aggregation and reporting, which the distributors will fund for 10 years. These relief measures are intended to create additional transparency. And while there is additional costs, these initiatives demonstrate our commitment to being part of the solution to the U.S. opioid epidemic. In closing, what we do matters, we aspire to be healthcare's most trusted partner by delivering the products and solutions our customers need, advancing health care and improving lives. And now, Jason, and I will take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go ahead and take our first question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen.\nCharles Rhyee: Yes. Thanks for taking the question guys up. Like, obviously, it looks like there were a number of items here in the fiscal third quarter, particularly the pharma segment, and you highlighted that we're going to be lapping a number of these as in the fourth quarter and you're maintaining the fiscal '22 guide in that segment. Can you just remind us what those items are that we're lapping now? I know that technology investments you mentioned is one. But could you kind of help us size those so we get a better sense? And is that then the right kind of jump off point in the pharma segment as we look into '23. And then, part of that you mentioned higher sort of operational expense and you kind of maybe highlighted inflation hasn't like wage inflation. You kind of mentioned that should mostly just be in the first half of the year. Can you touch on why that might only be a half year impact and not just a new baseline? Thanks.\nJason Hollar: Yes. This is Jason. Let me go ahead and start. There's a number of questions. Hopefully, we can catch them all. So in terms of the IT enhancements, what we mentioned at the beginning of the year, and it's still very consistent with what we've seen rollout is about $80 million of incremental costs that we saw in '22 versus '21. And we indicated that would be spread somewhat evenly over the first three quarters of the fiscal year. So you can kind of think of roughly that 1/3rd per quarter is what we've been experiencing all year. First two quarters, we had other actions that drove growth above and beyond that headwind. But that was with the inflation included in the third quarter drove that 5% reduction. As it relates to the fourth quarter, the other unusual items -- beyond that lapping so there's very little year-over-year change as relates to IT enhancements in the fourth quarter. So that headwind goes away in Q4. But we also referenced last Q4' 21, that we had some unusual items that were adversely affecting us. So that becomes a year-over-year tailwind for us this Q4. And then in addition to that, we indicated here on the call today, just before this, that we're also seeing some volume underlying operational improvements that are expected for the fourth quarter that then would also continue on at that point. As it relates to inflation, what we saw here in the third quarter was elevated, it was a little bit higher than what we had expected. It is consistent with the range of our guidance. But nonetheless, it's an item that does impact our Q3 and we're expecting it to impact Q4. And then, carry over our comments for the first half of fiscal '23 are just presuming that costs will continue on at a similar elevated level and be a year-over-year headwind such that by the time we get to the second half of fiscal '23. It would then lap it at that point in time. Think I captured all your questions there.\nOperator: All right. We'll go ahead and take our next question from Eric Percher with Nephron Research.\nEric Percher: Thank you. I recognize you had some unprecedented headwinds, but throughout the guidance has appeared to assume stabilization or improvement. And so we've seen step downs of 100 to 125, 150, 175 and now 300. It sounds like for '23, you're trying to let us know that we're going to be lapping and it doesn't get better, though there are actions being taken. Can you give us a feel for what actions you would take if it turns out that things continue to get worse? And have you thought about the profitability of elements of the business what might need to change or even whether the business might be better positioned for rebound if it's a multi-year rebound under someone else's ownership?\nMike Kaufmann: Yes. I'll take that and then Jason can fill in if I've missed any of the components of that. Thanks for the question. So, yes, well, we had said last quarter, we expected 250 to 300 of incremental cost. And now we think it'll be nearly 300. So that's adjusting the inflation component of it up to 300. And then, you also heard Jason comment in his comments that we saw some, as we look forward into Q4, we see some PPE cost, timing, and PPE volume impacts for us in Q4, that will also be an incremental negative for '22. So that's what's in our updated guidance to go to the new 45 to 55 down versus where we were before. So that's the change of the two key items that changed there. Again, there was some small stuff we mentioned in pharma and all that, we believe it's manageable within the guidance for pharma. So no call out any changing guidance for pharma. But that's the drivers for what we chose in medical. As far as looking forward to '23, what we are trying to indicate is that we do believe, as we annualize, if you think about the inflation increase over the year, and it sits in our inventory for a while. So using the $300 million, obviously, we believe that will annualize to a greater number next year. And so inflation actually on an absolute basis, the total impact of inflation will be greater next year in '23, than it was in '22. That's what we were talking about there. But then on the flip side, we also already has implemented price increases some in March and additional ones, as I mentioned, that go into effect here, essentially, July 1, that as we look at those and additional price increases that we would intend to take during the year that we also will see a greater positive impact from price increases next year. So while inflation on absolute will go up, the positives that we will get from increased pricing will also go up. And the two of those will net to a similar to slightly down overall net impact next year in '23. So that's how we're thinking about it next year, as you can imagine, we're going to continue to focus on those items and where we have opportunities based on the market, based on the conditions in costing, we will take more price to market. And what Jason also said to be helpful, our goal is that when we exit the year, next year, we plan to have at least 50% of those inflated items offset through either pricing actions that we will have taken either both to manufacturers and to customers, or we will obviously have seen some of those costs come back down. So we do plan to exit at that level. So that's kind of financially, I guess, an overall summary of that. To your question around the medical business, we still continue to feel very good about this business. As I look at this business overall, yes, our medical products and distribution business is having some challenges, no doubt about it, obviously, with lowering guidance three times. But when we look across the rest of the portfolio, whether it be at home, OptiFreight, Lab, WaveMark, we continue to see very strong growth from all of those businesses. And we feel really good about those. We feel good about the actions that we're putting in place. As always, we're always constantly because I'll look at our portfolio and make adjustments as necessary, but we feel good about where we are with medical at this point in time.\nOperator: And we'll go ahead and move on to our next question from Michael Cherny with Bank of America.\nMichael Cherny: Good morning, and thanks for all the color. Mike, I want to dive in a little bit more about the comments you made tying into next year on medical. As we think about both the fiscal 3Q numbers and the implied fiscal 4Q guidance. Is that the right annualization and jumping off point as we think into next year and along those lines with the pieces that you've given us. Where do you see the dynamics, I know it's early, but around all these pieces coming together towards some level of EPS growth relative to long range planning. Jason hinted that you'll be below that. But should we expect to see EPS growth next year?\nJason Hollar: Yes. So let me start with that. This is Jason. And the 23 elements that we are providing here for medical entirely focused on the inflation component, that is clearly going to be the most significant item that we are focused on for both the current year and what we know will impact us this next year. We have not -- this is not a full comprehensive guidance. And this is not meant to be complete with all the moving pieces. As Mike indicated, we're very focused on all those growth businesses that he mentioned, there's going to be other operational elements that we'll be working through. And that will provide more color on. As it relates to inflation that $300 million impact this year, is by far the most significant item. And when we think about our long-term targets, the reason we use the phrase normalized is items like that $300 million do need to be adjusted. But as it relates to other moving pieces for fiscal '23, that will come at our normal guidance update next quarter.\nOperator: All right. We'll go ahead and take our next question from Lisa Gill, JP Morgan.\nLisa Gill: Hi. Thanks very much. Good morning. Staying on the medical supply side of the business, I just want to better understand just a couple of things. Mike, you talked about the opportunity now to mitigate some of this by taking some price increases. Is there any reason I mean; we've been talking about all of these headwinds and pressures for several quarters now? Is there any reason why one, you haven't been able to do that historically? And why now you'll be able to do it. And then secondly, can you maybe just talk about the competitive landscape? Is there anything in the competitive landscape that has prohibited you from taking mitigating price increases during this time?\nMike Kaufmann: Yes. Thanks for the question. So first of all, I would talk about it in two buckets. And as reminder, one, on the branded medical products, when we see price increases from those manufacturers, we are able to pass those through because it is like you're used to on the pharma side a cost-plus type of model. So whatever that cost is, we pass it on. So what we're talking about specifically here is the impact on Cardinal branded products, whether it be the Cardinal brand or Kendall, Curity, Kangaroo, all of our brands that we have, as we see input costs going up, whether that be transportation, ocean, freight, commodities, et cetera. Those are the types of things that are impacting. And so as again, as I think about the entire medical segment, remember, it is highly focused in this one area. As we look across the rest of the segment, we see really good progress on our initiatives and the various activities that we have going on. Specifically related to this to your point around taking pricing. As you know, taking pricing in this marketplace is complicated. First of all, you have to work not only with the actual customers themselves, but you also need to work with the GPOs and make sure that you are communicating what you intend to do when you'll do it, you have to give notice. Remember, in many cases, these are contracts that we have that could be multiyear contracts in place at a fixed price, because this is an industry that has historically not seen large fluctuations in pricing. It's been relatively stable in while you might see little things here and there. It's generally been very stable. And so the industry itself has been comfortable with doing longer term pricing. Obviously, that model needs to change going forward based on what we've seen in this hyperinflation environment that we're in that not only has occurred but seems to be lasting at least a little bit longer. And so this is about working with customers on redesigning the contracts, working with the GPOs working directly with the customers. We have been having those conversations. So we did take price increases on five categories, effective March 1. We recently added four more categories. This represents 1000s of SKUs. In fact, it's almost half of our Cardinal Health branded portfolio, we have now taken price on. And to your point, when we compete on products that's not just against the other distributors. And in fact, in most cases, it's against many other folks in the marketplace, including some of the branded suppliers. So we do have to understand what they are doing in the market and understanding how that as we raise prices, we still remain competitive in the best option for our customers.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yes. Hi. Good morning. So, couple of questions here. First of all, Mike, if we just step back, I think you talked in the prepared remarks about investing in building in a new facility in the medical segment. But if you really think back and we think about sort of the two segments that you have. Are there any synergies between drug distribution and medical segments in what is really the rationale to own a business on the medical side that has been underperforming for a very long time?\nMike Kaufmann: Thanks for the question. Appreciate it. Couple of things. As we've said before, we do see some synergies between M&P. We go to market together with our GPO selling teams. We share corporate overhead together. We work on our innovation and technology group. Together, we work together on back-office types of things. Clearly, acute care customers are common to both segments. We don't see as much synergy as between the large distribution businesses, obviously, because we maintained separate warehouses. And there's different needs for the customers there in terms of specific go-to-market strategies. But we do see it a lot with our complementary businesses. Our at-home business works with our pharma distribution business, our OptiFreight business works with them. So we do see working together there. So that being said, we do see opportunities, but as I've always said, we will always look at our portfolio. We will always look to see what is the best opportunity to create shareholder value. And so at this point in time, we feel good about where we are and where we're headed. But there's nothing off the table when it comes to looking forward in order to create value for shareholders.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI.\nElizabeth Anderson: Hi, guys, thanks so much for the question. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the medical utilization assumptions embedded in sort of 4Q and then your comments regarding 2023, both maybe on the surgical side and at-home volumes? Thanks.\nMike Kaufmann: Yes. Right now, what we're seeing is, we're seeing elective procedures be pretty similar to what we would say pre-COVID. Now, that's a hard phrase to use anymore and it's probably one we'll begin getting away from because trying to measure something that's now over two years old, with lots of puts and takes with new items and changes in the marketplace and everything else. It's a little hard to compare to something that old at this point in time. But roughly what we would say is that elective procedures in Q3 were pretty similar to the prior couple quarters prior to and similar levels to pre-COVID. We expect about the same for Q4 and are not really expecting any differences in '23 as far as that goes in either direction. We're not expecting that there's a big build-up of unmet needs that are going to fly through the system, or vice versa, that we should see a significant reduction. Now, obviously, that could change if there's a flare up with COVID or something like that. But right now, we don't see anything at this point in time that we would forecast for the rest of this year next year as it relates to differences in elective procedures.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.\nGeorge Hill: Yes. Good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the question. Jason, the med surg business, I'm going to stay on this one did about 60 million in EBIT in Q3. And that's kind of the midpoint of the Q4 guide. But as we think about your fiscal '23 comments, we know that inflation is building, and the impact tends to lag. I guess is the right way to think about med surg in fiscal '23, this is kind of the jumping off like the back half of fiscal '22 almost overstates the operating earnings run rate of the business. I guess I'm trying to get a sense of the magnitude of how far down it can go in fiscal '23. And to what degree can pricing initiatives kind of offset that?\nJason Hollar: Yes. The area I can probably be a little more helpful is on the timing associated with that the impact of that inflation from a year-over-year perspective will be more unfavorable in the first half of the year. If you think about what we had in fiscal '22, Q1 had much less of an impact actually hitting the P&L, we had seen the cost start to come -- start to build in terms of what was procured, but what actually hit the P&L escalated much more greatly in the second quarter and as increased from there in Q3 and Q4. So that comparison from a year-over-year perspective will be unfavorable for those elements, all things being equal. But given the magnitude of what we're talking about, I would expect that to be one of the more significant items, especially in Q1. And then, as we get to the back half of the year, as I indicated in my comments and Mike reiterated a few moments ago, with the expectation that we are able to offset about half of the run rate at the end of the fiscal year as we jump into '24, that would imply especially over the second half of the year, that would be trending more favorably, and then we would have a much more of a tailwind associated with those items. There are always other moving items within each year in our guidance. As you go back and look at all of our commentary this year, there have not been too many significant items referenced other than inflation. So this one singular item is going to be the key driver of the year-over-year results for the medical business next year. There will be other color, of course back to the growth businesses and other changes in underlying assumptions. But this will be driving the underlying performance for the segments very significantly from a year-over-year perspective. Again, in a general similar magnitude, perhaps, a modest headwind associated with it, based upon those underlying assumptions.\nOperator: And your next question comes from AJ Rice with Credit Suisse.\nAJ Rice: Hi, everybody. Thanks. Just on the medical, I don't think you've given in a while, how much of the revenues there is Cardinal branded products at this point, roughly. And then, as you're talking about the offset that will come from pricing -- your price increases, offsetting about 50% by the end of next year of fiscal year. Are there any other things that are meaningful that could be impactful? I mean, I don't know diversification of sourcing, maybe toggling back and forth in the Cardinal brand and products. Anything else beyond just pushing through price increases? Or are we basically waiting for the backdrop to improve from a macro perspective?\nMike Kaufmann: Yes. We don't -- we have not given any actual mixed percentages in terms of how much of our volume is Cardinal Health brand versus others. So I can't do that at this point in time. But what I will say is that there's opportunity for growth there. We know that's an area that we're excited about. We continue to put things in place like working on our incentives for our sales force, expanding our product line to have more items to drive mix to what you heard in my comments on what our project is doing with Avery Dennison and Innara Health. So we're both looking to expand the line as well as drive the mix through our sales reps and continuing to work with customers. So while we don't give it, it's an area where we do see some real opportunity going forward to grow. As far as other things to your point. So yes, number one is going to be pricing to customers that's going to be an issue. I also mentioned that we are taking fee changes to our manufacturing partners to increase the fees. Our costs, as we said have gone up, the service that we provide to manufacturers we believe is their best option to be able to get to market and get to the customers that we service. We want to obviously be fair with them and be a great and trusted partner. But we do need to make sure we're charging fairly for our services. So we have and our taking fee changes to those manufacturing partners that we have on the medical side in order to help compensate us for the great service that we drive there. We continue to look at our cost side of the business. We continue to feel good about our $750 million cost takeout and we're continuing to look at opportunities to be even more aggressive on that and we will continue to do that going forward. And then, in our growth businesses and focusing on those growth businesses, whether it be at-home or OptiFreight or Lab, we're continuing to make investments, as I noticed, noted around what we're doing with our lab business and a new facility to grow, that we've got some IT rollout of some new systems and OptiFreight and in our at-home business that are going to both improve our costs and increase our offerings. So those are the ways that we're going to be getting after over the next year and over the following years to grow this business.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Eric Coldwell with Baird.\nEric Coldwell: Hey, thank you. Good morning. I wanted to go back to the first question. I think it was Charles asked the pharma comp in 4Q '21. You identified some good guys from last year, you have not given more specifics today on what those are, I think, we're all pretty hectic with earnings and everything else a lot changed in last year. Can you just remind us what those items were in the fourth quarter of '21 that were that were bad guys? And how much they were? So we know what the year-over-year good guy comp is going into this quarter? And then, are there any new good guys, things the street wouldn't know about? That you know are going to hit in the fourth quarter that get you to your pharma profit margin target. Thanks very much.\nJason Hollar: Yes. The primary item that we referenced last Q4 was inventory adjustments. We did not provide any specific number; I think we might have referenced modest. And so it was a reasonable number that you can look at the growth rates there and how that was impacted to provide a range. The key again, was that we no longer have the headwinds of that 20 million, 30 million per quarter that we've seen over the first three quarters related to the IT enhancements. And then, we have had some incremental volume through, we referenced some net new customer volume within the pharma business that started to ramp up in the third quarter and is more significant in the fourth quarter. And those will be the most significant items that drive at year-over-year.\nOperator: And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Steven Valiquette with Barclays.\nSteven Valiquette: Great thanks. So regarding the elevated operating expenses in the pharma segment exiting '22, and into the first half of fiscal '23. I guess it's still not clear, which elevated cost categories you're able to pass through to customers, versus which ones you're absorbing in your own margins, when thinking about fuel costs, other transportation costs, higher labor expense, et cetera. So I guess just to confirm in which cost categories, are you seeing the greatest increase in the operating expenses that you're not able to pass through to the pharma customers? Thanks.\nMike Kaufmann: Yes. I would say in general, the majority of these are not items that we can pass through, there are opportunities on fuel surcharges for sure, as those remain elevated to pass those through. But I would remind you, there was a couple other things. Some of these costs were also focused more on the third quarter such as we did roll out just a few weekends ago, the final rollout of our multiyear [PMOD] [ph] project. So we've had some rollout costs and some making sure that we do that right. In the quarter, we onboard some new customers during the quarter, and there's some initial costs there that we also incurred during the quarter. So I would say that the bucket is, there's a small amount that's passed through to the customers. There's another part that's a little bit, I would say temporary in the third quarter because they were unique to some work we're doing in the quarter, the majority is elevated transportation costs, that we do see more permanent for at least for a while until it begins to come back down across the portfolio and those are not able to be passed on. That being said, when we look at the level those the amount of costs we're taking out of the business. That's why we're still comfortable with reiterating our overall guidance for pharma that while they are somewhat elevated in the third quarter, there's something that we would expect and are continuing to address going forward to manage the both our guidance for this year as well as still feel confident about our longer-term guidance as it relates to Pharma.\nJason Hollar: And just to be really clear in this point. We're not talking about any type of product cost inflation that's flowing through pharma business that is very much captured in the pass through.\nOperator: And it appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Kaufmann, I would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.\nMike Kaufmann: Just want to thank everybody for their time to be on the call today and I appreciate all the questions. I will just reiterate that we are taking action to mitigate these inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints. And we're focused on driving improved performance across all of our businesses. Take care and I hope to talk to all of you soon. Bye-bye.\nOperator: That concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mike Kaufmann",
            "content": "Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results reflect continued inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints. As we continue to manage through the current macroeconomic environment, we remain focused on both near-term priority and long-term strategies to drive growth and momentum across our businesses. At an enterprise level, we're maintaining our focus on our three strategic priorities, optimizing our core businesses, investing for growth and innovation, and deploying capital efficiently. In pharma, despite the quarter being a little lower, due to higher operations costs, we remain encouraged by the trajectory of the business. We saw resiliency and overall pharmaceutical demand, strong performance in our generics program and continue to expect pharma to realize mid-single digit profit growth in FY '22. In medical, our core U.S. medical products and distribution business continues to experience unprecedented inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints. We continue to take action to mitigate the effects of these global challenges on our business, including taking pricing actions, evolving our commercial contracting strategies, and investing in additional supply chain capacity. While we remain confident these actions will deliver value and are encouraged by the other areas of our medical business and our opportunities for long-term growth, the current environment remains highly dynamic. Our updated outlook for FY '22 reflects our most current expectation. I'll elaborate on the actions we're taking to drive performance, particularly in medical after Jason reviews our third quarter results and updated outlook. Before turning the discussion over to Jason, it's important to note that the opioid settlement agreement was finalized during the quarter and became effective on April 2. This is an important and significant step forward for our company. We build a settlement is the best way to deliver relief to communities across the United States and allow our company to move forward by putting 1000s of lawsuits behind us. 46 of 49 eligible states, all six eligible territories and over 98% of litigating political subdivisions are part of the national agreement. This comprehensive agreement will settle the vast majority of the opioid lawsuits filed by state and local governmental entities. Additionally, we recently reached an agreement with the State of Washington and its participating subdivisions to resolve opioid-related claims on similar terms to the broader settlement, bringing the total number of states with which we have settled the 47 out of 49. While the settlements do not cover all opioid related claims, these comprehensive agreements are a significant milestone toward achieving broad resolution of governmental opioid claims, and include injunctive relief terms designed, in part to increase transparency for the supply chain to these products and demonstrate our commitment to the safety of the pharmaceutical supply chain. With that, I'll turn it over to Jason. Thanks Jason. Let me elaborate on the actions we are taking to drive medical performance and maximize our differentiated strength. First, we're taking pricing actions, evolving our commercial contracting strategies, and focusing on driving mix across our global business. We have implemented a series of initial customer price increases on nine Cardinal Health brand product categories. We've also implemented fee increases for certain medical national brands suppliers, offset some of the elevated supply chain costs. We provide the most efficient and effective way for manufacturers to reach our customers and believe these increases help compensate us for the increased cost of providing this value. We have and will continue to be transparent and fair with customers and suppliers and focused on delivering on our service. As it relates to our products and distribution contracts, we are focusing on future pricing flexibility for factors beyond our control. To drive changes in mix, we're investing in new and innovative products to increase the breadth of our Cardinal Health brand product portfolio. One example of increased breadth is our recent launch of the first surgical incise drape using Avery Dennison's patented BeneHold CHG adhesive, which reduces risk of surgical site contamination, yet still removes easily after surgery without harming a patient's skin. Another example is our recently announced collaboration with the Innara Health, the industry leader in feeding development for newborns and premature infants to design our next generation NTrainer System, making it smaller, more intuitive, and easier to integrate into NICU feeding protocols. We are also investing to increase supply capacity, particularly within our protective surgical glove line, where we have increased our existing capacity by over 30% with a focus on long-term growth. We expect to invest over $125 million to expand our manufacturing footprint with the construction of a new facility dedicated to increase supply of our Protexis brand gloves and drive innovation in this important product portfolio. Second, we are simplifying our operating model and optimizing our international footprint. A year ago, we announced our intention to exit 36 market and those exits are now complete. We have also decided to exit another 10 markets where we see limited opportunity for long-term growth. Once complete, these actions will reduce our international commercial footprint by 50%, allowing us to focus on approximately 45 remaining markets where we are best positioned to serve. We are also optimizing our distribution network by consolidating less efficient facilities into larger modern, more efficient distribution centers to deliver improved service to our customers. For example, we recently announced plans to build a new approximately 600,000 square foot medical distribution center in Central Ohio, replacing a smaller facility nearby. This new facility along with others we have planning will improve service and quality, deliver operational efficiency and better support fluctuation in volume and labor. Additionally, our lab business is consolidating manufacturing and warehouse space into a new, larger 100,000 square foot facility. This move centralizes our high growth lab kitting services and supports significant expansion of our direct-to-consumer kitting capabilities. Third, in addition to investing in our core medical business, we continue to invest in our growth businesses at-Home Solution and Medical Services, which are aligned with industry trends. In at-Home Solutions, we continue to see strong demand as care continue to shift into the home. We recently partnered with Kinaxis to optimize digital supply chain planning, increased medical product visibility and supply chain agility. We're focusing initial implementation of Kinaxis rapid response platform with at home solutions with an expected completion date this summer. Furthermore, we've invested in a new warehouse management system across our at-Home Solutions Network, which we expect to roll out next week. This new infrastructure will improve labor planning based on demand, increased operating efficiencies to deliver on our commitments and streamline and standardize processes across our at-Home network. We're initiating a multi-year strategy to grow our warehouse footprint to our at-Home Solutions in target markets and we'll announce details for a new warehouse opening later this calendar year. And in our higher margin, technology enabled medical services businesses, OptiFreight Logistics and WaveMark, we've invested in additional technology capabilities to expand our offerings in both businesses. Turning to pharma, we continue to make progress on our two primary objectives. First, strengthening our core pharma distribution business. We have completed all deployments of our multi-year investment to modernize our pharmaceutical IT infrastructure in order to standardize operations, drive efficiencies and enhance the customer experience. These investments, including the automation of business procedures and real-time line of sight transparency for our employees and customers, will result in operational efficiencies and a more connected pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. We expect to benefit from the conversion in FY '23 and beyond. We're fueling our growth businesses, specialty, nuclear and outcomes. Especially, we continue to experience momentum in our oncology physician office business, driven in part by the Navista TS, our technology platform for value-based care. In March, we further expanded our Navista TS offering with the launch of decision path, a digital solution to help oncology practices lower costs, improve patient care and drive success and transitioning to value based care. Created by Fuse, our internal innovation engine, decision path is built into electronic health record workflow allowing oncologists easily compare cancer treatment options, both by clinical indication and cost at the point of care. And with biosimilars, we are well positioned to support the next phase of growth over the next several years as biosimilars expand into new therapeutic areas incisive care. We believe the next phase of growth in the biosimilars market will predominantly come from products with a greater retail or specialty pharmacy presence as more retail products with interchangeability come to market. Our significant scale and capabilities designed to support retail pharmacies uniquely positioned us to support and empower those pharmacists as they navigate the important operational complexities of managing multiple biosimilar launches against major reference products. Our Kinaxis digital services portal offers tailored solutions to help patients get on and stay on therapy. Patients who interact with our Kinaxis portal experience shorter time therapy for new patients and no gaps in therapy for existing patients. Digital reenrollment via the patient portal increased approvals within the first 30 days by 10% and delivered a retention rate greater than 90%. In our third-party logistics business, we have 166 manufactured contracts this fiscal year. So far, we have successfully launched 27 manufacturers and we expect [five to eight] [ph] additional launches by the end of the fiscal year. And specific to cell and gene therapy, we continue to win opportunities and have plans to launch five manufacturers in the coming years based on FDA approval and manufacture readiness. In Nuclear, we continue to see the benefits of our investments in Theranostics. Our center for Theranostics advancement and in Indianapolis continues to be in high demand with a number of new innovators and products we are collaboratively doubling in FY '22 versus the prior year. Our outcomes business continues to add new payers, PBM pharmaceutical manufacturers and expand clinical solutions for both independent pharmacies and retail chains. We have combined a reimbursement consulting solution and outcomes connect platforms into a single unified platform that offers reimbursement assistance, decision support and scheduling to identify and complete clinical opportunities. Across the enterprise, we continue to aggressively review our cost structure as we work to streamline, simplify, and strengthen our operations and execute our digital transformation. We're pairing these cost reduction efforts with balanced discipline and shareholder friendly capital allocation according to our priorities. Looking ahead, we're confident in our ability to achieve our long-term targets. Now let me give a little color on injunctive relief as part of the national opioid settlement. Injunctive relief relates to controlled substance anti-diversion efforts and includes enhancements to governance, independence and training of personnel, due diligence for new and existing customers, ordering limits for certain products and suspicious order monitoring. In addition, we and the two other settling distributors will engage a third-party vendor to act as a clearinghouse for data aggregation and reporting, which the distributors will fund for 10 years. These relief measures are intended to create additional transparency. And while there is additional costs, these initiatives demonstrate our commitment to being part of the solution to the U.S. opioid epidemic. In closing, what we do matters, we aspire to be healthcare's most trusted partner by delivering the products and solutions our customers need, advancing health care and improving lives. And now, Jason, and I will take your questions. Yes. I'll take that and then Jason can fill in if I've missed any of the components of that. Thanks for the question. So, yes, well, we had said last quarter, we expected 250 to 300 of incremental cost. And now we think it'll be nearly 300. So that's adjusting the inflation component of it up to 300. And then, you also heard Jason comment in his comments that we saw some, as we look forward into Q4, we see some PPE cost, timing, and PPE volume impacts for us in Q4, that will also be an incremental negative for '22. So that's what's in our updated guidance to go to the new 45 to 55 down versus where we were before. So that's the change of the two key items that changed there. Again, there was some small stuff we mentioned in pharma and all that, we believe it's manageable within the guidance for pharma. So no call out any changing guidance for pharma. But that's the drivers for what we chose in medical. As far as looking forward to '23, what we are trying to indicate is that we do believe, as we annualize, if you think about the inflation increase over the year, and it sits in our inventory for a while. So using the $300 million, obviously, we believe that will annualize to a greater number next year. And so inflation actually on an absolute basis, the total impact of inflation will be greater next year in '23, than it was in '22. That's what we were talking about there. But then on the flip side, we also already has implemented price increases some in March and additional ones, as I mentioned, that go into effect here, essentially, July 1, that as we look at those and additional price increases that we would intend to take during the year that we also will see a greater positive impact from price increases next year. So while inflation on absolute will go up, the positives that we will get from increased pricing will also go up. And the two of those will net to a similar to slightly down overall net impact next year in '23. So that's how we're thinking about it next year, as you can imagine, we're going to continue to focus on those items and where we have opportunities based on the market, based on the conditions in costing, we will take more price to market. And what Jason also said to be helpful, our goal is that when we exit the year, next year, we plan to have at least 50% of those inflated items offset through either pricing actions that we will have taken either both to manufacturers and to customers, or we will obviously have seen some of those costs come back down. So we do plan to exit at that level. So that's kind of financially, I guess, an overall summary of that. To your question around the medical business, we still continue to feel very good about this business. As I look at this business overall, yes, our medical products and distribution business is having some challenges, no doubt about it, obviously, with lowering guidance three times. But when we look across the rest of the portfolio, whether it be at home, OptiFreight, Lab, WaveMark, we continue to see very strong growth from all of those businesses. And we feel really good about those. We feel good about the actions that we're putting in place. As always, we're always constantly because I'll look at our portfolio and make adjustments as necessary, but we feel good about where we are with medical at this point in time. Yes. Thanks for the question. So first of all, I would talk about it in two buckets. And as reminder, one, on the branded medical products, when we see price increases from those manufacturers, we are able to pass those through because it is like you're used to on the pharma side a cost-plus type of model. So whatever that cost is, we pass it on. So what we're talking about specifically here is the impact on Cardinal branded products, whether it be the Cardinal brand or Kendall, Curity, Kangaroo, all of our brands that we have, as we see input costs going up, whether that be transportation, ocean, freight, commodities, et cetera. Those are the types of things that are impacting. And so as again, as I think about the entire medical segment, remember, it is highly focused in this one area. As we look across the rest of the segment, we see really good progress on our initiatives and the various activities that we have going on. Specifically related to this to your point around taking pricing. As you know, taking pricing in this marketplace is complicated. First of all, you have to work not only with the actual customers themselves, but you also need to work with the GPOs and make sure that you are communicating what you intend to do when you'll do it, you have to give notice. Remember, in many cases, these are contracts that we have that could be multiyear contracts in place at a fixed price, because this is an industry that has historically not seen large fluctuations in pricing. It's been relatively stable in while you might see little things here and there. It's generally been very stable. And so the industry itself has been comfortable with doing longer term pricing. Obviously, that model needs to change going forward based on what we've seen in this hyperinflation environment that we're in that not only has occurred but seems to be lasting at least a little bit longer. And so this is about working with customers on redesigning the contracts, working with the GPOs working directly with the customers. We have been having those conversations. So we did take price increases on five categories, effective March 1. We recently added four more categories. This represents 1000s of SKUs. In fact, it's almost half of our Cardinal Health branded portfolio, we have now taken price on. And to your point, when we compete on products that's not just against the other distributors. And in fact, in most cases, it's against many other folks in the marketplace, including some of the branded suppliers. So we do have to understand what they are doing in the market and understanding how that as we raise prices, we still remain competitive in the best option for our customers. Thanks for the question. Appreciate it. Couple of things. As we've said before, we do see some synergies between M&P. We go to market together with our GPO selling teams. We share corporate overhead together. We work on our innovation and technology group. Together, we work together on back-office types of things. Clearly, acute care customers are common to both segments. We don't see as much synergy as between the large distribution businesses, obviously, because we maintained separate warehouses. And there's different needs for the customers there in terms of specific go-to-market strategies. But we do see it a lot with our complementary businesses. Our at-home business works with our pharma distribution business, our OptiFreight business works with them. So we do see working together there. So that being said, we do see opportunities, but as I've always said, we will always look at our portfolio. We will always look to see what is the best opportunity to create shareholder value. And so at this point in time, we feel good about where we are and where we're headed. But there's nothing off the table when it comes to looking forward in order to create value for shareholders. Yes. Right now, what we're seeing is, we're seeing elective procedures be pretty similar to what we would say pre-COVID. Now, that's a hard phrase to use anymore and it's probably one we'll begin getting away from because trying to measure something that's now over two years old, with lots of puts and takes with new items and changes in the marketplace and everything else. It's a little hard to compare to something that old at this point in time. But roughly what we would say is that elective procedures in Q3 were pretty similar to the prior couple quarters prior to and similar levels to pre-COVID. We expect about the same for Q4 and are not really expecting any differences in '23 as far as that goes in either direction. We're not expecting that there's a big build-up of unmet needs that are going to fly through the system, or vice versa, that we should see a significant reduction. Now, obviously, that could change if there's a flare up with COVID or something like that. But right now, we don't see anything at this point in time that we would forecast for the rest of this year next year as it relates to differences in elective procedures. Yes. We don't -- we have not given any actual mixed percentages in terms of how much of our volume is Cardinal Health brand versus others. So I can't do that at this point in time. But what I will say is that there's opportunity for growth there. We know that's an area that we're excited about. We continue to put things in place like working on our incentives for our sales force, expanding our product line to have more items to drive mix to what you heard in my comments on what our project is doing with Avery Dennison and Innara Health. So we're both looking to expand the line as well as drive the mix through our sales reps and continuing to work with customers. So while we don't give it, it's an area where we do see some real opportunity going forward to grow. As far as other things to your point. So yes, number one is going to be pricing to customers that's going to be an issue. I also mentioned that we are taking fee changes to our manufacturing partners to increase the fees. Our costs, as we said have gone up, the service that we provide to manufacturers we believe is their best option to be able to get to market and get to the customers that we service. We want to obviously be fair with them and be a great and trusted partner. But we do need to make sure we're charging fairly for our services. So we have and our taking fee changes to those manufacturing partners that we have on the medical side in order to help compensate us for the great service that we drive there. We continue to look at our cost side of the business. We continue to feel good about our $750 million cost takeout and we're continuing to look at opportunities to be even more aggressive on that and we will continue to do that going forward. And then, in our growth businesses and focusing on those growth businesses, whether it be at-home or OptiFreight or Lab, we're continuing to make investments, as I noticed, noted around what we're doing with our lab business and a new facility to grow, that we've got some IT rollout of some new systems and OptiFreight and in our at-home business that are going to both improve our costs and increase our offerings. So those are the ways that we're going to be getting after over the next year and over the following years to grow this business. Yes. I would say in general, the majority of these are not items that we can pass through, there are opportunities on fuel surcharges for sure, as those remain elevated to pass those through. But I would remind you, there was a couple other things. Some of these costs were also focused more on the third quarter such as we did roll out just a few weekends ago, the final rollout of our multiyear [PMOD] [ph] project. So we've had some rollout costs and some making sure that we do that right. In the quarter, we onboard some new customers during the quarter, and there's some initial costs there that we also incurred during the quarter. So I would say that the bucket is, there's a small amount that's passed through to the customers. There's another part that's a little bit, I would say temporary in the third quarter because they were unique to some work we're doing in the quarter, the majority is elevated transportation costs, that we do see more permanent for at least for a while until it begins to come back down across the portfolio and those are not able to be passed on. That being said, when we look at the level those the amount of costs we're taking out of the business. That's why we're still comfortable with reiterating our overall guidance for pharma that while they are somewhat elevated in the third quarter, there's something that we would expect and are continuing to address going forward to manage the both our guidance for this year as well as still feel confident about our longer-term guidance as it relates to Pharma. Just want to thank everybody for their time to be on the call today and I appreciate all the questions. I will just reiterate that we are taking action to mitigate these inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints. And we're focused on driving improved performance across all of our businesses. Take care and I hope to talk to all of you soon. Bye-bye."

            "name": "Jason Hollar",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with total company results, third quarter revenue increased 14% to $45 billion driven by sales growth from existing and net new pharma customers. Total gross margin was $1.7 billion a decrease of 7% due to the elevated supply chain costs in medical and the Cordis divestiture partially offset by generic program performance. Consolidated SG&A increased 2% to $1.1 billion reflecting higher operations expenses and previously anticipated IT investments, partially offset by the Cordis divestiture in cost savings initiatives. Third quarter operating earnings decreased 21% to $545 million, primarily reflecting the elevated supply chain costs in medical. Moving below the line, interest and other increased by $8 million, which reflects one-time gains and other income in the prior year, partially offset by lower interest expense from debt reduction actions. The third quarter effective tax rate finished at 20.1%, 11 percentage points lower than the prior year due to certain discrete items affecting both periods. Average diluted shares outstanding were 277 million, 6% lower than a year ago due to share repurchases. During the quarter, we initiated a $200 million share repurchase program which was completed in April and brings our year-to-date repurchases to $1 billion. The net result for the quarter was EPS of $1.45, a decline of 5%. In the quarter, we also recorded a $474 million non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge related to the medical segment, which is excluded from our non-GAAP results. This accounting charge reflects an increase in the discount rate used in our goodwill impairment analysis. Third quarter operating cash flow was a use of $490 million and we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.4 billion and no outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, in addition to expecting strong operating cash flow generation, we received the previously defined tax receivable of approximately $1 billion in April. Timing, including the day of the week in which any period ends, affects point in time cash flows and fiscal '22 is unfavorably affected by this dynamic. Additionally, we expect approximately $550 million in total litigation payments this year, primarily related to opioid settlements, which includes the initial payments for the national settlement already made. Now turning into segments beginning with pharma on Slide five. Revenue increased 17% to $41 billion, driven by branded pharmaceutical sales growth from existing and net new pharmaceutical distribution and specialty customers. Segment profit decreased 5% to $487 million driven by higher operations expenses and previously anticipated investments in technology enhancements, partially offset by generics program performance. During the quarter, we incurred higher costs supporting sales growth, including some initial customer onboarding costs and inflationary impacts in areas like transportation and labor. Importantly, we also completed the launch for our planned technology enhancements. As Mike mentioned, we continue to see resiliency in pharmaceutical demand and our generics program continued to experience generally consistent market dynamics including strong performance from Red Oak. Turning to medical on Slide six. Third quarter revenue decreased 7% to $3.9 billion due to the divestiture of the Cordis business and lower products and distribution volumes, which includes the impact of global supply chain constraints. Segment profit decreased 66% to $59 million, primarily due to net inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints in products and distribution. During the quarter, our U.S. medical products and distribution business continued to experience significant inflationary impacts across the global supply chain, particularly in the areas of international and domestic transportation and commodities. Additionally, increased pressures from global supply chain constraints affected the volume of some of our higher margin Cardinal Health brand products. To a lesser extent, the third quarter decline in segment profit also reflected a lower contribution from PPE as well as the Cordis divestiture. On PPE, we saw unfavorable price cost timing in the quarter as well as lower volumes as we exited the quarter. We were encouraged, however, by the resiliency in surgical product demand related to elective procedures, which was generally consistent with recent quarters and improved from a year ago. And we continue to see strong performance from our lab business. We continue to take actions to address the inflationary cost challenges and manage through the temporary supply disruptions including pricing adjustments, cutting costs throughout the organization, and investing in our supply chain network which Mike will elaborate on momentarily. Now, transitioning to our updated fiscal '22 outlook on Slide eight. We now expect EPS in the range of $5.15 to $5.25 per share, reflecting updated expectations for medical and a few of our corporate assumptions. With the favorability seem to-date from discrete items, we now expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 23%. We expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 281 million which reflects the $1 billion in share repurchases completed to-date. And with one quarter to go, we expect CapEx of approximately $400 million. We continue to expect interest and other in the range of $140 million to $160 million. As for the segments on Slide nine. For pharma, no changes to our outlook. We continue to expect low double-digit revenue growth, mid-single digit segment profit growth, and as previously indicated a strong fourth quarter segment profit growth. With the combination of our planned technology enhancements, we will now be lapping elevated expense levels from the initial deployment a year ago, which has been a year-over-year headwind last several quarters. We are also lapping a few one-time items that we called out last year, which will create a favorable fourth quarter comparison and we expect strong underlying performance in the quarter. For medical, we now expect revenue at the low end of our previous range down mid-single digits and segment profit to be down 45% to 55% in fiscal '22, which includes a net incremental headwind of nearly $300 million due to inflationary and global supply chain constraints. Additionally, based on volume trends, the update from our previous medical outlook primarily reflects a lower contribution from PPE. Now, let me spend some time sharing a few high-level thoughts on fiscal '23 from our vantage point today, ahead of providing our usual guidance in early August. In pharma, the business is tracking consistent with our long-term targets of low to mid-single digits segment profit growth. With respect to a couple of other notable pharma puts and takes for next year, we do anticipate higher operations expenses based on recent inflationary trends, particularly in the first half of the fiscal year. Additionally, with the finalization of the global opioid settlement, we anticipate lower opioid related legal costs partially offset by higher costs for implementation of the settlement's injunctive relief terms. Together, we expect these litigation items to be a modest net tailwind in fiscal '23. For reference, we are currently estimating opioid related legal costs of approximately $115 million in fiscal '22. We expect a further reduction in opioid related legal costs in subsequent years. In medical, we are highly focused on the inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints affecting our U.S. medical products and distribution business. At this time, we expect a similar to modestly higher net impact from inflation and global supply chain constraints in fiscal '23 as in fiscal '22. Embedded in these are two key assumptions. First, with visibility generally limited to the first half of the year, we are assuming key cost drivers such as international freight and commodities have flattened and will begin to decrease slowly over the course of the next fiscal year, affecting our results in a one to two quarter delay. This would result in a greater absolute impact from inflation and global supply chain constraints in fiscal '23 due to the amortization of higher costs in the second half of fiscal '22. Second, we also expect a greater impact for mitigation initiatives with various waves of price increases going into effect throughout the year. In total, these two assumptions result in a similar to modestly higher net impact from inflation and global supply chain constraints as in the current year. As we exit fiscal '23, we anticipate a run rate where our pricing actions will offset approximately half of the gross impact. Though these inflationary impacts are persisting for much longer than originally anticipated, we remain committed to mitigating the effects on our medical business over time. We continue to believe the majority of these impacts will prove temporary once global supply chain pressures eventually abate or pricing will adjust accordingly. Below the line, we anticipate a year-over-year headwind in our fiscal '23 effective tax rate with the discrete favorability seen in fiscal '22 not expected to repeat. And with our strong balance sheet, we see the potential for accretive capital deployment through a similar level of share repurchases over the course of the year, supported by the $2.7 billion of authorization remaining on our existing share repurchase program expiring at the end of 2024. In summary, while there's obviously moving parts for fiscal '23, or any particular year, we continue to believe our previously announced long-term targets for our businesses and for double-digit combined EPS growth and dividend yield are achievable over normalized longer periods. With that I'll turn it back over to Mike. Yes. This is Jason. Let me go ahead and start. There's a number of questions. Hopefully, we can catch them all. So in terms of the IT enhancements, what we mentioned at the beginning of the year, and it's still very consistent with what we've seen rollout is about $80 million of incremental costs that we saw in '22 versus '21. And we indicated that would be spread somewhat evenly over the first three quarters of the fiscal year. So you can kind of think of roughly that 1/3rd per quarter is what we've been experiencing all year. First two quarters, we had other actions that drove growth above and beyond that headwind. But that was with the inflation included in the third quarter drove that 5% reduction. As it relates to the fourth quarter, the other unusual items -- beyond that lapping so there's very little year-over-year change as relates to IT enhancements in the fourth quarter. So that headwind goes away in Q4. But we also referenced last Q4' 21, that we had some unusual items that were adversely affecting us. So that becomes a year-over-year tailwind for us this Q4. And then in addition to that, we indicated here on the call today, just before this, that we're also seeing some volume underlying operational improvements that are expected for the fourth quarter that then would also continue on at that point. As it relates to inflation, what we saw here in the third quarter was elevated, it was a little bit higher than what we had expected. It is consistent with the range of our guidance. But nonetheless, it's an item that does impact our Q3 and we're expecting it to impact Q4. And then, carry over our comments for the first half of fiscal '23 are just presuming that costs will continue on at a similar elevated level and be a year-over-year headwind such that by the time we get to the second half of fiscal '23. It would then lap it at that point in time. Think I captured all your questions there. Yes. So let me start with that. This is Jason. And the 23 elements that we are providing here for medical entirely focused on the inflation component, that is clearly going to be the most significant item that we are focused on for both the current year and what we know will impact us this next year. We have not -- this is not a full comprehensive guidance. And this is not meant to be complete with all the moving pieces. As Mike indicated, we're very focused on all those growth businesses that he mentioned, there's going to be other operational elements that we'll be working through. And that will provide more color on. As it relates to inflation that $300 million impact this year, is by far the most significant item. And when we think about our long-term targets, the reason we use the phrase normalized is items like that $300 million do need to be adjusted. But as it relates to other moving pieces for fiscal '23, that will come at our normal guidance update next quarter. Yes. The area I can probably be a little more helpful is on the timing associated with that the impact of that inflation from a year-over-year perspective will be more unfavorable in the first half of the year. If you think about what we had in fiscal '22, Q1 had much less of an impact actually hitting the P&L, we had seen the cost start to come -- start to build in terms of what was procured, but what actually hit the P&L escalated much more greatly in the second quarter and as increased from there in Q3 and Q4. So that comparison from a year-over-year perspective will be unfavorable for those elements, all things being equal. But given the magnitude of what we're talking about, I would expect that to be one of the more significant items, especially in Q1. And then, as we get to the back half of the year, as I indicated in my comments and Mike reiterated a few moments ago, with the expectation that we are able to offset about half of the run rate at the end of the fiscal year as we jump into '24, that would imply especially over the second half of the year, that would be trending more favorably, and then we would have a much more of a tailwind associated with those items. There are always other moving items within each year in our guidance. As you go back and look at all of our commentary this year, there have not been too many significant items referenced other than inflation. So this one singular item is going to be the key driver of the year-over-year results for the medical business next year. There will be other color, of course back to the growth businesses and other changes in underlying assumptions. But this will be driving the underlying performance for the segments very significantly from a year-over-year perspective. Again, in a general similar magnitude, perhaps, a modest headwind associated with it, based upon those underlying assumptions. Yes. The primary item that we referenced last Q4 was inventory adjustments. We did not provide any specific number; I think we might have referenced modest. And so it was a reasonable number that you can look at the growth rates there and how that was impacted to provide a range. The key again, was that we no longer have the headwinds of that 20 million, 30 million per quarter that we've seen over the first three quarters related to the IT enhancements. And then, we have had some incremental volume through, we referenced some net new customer volume within the pharma business that started to ramp up in the third quarter and is more significant in the fourth quarter. And those will be the most significant items that drive at year-over-year. And just to be really clear in this point. We're not talking about any type of product cost inflation that's flowing through pharma business that is very much captured in the pass through."

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Kevin Moran, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKevin Moran: Good morning and welcome. Today, we will discuss Cardinal Health Second Quarter Fiscal 2022 results along with an update to our FY\u201922 Outlook. You can find today\u2019s press release and presentation on the IR section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com. Joining me today are Mike Kaufmann, Chief Executive Officer, and Jason Hollar, Chief Financial Officer. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in these statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statements slide at the beginning of our presentation for a description of these risks and uncertainties. Please note that during the discussion today, our comments will be on a non-GAAP basis unless they are specifically called out as GAAP. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation for all relevant periods can be found in the schedules attached to our press release. During the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call, we please ask that you try and limit yourself to one question so that we can try and give everyone an opportunity. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Kaufmann: Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Today, Jason\u2019s and my comments will be consistent with the update we provided a few weeks ago. Let me start with the few high level thoughts. At an enterprise level, we continue to focus our efforts on three strategic priorities: optimizing our core businesses, investing for growth and innovation and deploying capital efficiently. We continue to believe the long-term targets we announced in November are appropriate and we remain on-track to meet our $750 million enterprise cost savings target by FY\u201923. Our Pharma business is performing as planned. We\u2019ve seen volumes continue to improve sequentially and we\u2019re encouraged by the growth we saw again in Q2. Looking ahead, we continue to expect Pharma to realize mid-single-digit growth in FY\u201922. In our Medical segment, we continue to experience unprecedented inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints in our core U.S. medical and products distribution business. These impacts, combined with lower than expected offsets from pricing actions, will significantly impact medical segment profit consistent with our update a few weeks ago. While we believe these impacts are temporary, the timing of when they will be, remains difficult to predict. Consequently, we\u2019re urgently working to mitigate the effect of these external macroeconomic challenges on our business. We\u2019re seeing progress in other areas of the Medical segment, including our Lab business in growth areas and we recently extended several key acute care distribution customers. Looking ahead, I\u2019ll elaborate on the actions we\u2019re taking to drive performance, particularly for Medical, after Jason reviews our Q2 results and updated outlook.\nJason Hollar: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with total company results, second quarter revenue increased 9% to $45 billion, driven by sales growth from existing pharma customers. Total gross margin was $1.6 billion, a decrease of 9%, primarily due to the Cordis divestiture and elevated supply chain costs in Medical. Consolidated SG&A was flat to the prior year at $1.2 billion, as the Cordis divestiture and benefits from cost savings initiatives offset IT investments and higher operations expenses. Second quarter operating earnings were $467 million. Outside of the incremental inflationary impacts of Medical, these results were generally in line with our expectations. Moving below line, interest and other decreased by 30% to $24 million, driven primarily by lower interest expense from debt reduction actions. The second quarter effective tax rate finished at 19.4%, 6 percentage points higher than the prior year due to certain discrete items, which primarily benefited the prior year period. Additionally, our second quarter rate this year included some timing favorability. Average diluted shares outstanding were $281 million, 5% lower than the prior year due to share repurchases. Of note, we initiated a $300 million share repurchase program in the quarter, which was recently completed and brings our total year-to-date repurchases to $800 million. The net result for the quarter was EPS of $1.27. Second quarter operating cash flow was strong at $1.2 billion. As a reminder, the day of the week in which the quarter ends affects point-in-time cash flows. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.2 billion, and no outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities. In the quarter, we also recorded a $1.3 billion non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge related to the Medical segment, which is excluded from our non-GAAP results. This accounting charge primarily resulted from additional inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints, I\u2019ll discuss shortly. Now turning to segments, beginning with Pharma on Slide 5. Revenue increased 11% to $41 billion, driven primarily by branded pharmaceutical sales growth from large pharmaceutical distribution and specialty customers. Segment profit increased 3% to $426 million, driven by generics program performance. This was partially offset by our previously discussed investments and technology enhancements and higher operations expenses, including cost supporting sales growth such as transportation and labor. During the quarter, we were encouraged to see continued broad-based improvements in pharmaceutical demand consistent with our expectations, including a return of generic volumes to approximately pre-pandemic levels. Our generics program continued to experience generally consistent market dynamics, including continued strong performance from Red Oak. Outside of generics, we\u2019ve seen brand inflation trending in line with our expectations. Turning to Medical on Slide 6. Second quarter revenue decreased 5% to $4.1 billion, primarily due to the divestiture of the Cordis business. Segment profit decreased 79% to $50 million, primarily due to inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints in products and distribution. This also reflects the timing of selling higher cost PPE, including the net positive impact from this dynamic in the prior year and to a lesser extent, the divestiture of the Cordis business. During the quarter, our products and distribution business continued to be impacted by significant inflationary pressures in the global supply chain primarily in the areas of polypropylene and international freight. Additionally, in the quarter, we saw broader inflationary impacts across the business such as domestic freight and other commodities as well as global supply chain constraints affecting the volume of some of our higher-margin Cardinal Health brand products. I\u2019ll discuss these impacts with respect to our full year Medical outlook momentarily and Mike will elaborate on the actions we\u2019re taking to address these macro challenges and drive performance in our core Medical business. With respect to COVID-19 and the Omicron variant, we continue to see strong performance from our Lab business, including significant testing demand generally consistent with levels seen a year ago. And despite some impacts from Omicron and various geographies, demand for surgical products related to elective procedures was comparable to both the first quarter and prior year. Now transitioning to our updated fiscal 2022 outlook on Slide 8. We now expect EPS in the range of $5.15 to $5.50 per share, primarily reflecting our updated expectations for Medical. We also now expect an annual effective tax rate in the range of 23% to 24.5% and interest and other in the range of $140 million to $160 million, with the improvement in I&O, including deferred compensation favorability which, as a reminder, is fully offset above the line in corporate SG&A. As for the segments on Slide 9. For Pharma, no changes to our outlook, we continue to expect low double-digit revenue growth and mid-single-digit segment profit growth. For Medical, we now expect revenue to be down low single to mid-single digit and segment profit to be down 30% to 45%. Consistent with the financial update provided a few weeks ago, we expect increased inflationary impacts on global supply chain constraints as well as lower than expected pricing offsets to result in an estimated incremental $150 million to $175 million headwind to Medical segment profits for the full year. This, in addition to our November 9 update regarding the pressures and international freight and polypropylene, now reflects a total net incremental headwind of approximately $250 million to $300 million to Medical in fiscal 2022. While these impacts are persisted for longer than previously anticipated, we continue to believe the majority will be temporary as global supply chain pressures eventually abate. While it will take time, we\u2019re committed to mitigating the impacts of inflationary pressures and will continue to work through these dynamics with our customers. Now a few other things to keep in mind in terms of the fiscal 2022 cadence. For Pharma, we expect the year-over-year growth in the back half to be heavily weighted to the fourth quarter due to the lapping of some prior year items including higher costs for the deployment of IT investments and the general sequencing of our growth initiatives. In Medical, we continue to expect an unfavorable year-over-year impacts due to timing of selling higher cost PPE in the second half of fiscal 2022, though not to the same magnitude as in the second quarter. We also will be lapping the large prior year PPE inventory reserve in the fourth quarter. Finally to close, a few reminders on the capital deployment. We continue to expect the pay down to approximate $280 million of remaining June 2022 notes at maturity and continue to expect approximately $1 billion in total share repurchases in fiscal 2022. As we said, we see our increasing balance sheet flexibility supporting more opportunistic return-of-capital to shareholders as our debt pay down begins to moderate enabled by our recent $3 billion share repurchase authorization. We continue to believe that capital deployment along with the future growth that we expect in both our segments will drive the long term double digit combined EPS growth and dividend yield that we\u2019re targeting. With that I\u2019ll turn it back over to Mike.\nMike Kaufmann: Thanks Jason. In Medical, we\u2019re continuing to take action to drive performance and maximize the differentiated strengths we\u2019ve in this business. We\u2019re vertically integrated with distribution through our comprehensive Medical products portfolio, which is generally oriented around the operating room and the intensive care unit. We also have an advantage of products portfolio in higher margin growth businesses. With our diverse customer base, we cross sell products and services spanning our portfolio. To address the challenges in our Medical business, we\u2019re focused on three things. First, evolving our commercial contracting strategy and driving mix. Historically, costs have been relatively stable and industry participants have committed to longer term multiyear contracts. However, the rapid escalation of today\u2019s inflationary pressures demonstrate that our contracting strategy needs to change. We\u2019re in the process of working with our customers to adjust certain contracts to ensure we\u2019ve more pricing flexibility for factors beyond our control. With regards to mix, as I noted in the prior quarter, we\u2019ve made important changes to align our commercial organization structure and incentives. We\u2019re underpenetrated in Cardinal Health brand mix relative to our potential which remains a significant mid to long term profit opportunity as we move past the pandemic and associated supply chain challenges. Within our Medical products portfolio, we\u2019re actively improving our key category product offerings. For example, in our confidence product line, we\u2019ve launched a new Cardinal Health brand stretch free and a comprehensive breathable platform. These enhancements directly support and meet our customers\u2019 needs. Second, we\u2019re simplifying our operating model and optimizing our international footprint. We remain on track regarding the timing of the previously announced exits in certain commercial markets with 35 of the 36 completed to-date. We\u2019re focused on the modernization of our distribution facilities including breaking ground on a new distribution center in the Midwest with nearly triple the space of the existing facility enabling future growth. We believe that a diverse global sourcing network is important to remain competitive on cost and are investing in additional self manufacturing capabilities including increases in annual production of safety needles and syringes, isolation gowns and surgical and procedural masks in our own North American facility. Specifically for surgical gowns, we\u2019ve efforts underway that would double our North American finished goods production and enhance our supply chain resiliency. Third, we continue to invest across the Medical segment including in our growth businesses, At-Home Solutions and medical services, which are aligned with industry trends and position to grow double digits in FY\u201922 and beyond. In At-Home Solutions, we continue to see strong demand as care continues to shift into the home. We recently announced an additional strategic investment in Medically Home, a technology company that enables health systems with other partners like Cardinal Health to safely bring the hospital at home for patients increasingly preferred to receive their care. Not only does this hospital at home model benefit patients, it also provides needed capacity for hospitals and delivers care in a lower cost setting. And in our higher margin medical services businesses OptiFreight Logistics and WaveMark, we continue to enable clinically integrated and digitally automated supply chain and are seeing growth driven by an expanded customer base and diversified solution. We\u2019ve invested in additional technology capabilities to increase our offerings in both businesses. In OptiFreight, we\u2019ve invested in additional technology capabilities focused on building automated technology driven solutions that innovate the way healthcare supply chain leaders manage shipping spend and take control over their transportation logistics. These efforts are connecting suppliers and customers at over 22,000 shipping locations. In WaveMark, we\u2019ve launched a cutting edge supply automation solution for clinical labs, which automates previously manual inventory management task. This enables clinical lab staff to focus on patient care and better managed increased testing demand due to COVID-19. Our Pharma business remains on track to deliver mid-single digit growth in FY\u201922. We continue to make progress on our two primary objectives. First, strengthening our core Pharma distribution or PD business. This quarter segment profit was driven by the performance in our generics program. Our generics program is anchored by the scale and expertise of Red Oak sourcing, a partnership we also recently extended through FY\u201929 and which positions us well to meet customers\u2019 needs. In addition, our multiyear technology investment to modernize our systems is on track. We plan to complete the rollout by the beginning of our Q4 and look to benefit from the conversion in FY\u201923 and beyond. Second, we\u2019re fueling our growth businesses, Specialty, Nuclear and Outcomes. In Specialty, we continue to experience momentum in our oncology physician office business driven in part by Navista TS, our technology platform for value based care. Just this week, we announced a partnership with Ember Technologies to offer the world\u2019s first self-refrigerated cloud based shipping box for temperature-sensitive medicines. As biopharma continues bringing cold chain biologic products to market including cell and gene therapies, this partnership will help ensure product integrity throughout the supply chain. This is a differentiated offering and one that will reduce landfill rates by millions of pounds annually and with biosimilars, we\u2019re well positioned to support the next phase of growth as biosimilars expand into new therapeutic areas and slides of care. In Nuclear, we expect continued double digit profit growth which will result in a doubling of our profit in this business by FY\u201926. We continue to build out our multimillion dollar center for Theranostics advancement in Indianapolis where we partner with several pharma companies to develop and commercialize novel Theranostics and we\u2019re investing in our PET capabilities to support robust PET diagnostics. For example, with the FDA approval of Telix\u2019s radiopharmaceutical in Q2, we\u2019re positioned to drive nationwide accessibility and broad adoption of prostate specific PET imaging for physicians and eligible patients across the United States. And in Outcomes, we\u2019re adding new payers and PBMs and expanding clinical solutions for both independent pharmacies and retail chains. Outcomes recently activated it\u2019s 20 million user on its digital patient engagement platform, which enables two-way communication between pharmacies and patients to increase medication adherence. With respect to the Enterprise, we continue to aggressively review our cost structure as we work to streamline, simplify and strengthen our operations and execute our digital transformation. We\u2019re pairing cost reduction efforts with balance, discipline and shareholder friendly capital allocation with the focus on investing in the business, maintain a strong balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders. Long term, we\u2019re targeting a double digit combined EPS growth and dividends yield. These expectations are driven by our growth targets for our segment, our commitment to our dividend and our $3 billion share repurchase authorization. Now let me provide an update on the proposed opioid settlement agreement and settlement process. As of today, 46 out of 49 states have indicated their intent to join the global settlement. The sign on period for political subdivisions within participating states concluded on January 26. Now each of the participating states are in the process of determining whether there is sufficient subdivision participation to proceed. After we receive notice from the states regarding their decision, each of the distributors will make final determinations by February 25. If all conditions are satisfied this agreement would resolve in the settlement of a substantial majority of opioid losses followed by the state and local governmental entities. This is an important step forward for our company as we\u2019ve consistently said, we remain committed to being part of the solution to the US opioid epidemic and believe that settlement would provide relief for our communities and increase certainty for our shareholders. In closing, our aspiration has been and continues to be that we\u2019re healthcare\u2019s most trusted partner. We will do this by focusing on our customers\u2019 need and delivering the products and solutions that advance healthcare and improve the lives of people every day. We bring life changing healthcare innovation to market harnessing the power of technology, data and insights to optimize care delivery for investing in technology and analytics to drive future growth in evolving areas of healthcare and address healthcare\u2019s most complicated challenges. What we do matters and we\u2019re focusing our resources on building solutions to meet the needs of our customers and their patients now and in the future. And now, Jason and I will take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will go ahead and take our first question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.\nCharles Rhyee: Yes, thanks, guys. Mike and Jason, I want to talk about the issues with supply costs here, and we\u2019re obviously challenged at the moment. But can you talk a little bit more about As, let's say, these pressures ease, let's say, hopefully, later this year or whenever? Can you talk about how those expenses that you are incurring today roll off? Do they kind of roll off fairly quickly, or is it that these kind of knock-on effects of delays and everything for all your supplies and equipment just kind of just drag even further beyond if we were to see reports that the ports are working as normal? How long is that kind of follow-on effects before everything really would return to normal? And from a P&L perspective, are these kind of expenses kind of overshadowing, let's say, sort of the underlying performance of the division or a little more color on that would be helpful? Thank you.\nJason Hollar: Sure. I'll definitely start here, it\u2019s Jason, and then I'm sure Michael has some thoughts as well. But generally speaking, the vast majority of these costs that we've outlined are product-related cost or cost to get the products shipped to United States where our customers typically are. And as such, most of those costs are included in inventory and then expensed as they're sold. So that means that there would be a one to two-quarter delay in terms of when those costs begin to come down and when you would start to see that offset then in the P&L. And that's I think fairly typical for the - what we saw with PPE as well last year in terms of that type of cadence. Now there is some of this, a smaller portion is related to the volume impact of the supply chain constraints, so that's obviously going to be at the time that volume freeze up. There's a small part that the period cost, but it's much less significant. Again, the biggest buckets when you step back and think about the $250 million to $300 million, that's an aggregate that we're talking about, is that international freight is the biggest piece and it's very much inventoried as I just described. And then the second largest would be the general commodities we talked about, commodities like oil-based commodities like polypropylene, that is the big driver that again those would all be inventoried cost and then flowing through. As it relates to the overall impacts to the business, just using Q2 as the example from a year-over-year perspective, this overall aggregate impact of the inflation and net of pricing is the greatest driver of the year-over-year reduction. We did as a reminder have favorability last Q2 as it relates to the timing of PPE pricing cost. So it's a little bit of a headwind than on an absolute basis this quarter, but it's more significant, the comparison to the favorability of last year. And that's about $60 million in this quarter. So that's a relevant piece to the year-over-year impact. And then the final piece as you know, Cordis is running at roughly - last year was roughly $20 million a quarter. So the absence of that business as was divested is that last piece. So I think that gives you most of the key pieces.\nMike Kaufmann: Yes, the only thing I would add Charles is that wow everything Jason said is true, the one to two quarters and all that. One thing I want to make sure people understand is we're actively getting after this now. So we're not going to have a strategy of just waiting for these to come down. So we are evolving our commercial and contracting strategies, that is something we're actively doing, working with customers to be able to either pass on some of these prices change or contracting driving our mix as we talked about and continuing to aggressively get after our cost and invest in our growth businesses. So while we will hopefully see these come down because we do believe these are temporary, we're also at the same time getting after things that we need to do manage and operate the business aggressively. Next question?\nOperator: We will go ahead and move on to our next question now from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nLisa Gill: Hi, thanks very much. Mike, can I just first start with a follow-up to what you just talked about. When we think about your medical business longer-term, I know you previously had a goal of north of 5% operating margin improvement surge. I know they part of that was the higher margin of Cordis. But when we get back to a more normalized basis, how do we think about what the margin should look like in that business?\nMike Kaufmann: Yes, that's a great question. We've now put that out there. I will give you a couple of things. Obviously at the inflation goes away and as we said, we believe this 250, the 300 that the vast majority of that is temporary. So you can add that back to our margin rates as the biggest driver. Second of all, the second thing I would add is we said we want to drive mix. And what we mean by that is selling more of Cardinal Health branded products versus National brand. That's going to also drive our mix in a positive way. We're getting after expenses, that's going to drive our margins to for the segment. And we're growing our growth business, which do have higher margin. So all of our key initiatives not only will drive bottom line, but they all should drive margin rates up significantly. But at this point in time, we're not putting target margin rate out there that we're going after.\nOperator: And we'll go ahead and move on to our next question from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nEric Percher: Thank you. I want to stay on this topic, and my question is can we talk a little bit about your expectations for some of these specific items may be built into the year or your view on duration? And I separate kind of freight commodity and then the sales volume and duration on how long you pass this on given the new contracting methodology. Can you just give us your take on either expectations today or based on prior experience and what you know today the duration of those trend pressures?\nJason Hollar: Yes, again, this is Jason, I'll start. So to your point, it will potentially differ not only by type of cost, but also the magnitude of what we're talking about. So as it relates to first of all, just to the international freight, one thing to highlight is that that particular area of cost has remained at very elevated levels. So at this point, we're not seeing much of a change from where we have been. And so that's something that is a clear part of our pricing focus is to make sure we can get at least a good portion of that recovered. As it relates to some of the other commodities, they've been more volatile. We have seen some that have started to appear to come down that cost sort of looks like they may have plateaued and started to reduce others that have been choppier. And so that environment where the costs are moving around a lot, it is -- provides more challenges as it relates to getting that pricing more established. I think the key is, as you think about the cadence of what this impact is on a net basis, that $250 million to $300 million, we have already incurred about a $100 million of that year-to-date. That $150 million to $200 million that's remaining within our guidance, we see that peaking in the third quarter and that's a combination of not only the cost we expect to be at its highest and then as they start to come down and that takes that delay to get it actually flowing through our inventory to our P&L. That then will start to benefit us later in the year. But also that also the timing of when we would start to see from the pricing actions that we have already begun to start to come through. It is just the beginning, it's not offsetting enough of that. There's more activity that will need to still occur. But it all depends on exactly what that cadence is of cost and the key is that we remain very close to both the GPOs as well as our customers to manage through that on an item-by-item customer/customer basis to get to an answer then that will give us the right cadence exiting the year. With all that said I\u2019ve given the one to two quarter lag even of if costs do come down and even if we have more success with the pricing we would expect there to be a carry over into fiscal \u201923 there will be some impact [on result] of the year but we need to see the cadence of both the cost and the pricing before we can establish that more clearly.\nOperator: We will go ahead and move on to our next question Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. This is [Dan] for Ricky. Two questions from us, one as we think about you are moved to little bit more finished goods production back in North America. How should we think about that in terms margin sort of an pre-COVID environment and the impact of margin as we think about your margins in the recent quarts and as a follow up just wanted to confirm updated tax rate interest expense guidance back in today, but that enquired early January updater, is that incremental. Thank you.\nMike Kaufmann: Jason will talk about the tax rate then I can talk about the margin.\nJason Hollar: There was some small differences in this latest update the tax rate was just bringing down the top end a little bit low and was not much with difference there. The interesting another change I highlighted was in part related to deferred comp and as reminder that just geography between interest and other as well corporate SG&A so, yes there was largely considered in our prior assumptions but as a lot of it is just geography anyway. So there's no material difference in those other updates.\nMike Kaufmann: And as far as moving capacity to our North American operations, I would say a couple of things. Generally I wouldn\u2019t say that we would expect much of a margin difference, if it was manufactured outside of North America versus manufactured here. That is not something I would say would be a margin driver, it's more about supply chain integrity, which is why we moved in there. So if there are disruptions in the future, we obviously then have certain key items closer here. So we've chosen as items that can be highly automated, make a lot of sense and freight is a big piece of it. So that we can still stay cost competitive. So again I want to say it's margined generating in and of itself. However by increasing the capacity on some of these items like we mentioned doubling our ability to manufacture our own gown, that does give us more ability to sell our own product which is we drive mix that would increase our overall margin rate.\nOperator: And we'll move on to our next question from Jailendra Singh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nJailendra Singh: Thank you, and good morning. A run up. With respect to the third, 250 million to the 300 million impact in medical segment, can you be a little bit more specific on how much impact did you see in fiscal first half and how much is expected in second half. And a follow-up to an earlier question, how should be modeled the split between 3Q and 4Q on the remaining impact. I'm trying to better understand if all these initiatives you're putting in place are more focused on positioning the company in better next time you see these kind of pressure or do you think there's a possibility these initiatives result in some near term offsets and are you capturing those in your outlook?\nJason Hollar: Yes, I -- if I understood the question right, Jailendra, the I think I'd answer before I'll go and repeat that. So the 250 million to 300 million, 100 million was has already been incurred in the first half. I think about it as kind of a sequential step up, so Q2 was higher than Q1 and Q3 is expected to be higher than Q2. And then that's the period that peaks before it starts to come back down. So there is, it depends on that if we're talking sequential or year-over-year from a sequential perspective from Q2 to Q3 within the medical business. That is just the ongoing cost reductions that we would expect to be always in place that continue those initiatives we talked fairly consistently about are there. Within the other type of PPE impacts, like I said from a year-over-year perspective in the second quarter, it was $60 million headwind. There was a small headwind in an absolute basis in the second quarter that we think will be less in the third quarter. So it's a bit of an offset and not significant but generally speaking it's the inflationary impacts. So the most pronounced from a year-over-year as well as expected to be a little bit greater than in the third quarter.\nMike Kaufmann: Yes. Things I would add be helpful here is Jason mentioned as we expect some of the inflation impacts to start to hopefully come down some and that will give us a little bit of benefit in Q4. We also see our pricing actions ramping up some in Q4 too because we are continuing to implement additional pricing actions. We have some going into effect here very soon that have been agreed to. So we're working through those. So I would say that that would be a positive item going forward for us. Also as we mention, we are working on our commercial contracting strategies. And so, as we work through those contracts, our goal is to give us more flexibility. So that in the future if there is another instance like this, we are able to react a quicker and address our pricing and work with our partners in a very transparent and productive way because our customers are obviously some of the thing that we have to always have in the front of our mind but we do need some more flexibility in the business and we are working aggressively to work with the GPOs and our customers do that.\nJason Hollar: And Jailendra, as you do your modeling for the balance of the year, just remember in the prior year we had the significant inventory charge in Q4 that would of course not be expected to replicate here this year.\nOperator: We will then and move on to your next question from Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cherny: Good morning. Thanks for the details. Mike, you mentioned in your remarks how you had a few customer extensions to some of your key customers on the medical side. Especially against this backdrop of your focus on re-contracting, would love to know a little more detail about how qualitatively those discussions went and in terms of your thought process where we're re-contracting, we're able to test out where you were able to get through and not get through and what customers are willing to accept relative to that change contracting dynamics especially given the obviously extensions on customers that have worked with you, I assume for at least a long time.\nMike Kaufmann: That's a great question. Yes, we're -- we are working aggressively on that. It's not just the individual customers, in fact it's just as important to be able to work with our GPO partners to allow us because you really have to coordinate between all three of them. So there's still absolutely work to do but we're seeing some positive signs from both the GPOs and the customers that understand the importance of having a strong supply chain and strong supply chain partners in medical distribution. That these are things that we're going to have to work together. Key things that we've learned to those discussions that we'll be helpful as one, our willingness to be transparent with them so that we understand as costs come up why are they going up and also when costs come down so that they know that you're not continuing to charge a high price when things have got better and we're very willing to work with them on this transparency piece which I think will help both parties understand the importance of what we need to do here from a pricing standpoint. So I would say early indications have been positive but still a lot of work to do as we work on changing our commercial strategies.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nElizabeth Anderson: Hi guys, thanks so much for the question. I was wondering if you could comment on as we sort of have gone through a month in the new quarter. Just now you're seeing sort of volumes come back particularly on the surgical side and also on to the home care just so sort of we think about the cadence for that going through the back half of the year?\nMike Kaufmann: Yes. And maybe I'll just take the opportunity to just talk about volumes in general because I think whether it\u2019s pharma or medical, the general response is about the same. Within medical, while there has been certain level of choppiness over the last three to six months, largely it's been very consistent with our expectations. We indicated before we are back to near pre-COVID levels and this quarter was pretty consistent with our expectations. And sequentially, from the first quarter as well as the year-over-year, there were not many differences. And so, there's noise but the key is that state-by-state, geography-by-geography, different regions are impacted at different times to different extents but we're just not seeing big impact. That\u2019s because our customers continue to do a wonderful job of providing great service to their patients and that's providing a better balance underneath the volume than what we saw earlier on in the pandemic. On the pharma side, we continued to talk in today's prepared remarks as well as a couple of weeks ago and just that we continue to see that widespread improvement back to pre-COVID levels and we have largely gone back to that point at the end of the second quarter and so we're just not seeing a lot of variability there as well.\nOperator: And with that, that does conclude our question and answer session for today. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mike Kaufmann for closing remarks.\nMike Kaufmann: Thanks, Ali. I want to thank everybody for taking the time to be on the call today and for all of your questions. I like to conclude by reiterating that we are taking action to mitigate these inflationary impacts in supply chain constraints. And we're laser focused on driving improved performance across all of our businesses. So please stay safe and we'll speak with you again soon. Take care, everybody.\nOperator: And with that, that does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mike Kaufmann",
            "content": "Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Today, Jason's and my comments will be consistent with the update we provided a few weeks ago. Let me start with the few high level thoughts. At an enterprise level, we continue to focus our efforts on three strategic priorities: optimizing our core businesses, investing for growth and innovation and deploying capital efficiently. We continue to believe the long-term targets we announced in November are appropriate and we remain on-track to meet our $750 million enterprise cost savings target by FY'23. Our Pharma business is performing as planned. We've seen volumes continue to improve sequentially and we're encouraged by the growth we saw again in Q2. Looking ahead, we continue to expect Pharma to realize mid-single-digit growth in FY'22. In our Medical segment, we continue to experience unprecedented inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints in our core U.S. medical and products distribution business. These impacts, combined with lower than expected offsets from pricing actions, will significantly impact medical segment profit consistent with our update a few weeks ago. While we believe these impacts are temporary, the timing of when they will be, remains difficult to predict. Consequently, we're urgently working to mitigate the effect of these external macroeconomic challenges on our business. We're seeing progress in other areas of the Medical segment, including our Lab business in growth areas and we recently extended several key acute care distribution customers. Looking ahead, I'll elaborate on the actions we're taking to drive performance, particularly for Medical, after Jason reviews our Q2 results and updated outlook. Thanks Jason. In Medical, we're continuing to take action to drive performance and maximize the differentiated strengths we've in this business. We're vertically integrated with distribution through our comprehensive Medical products portfolio, which is generally oriented around the operating room and the intensive care unit. We also have an advantage of products portfolio in higher margin growth businesses. With our diverse customer base, we cross sell products and services spanning our portfolio. To address the challenges in our Medical business, we're focused on three things. First, evolving our commercial contracting strategy and driving mix. Historically, costs have been relatively stable and industry participants have committed to longer term multiyear contracts. However, the rapid escalation of today's inflationary pressures demonstrate that our contracting strategy needs to change. We're in the process of working with our customers to adjust certain contracts to ensure we've more pricing flexibility for factors beyond our control. With regards to mix, as I noted in the prior quarter, we've made important changes to align our commercial organization structure and incentives. We're underpenetrated in Cardinal Health brand mix relative to our potential which remains a significant mid to long term profit opportunity as we move past the pandemic and associated supply chain challenges. Within our Medical products portfolio, we're actively improving our key category product offerings. For example, in our confidence product line, we've launched a new Cardinal Health brand stretch free and a comprehensive breathable platform. These enhancements directly support and meet our customers' needs. Second, we're simplifying our operating model and optimizing our international footprint. We remain on track regarding the timing of the previously announced exits in certain commercial markets with 35 of the 36 completed to-date. We're focused on the modernization of our distribution facilities including breaking ground on a new distribution center in the Midwest with nearly triple the space of the existing facility enabling future growth. We believe that a diverse global sourcing network is important to remain competitive on cost and are investing in additional self manufacturing capabilities including increases in annual production of safety needles and syringes, isolation gowns and surgical and procedural masks in our own North American facility. Specifically for surgical gowns, we've efforts underway that would double our North American finished goods production and enhance our supply chain resiliency. Third, we continue to invest across the Medical segment including in our growth businesses, At-Home Solutions and medical services, which are aligned with industry trends and position to grow double digits in FY'22 and beyond. In At-Home Solutions, we continue to see strong demand as care continues to shift into the home.

Not only does this hospital at home model benefit patients, it also provides needed capacity for hospitals and delivers care in a lower cost setting. And in our higher margin medical services businesses OptiFreight Logistics and WaveMark, we continue to enable clinically integrated and digitally automated supply chain and are seeing growth driven by an expanded customer base and diversified solution. We've invested in additional technology capabilities to increase our offerings in both businesses. In OptiFreight, we've invested in additional technology capabilities focused on building automated technology driven solutions that innovate the way healthcare supply chain leaders manage shipping spend and take control over their transportation logistics. These efforts are connecting suppliers and customers at over 22,000 shipping locations. In WaveMark, we've launched a cutting edge supply automation solution for clinical labs, which automates previously manual inventory management task. This enables clinical lab staff to focus on patient care and better managed increased testing demand due to COVID-19. Our Pharma business remains on track to deliver mid-single digit growth in FY'22. We continue to make progress on our two primary objectives. First, strengthening our core Pharma distribution or PD business. This quarter segment profit was driven by the performance in our generics program. Our generics program is anchored by the scale and expertise of Red Oak sourcing, a partnership we also recently extended through FY'29 and which positions us well to meet customers' needs. In addition, our multiyear technology investment to modernize our systems is on track. We plan to complete the rollout by the beginning of our Q4 and look to benefit from the conversion in FY'23 and beyond. Second, we're fueling our growth businesses, Specialty, Nuclear and Outcomes. In Specialty, we continue to experience momentum in our oncology physician office business driven in part by Navista TS, our technology platform for value based care. Just this week, we announced a partnership with Ember Technologies to offer the world's first self-refrigerated cloud based shipping box for temperature-sensitive medicines. As biopharma continues bringing cold chain biologic products to market including cell and gene therapies, this partnership will help ensure product integrity throughout the supply chain. This is a differentiated offering and one that will reduce landfill rates by millions of pounds annually and with biosimilars, we're well positioned to support the next phase of growth as biosimilars expand into new therapeutic areas and slides of care. In Nuclear, we expect continued double digit profit growth which will result in a doubling of our profit in this business by FY'26. We continue to build out our multimillion dollar center for Theranostics advancement in Indianapolis where we partner with several pharma companies to develop and commercialize novel Theranostics and we're investing in our PET capabilities to support robust PET diagnostics. For example, with the FDA approval of Telix's radiopharmaceutical in Q2, we're positioned to drive nationwide accessibility and broad adoption of prostate specific PET imaging for physicians and eligible patients across the United States. And in Outcomes, we're adding new payers and PBMs and expanding clinical solutions for both independent pharmacies and retail chains. Outcomes recently activated it's 20 million user on its digital patient engagement platform, which enables two-way communication between pharmacies and patients to increase medication adherence. With respect to the Enterprise, we continue to aggressively review our cost structure as we work to streamline, simplify and strengthen our operations and execute our digital transformation. We're pairing cost reduction efforts with balance, discipline and shareholder friendly capital allocation with the focus on investing in the business, maintain a strong balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders. Long term, we're targeting a double digit combined EPS growth and dividends yield. These expectations are driven by our growth targets for our segment, our commitment to our dividend and our $3 billion share repurchase authorization. Now let me provide an update on the proposed opioid settlement agreement and settlement process. As of today, 46 out of 49 states have indicated their intent to join the global settlement. The sign on period for political subdivisions within participating states concluded on January 26. Now each of the participating states are in the process of determining whether there is sufficient subdivision participation to proceed. After we receive notice from the states regarding their decision, each of the distributors will make final determinations by February 25. If all conditions are satisfied this agreement would resolve in the settlement of a substantial majority of opioid losses followed by the state and local governmental entities. This is an important step forward for our company as we've consistently said, we remain committed to being part of the solution to the US opioid epidemic and believe that settlement would provide relief for our communities and increase certainty for our shareholders. In closing, our aspiration has been and continues to be that we're healthcare's most trusted partner. We will do this by focusing on our customers' need and delivering the products and solutions that advance healthcare and improve the lives of people every day. We bring life changing healthcare innovation to market harnessing the power of technology, data and insights to optimize care delivery for investing in technology and analytics to drive future growth in evolving areas of healthcare and address healthcare's most complicated challenges. What we do matters and we're focusing our resources on building solutions to meet the needs of our customers and their patients now and in the future. And now, Jason and I will take your questions. Yes, the only thing I would add Charles is that wow everything Jason said is true, the one to two quarters and all that. One thing I want to make sure people understand is we're actively getting after this now. So we're not going to have a strategy of just waiting for these to come down. So we are evolving our commercial and contracting strategies, that is something we're actively doing, working with customers to be able to either pass on some of these prices change or contracting driving our mix as we talked about and continuing to aggressively get after our cost and invest in our growth businesses. So while we will hopefully see these come down because we do believe these are temporary, we're also at the same time getting after things that we need to do manage and operate the business aggressively. Next question? Yes, that's a great question. We've now put that out there. I will give you a couple of things. Obviously at the inflation goes away and as we said, we believe this 250, the 300 that the vast majority of that is temporary. So you can add that back to our margin rates as the biggest driver. Second of all, the second thing I would add is we said we want to drive mix. And what we mean by that is selling more of Cardinal Health branded products versus National brand. That's going to also drive our mix in a positive way. We're getting after expenses, that's going to drive our margins to for the segment. And we're growing our growth business, which do have higher margin. So all of our key initiatives not only will drive bottom line, but they all should drive margin rates up significantly. But at this point in time, we're not putting target margin rate out there that we're going after. Jason will talk about the tax rate then I can talk about the margin. And as far as moving capacity to our North American operations, I would say a couple of things. Generally I wouldn't say that we would expect much of a margin difference, if it was manufactured outside of North America versus manufactured here. That is not something I would say would be a margin driver, it's more about supply chain integrity, which is why we moved in there. So if there are disruptions in the future, we obviously then have certain key items closer here. So we've chosen as items that can be highly automated, make a lot of sense and freight is a big piece of it. So that we can still stay cost competitive. So again I want to say it's margined generating in and of itself. However by increasing the capacity on some of these items like we mentioned doubling our ability to manufacture our own gown, that does give us more ability to sell our own product which is we drive mix that would increase our overall margin rate. Yes. Things I would add be helpful here is Jason mentioned as we expect some of the inflation impacts to start to hopefully come down some and that will give us a little bit of benefit in Q4. We also see our pricing actions ramping up some in Q4 too because we are continuing to implement additional pricing actions. We have some going into effect here very soon that have been agreed to. So we're working through those. So I would say that that would be a positive item going forward for us. Also as we mention, we are working on our commercial contracting strategies. And so, as we work through those contracts, our goal is to give us more flexibility. So that in the future if there is another instance like this, we are able to react a quicker and address our pricing and work with our partners in a very transparent and productive way because our customers are obviously some of the thing that we have to always have in the front of our mind but we do need some more flexibility in the business and we are working aggressively to work with the GPOs and our customers do that. That's a great question. Yes, we're -- we are working aggressively on that. It's not just the individual customers, in fact it's just as important to be able to work with our GPO partners to allow us because you really have to coordinate between all three of them. So there's still absolutely work to do but we're seeing some positive signs from both the GPOs and the customers that understand the importance of having a strong supply chain and strong supply chain partners in medical distribution. That these are things that we're going to have to work together. Key things that we've learned to those discussions that we'll be helpful as one, our willingness to be transparent with them so that we understand as costs come up why are they going up and also when costs come down so that they know that you're not continuing to charge a high price when things have got better and we're very willing to work with them on this transparency piece which I think will help both parties understand the importance of what we need to do here from a pricing standpoint. So I would say early indications have been positive but still a lot of work to do as we work on changing our commercial strategies. Yes. And maybe I'll just take the opportunity to just talk about volumes in general because I think whether it's pharma or medical, the general response is about the same. Within medical, while there has been certain level of choppiness over the last three to six months, largely it's been very consistent with our expectations. We indicated before we are back to near pre-COVID levels and this quarter was pretty consistent with our expectations. And sequentially, from the first quarter as well as the year-over-year, there were not many differences. And so, there's noise but the key is that state-by-state, geography-by-geography, different regions are impacted at different times to different extents but we're just not seeing big impact. That's because our customers continue to do a wonderful job of providing great service to their patients and that's providing a better balance underneath the volume than what we saw earlier on in the pandemic. On the pharma side, we continued to talk in today's prepared remarks as well as a couple of weeks ago and just that we continue to see that widespread improvement back to pre-COVID levels and we have largely gone back to that point at the end of the second quarter and so we're just not seeing a lot of variability there as well. Thanks, Ali. I want to thank everybody for taking the time to be on the call today and for all of your questions. I like to conclude by reiterating that we are taking action to mitigate these inflationary impacts in supply chain constraints. And we're laser focused on driving improved performance across all of our businesses. So please stay safe and we'll speak with you again soon. Take care, everybody."

            "name": "Jason Hollar",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with total company results, second quarter revenue increased 9% to $45 billion, driven by sales growth from existing pharma customers. Total gross margin was $1.6 billion, a decrease of 9%, primarily due to the Cordis divestiture and elevated supply chain costs in Medical. Consolidated SG&A was flat to the prior year at $1.2 billion, as the Cordis divestiture and benefits from cost savings initiatives offset IT investments and higher operations expenses. Second quarter operating earnings were $467 million. Outside of the incremental inflationary impacts of Medical, these results were generally in line with our expectations. Moving below line, interest and other decreased by 30% to $24 million, driven primarily by lower interest expense from debt reduction actions. The second quarter effective tax rate finished at 19.4%, 6 percentage points higher than the prior year due to certain discrete items, which primarily benefited the prior year period. Additionally, our second quarter rate this year included some timing favorability. Average diluted shares outstanding were $281 million, 5% lower than the prior year due to share repurchases. Of note, we initiated a $300 million share repurchase program in the quarter, which was recently completed and brings our total year-to-date repurchases to $800 million. The net result for the quarter was EPS of $1.27. Second quarter operating cash flow was strong at $1.2 billion. As a reminder, the day of the week in which the quarter ends affects point-in-time cash flows. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.2 billion, and no outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities. In the quarter, we also recorded a $1.3 billion non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge related to the Medical segment, which is excluded from our non-GAAP results. This accounting charge primarily resulted from additional inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints, I'll discuss shortly. Now turning to segments, beginning with Pharma on Slide 5. Revenue increased 11% to $41 billion, driven primarily by branded pharmaceutical sales growth from large pharmaceutical distribution and specialty customers. Segment profit increased 3% to $426 million, driven by generics program performance. This was partially offset by our previously discussed investments and technology enhancements and higher operations expenses, including cost supporting sales growth such as transportation and labor. During the quarter, we were encouraged to see continued broad-based improvements in pharmaceutical demand consistent with our expectations, including a return of generic volumes to approximately pre-pandemic levels. Our generics program continued to experience generally consistent market dynamics, including continued strong performance from Red Oak. Outside of generics, we've seen brand inflation trending in line with our expectations. Turning to Medical on Slide 6. Second quarter revenue decreased 5% to $4.1 billion, primarily due to the divestiture of the Cordis business. Segment profit decreased 79% to $50 million, primarily due to inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints in products and distribution. This also reflects the timing of selling higher cost PPE, including the net positive impact from this dynamic in the prior year and to a lesser extent, the divestiture of the Cordis business. During the quarter, our products and distribution business continued to be impacted by significant inflationary pressures in the global supply chain primarily in the areas of polypropylene and international freight. Additionally, in the quarter, we saw broader inflationary impacts across the business such as domestic freight and other commodities as well as global supply chain constraints affecting the volume of some of our higher-margin Cardinal Health brand products. I'll discuss these impacts with respect to our full year Medical outlook momentarily and Mike will elaborate on the actions we're taking to address these macro challenges and drive performance in our core Medical business. With respect to COVID-19 and the Omicron variant, we continue to see strong performance from our Lab business, including significant testing demand generally consistent with levels seen a year ago. And despite some impacts from Omicron and various geographies, demand for surgical products related to elective procedures was comparable to both the first quarter and prior year. Now transitioning to our updated fiscal 2022 outlook on Slide 8. We now expect EPS in the range of $5.15 to $5.50 per share, primarily reflecting our updated expectations for Medical. We also now expect an annual effective tax rate in the range of 23% to 24.5% and interest and other in the range of $140 million to $160 million, with the improvement in I&O, including deferred compensation favorability which, as a reminder, is fully offset above the line in corporate SG&A. As for the segments on Slide 9. For Pharma, no changes to our outlook, we continue to expect low double-digit revenue growth and mid-single-digit segment profit growth. For Medical, we now expect revenue to be down low single to mid-single digit and segment profit to be down 30% to 45%. Consistent with the financial update provided a few weeks ago, we expect increased inflationary impacts on global supply chain constraints as well as lower than expected pricing offsets to result in an estimated incremental $150 million to $175 million headwind to Medical segment profits for the full year. This, in addition to our November 9 update regarding the pressures and international freight and polypropylene, now reflects a total net incremental headwind of approximately $250 million to $300 million to Medical in fiscal 2022. While these impacts are persisted for longer than previously anticipated, we continue to believe the majority will be temporary as global supply chain pressures eventually abate. While it will take time, we're committed to mitigating the impacts of inflationary pressures and will continue to work through these dynamics with our customers. Now a few other things to keep in mind in terms of the fiscal 2022 cadence. For Pharma, we expect the year-over-year growth in the back half to be heavily weighted to the fourth quarter due to the lapping of some prior year items including higher costs for the deployment of IT investments and the general sequencing of our growth initiatives. In Medical, we continue to expect an unfavorable year-over-year impacts due to timing of selling higher cost PPE in the second half of fiscal 2022, though not to the same magnitude as in the second quarter. We also will be lapping the large prior year PPE inventory reserve in the fourth quarter. Finally to close, a few reminders on the capital deployment. We continue to expect the pay down to approximate $280 million of remaining June 2022 notes at maturity and continue to expect approximately $1 billion in total share repurchases in fiscal 2022. As we said, we see our increasing balance sheet flexibility supporting more opportunistic return-of-capital to shareholders as our debt pay down begins to moderate enabled by our recent $3 billion share repurchase authorization. We continue to believe that capital deployment along with the future growth that we expect in both our segments will drive the long term double digit combined EPS growth and dividend yield that we're targeting. With that I'll turn it back over to Mike. Sure. I'll definitely start here, it's Jason, and then I'm sure Michael has some thoughts as well. But generally speaking, the vast majority of these costs that we've outlined are product-related cost or cost to get the products shipped to United States where our customers typically are. And as such, most of those costs are included in inventory and then expensed as they're sold. So that means that there would be a one to two-quarter delay in terms of when those costs begin to come down and when you would start to see that offset then in the P&L. And that's I think fairly typical for the - what we saw with PPE as well last year in terms of that type of cadence. Now there is some of this, a smaller portion is related to the volume impact of the supply chain constraints, so that's obviously going to be at the time that volume freeze up. There's a small part that the period cost, but it's much less significant. Again, the biggest buckets when you step back and think about the $250 million to $300 million, that's an aggregate that we're talking about, is that international freight is the biggest piece and it's very much inventoried as I just described. And then the second largest would be the general commodities we talked about, commodities like oil-based commodities like polypropylene, that is the big driver that again those would all be inventoried cost and then flowing through. As it relates to the overall impacts to the business, just using Q2 as the example from a year-over-year perspective, this overall aggregate impact of the inflation and net of pricing is the greatest driver of the year-over-year reduction. We did as a reminder have favorability last Q2 as it relates to the timing of PPE pricing cost. So it's a little bit of a headwind than on an absolute basis this quarter, but it's more significant, the comparison to the favorability of last year. And that's about $60 million in this quarter. So that's a relevant piece to the year-over-year impact. And then the final piece as you know, Cordis is running at roughly - last year was roughly $20 million a quarter. So the absence of that business as was divested is that last piece. So I think that gives you most of the key pieces. Yes, again, this is Jason, I'll start. So to your point, it will potentially differ not only by type of cost, but also the magnitude of what we're talking about. So as it relates to first of all, just to the international freight, one thing to highlight is that that particular area of cost has remained at very elevated levels. So at this point, we're not seeing much of a change from where we have been. And so that's something that is a clear part of our pricing focus is to make sure we can get at least a good portion of that recovered. As it relates to some of the other commodities, they've been more volatile. We have seen some that have started to appear to come down that cost sort of looks like they may have plateaued and started to reduce others that have been choppier. And so that environment where the costs are moving around a lot, it is -- provides more challenges as it relates to getting that pricing more established. I think the key is, as you think about the cadence of what this impact is on a net basis, that $250 million to $300 million, we have already incurred about a $100 million of that year-to-date. That $150 million to $200 million that's remaining within our guidance, we see that peaking in the third quarter and that's a combination of not only the cost we expect to be at its highest and then as they start to come down and that takes that delay to get it actually flowing through our inventory to our P&L. That then will start to benefit us later in the year. But also that also the timing of when we would start to see from the pricing actions that we have already begun to start to come through. It is just the beginning, it's not offsetting enough of that. There's more activity that will need to still occur. But it all depends on exactly what that cadence is of cost and the key is that we remain very close to both the GPOs as well as our customers to manage through that on an item-by-item customer/customer basis to get to an answer then that will give us the right cadence exiting the year. With all that said I've given the one to two quarter lag even of if costs do come down and even if we have more success with the pricing we would expect there to be a carry over into fiscal '23 there will be some impact [on result] of the year but we need to see the cadence of both the cost and the pricing before we can establish that more clearly. There was some small differences in this latest update the tax rate was just bringing down the top end a little bit low and was not much with difference there. The interesting another change I highlighted was in part related to deferred comp and as reminder that just geography between interest and other as well corporate SG&A so, yes there was largely considered in our prior assumptions but as a lot of it is just geography anyway. So there's no material difference in those other updates. Yes, I -- if I understood the question right, Jailendra, the I think I'd answer before I'll go and repeat that. So the 250 million to 300 million, 100 million was has already been incurred in the first half. I think about it as kind of a sequential step up, so Q2 was higher than Q1 and Q3 is expected to be higher than Q2. And then that's the period that peaks before it starts to come back down. So there is, it depends on that if we're talking sequential or year-over-year from a sequential perspective from Q2 to Q3 within the medical business. That is just the ongoing cost reductions that we would expect to be always in place that continue those initiatives we talked fairly consistently about are there. Within the other type of PPE impacts, like I said from a year-over-year perspective in the second quarter, it was $60 million headwind. There was a small headwind in an absolute basis in the second quarter that we think will be less in the third quarter. So it's a bit of an offset and not significant but generally speaking it's the inflationary impacts. So the most pronounced from a year-over-year as well as expected to be a little bit greater than in the third quarter. And Jailendra, as you do your modeling for the balance of the year, just remember in the prior year we had the significant inventory charge in Q4 that would of course not be expected to replicate here this year."

I would like to turn the conference over to Kevin Moran, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKevin Moran : Good morning and welcome. Today we will discuss Cardinal Health First Quarter Fiscal 2022 results. You can find today's press release and presentation on the IR section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com. Joining me today are Mike Kaufmann, Chief Executive Officer, and Jason Hollar, Chief Financial Officer. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in these statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statements slide at the beginning of our presentation for a full description of these risks and uncertainties. Please note that during our discussion today, our comments will be on a non-GAAP basis unless they are specifically called out as GAAP. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation for all relevant periods can be found in the schedules attached to our press release. During the Q&A portion of today's call. We please ask that you try and limit yourself to one question so that we can try and give everyone an opportunity. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Kaufmann : Thank you, Kevin. And good morning, everyone. Our first-quarter results were in line with our expectations. As we continue to manage through the global pandemic, we're staying focused on the near-term priorities and long-term strategies to drive growth and momentum across our businesses. In Pharma we continue to see sequential volume improvement, and are encouraged by the profit growth that we saw in the first quarter. We believe our Pharma business, inclusive of our strategic growth areas of specialty, nuclear and outcomes is well-positioned for growth in FY\u201922 and beyond. Our Medical segment continues to be impacted by the disruptions in the global supply chain that we called out last quarter. Recently, these pressures have rapidly escalated, and we are experiencing significantly elevated product costs due to international freight and commodities. While we believe the majority of these elevated supply chain costs are temporary, we do not expect them to return to normalized levels this fiscal year. As a result, we are lowering our FY\u201922 outlook for Medical segment profit to adjust for these increased headwinds. We are taking actions to mitigate these impacts across the enterprise. And we're reaffirming our FY\u201922 EPS guidance of $5.60 to $5.90 per share.  We have been on a journey to simplify our portfolio and strengthen our core businesses, so we are positioned for broad-based sustainable growth as noted in the long-term targets we are announcing today. We are prioritizing investment in our strategic growth areas, and in innovative solutions to meet our customers needs today and tomorrow. And with our improved balance sheet, commitment to our dividend, and now an additional $3 billion share repurchase authorization, we are positioned to return capital to shareholders. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our strategy.  Now, I'll turn it over to Jason to discuss our results.\nJason Hollar: Thanks Mike and good morning everyone. I will review our first-quarter results and updated expectations for fiscal '22 before closing with some comments on capital deployment. Beginning with total Company results, first quarter revenue increased 13% to $44 billion driven by sales growth from existing customers. Total gross margin decreased 4% to $1.6 billion driven by the Cordis divestiture and the net impact of elevated supply chain costs in Medical. As a reminder, the sale of Cordis was completed in August second and impacted the quarter's results by approximately two months. SG&A increased 1% reflecting information technology investments in higher costs to support sales growth, partially offset by the Cordis divestiture and benefits from cost savings initiatives. Overall, first quarter operating earnings track in line with our expectations, down 15%. Moving below the line, interest and other decreased by $2 million driven primarily by lower interest expense from continued debt reduction actions. During the first quarter, we exercised a make-whole call provision to redeem $572 million with outstanding June 2022, debt maturities. We continue to expect to repay the approximately $280 million of remaining June 2022 notes upon maturity. Our first quarter effective tax rate was approximately 24%. Average diluted shares outstanding were 289 million, about 4 million shares fewer than the prior year. This reflects prior year share repurchases, as well as the $500 million share repurchase program initiated in the first quarter and recently completed. The net result for the quarter was EPS of $1.29. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $2.5 billion and no outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities. This cash balance also reflects our first annual settlement payment into escrow under the proposed opioid settlement agreement.  Now, turning to the segments beginning with Pharma on Slide 5. Revenue increased 13% to $40 billion, driven primarily by branded pharmaceutical sales growth from large Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty customers. Segment profit grew 1% to $406 million, which reflects an improvement in volumes compared to the prior year quarter, which was adversely impacted by COVID-19. This was largely offset by investments in information technology enhancements. As a reminder, last quarter we began deploying new technology platforms across our Pharmaceutical Distribution business as a part of a multi-year journey to enhance our IT infrastructure. This rollout is tracking according to plan, and we continue to expect incremental implementation and depreciation costs through the first 3 quarters of fiscal '22. As Mike mentioned, during the quarter, we saw broad-based sequential improvement in pharmaceutical demand, including generics. We continue to expect a recovery in generic volumes to pre-Covid levels by the end of the calendar year. Outside the volumes, our generics program continue to experience generally consistent market dynamics along with strong performance from Red Oak. And during the quarter, Pharma saw double-digit contributions from our growth businesses, specialty, nuclear, and outcomes. Transitioning to the Medical segment on Slide 6, Medical revenue increased 5% to $4.1 billion driven primarily by PPE sales, partially offset by the Cordis divestiture. Segment profit decreased 46% to $123 million, primarily due to elevated supply chain costs. To a lesser extent, this also reflects the impact of the Cordis divestiture, as well as net favorability in the prior year attributed to COVID-19. As Mike mentioned, Medical segment profit was negatively impacted by increased product costs due to significant inflationary pressures in our global supply chain, particularly in the areas of commodities and international freight. In commodities, we have seen spikes in some key resins, such as polypropylene, that are inputs into our self-manufactured and source products, with recent index prices nearly double where they were last year. And with international freight, we're seeing ocean container costs at roughly 8 to 10 times pre -COVID levels. We believe the majority of these headwinds are temporary, but we do not expect them to abate this fiscal year. We are taking action, including through pricing and aggressive cost management. I will discuss these impacts to our full-year medical outlook look shortly. To wrap up the quarter, despite some impact from the Delta variant on elective procedure volumes, overall, our customers continue to manage effectively and total elective volumes exited the quarter near 95% of pre-Covid levels. Additionally, lab testing volumes remained significantly elevated above pre-Covid levels, but was not a material driver to the quarter due to the strong performance in the prior year.  Next on slide eight, a few updates to our fiscal 22 outlook. We are reiterating our EPS guidance range of $5.60 to $5.90 per share. This reflects updated expectations for the Medical segment, as well as lower ranges for our tax rate and share count. We now expect our annual effective tax rate in the range of 23% to 25%. We also now expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the range of 280 million to 282 million.  As for the segment outlooks on Slide 9, first we are adjusting our Pharma revenue outlook to low double-digit growth to reflect the strong branded pharmaceutical sales growth that we're seeing from large customers. For medical, we now expect fiscal '22 segment profit to be down mid-single to low double-digits. This change is driven by the significant increases in supply chain costs inflation that I previously discussed, which is expected to result in an incremental net headwind of approximately $100 to $125 million on the year. Given the anticipated timing of realizing these cost increases and our mitigating actions, as well as the timing of selling higher cost PPE, we expect a sequential decline in medical segment [Indiscernible] Stepping back, the only large operational item that we see meaningfully different today compared to our original fiscal '22 guidance is the incremental impact of elevated supply chain costs [Indiscernible] medical. Notably, we do not anticipate any material net impact in Pharma from inflationary supply chain costs. And as noted last quarter, we still expect the cadence of our EPS guidance to be significantly back-half weighted. Now to close, an update on capital deployment. We are focused on deploying capital in a balanced, disciplined, and shareholder-friendly manner, and we'll continue to allocate capital through the lens of our priorities, which are unchanged. We have been on a journey to improve our balance sheet and our portfolio, and have made tremendous progress. As we look forward, we see our debt paydown beginning to moderate, which will provide an increased ability to be more opportunistic with our return of capital to shareholders. On that note, 2 important updates. Our board recently approved a new three-year authorization to repurchase up to an additional $3 billion of our common stock, expiring at the end of calendar year 2024. And we now expect approximately $1 billion of share repurchases in fiscal 22, which includes the $500 million of share repurchases executed to date. We believe that capital deployment, along with the future growth that we expect in both our segments, will be a key driver to the double-digit combined EPS growth and dividend yield that we're targeting in the long term. With that, turn it back over to Mike.\nMike Kaufmann : Thanks, Jason. Throughout the pandemic, we have responded to challenges with resilience and agility, approaching every situation with a focus of delivering for our customers. So they can care for their patients. We're continuing reviewing our business and seeking areas to improve as we navigate the dynamic macroeconomic environment. We are taking action to mitigate elevated costs and manage through temporary supply chain disruptions in medical. These actions include pricing, adjustments, cutting additional costs throughout the organization and accelerating additional growth opportunities. Outside of a continual focus on the customer, we are directing our efforts to 3 main areas that will support our long-term target of mid single to high single-digit growth for the medical segment. First, we are simplifying our operating model. We continue to take decisive action to reposition the business for growth. We divested the Cordis business, and have begun significantly reducing our international commercial footprint. We have announced and are in the process of exiting 36 initial market, which will allow us to focus on the markets where we have a competitive advantage. Additionally, we are further streamlining our medical manufacturing footprint and modernizing our distribution facilities. We expect these simplification initiatives to contribute to our $750 million enterprise cost savings target, and position us to generate sustained long-term growth. Second, we are focused on driving mix through commercial excellence. Our Cardinal brand portfolio has significant breath, with leading brands and clinically differentiated products such as Kendall Compression, Kangaroo Enteral Feeding, and Protexis surgical gloves, among others. While we have made important changes to align our commercial organization structure and incentives, we recognized that we are underpenetrated in Cardinal Health brand mix relative to our potential. An increase in private label penetration across the U.S. in in-channel customer base, represents a significant profit opportunity, with even further opportunities out of channel than internationally. As we move past the pandemic, we see this as a significant opportunity to both deliver savings for our customers and grow our business over the mid to long term. And third, work fueling our medical segment growth businesses. At-Home Solutions and medical services, which includes OptiFreight Logistics and WaveMark. These growth businesses are aligned with industry trends and positioned to capture market share and growth double-digits in FY'22 and beyond. We continue to invest in technology enhancements and innovative solutions that give our businesses a competitive edge. In OptiFreight, we continue to expand our customer base and offerings. And in At Home Solutions, which is now a $2.2 billion business. We continue to see volume growth as scare is rapidly shifting to the home. We are investing in new technologies to drive operational efficiencies and enhanced data visibility. Moving to Pharma. We have 2 primary objectives to achieve our long-term guidance of low to mid-single digit segment growth. Continuing to strengthen our core Pharma Distribution business, and fueling our growth businesses, Specialty, Nuclear, and Outcomes. We will continue to strengthen our core business by focusing in 3 primary areas. First, supporting our diverse customer base. Over 50 years, we've honed our distribution expertise, and developed a strong customer base across multiple classes of trade with leaders in chain pharmacy, direct mail order, grocery, and retail independent customers, all of whom play critical roles in providing health care access to their local communities. Along those lines. During the quarter, we extended our distribution agreements with CVS Health through FY 27. Second, we're managing our generics program to ensure consistent dynamics, which we continue to see and expect. Our generics program is anchored by the scale and expertise of Red Oak sourcing, a partnership we also recently extended through FY 29. Third, we've been investing heavily in our technology to enhance customer experience and drive efficiencies. We are approaching the end of a multi-year investment journey to modernize our IT infrastructure, which will yield meaningful working capital improvements and operational efficiencies. As for our second overall Pharma objective, fueling our growth businesses. We continue to expect these 3 businesses to realize double-digit growth over the next several years. And as these businesses grow, it will become a bigger portion of the overall Pharma segment. In Specialty, key downstream and upstream initiatives will enable our growth. In Oncology, we're competing differently downstream by transforming from a distribution lab orientation to a focus on supporting independent oncology practices with solutions to thrive in a value-based care environment. We're seeing commercial momentum with Navista TS, our technology platform that helps oncology practices improve their performance in value-based care. We have a strong presence in other therapeutic areas, such as rheumatology, which today is a $4 billion distribution market growing double-digit. We're also encouraged by the anticipated growth biosimilars as more products come to market, such as the FDA approval for the first interchangeable bio similar insulin product. We're well-positioned to support the next phase of biosimilar growth as adoption increases in areas outside of oncology. Upstream, we are expecting strong growth from higher-margin services supporting biopharma manufacturers. We operate a leading 3PL supporting hundreds of manufacturers that continues to see wins, and support new products coming to market, such as in the area of cell and gene therapy. The nuclear, we are expecting continued double-digit profit growth, resulting in a doubling of our processes in this business by FY 26. We continue to build up our multi-million-dollar center for Theranostics advancement in Indianapolis and are investing to expand our pack capabilities. We're partnering with several companies to grow the pipeline of novel Theranostics. For example, through our agreement with TerraPower, we will produce and distribute Actinium-225, a radionuclide involved in creating targeted therapies for several cancer types. And in outcomes, we continue to see and expect strong growth. This business has added new payers and PBMs, and is expanding clinical solutions for both independent pharmacies and retail chains to include solutions for medical billing, point-of-care testing, and other clinical capabilities. With respect to the enterprise, we continue to aggressively review our cost structure as we work to streamline, simplify, and strengthen our operations and execute our digital transformation. As I mentioned earlier, we recently increased our total cost reduction goal to $750 million by FY2023, and we are on track to deliver those savings. We're paring cost reduction efforts with balance, discipline, and shareholder-friendly capital allocation, with a focus on investing in the business, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and returning cash to shareholders. Long-term, we're targeting a double-digit combined EPS growth and dividend yield. These expectations are driven by our growth targets for our segments, our commitment to our dividend, and our new $3 billion share repurchase authorization. Now, let me provide an update on the proposed opioid settlement agreement and settlement process. In September, we announced that enough states agreed to settle to proceed to the next phase, and each participating state is offering its political subdivisions the opportunity to participate in the settlement for an additional 120 day period, which ends on January 2nd, 2022. At that point, each of the distributors and the states will have the opportunity to determine whether there is a sufficient participation to proceed with the agreement. If all conditions are satisfied, this agreement would result in a settlement of a substantial majority of opioid lawsuits filed by the state and local governmental entities. This is an important step forward for our Company. As we've consistently said, we remain committed to being part of the solution to the U.S. opioid epidemic, and believe the settlement would provide relief for our communities and certainty for our shareholders. Turning to ESG, these priorities remain critical to achieving a healthier, more sustainable world. We recently announced goals to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030, and increase minority representation in our global workforce by 2030. In closing, what we do matters. And it is our privilege to serve our customers, their patients, and their communities around the world. And now, Jason, I will take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you [Indiscernible] [Operator Instructions]. We'll pause for a moment to assemble the queue. And our first question will come from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan, please go ahead.\nLisa Gill: Thanks very much. Good morning, Mike and Jason and thank you for all the comments. Mike, I just want to go back to your comments around simplifying the operating model on the medical supply side, and, where you talked about driving the mix of Cardinal branded products. One, can you remind us what percentage of sales say are Cardinal branded products. And then 2, can you talk about the margin differential on those products? And then my third and last question would just be that, now that you have the divestiture of Cordis behind you -- the sale of Cordis behind you, are there other assets within Medical that would make sense to divest?\nMike Kaufmann : Thanks, Lisa. Thanks for the question. Tough questions to answer, because these aren't things we have historically given. Obviously I can say this. We believe there is plenty of room to grow. Some of our accounts were significantly penetrated in and others obviously were less penetrated in. So we do have good target by account that we're going after. So we think there's plenty of opportunity in there. It's one of the key reasons we believe in our longer-term guidance for Medical is the fact that we can do that. As far as margin rates go, generally, they are much more higher as a percentage and dollars and national brand. There are times and certain preferred brand programs, which is why we have them that we do prefer national brand.  But in general, as a rule of thumb, our margin rates are much more significant on our Cardinal sourced or Cardinal manufactured products.  And then lastly around Cordis, we're always looking at our entire portfolio of businesses to make sure we have the right type of businesses where we are positioned to win. There's nothing that sticks out to me in terms of a certain product category or that, but we are, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we are exiting 36 countries. So not only do we look at products, we look at products by country and countries, and where we don't believe we have significant growth opportunity, whether it might be too much risk versus benefit, etc. We have made real conscious decisions to aggressively manage the number of countries and which is why we are exiting 36 countries to help simplify the model.\nOperator: All right. And up next, we will take a question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nCharles Rhyee : Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Mike and Jason, I want to just talk a little bit about the long-term growth targets a little bit here. I guess first is when we're starting the jump off point for these -- for the earnings and earnings growth, are you starting from fiscal '22. And is that a 5-year target that we should be thinking about or are we jumping off from fiscal '21 as the baseline year?  And then secondly, within that, can you just remind us again, what the -- obviously the earnings this year are back half-way -- just remind us what the tailwinds that we should be considering as we build our model for the remainder of this fiscal year. And then lastly, those higher freight and shipping costs, do you assume those go away after this year as we think about it in relation to the long-term targets? Thanks.\nJason Hollar : Hi. Good morning, this is Jason, I'll try to capture all those points. Your question is certainly fair as it relates to trying to define the baseline for those longer-term targets. As we indicated in the remarks today, we do anticipate this additional $100 million to a $125 million related to the inflationary environment as temporary. It's difficult certainly to define exactly if that's short-term, medium-term, or longer-term. And at the current moment, we would expect those to revert back to some normalized level in a time frame that is relatively short to medium term. And so when we talk about these longer-term targets, we are not presuming that type of tailwind, right. So it isn't a more normalized state when we provide those targets. You referenced 5-year, so I'd say 3 to 5 years is a reasonable type of time frame for average types of performance levels, to get a broad perspective on the ins and the outs, but we would not expect big shocks associated with items like that, divestitures and acquisitions, things that nature would also be normalized out of that so that we're getting at that core type of performance. And then as it relates to more specifics around elevated supply chain cost, we highlighted within our remarks that its really just two key areas; the international freight and the commodities. In both cases, the reason we believe that they are temporary is that they are at multiple levels higher than what we've historically seen on international freight, which is essentially the cost of getting a shipping container shipped from overseas locations such as Asia to the U.S. We're seeing that cost up 8 to 10 times versus pre -COVID levels. Certainly we would expect that to be significantly lower at some point in the future. And on the commodities, we're talking about a lot of different types of polymers, such as polypropylene. Those levels are more like 2x what we've seen historically. So again, we would expect those to get back to a more normalized state at some point in the future. But again, those are not tailwinds to get us to these targets, those targets are more normalized.  In terms of the second half, a different cadence of our results for the various businesses, we did indicate that with Pharma, we would expect the second half to continue to improve steadily versus where we're at today. Just as it relates to getting back to more normalized stay for underlying generics volume. So that continues to be as expected and also as expected, our investments in our technology investments, we indicated would be front-end loaded, especially with the first three quarters, primarily as it relates to that fourth-quarter. We started to implement those cost increases in the final implementation last Q4. So we start to get the full-year effect of that as we exit the third quarter here. On the Medical side, we did indicate a sequential decline from Q1 to Q2, and that's just related to the timing of realizing that supply chain cost I was just walking through, and all of the mitigating actions that go along with that. And then, also recall that we cited the COVID favorability in Q2 of last year that is not expected to repeat, and in fact, we expect that to be a headwind to this Q2 primarily as a result of the PPE price and cost timing. So we have that Q1 to Q2 cadence. And then of course in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year, we'd expect a significant COVID tailwind associated with the comparison benefit from the PPE in the prior year. And then in all of our businesses, we expect ongoing stronger contributions from our growth businesses as we see the effects of various initiatives and investments that have been put in place over the course of last year.  Next question.\nOperator: And next question will come from Eric Percher with Nephron Research, please go ahead.\nEric Percher: Thank you. Appreciate the supply chain commentary. I'd like to get a little bit deeper here. We used to have guidance on commodity impact. So I think anything you can provide relative to $17 [billion] (ph) of revenue or the cost that you incur to give us some sense there. And then thinking about commodity and freight, what is clearly passed along versus what represents a decision that has to be made? And what I'm really looking for is $100 million to $125 million of increased expense. What does that represent relative to the total expense that you're seeing passed through?\nMike Kaufmann : Yeah. Thanks for the question. So let me see if I could help. First of all, we as you know, called out in our fourth quarter of last year that we did expect elevated supply chain costs. So in our guidance for this year for the medical segment, we already assumed a certain amount of elevated supply chain costs, some of which we have plans already to offset through cost reductions, pricing actions, and those types of things, and that was originally built-in. What we saw during the quarter, particularly as the quarter went on, was a significant increase in those supply chain costs, most notably in international freight, high containers that we talked about, as well as commodities. And those we feel will create an incremental $100 to a $125 million of costs for us. Roughly, I would say that $100 to a $125 is split relatively evenly between the impact of commodities and the impact of freight costs. So they were both very, very significant and we saw other minor ones in other areas, but those were the really 2 big ones, both of which we believe are temporary because 1. as Jason said earlier, they are at all-time highs for the most part, significantly higher than where they were and we believe that over time, the market will adjust and those will be able to come back down. So what are we doing about that? That is a net number, the $100 to $125 obviously since we called that out as the adjustments of Medical guidance, is that we are getting after it through pricing actions, passing some of it through. It's hard to really talk about exactly which once you can pass through or not. The market is very complicated. There are contracts that we have to work through. We have to work with our partners, both the hospitals and the GPOs. We have to understand the supply and demand dynamics of each item in the environment. And so we are working through and understanding all of those factors but there is some additional pricing action built into that number. And then obviously since we maintain guidance for the entire Company, we are taking aggressive cost actions across the Company. We are leveraging our improved balance sheet. And we're also focusing on our growth businesses, and pushing our teams to do more faster there. So those are some -- I hope some helpful comments.\nJason Hollar: And the only thing I'd add is that this increase is not -- it's related to 2 parts. It's a greater increase in both of these areas of international freight and commodities, but it's also longer expected duration. We had anticipated that they would come back to more normalized levels a bit earlier. So we saw a higher spike and a longer duration. And in terms of just how you model it through on revenue, I'd like to draw -- just draw a little bit of distinction. With PPE, we saw many, many times higher total impact on that product cost, and so we saw a much more significant number of dollars in both cost and revenue that came through. While this is still significant, it's much less meaningful from a revenue perspective, and is not moving that needle nearly as much. Next question.\nOperator: And next we'll hear from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Please go ahead.\nKevin Caliendo : Thanks for taking my question. So if I'm doing the math right, it appears that the bad guy that is the incremental supply chain costs is larger than the good guy, the lower share count, and perhaps the lower tax rate. Am I doing -- am I thinking about that right. And the fact that you didn't change guidance, is that just you're still within the range but maybe it's the lower end of the range or you were just giving yourself a little room. How should we think about that?\nJason Hollar : Yeah. I think your math is accurate for the items that we typically provide guidance. One area that's not explicitly called out but is implied is just the underlying other corporate expenses. And as we referenced a few times already in Mike's specific comments, there's broad-based cost reductions, the $750 million program which we increased by $250 million last quarter, is enterprise-wide and that includes the corporate function. So we have identified additional corporate cost reduction actions that are not included in either of the segments, but do fall through to the bottom line, the total segment profit as well as our earnings per share.\nMike Kaufmann: Next question, please.\nOperator: And next we'll hear from Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cherny: Good morning. I want to dive a little bit more into some of the long-term guidance and concurrent contrast that with the dynamics you're seeing right now in terms of supply chain. I know that a lot of these are already control and clearly, some companies in the space are seeing similar approaches. That being said, as you think about the ways you interact with your customers now, and interact with your partners and supplier partners, are there any ways that you can continue to evolve your business so that maybe we don't see ever spikes like this. But some of the fluctuations and volatility that you have seen at the supply chain in the past. And I'm thinking particularly on some of the raw material cost spikes that do come up from time-to-time. Are ways that can be mitigated in a more systematic fashion going forward so we don't have this level of volatility and [Indiscernible] surprise for stuff that, as I mentioned, a lot of it is -- tends to be out of your control.\nMike Kaufmann : Yeah. I really appreciate the question. It's a really good one. So let me step back and hit a couple of different pieces, and I'll finish with your question on medical, but I'll take a shot here to emphasize a few others. So there's really, I would say, 3 obviously components to our long-term target, which our long-term target we're talking about is having a double-digit combined EPS growth and dividend yield on averages as Jason mentioned. In Pharma, the -- to your point, we don't really see those fluctuations in commodities and costs affecting their business generally, because if it does, it generally happens in the form of the drugs having increases, which in that model, are able to be passed on and work through the model. And so our goal of low single-digit to mid-single-digit growth in Pharma is really focused on strengthening that [Indiscernible] balance, getting that right mix of generics, making sure we're managing the balancing through of our margin initiatives and all that as well as then driving our growth businesses, specialty nuclear in out comes, and we gave some color on those. Hopefully, you found helpful and exciting for instance nuclear doubling in the next five-years especially, continuing and outcomes continuing with double-digit growth. We believe the combination of getting that PD business stabilize, which we're seeing and then seeing the growth there is really what's going to drive that. And then of course we mentioned in the use of capital being able to having our debt lower commitment to our dividend, and then the share repurchases. On medical as you mentioned, it's a couple of different things that simplify our operating model, focusing on driving mix and filling our growth businesses. I won't go into those details because we did in the comments. But to your question rollout kind of changes can we make that help. It's really one of the things we are working on with customers right now is how do we change our contracts with our customers to give us more flexibility when there is sudden significant changes in the supply chain, that there is some ability to raise price. Our discussions with our customer -- our customers are being very transparent. We want to be able to make sure that if we're able to do that, we're very willing to tie those things -- indexes and things so they understand that as they come back down. We're not -- we're going to pass lower-cost back on to them, because we don't want to look at this as a necessarily a chance to improve our margins. We'd like to do that through driving mix and launching more products, not on the backs of our customers during a supply chain. So we are working with them to create contracting methods that will allow us to be able to pass those on, as well as help them understand what are the metrics we will do to be able to know for them when they're changed the other direction too.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Jailendra Singh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nAdamHeussner: Hi. This is Adam on for Jailendra today. Thanks for taking the question. Going back to your long-term growth targets, just wondering if you take into account the capital allocated to the anticipate opioid segment payments or how we should be thinking about that potential impact as it relates to being able to invest across some of your growth and higher-margin businesses?\nJason Hollar: Yes. Good morning, Adams, Jason. Yes. That would incorporate that as we think about the capital deployment side of that. We have for quite some time now included in an expectation of what those payments would be. That's all based upon our current set of assumptions, of course that I would change materially, and that would change your answer, but based upon what we know now, that would be the baseline, for example, the $3 billion share repurchase authorization that we have just completed is inclusive of that as well, as a part of the capital outlay that we would expect over that period of time, and this would be the available capital beyond that. Next question.\nOperator: And up next we'll take a question from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSteven Valiquette: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Just a question on the Medical segment. You mentioned that despite some impact from the Delta variant, that the total elective volumes exited the quarter near 95% of pre -COVID levels. I guess I'm curious if there's any updates on your assumptions for the pace of return to procedures for the remainder of fiscal '22. Is this also a positive factor that helps to offset some of the negatives that you discussed within the Medical segment. Thanks.\nMike Kaufmann : Yeah. The -- there was a little bit of a reduction in that base -- in that level of elective procedures in the first quarter. We started the quarter at close to pre -COVID levels. And as we indicated, we exited in the back at about 95%. And we think that's primarily attributed to the Delta variant. So we see that trending in the right direction. And with the pace of the virus since then, we feel that will continue to improve. And importantly, what we saw in the quarter is we saw an improvement in our Lab business that effectively offset that modest deterioration in the amount of elective procedures. So what we're seeing right now is that those two items tend to generally offset both good and bad depending upon the pace of the virus. So it's nothing significant that we saw in the quarter and as a result, we don't anticipate there being wild fluctuations going forward. Next question.\nOperator: And next we'll take a question from Stuart Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nStuart Hill: Good morning, guys and this is the second time this earnings season has been [Indiscernible] Jason and Mike, just a quick question on the long-term guide, which is, over the long term, how do you think about the underlying operating earnings growth contribution versus the capital deployment or inorganic growth contribution?\nMike Kaufmann : I think if you -- as you break down the long-term targets, when we were really talking about Pharma being low single-digit to mid-single-digit growth, we're really talking about the operating earnings of that segment being in the low-single to mid-single Medical being in mid-single to high single digit. And then the rest of it would come from our dividend yield, as well as capital deployment around REPO to get to the double-digit combined EPS growth and dividend yield. So the guidance on medical and foremost really about operating earnings and I would also say that M&A is not a top priority and that that may occur, and we may have some of that here and there. That is one option with capital deployment. But this is really more focused on what we talked about, operating earnings growth as well as dividend yield and opportunistic repo. Next question.\nOperator: All right. And our last question will come from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRicky Goldwasser: Good morning, so on the long-term double-digit growth, I know you talked about the growth rate being sort of on a normalized basis. So should we take that long term double digit growth back out from 2020 to guidance sort of the abnormal costs that you are seeing, normalized for them and then apply that growth rate to get to 2023. That's the first part of the question and then secondly, as we think about these transitory costs in nature. You talked about a $100 to a$ 125 million costs related to the supply chain. What's the contribution of labor cost to that headwind? Because when we think about labor costs, we think about it as potentially more structural because once you raise someone salaries, it's difficult to bring it back down. So how should we think about that component within the additional cost?\nJason Hollar : Sure. Good morning, Ricky. This is Jason. I'll start. As we talked about our long-term target, it's not expected or intended to be each and every year. There's a reason that we do a highlight that is an average over that period of time. So we're not providing fiscal '23 guidance with the statement. With that said, we think that there are over these longer periods of time that these would be the primary drivers and expectations we would have for our businesses. And how you described at about the normalized level as an example that 100 to 125 five were -- we indicated that we anticipate these costs remain elevated for the balance of fiscal '22, we're not taking a position at this point as to how much, if any, carries over into fiscal '23, that is a terrific example of an important element of fiscal '23 guidance that we will provide in the future that is not at this point something that we feel comfortable being able to identify. And then your question about labor is a great one. We did not call it out because it is very consistent with what we had last quarter. So while labor, inflation, and those pressures are very real for us, like the whole industry, we are not seeing anything new and unique this quarter versus last quarter, and so we're not adding in any additional costs for that. But I would also highlight that even what was included in the original guidance was not nearly as substantial as the cost that we're referencing for and what was included before for commodities and international freight. Those are clearly the most significant items that drive that fluctuation, and items like labor as well as more domestic related costs such as domestic transportation and other fuel are all relatively low compared to those other 2 primary items, the international freight and commodities.\nOperator: And that concludes our Q&A session for today. I will turn the call back over to CEO, Mike Kaufmann for closing remarks.\nMike Kaufmann: I want to thank everybody for taking the time to be on the call today and for all of your questions. I'd like to conclude with just a few thoughts. I know the elevated product costs within the Medical Segment carried a lot of attention here today. But I want to just reiterate that, 1. We do believe the majority of these costs are temporary. 2. That we're taking aggressive enterprise-wide actions to help mitigate. And 3. We did reaffirm our non-GAAP EPS guidance. Additionally, in Pharma, we are encouraged by the profit growth we saw in the quarter, and the ongoing resiliency in this business. With an additional $3 billion share repurchase authorization and our commitment to our dividend, we are positioned to return capital to shareholders while prioritizing investment in our growth businesses, simplifying our operating model, and strengthening our core businesses. And together this gives us confidence in achieving the new long-term growth targets that we provided. With that, thank you again. We hope you all have a good day.\nOperator: And this concludes today's call. We thank you again for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mike Kaufmann",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. And good morning, everyone. Our first-quarter results were in line with our expectations. As we continue to manage through the global pandemic, we're staying focused on the near-term priorities and long-term strategies to drive growth and momentum across our businesses. In Pharma we continue to see sequential volume improvement, and are encouraged by the profit growth that we saw in the first quarter. We believe our Pharma business, inclusive of our strategic growth areas of specialty, nuclear and outcomes is well-positioned for growth in FY'22 and beyond. Our Medical segment continues to be impacted by the disruptions in the global supply chain that we called out last quarter. Recently, these pressures have rapidly escalated, and we are experiencing significantly elevated product costs due to international freight and commodities. While we believe the majority of these elevated supply chain costs are temporary, we do not expect them to return to normalized levels this fiscal year. As a result, we are lowering our FY'22 outlook for Medical segment profit to adjust for these increased headwinds. We are taking actions to mitigate these impacts across the enterprise. And we're reaffirming our FY'22 EPS guidance of $5.60 to $5.90 per share.  We have been on a journey to simplify our portfolio and strengthen our core businesses, so we are positioned for broad-based sustainable growth as noted in the long-term targets we are announcing today. We are prioritizing investment in our strategic growth areas, and in innovative solutions to meet our customers needs today and tomorrow. And with our improved balance sheet, commitment to our dividend, and now an additional $3 billion share repurchase authorization, we are positioned to return capital to shareholders. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our strategy.  Now, I'll turn it over to Jason to discuss our results. Thanks, Jason. Throughout the pandemic, we have responded to challenges with resilience and agility, approaching every situation with a focus of delivering for our customers. So they can care for their patients. We're continuing reviewing our business and seeking areas to improve as we navigate the dynamic macroeconomic environment. We are taking action to mitigate elevated costs and manage through temporary supply chain disruptions in medical. These actions include pricing, adjustments, cutting additional costs throughout the organization and accelerating additional growth opportunities. Outside of a continual focus on the customer, we are directing our efforts to 3 main areas that will support our long-term target of mid single to high single-digit growth for the medical segment. First, we are simplifying our operating model. We continue to take decisive action to reposition the business for growth. We divested the Cordis business, and have begun significantly reducing our international commercial footprint. We have announced and are in the process of exiting 36 initial market, which will allow us to focus on the markets where we have a competitive advantage. Additionally, we are further streamlining our medical manufacturing footprint and modernizing our distribution facilities. We expect these simplification initiatives to contribute to our $750 million enterprise cost savings target, and position us to generate sustained long-term growth. Second, we are focused on driving mix through commercial excellence. Our Cardinal brand portfolio has significant breath, with leading brands and clinically differentiated products such as Kendall Compression, Kangaroo Enteral Feeding, and Protexis surgical gloves, among others. While we have made important changes to align our commercial organization structure and incentives, we recognized that we are underpenetrated in Cardinal Health brand mix relative to our potential. An increase in private label penetration across the U.S. in in-channel customer base, represents a significant profit opportunity, with even further opportunities out of channel than internationally. As we move past the pandemic, we see this as a significant opportunity to both deliver savings for our customers and grow our business over the mid to long term. And third, work fueling our medical segment growth businesses. At-Home Solutions and medical services, which includes OptiFreight Logistics and WaveMark. These growth businesses are aligned with industry trends and positioned to capture market share and growth double-digits in FY'22 and beyond. We continue to invest in technology enhancements and innovative solutions that give our businesses a competitive edge. In OptiFreight, we continue to expand our customer base and offerings. And in At Home Solutions, which is now a $2.2 billion business. We continue to see volume growth as scare is rapidly shifting to the home. We are investing in new technologies to drive operational efficiencies and enhanced data visibility. Moving to Pharma. We have 2 primary objectives to achieve our long-term guidance of low to mid-single digit segment growth. Continuing to strengthen our core Pharma Distribution business, and fueling our growth businesses, Specialty, Nuclear, and Outcomes. We will continue to strengthen our core business by focusing in 3 primary areas. First, supporting our diverse customer base. Over 50 years, we've honed our distribution expertise, and developed a strong customer base across multiple classes of trade with leaders in chain pharmacy, direct mail order, grocery, and retail independent customers, all of whom play critical roles in providing health care access to their local communities. Along those lines. During the quarter, we extended our distribution agreements with CVS Health through FY 27. Second, we're managing our generics program to ensure consistent dynamics, which we continue to see and expect. Our generics program is anchored by the scale and expertise of Red Oak sourcing, a partnership we also recently extended through FY 29. Third, we've been investing heavily in our technology to enhance customer experience and drive efficiencies. We are approaching the end of a multi-year investment journey to modernize our IT infrastructure, which will yield meaningful working capital improvements and operational efficiencies. As for our second overall Pharma objective, fueling our growth businesses. We continue to expect these 3 businesses to realize double-digit growth over the next several years. And as these businesses grow, it will become a bigger portion of the overall Pharma segment. In Specialty, key downstream and upstream initiatives will enable our growth. In Oncology, we're competing differently downstream by transforming from a distribution lab orientation to a focus on supporting independent oncology practices with solutions to thrive in a value-based care environment. We're seeing commercial momentum with Navista TS, our technology platform that helps oncology practices improve their performance in value-based care. We have a strong presence in other therapeutic areas, such as rheumatology, which today is a $4 billion distribution market growing double-digit. We're also encouraged by the anticipated growth biosimilars as more products come to market, such as the FDA approval for the first interchangeable bio similar insulin product. We're well-positioned to support the next phase of biosimilar growth as adoption increases in areas outside of oncology. Upstream, we are expecting strong growth from higher-margin services supporting biopharma manufacturers. We operate a leading 3PL supporting hundreds of manufacturers that continues to see wins, and support new products coming to market, such as in the area of cell and gene therapy. The nuclear, we are expecting continued double-digit profit growth, resulting in a doubling of our processes in this business by FY 26. We continue to build up our multi-million-dollar center for Theranostics advancement in Indianapolis and are investing to expand our pack capabilities. We're partnering with several companies to grow the pipeline of novel Theranostics. For example, through our agreement with TerraPower, we will produce and distribute Actinium-225, a radionuclide involved in creating targeted therapies for several cancer types. And in outcomes, we continue to see and expect strong growth. This business has added new payers and PBMs, and is expanding clinical solutions for both independent pharmacies and retail chains to include solutions for medical billing, point-of-care testing, and other clinical capabilities. With respect to the enterprise, we continue to aggressively review our cost structure as we work to streamline, simplify, and strengthen our operations and execute our digital transformation. As I mentioned earlier, we recently increased our total cost reduction goal to $750 million by FY2023, and we are on track to deliver those savings. We're paring cost reduction efforts with balance, discipline, and shareholder-friendly capital allocation, with a focus on investing in the business, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and returning cash to shareholders. Long-term, we're targeting a double-digit combined EPS growth and dividend yield. These expectations are driven by our growth targets for our segments, our commitment to our dividend, and our new $3 billion share repurchase authorization. Now, let me provide an update on the proposed opioid settlement agreement and settlement process. In September, we announced that enough states agreed to settle to proceed to the next phase, and each participating state is offering its political subdivisions the opportunity to participate in the settlement for an additional 120 day period, which ends on January 2nd, 2022. At that point, each of the distributors and the states will have the opportunity to determine whether there is a sufficient participation to proceed with the agreement. If all conditions are satisfied, this agreement would result in a settlement of a substantial majority of opioid lawsuits filed by the state and local governmental entities. This is an important step forward for our Company. As we've consistently said, we remain committed to being part of the solution to the U.S. opioid epidemic, and believe the settlement would provide relief for our communities and certainty for our shareholders. Turning to ESG, these priorities remain critical to achieving a healthier, more sustainable world. We recently announced goals to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030, and increase minority representation in our global workforce by 2030. In closing, what we do matters. And it is our privilege to serve our customers, their patients, and their communities around the world. And now, Jason, I will take your questions. Thanks, Lisa. Thanks for the question. Tough questions to answer, because these aren't things we have historically given. Obviously I can say this. We believe there is plenty of room to grow. Some of our accounts were significantly penetrated in and others obviously were less penetrated in. So we do have good target by account that we're going after. So we think there's plenty of opportunity in there. It's one of the key reasons we believe in our longer-term guidance for Medical is the fact that we can do that. As far as margin rates go, generally, they are much more higher as a percentage and dollars and national brand. There are times and certain preferred brand programs, which is why we have them that we do prefer national brand.  But in general, as a rule of thumb, our margin rates are much more significant on our Cardinal sourced or Cardinal manufactured products.  And then lastly around Cordis, we're always looking at our entire portfolio of businesses to make sure we have the right type of businesses where we are positioned to win. There's nothing that sticks out to me in terms of a certain product category or that, but we are, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we are exiting 36 countries. So not only do we look at products, we look at products by country and countries, and where we don't believe we have significant growth opportunity, whether it might be too much risk versus benefit, etc. We have made real conscious decisions to aggressively manage the number of countries and which is why we are exiting 36 countries to help simplify the model. Yeah. Thanks for the question. So let me see if I could help. First of all, we as you know, called out in our fourth quarter of last year that we did expect elevated supply chain costs. So in our guidance for this year for the medical segment, we already assumed a certain amount of elevated supply chain costs, some of which we have plans already to offset through cost reductions, pricing actions, and those types of things, and that was originally built-in. What we saw during the quarter, particularly as the quarter went on, was a significant increase in those supply chain costs, most notably in international freight, high containers that we talked about, as well as commodities. And those we feel will create an incremental $100 to a $125 million of costs for us. Roughly, I would say that $100 to a $125 is split relatively evenly between the impact of commodities and the impact of freight costs. So they were both very, very significant and we saw other minor ones in other areas, but those were the really 2 big ones, both of which we believe are temporary because 1. as Jason said earlier, they are at all-time highs for the most part, significantly higher than where they were and we believe that over time, the market will adjust and those will be able to come back down. So what are we doing about that? That is a net number, the $100 to $125 obviously since we called that out as the adjustments of Medical guidance, is that we are getting after it through pricing actions, passing some of it through. It's hard to really talk about exactly which once you can pass through or not. The market is very complicated. There are contracts that we have to work through. We have to work with our partners, both the hospitals and the GPOs. We have to understand the supply and demand dynamics of each item in the environment. And so we are working through and understanding all of those factors but there is some additional pricing action built into that number. And then obviously since we maintain guidance for the entire Company, we are taking aggressive cost actions across the Company. We are leveraging our improved balance sheet. And we're also focusing on our growth businesses, and pushing our teams to do more faster there. So those are some -- I hope some helpful comments. Next question, please. Yeah. I really appreciate the question. It's a really good one. So let me step back and hit a couple of different pieces, and I'll finish with your question on medical, but I'll take a shot here to emphasize a few others. So there's really, I would say, 3 obviously components to our long-term target, which our long-term target we're talking about is having a double-digit combined EPS growth and dividend yield on averages as Jason mentioned. In Pharma, the -- to your point, we don't really see those fluctuations in commodities and costs affecting their business generally, because if it does, it generally happens in the form of the drugs having increases, which in that model, are able to be passed on and work through the model. And so our goal of low single-digit to mid-single-digit growth in Pharma is really focused on strengthening that [Indiscernible] balance, getting that right mix of generics, making sure we're managing the balancing through of our margin initiatives and all that as well as then driving our growth businesses, specialty nuclear in out comes, and we gave some color on those. Hopefully, you found helpful and exciting for instance nuclear doubling in the next five-years especially, continuing and outcomes continuing with double-digit growth. We believe the combination of getting that PD business stabilize, which we're seeing and then seeing the growth there is really what's going to drive that. And then of course we mentioned in the use of capital being able to having our debt lower commitment to our dividend, and then the share repurchases. On medical as you mentioned, it's a couple of different things that simplify our operating model, focusing on driving mix and filling our growth businesses. I won't go into those details because we did in the comments. But to your question rollout kind of changes can we make that help. It's really one of the things we are working on with customers right now is how do we change our contracts with our customers to give us more flexibility when there is sudden significant changes in the supply chain, that there is some ability to raise price. Our discussions with our customer -- our customers are being very transparent. We want to be able to make sure that if we're able to do that, we're very willing to tie those things -- indexes and things so they understand that as they come back down. We're not -- we're going to pass lower-cost back on to them, because we don't want to look at this as a necessarily a chance to improve our margins. We'd like to do that through driving mix and launching more products, not on the backs of our customers during a supply chain. So we are working with them to create contracting methods that will allow us to be able to pass those on, as well as help them understand what are the metrics we will do to be able to know for them when they're changed the other direction too. Yeah. The -- there was a little bit of a reduction in that base -- in that level of elective procedures in the first quarter. We started the quarter at close to pre -COVID levels. And as we indicated, we exited in the back at about 95%. And we think that's primarily attributed to the Delta variant. So we see that trending in the right direction. And with the pace of the virus since then, we feel that will continue to improve. And importantly, what we saw in the quarter is we saw an improvement in our Lab business that effectively offset that modest deterioration in the amount of elective procedures. So what we're seeing right now is that those two items tend to generally offset both good and bad depending upon the pace of the virus. So it's nothing significant that we saw in the quarter and as a result, we don't anticipate there being wild fluctuations going forward. Next question. I think if you -- as you break down the long-term targets, when we were really talking about Pharma being low single-digit to mid-single-digit growth, we're really talking about the operating earnings of that segment being in the low-single to mid-single Medical being in mid-single to high single digit. And then the rest of it would come from our dividend yield, as well as capital deployment around REPO to get to the double-digit combined EPS growth and dividend yield. So the guidance on medical and foremost really about operating earnings and I would also say that M&A is not a top priority and that that may occur, and we may have some of that here and there. That is one option with capital deployment. But this is really more focused on what we talked about, operating earnings growth as well as dividend yield and opportunistic repo. Next question. I want to thank everybody for taking the time to be on the call today and for all of your questions. I'd like to conclude with just a few thoughts. I know the elevated product costs within the Medical Segment carried a lot of attention here today. But I want to just reiterate that, 1. We do believe the majority of these costs are temporary. 2. That we're taking aggressive enterprise-wide actions to help mitigate. And 3. We did reaffirm our non-GAAP EPS guidance. Additionally, in Pharma, we are encouraged by the profit growth we saw in the quarter, and the ongoing resiliency in this business. With an additional $3 billion share repurchase authorization and our commitment to our dividend, we are positioned to return capital to shareholders while prioritizing investment in our growth businesses, simplifying our operating model, and strengthening our core businesses. And together this gives us confidence in achieving the new long-term growth targets that we provided. With that, thank you again. We hope you all have a good day."

            "name": "Jason Hollar",
            "content": "Thanks Mike and good morning everyone. I will review our first-quarter results and updated expectations for fiscal '22 before closing with some comments on capital deployment. Beginning with total Company results, first quarter revenue increased 13% to $44 billion driven by sales growth from existing customers. Total gross margin decreased 4% to $1.6 billion driven by the Cordis divestiture and the net impact of elevated supply chain costs in Medical. As a reminder, the sale of Cordis was completed in August second and impacted the quarter's results by approximately two months. SG&A increased 1% reflecting information technology investments in higher costs to support sales growth, partially offset by the Cordis divestiture and benefits from cost savings initiatives. Overall, first quarter operating earnings track in line with our expectations, down 15%. Moving below the line, interest and other decreased by $2 million driven primarily by lower interest expense from continued debt reduction actions. During the first quarter, we exercised a make-whole call provision to redeem $572 million with outstanding June 2022, debt maturities. We continue to expect to repay the approximately $280 million of remaining June 2022 notes upon maturity. Our first quarter effective tax rate was approximately 24%. Average diluted shares outstanding were 289 million, about 4 million shares fewer than the prior year. This reflects prior year share repurchases, as well as the $500 million share repurchase program initiated in the first quarter and recently completed. The net result for the quarter was EPS of $1.29. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $2.5 billion and no outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities. This cash balance also reflects our first annual settlement payment into escrow under the proposed opioid settlement agreement.  Now, turning to the segments beginning with Pharma on Slide 5. Revenue increased 13% to $40 billion, driven primarily by branded pharmaceutical sales growth from large Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty customers. Segment profit grew 1% to $406 million, which reflects an improvement in volumes compared to the prior year quarter, which was adversely impacted by COVID-19. This was largely offset by investments in information technology enhancements. As a reminder, last quarter we began deploying new technology platforms across our Pharmaceutical Distribution business as a part of a multi-year journey to enhance our IT infrastructure. This rollout is tracking according to plan, and we continue to expect incremental implementation and depreciation costs through the first 3 quarters of fiscal '22. As Mike mentioned, during the quarter, we saw broad-based sequential improvement in pharmaceutical demand, including generics. We continue to expect a recovery in generic volumes to pre-Covid levels by the end of the calendar year. Outside the volumes, our generics program continue to experience generally consistent market dynamics along with strong performance from Red Oak. And during the quarter, Pharma saw double-digit contributions from our growth businesses, specialty, nuclear, and outcomes. Transitioning to the Medical segment on Slide 6, Medical revenue increased 5% to $4.1 billion driven primarily by PPE sales, partially offset by the Cordis divestiture. Segment profit decreased 46% to $123 million, primarily due to elevated supply chain costs. To a lesser extent, this also reflects the impact of the Cordis divestiture, as well as net favorability in the prior year attributed to COVID-19. As Mike mentioned, Medical segment profit was negatively impacted by increased product costs due to significant inflationary pressures in our global supply chain, particularly in the areas of commodities and international freight. In commodities, we have seen spikes in some key resins, such as polypropylene, that are inputs into our self-manufactured and source products, with recent index prices nearly double where they were last year. And with international freight, we're seeing ocean container costs at roughly 8 to 10 times pre -COVID levels. We believe the majority of these headwinds are temporary, but we do not expect them to abate this fiscal year. We are taking action, including through pricing and aggressive cost management. I will discuss these impacts to our full-year medical outlook look shortly. To wrap up the quarter, despite some impact from the Delta variant on elective procedure volumes, overall, our customers continue to manage effectively and total elective volumes exited the quarter near 95% of pre-Covid levels. Additionally, lab testing volumes remained significantly elevated above pre-Covid levels, but was not a material driver to the quarter due to the strong performance in the prior year.  Next on slide eight, a few updates to our fiscal 22 outlook. We are reiterating our EPS guidance range of $5.60 to $5.90 per share. This reflects updated expectations for the Medical segment, as well as lower ranges for our tax rate and share count. We now expect our annual effective tax rate in the range of 23% to 25%. We also now expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the range of 280 million to 282 million.  As for the segment outlooks on Slide 9, first we are adjusting our Pharma revenue outlook to low double-digit growth to reflect the strong branded pharmaceutical sales growth that we're seeing from large customers. For medical, we now expect fiscal '22 segment profit to be down mid-single to low double-digits. This change is driven by the significant increases in supply chain costs inflation that I previously discussed, which is expected to result in an incremental net headwind of approximately $100 to $125 million on the year. Given the anticipated timing of realizing these cost increases and our mitigating actions, as well as the timing of selling higher cost PPE, we expect a sequential decline in medical segment [Indiscernible] Stepping back, the only large operational item that we see meaningfully different today compared to our original fiscal '22 guidance is the incremental impact of elevated supply chain costs [Indiscernible] medical. Notably, we do not anticipate any material net impact in Pharma from inflationary supply chain costs. And as noted last quarter, we still expect the cadence of our EPS guidance to be significantly back-half weighted. Now to close, an update on capital deployment. We are focused on deploying capital in a balanced, disciplined, and shareholder-friendly manner, and we'll continue to allocate capital through the lens of our priorities, which are unchanged. We have been on a journey to improve our balance sheet and our portfolio, and have made tremendous progress. As we look forward, we see our debt paydown beginning to moderate, which will provide an increased ability to be more opportunistic with our return of capital to shareholders. On that note, 2 important updates. Our board recently approved a new three-year authorization to repurchase up to an additional $3 billion of our common stock, expiring at the end of calendar year 2024. And we now expect approximately $1 billion of share repurchases in fiscal 22, which includes the $500 million of share repurchases executed to date. We believe that capital deployment, along with the future growth that we expect in both our segments, will be a key driver to the double-digit combined EPS growth and dividend yield that we're targeting in the long term. With that, turn it back over to Mike. Hi. Good morning, this is Jason, I'll try to capture all those points. Your question is certainly fair as it relates to trying to define the baseline for those longer-term targets. As we indicated in the remarks today, we do anticipate this additional $100 million to a $125 million related to the inflationary environment as temporary. It's difficult certainly to define exactly if that's short-term, medium-term, or longer-term. And at the current moment, we would expect those to revert back to some normalized level in a time frame that is relatively short to medium term. And so when we talk about these longer-term targets, we are not presuming that type of tailwind, right. So it isn't a more normalized state when we provide those targets. You referenced 5-year, so I'd say 3 to 5 years is a reasonable type of time frame for average types of performance levels, to get a broad perspective on the ins and the outs, but we would not expect big shocks associated with items like that, divestitures and acquisitions, things that nature would also be normalized out of that so that we're getting at that core type of performance. And then as it relates to more specifics around elevated supply chain cost, we highlighted within our remarks that its really just two key areas; the international freight and the commodities. In both cases, the reason we believe that they are temporary is that they are at multiple levels higher than what we've historically seen on international freight, which is essentially the cost of getting a shipping container shipped from overseas locations such as Asia to the U.S. We're seeing that cost up 8 to 10 times versus pre -COVID levels. Certainly we would expect that to be significantly lower at some point in the future. And on the commodities, we're talking about a lot of different types of polymers, such as polypropylene. Those levels are more like 2x what we've seen historically. So again, we would expect those to get back to a more normalized state at some point in the future. But again, those are not tailwinds to get us to these targets, those targets are more normalized.  In terms of the second half, a different cadence of our results for the various businesses, we did indicate that with Pharma, we would expect the second half to continue to improve steadily versus where we're at today. Just as it relates to getting back to more normalized stay for underlying generics volume. So that continues to be as expected and also as expected, our investments in our technology investments, we indicated would be front-end loaded, especially with the first three quarters, primarily as it relates to that fourth-quarter. We started to implement those cost increases in the final implementation last Q4. So we start to get the full-year effect of that as we exit the third quarter here. On the Medical side, we did indicate a sequential decline from Q1 to Q2, and that's just related to the timing of realizing that supply chain cost I was just walking through, and all of the mitigating actions that go along with that. And then, also recall that we cited the COVID favorability in Q2 of last year that is not expected to repeat, and in fact, we expect that to be a headwind to this Q2 primarily as a result of the PPE price and cost timing. So we have that Q1 to Q2 cadence. And then of course in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year, we'd expect a significant COVID tailwind associated with the comparison benefit from the PPE in the prior year. And then in all of our businesses, we expect ongoing stronger contributions from our growth businesses as we see the effects of various initiatives and investments that have been put in place over the course of last year.  Next question. And the only thing I'd add is that this increase is not -- it's related to 2 parts. It's a greater increase in both of these areas of international freight and commodities, but it's also longer expected duration. We had anticipated that they would come back to more normalized levels a bit earlier. So we saw a higher spike and a longer duration. And in terms of just how you model it through on revenue, I'd like to draw -- just draw a little bit of distinction. With PPE, we saw many, many times higher total impact on that product cost, and so we saw a much more significant number of dollars in both cost and revenue that came through. While this is still significant, it's much less meaningful from a revenue perspective, and is not moving that needle nearly as much. Next question. Yeah. I think your math is accurate for the items that we typically provide guidance. One area that's not explicitly called out but is implied is just the underlying other corporate expenses. And as we referenced a few times already in Mike's specific comments, there's broad-based cost reductions, the $750 million program which we increased by $250 million last quarter, is enterprise-wide and that includes the corporate function. So we have identified additional corporate cost reduction actions that are not included in either of the segments, but do fall through to the bottom line, the total segment profit as well as our earnings per share. Yes. Good morning, Adams, Jason. Yes. That would incorporate that as we think about the capital deployment side of that. We have for quite some time now included in an expectation of what those payments would be. That's all based upon our current set of assumptions, of course that I would change materially, and that would change your answer, but based upon what we know now, that would be the baseline, for example, the $3 billion share repurchase authorization that we have just completed is inclusive of that as well, as a part of the capital outlay that we would expect over that period of time, and this would be the available capital beyond that. Next question. Sure. Good morning, Ricky. This is Jason. I'll start. As we talked about our long-term target, it's not expected or intended to be each and every year. There's a reason that we do a highlight that is an average over that period of time. So we're not providing fiscal '23 guidance with the statement. With that said, we think that there are over these longer periods of time that these would be the primary drivers and expectations we would have for our businesses. And how you described at about the normalized level as an example that 100 to 125 five were -- we indicated that we anticipate these costs remain elevated for the balance of fiscal '22, we're not taking a position at this point as to how much, if any, carries over into fiscal '23, that is a terrific example of an important element of fiscal '23 guidance that we will provide in the future that is not at this point something that we feel comfortable being able to identify. And then your question about labor is a great one. We did not call it out because it is very consistent with what we had last quarter. So while labor, inflation, and those pressures are very real for us, like the whole industry, we are not seeing anything new and unique this quarter versus last quarter, and so we're not adding in any additional costs for that. But I would also highlight that even what was included in the original guidance was not nearly as substantial as the cost that we're referencing for and what was included before for commodities and international freight. Those are clearly the most significant items that drive that fluctuation, and items like labor as well as more domestic related costs such as domestic transportation and other fuel are all relatively low compared to those other 2 primary items, the international freight and commodities."

With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jason.\nJason Hollar: Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal '23 was an inflection point for Cardinal Health with improved performance, strong execution and notable progress against both our short and long-term plans. We delivered record financial performance, including our highest non-GAAP EPS ever, reflecting 14% growth in the prior year. We grew Pharma segment profit an impressive 13% and generated $2.8 billion of adjusted free cash flow. And in Medical, we drove significant sequential improvement in operating performance from a segment loss in the first quarter to over $80 million of segment profit in Q4. This year, we took decisive action to advance our three strategic imperatives; building upon the resiliency of our Pharma segment, executing our Medical Improvement Plan and maximizing shareholder value creation. Consistent with what you heard at our June Investor Day, these results were achieved through our team's commitment to ruthlessly prioritize the core of our business and to better serve our customers so they, in turn, can focus on caring for patients. We simplified how we operate by streamlining our organizational structure, exiting non-core product lines and rationalizing our geographic and manufacturing footprint. We made key leadership changes and governance enhancements, adding talent and key positions across the enterprise and to our Board. We formed and extended the business review committee tasked with evaluating our strategy, portfolio, operations and capital deployment. On that note, we completed our review of the Pharma segment, including announcements at Investor Day to further invest in our Nuclear & Precision Health Solutions business and launched our new Navista Network supporting community oncologists, which I will discuss more later in my remarks. We recently closed our Outcomes merger with BlackRock's Transaction Data Systems, which we see as a big win for pharmacies and an important opportunity to accelerate the business' future growth. We also deployed capital responsibly with a continued eye on maximizing value, and we are positioned with the financial flexibility to continue driving value for shareholders. At Investor Day, we provided preliminary guidance for fiscal '24. With a strong finish to the year and increased confidence as we look ahead, I am pleased that we can raise our fiscal '24 outlook. Later in my remarks, I will share further details on our three strategic priorities. But first, let me hand it over to Aaron to walk you through our financial results and guidance.\nAaron Alt: Thanks, Jason, and good morning. I won't bury the lead. Q4 was a strong finish to a year in which with Jason's guidance, the Cardinal team made significant progress against our strategic initiatives. We delivered fourth quarter EPS of $1.55 and $5.79 for the full year at the high end of our guidance from Investor Day. For both Q4 and the year, our EPS results reached historical high points. We also delivered stronger than expected cash flow, something I will touch on more later. Let's start with the Pharma segment on Slide 6. Fourth quarter revenue increased 15% to $49.7 billion driven by brand and specialty pharmaceutical sales growth from existing customers. We continue to see broad-based strength in Pharmaceutical demand spanning across product categories, brand, specialty, consumer health and generics and from our largest customers. Similar to Q3, GLP-1 medications provided a revenue tailwind in the quarter. Segment profit increased 12% to $504 million in the fourth quarter primarily driven by positive generics program performance. Within our generics program, we saw volume growth and consistent market dynamics, including strong performance from Red Oak. Increased contributions from brand and specialty products along with nuclear were also a positive factor, partially offset by higher investment and operating expenses, including higher costs to support sales growth. Turning to Medical on Slide 7. Fourth quarter revenue was flat at $3.8 billion, an improvement in trend. We saw a decrease in products and distribution sales related to lower PP&E volumes and pricing, partially offset by inflationary impacts, including our mitigation initiatives. This decrease within products and distribution was offset by growth in at-Home Solutions. In the fourth quarter, we delivered Medical segment profit of $82 million, a nearly $100 million increase from the prior year loss. The results for the quarter were consistent with our Investor Day commentary, composed of approximately $60 million or more core performance driven in connection with the Medical Improvement Plan and approximately $20 million of both seasonality and net favorable onetime items. As expected, we saw an improvement in net inflationary impacts, including our mitigation initiatives and the normalization of PP&E margins, which were impacted by unfavorable price/cost timing in the prior year. Of note, we achieved our target of exiting fiscal 2023 with at least 50% inflation mitigation. Consistent with the expectations communicated at Investor Day, we were encouraged to see early indicators of an improvement in trend with respect to our Cardinal Health brand product sales. We also saw a positive overall contribution from our growth businesses, including at-Home Solutions and OptiFreight and from our ongoing cost optimization measures. Though with significant profit growth in both segments, we delivered total operating earnings of $560 million, growth of 24%. Moving below the line. Interest and other decreased by $48 million to $16 million due to increased interest income from cash and equivalents and increased income from our company's deferred compensation plan investments, which, as a reminder, is fully offset above the line in corporate. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate finished at 27% to approximately two percentage points higher than the prior year due to certain discrete items. Fourth quarter average diluted shares outstanding were 256 million, 7% lower than a year ago due to share repurchases, including a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program initiated in the quarter as we announced at Investor Day. The net result of all of this was fourth quarter EPS of $1.55, growth of 48%. Now, transitioning to our consolidated results for the year. We surpassed the $200 billion revenue mark for the first time. Fiscal '23 revenue increased 13% to $205 billion and gross margin increased 5% to $6.9 billion, both driven by the Pharma segment. Total company SG&A increased 6% to $4.8 billion, primarily reflecting inflationary supply chain costs and higher investments in operating expenses such as higher costs to support sales growth, which were partially offset by our comprehensive enterprise-wide cost savings measures. Operating earnings increased 3% to $2.1 billion. Interest and other decreased 46% to $89 million, primarily driven by increased interest income from cash and equivalents. As a reminder, our debt is largely fixed rate, resulting in a net benefit from rising interest rates in the near-term. Our annual effective tax rate finished at 23%. Net result was for fiscal 2023 EPS, $5.79, growth of 14%. As for the segment's full year results, beginning with Pharma on Slide 10. Pharma segment profit increased 13% to $2 billion, driven by positive generics program performance and a higher contribution from brand and specialty products, partially offset by inflationary supply chain costs. Fiscal '23 year-over-year growth also included a modest benefit from branded manufacturer price increases, which we are assuming will not repeat in fiscal '24 as well as a favorable prior year comparison related to higher opioid-related legal costs and costs for technology enhancements in fiscal '22. Moving to Medical on Slide 11. Segment profit decreased 49% to $111 million, primarily due to lower products and distribution volumes and unfavorable sales mix and net inflationary impacts, including mitigation initiatives. This decline was partially offset by normalization of PP&E margins. Now, before I turn to fiscal '24, let's cover the balance sheet. In fiscal '23, we generated robust adjusted free cash flow of $2.8 billion with particularly strong cash flow towards the end of the year. We ended the year with $4 billion of cash on hand. At our Investor Day, we highlighted that cash flow optimization was an area of go-forward focus for our teams, and the Cardinal team delivered across our businesses. This effort will continue in fiscal '24, notwithstanding that it is a tougher calendar from an inflow, outflow days-of-week perspective. We remain focused on deploying capital in a balanced, disciplined, and shareholder-friendly manner. In fiscal '23, we invested approximately $480 million of CapEx back into the business to drive future growth, paid down $550 million in debt to reduce leverage and maintain our strong investment-grade ratings, returned over $2.5 billion to shareholders, including through the dividend that our Board increased in May for the 34th year in a row and $2 billion of share repurchases. Now, for our updated fiscal '24 guidance on Slide 13. Today, we are raising our fiscal '24 EPS guidance to a range of $6.50 to $6.75. This increase reflects the strong finish to fiscal '23, particularly within Pharma where we are now entering the year at a higher jump-off point. We also are tightening our shares range to 250 million to 253 million, which reflects the recent share repurchases as well as our continued expectation of $500 million in base share repurchases over the course of fiscal '24. As you will calculate, the midpoint of our newly raised fiscal '24 EPS guidance is 15% above our fiscal '23 EPS results. There are no changes to the other corporate guidance assumptions provided at Investor Day. Interest and other between $110 million to $130 million, and effective tax rate in the range of 23% to 25% and adjusted free cash flow of approximately $2 billion in fiscal '24.  Our segment outlooks for fiscal '24 are also unchanged with one exception, a high revenue range for Pharma driven by the continued acceleration of GLP-1s, which, as a branded product category, do not meaningfully contribute to segment profit. Slide 14 shows our fiscal '24 outlook for Pharma, our build and grow business. We expect revenue growth in the range of 10% to 12% and segment profit growth in the range of 4% to 6%, which is now on a larger fiscal '23 reference point due to our strong finish to the year. We are reiterating our key assumptions provided at Investor Day. We expect growth from our generics program with volume growth and consistent market dynamics and positive operational execution against our organic specialty efforts. We are not assuming outsized benefits from branded inflation. In contrast, some of the benefits that we did see in fiscal '23. On the Pharma fiscal '24 cadence, we expect the year to follow typical seasonality patterns. As usual, we see our fiscal Q3 being the largest segment profit dollar quarter due to the usual timing of branded manufacturer price increases. Turning to Medical. I want to recognize the progress that the Medical team made during fiscal '23, particularly in Q4, and also acknowledge that we still have blocking and tackling to do against the turnaround to both drive demand and improve our cost. For the full year, we are reiterating our assumptions of revenue growth of approximately 3% and segment profit of approximately $400 million for the year, while providing some additional color. Like fiscal '23, we anticipate segment profit to be significantly back-half weighted. We expect Q1 to be generally consistent with the core performance from Q4 with quarterly sequential improvements thereafter driven by our Medical Improvement Plan initiatives. There are a couple of factors for why Q1 is the low point in the year. First, keep in mind that Q1 is the seasonal low point for our global Medical products and distribution business due to the timing of volume and cost recognition. Second, while we continue to expect to exit fiscal '24 offsetting the impact of gross inflation, those improvements are expected to grow over time, making the impact greater over the course of the year. And finally, we continue to plan for slight Cardinal Health brand volume growth that will largely hit in the second half of the fiscal year. So in summary for Medical for fiscal year '24, continued work in front of us with each quarter improving from our Q1 launching point to get us to the approximately $400 million guidance for the year. Stepping back, we are pleased to see growth across our businesses continuing in fiscal '24. Consistent with our messaging from Investor Day, we are targeting a 12% to 14% EPS growth CAGR for fiscal '24 to 2026, now from the higher fiscal '23 baseline of $5.79. Now regarding our intended deployment of cash, which is consistent with our disciplined capital allocation framework as seen on Slide 18. After investing approximately $500 million back into the business to drive organic growth, making approximately $500 million of litigation payments, including our third payment under the national opioid settlement back in July, and our $1 billion baseline return on capital, we expect to have strong flexibility as we assess further investments in the business, M&A and the possibility of incremental return of capital to shareholders. I want to reiterate that as we shared at Investor Day, neither our fiscal '24 guidance or our long-term targets reflect potential opportunistic deployment of capital, including M&A, which is difficult to predict in timing or magnitude or additional share repurchases beyond our $500 million of baseline repurchases each year. We will continue to evaluate both of these levers opportunistically to drive long-term value. To close, the Cardinal team has a lot to be proud of with respect to their accomplishments in fiscal '23. Jason and I are pleased with the progress our teams have made. We are confident in the plans we have in place, and we are excited for our team to realize the significant value creation opportunities still in front of Cardinal Health. With that, I will turn it back over to Jason.\nJason Hollar: Thanks, Aaron. Let's now dive deeper into the actions we are taking to execute our three strategic priorities, beginning with priority number one and building upon the resiliency of the Pharma segment. In our largest most significant business, the Pharma segment has been performing well by prioritizing what matters most, focusing on the core and delivering for our customers and their patients. The business is positioned at the forefront of favorable secular industry trends and has also benefited from our specific actions and performance. We are pleased to recently raise our long-term segment profit target to 4% to 6% growth, solidly in the mid-single digits and consistent with the segment profit growth we expect in fiscal '24. Our growth is enabled by a scaled, stable and resilient core Pharmaceutical distribution business growing in the low single digits and double-digit growth from our higher-margin specialty and Nuclear businesses. Within the core, our generics program remains a critical component of our overall offering and performance, enabled by Red Oak Sourcing. In addition to its leading scale, Red Oak's proprietary analytical tools and deep industry expertise puts us in the best position possible whenever product shortages occur to continue servicing customers. We're committed to providing customer-focused solutions across our many classes of trade as we noted at Investor Day. More recently, we hosted our 31st Annual Retail Business Conference, where we brought together nearly 4,500 attendees from across the country to celebrate the critical role independent pharmacies play in caring for their communities and showcase our commitment to our customers through our newest innovations. For example, we are offering modern payment solutions through our collaboration with Square to help independent pharmacies seamlessly manage business operations, integrate flexible payment options, and reduce payment processing costs. We've conveyed that specialty is our priority area of focus and a key enabler to our long-term growth. We're continuing to invest to expand downstream across key therapeutic areas such as oncology, rheumatology and other emerging areas. We're excited to build upon our existing capabilities with the recent launch of our Navista Network, a specific suite of offerings for community oncologists, supporting their growth and desire to remain independent. To ensure the Navista Network's success in development, we've recently appointed new leadership with deep industry and clinical experience and continue to build out the organization with internal and external talent. We continue to seek input from customers and have created an advisory board. While still early innings, I'm pleased with the engagement from current and potential customers. Upstream in specialty, we're expecting continued double-digit growth from manufacturer services. In our leading 3PL, we're expanding our ambient and cold chain space to keep up with our business' strong growth. At an excess access and patient support, we delivered on a record number of new client implementations and continue to launch new innovative products to streamline the patient journey. We're also supporting the growth of Pharmaceutical manufacturers in the cell and gene therapy space through our advanced therapy solutions offerings. For example, we're partnering with TrakCel to bring visibility and tracking capabilities to biopharma companies by helping them navigate cell therapies through multiple stages of development and commercialization. Overall in specialty, we're confident that the connection between our downstream and upstream strategies, what we call our specialty growth cycle, will drive double-digit growth well into the future. Our Nuclear business, which is on track to double profits by fiscal '26 as of our fiscal '21 baseline, is strategically positioned for growth at the center of precision medicine. We're further investing in the space with a Phase 2 investment of $30 million over the next several years to expand our center for theranostics advancement and support our manufacturer partners' projects as they advance through the commercial development pipeline. We're encouraged to see Pharmaceutical innovation expanding the breadth of conditions that are being addressed with emerging therapies such as cell and gene and precision medicine. As the future of health care continues to evolve, our breadth of capabilities from Pharmaceutical and specialty distribution, radiopharmaceuticals and theranostics to biopharma and manufacturer services enables us to offer multiple touch points for manufacturers, providers and patients to realize value from these promising new treatment options. Now, turning to Medical and priority number two. When we introduced the Medical Improvement Plan last August, our immediate focus was turning around the performance in the core product and distribution, where we've achieved tremendous progress over the past 12 months. We are on track to address the impact of inflation and global supply chain constraints by the time we exit fiscal '24. This is the number one key to returning to a more normalized level of profitability, and we are now over halfway to our target. We continue to execute our mitigation initiatives to offset elevated inflation and make progress with our commercial contracting efforts. And we are exploring other offsets with urgency such as our manufacturing excellence and sourcing initiatives. While overall costs remain elevated, international freight has generally returned to pre-pandemic levels, and we expect this improvement to be reflected in our fiscal '24 results. We're driving significant progress through our 5-point plan to grow Cardinal Health brand volume and seeing improvements in our leading indicators. This includes better portfolio health for key product categories and higher service levels, customer loyalty index scores and retention rates for distribution. We're driving enhanced customer experience through investments in product availability and automation while optimizing costs. At Investor Day, we highlighted our two-pronged approach to portfolio life cycle management, which has enabled us to completely exit our non-health care portfolio. And we are in the process of reducing over 2,000 SKUs across our Cardinal Health Branded product categories to simplify the business. We're focusing our investments in new product development and capacity expansion in key growth areas such as compression, enteral feeding and incontinence. Within our products that are core to distribution, we've seen continued stabilization with PPE, a smaller part of our portfolio but a source of volatility during the pandemic and growth in our pre-sourced surgical fitting category. In our specialty products portfolio comprised of clinically differentiated products and leading brands like Kangaroo, Kendall and Protexis, we're investing in innovation to meet customers' needs and drive sustainable growth. For example, the launch of our new Kangaroo OMNI\u2122 Enteral Feeding system this month. As a result of our combined efforts, commercial momentum is accelerating. During Q4, we renewed several key distribution customers and saw positive net new wins during the quarter. These leading indicators give us confidence that moving forward we'll participate in the growth from an overall improving medical utilization environment. Outside the core, we're on track to accelerate our growth businesses. In at-Home Solutions, we're investing in DC network expansion to keep pace with increased demand as care continues to shift into the home. For example, we've recently begun construction for a new 350,000 square foot Greenville, South Carolina, DC. This facility, the 11th in our national network will be fully operational in 18 to 24 months and equipped with advanced automation technology and robotics to drive operational efficiencies. In OptiFreight, we provide premier logistics management powered by our technology capabilities and expertise. We're continuing to invest in digital tools to support core volume growth and sustain our strong performance. Finally, we continue to execute our simplification and cost savings initiatives such as optimizing our global manufacturing and supply chain and our international footprint. For example, we exited four additional countries and two additional manufacturing sites this year. In short, we are making progress with our Medical Improvement Plan. While there is still execution in front of us, I'm excited for the business to return to more significant profitability in fiscal '24. Finally, priority number three, maximizing shareholder value creation. We're maximizing shareholder value creation through operational performance, robust cash flow generation and the responsible allocation of capital. At Investor Day, Aaron detailed our new long-term capital allocation framework, which builds upon our long-standing priorities with some notable enhancements. We're pleased that with our strong cash flow profile and the significant progress we've made on our balance sheet, we have the flexibility for share repurchases each and every year. And with the residual cash flow that we anticipate, we'll continue to opportunistically evaluate disciplined M&A in specialty and potential additional share repurchases. While our team has made significant progress over the past year, particularly in realigning our operations for focus and simplicity, there is still work and opportunity in front of us. We continue to evaluate additional value creation initiatives, including the progress we are making with our ongoing business and portfolio review. To wrap up, I want to acknowledge our dedicated Cardinal Health employees who are fulfilling our essential role in health care, serving customers and their patients. Thank you for your determination and advancing our key priorities and moving healthcare forward. I'm excited for the opportunities still to come. With that, we will take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan.\nLisa Gill: Thanks very much. Good morning and congratulations on the quarter. I just really want to start with the GLP-1 comment. So I understand you're raising revenue by 200 basis points. One, is that all GLP-1? And two, my understanding is that they are a lower margin, but they are contributory to overall margin dollars. Is that not the case when you're keeping the profit the same and when I think about the Pharmaceutical segment for '24?\nAaron Alt: Yes. Good morning, Lisa. Thanks for the question. Yes, the primary reason for the raise in the guidance on the revenue is related to the GLP-1. So we did not call out anything else. We saw a strong finish to the year as it relates to that. And looking forward, we see that there's nothing that we can foresee in the near term that will change those trends. As a reminder, we did call out for the first time GLP-1 as a benefit to our revenue from a year-over-year growth perspective in the third quarter. So we have kind of a -- there was growth before that, but not as significant. And so it was more meaningful in Q3 and Q4. So as you look forward to fiscal '24, you would expect that revenue growth to be stronger in the first half of the year as that's more of a contributor. Now of course, we don't know what that slope is going to look like into '24, but we would anticipate as you start to lap the second half of 2023 that, that will be more muted in terms of the year-over-year benefit. And I guess what -- as it relates to your second part of your question, I would just reiterate that these are branded products. And as such, they're just not a meaningful contributor to segment profit and just leave it at that. Next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Eric Percher of Nephron Research.\nEric Percher: Thanks for all the commentary on Medical performance. I want to make sure we're kind of precise on the core performance and the stepping off point there would be around $60 million, not $82 million. And then, can you define seasonality and one-time benefits this quarter, and any expectation that those will recur as we look at that cadence for fiscal year '24?\nJason Hollar: Eric, good morning. Good to hear your voice and happy to give you a little more context on that. Look, we were quite pleased with the results for Medical, as you can imagine, delivering that $82 million of results. That was $60 million of what we're referring to as for performance and $20 million in aggregate combined positive seasonality and one-time items in the fourth quarter. And I called -- I call it out purposely that way because it does impact how we think through the cadence of quarters during fiscal '24. Now before giving you a little more context on the quarterly guidance, I do want to go back and just observe that we are reiterating the $400 million profit target for the Medical segment from the year. The Medical Improvement Plan, the key components, that remain unchanged from our description at the Investor Day as well. But we are providing a little more color relative to how we see the year playing out, given the number of moving pieces on the blocking and tackling as I referred to in my prepared remarks as we carry forward. So look, from a full year perspective, the way I would have you think about it is this. As I said at Investor Day, if you take $60 million of core performance and multiply that by 4, that gets you to $240 million of profit, right? If you add $100 million of incremental inflation net on top of that, that gets you to $340 million in total. And as we talked about at Investor Day, that leaves about $60 million of contribution from other elements across the year, the simplification of the Cardinal Health brand, et cetera. That's a full year view of how to think about it. Now as we think about the cadence, though, we are being clear that the profit will be back-half weighted during the year just like it was in fiscal year '23. Our view is that Q1 will have similar core performance with Q4 with sequential performance thereafter. Q1 is the seasonal low point for the Med Products and Distribution business due to both the timing of volume as well as our cost recognition. That's an important point. And similarly, we do expect that continued acceleration of inflation mitigation over the course of the year as well. So that will push the profit from a weighting perspective in the back half. And then don't forget that while we were very pleased to call out a sign of change in trend in Cardinal Health brand, we're also clear at Investor Day that the Cardinal Health brand volume growth is largely back-half weighted. Hope that helps. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin Caliendo of UBS.\nKevin Caliendo: Thanks. Maybe to follow-up on that a little bit. So if we're thinking about $82 million , the baseline is really $60 million, the first quarter is likely because of the $20 million in seasonals' and one-timers. The first quarter is likely to be down sequentially and then grow off that base to get to the $400 million. I just want to make sure that, that's what you're committing to or commenting on. And then secondly, or incrementally, the new products or the Cardinal brand products, is that -- the increase in the back half of the year? Is that because of new product launches or manufacturing capabilities? Is it contractually like new contracts coming on that are higher weighted? Can you just sort of explain the dynamics of the Cardinal brand products as well?\nAaron Alt: Well, I'll start, and then toss it over to Jason. You are correct in that the way we're thinking about this is that core performance Q4 to Q1 will be roughly in line. And if you interpret what I was just saying in response to an earlier question, we do have some negative seasonality in Q1 versus Q4. So that's why the jumping off point is core performance versus the Q4 results. Jason?\nJason Hollar: Yes. I'd think about the Cardinal brand volume growth being back half-loaded through a couple of different lenses. First of all, we do think that the underlying utilization will be -- for the market will continue to be relatively consistent. So we do see same-store sales growth out there, and we anticipate that, that will continue. And within our performance within that, we highlighted that our comparison point to the prior year is becoming easier as we did lose some business over the last 18 months or so that we now are lapping and our five-point plan is working. Our five-point plan to improve -- that includes improving the customer experience and importantly, that supply chain health. We're seeing strong progress as it relates to service levels, CLI scores that gave us very good customer retention in the quarter, net new wins that were positive in the quarter. That gives us the foundation that -- that gives us confidence that we'll grow with the underlying market, especially as we continue to lap that prior year impact, which we think will be more impactful in the second half of the year. So all the leading indicators are going as anticipated and consistent with how we laid it out at the Investor Day and gives us the visibility and the confidence that we'll be able to participate in that market growth that we anticipate that will be there over the course of this next year. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from George Hill of Deutsche Bank.\nGeorge Hill: Yes. Good morning guys. And thanks for taking my questions. I'll take it in a little bit different direction. Jason, I'd love to hear the kind of the progress that you guys have made on the Navista offering, since it was first announced at the Analyst Day. And I guess, given the growth and the size of the specialty market, particularly in oncology, I guess how should we think about the ramp of that business maybe through fiscal '24 and beyond, so just kind of progress in ramping contribution? Thank you.\nJason Hollar: Sure. Yes. Great. Thanks for the question, George. Yes, so when we think about Navista, I think it's important to recognize that we had a foundation in place. We have a foundation in place, built off of our existing specialty business. We had plenty of programs and initiatives in platforms like our, Navista TS, where we are already providing capabilities to the community oncologists to help support their value-based care initiatives, of course, other data and insights, clinical research support. So we have a lot of the tools. What Navista Network is doing is, bringing that all together in the form of a business with new additional senior leadership brought in place. So that's one of the key things that's happened since the announcement a couple of months ago, is we have brought in additional leadership to bring on top of the strong team that we already had in place that were already serving these important customers and their patients. So we are building that out further with both internal as well as external talent. We also created an advisory board to ensure that we are working directly with both current and prospective customers, more than anything to make sure that they have a strong voice as to where we go next with the development of this platform in this business. We continue to listen and be out in the field doing a lot of research, but we're also building what we're already notably to be some of the key attributes of this platform and this network that they're demanding. What's key and what we highlighted before is that these are the 1,500 that we're focused on here are very strongly interested in maintaining their independence. We're also hearing a strong desire for ongoing transparency, which as health care's most trusted partner, we feel like we're really well positioned for. So it's only been a couple of months since we rolled this out. But in that time frame, we've got the team in place, better definition of what the platform needs to be built out with and continue to work with those prospective customers to make sure that their needs are met. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson of Evercore.\nElizabeth Anderson: Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question. I don't know if you could comment on the corporate costs that you just discussed in Medical, the $60 million. Is that something that you also expect to like ramp ratably over the course of the year? Is that something that has gone through, those cuts are going through -- have gone through already and are just annualizing? A little bit more help there would be very helpful. And then secondarily, can you talk about what is different about getting this next 50% of the inflation offset this year that was not the same last year? We obviously know that you've been getting more price \u2013 in your contracts, et cetera, but I'm just looking for any more additional commentary you can provide on what might be different about this remaining 50%. Thanks.\nJason Hollar: Okay. I think I caught the essence at least part of that. So let me start. I believe part of the question was related to the next part of the inflation mitigation in the second half. I think the other question related to the corporate cost ramp. So let me start with the second part and then throw it over to Aaron for the first part. So as you think about the inflation mitigation and the next piece, there's -- it's really the same for the second 50% as it was the first 50%. So in both cases, what we've seen is a moderation of the international freight. That spiked significantly about two years ago and started coming down about a year ago and got back down to pre-pandemic levels maybe six to nine months ago. So that has been -- started to benefit us as we especially exited fiscal '23. So we did start to see that. It, of course, was inventoried into our inventory, capitalized those costs into our inventories. So it took a little while for that to benefit our P&L as a cost reduce. And along the way, in parallel with that, of course, we were pricing mainly on a temporary basis the first year for those increases as well as increases in other commodity costs and transportation, domestic transportation, increased labor and all those other costs. All those other costs have plateaued. They are not coming down. We don't see any signs of them coming down. And so we have to price permanently for those items. We priced temporarily for the international freight. And as those costs on the international freight roll off, we need to maintain higher prices. And so we are continuing to price and some of those temporary prices are now being rolled into the permanent prices. And so we would expect that as those contracts renew that we'll continue to see more and more of that pricing recognized. I mean, to be very clear, we're not rolling back prices. We've not increased prices beyond the point of our costs. At the 50% level, we're still only being compensated for half of that overall gross impact that we've incurred. But over the course of this year, we do expect the international freight to come down. And by the time we exit fiscal '24, the prices will continue to increase as we go through the course of the year as we get more of those contracts renewed permanently, and then that will cross over with the lower cost, and then we'll exit in that manner at the end of the year. Aaron, on the first question?\nAaron Alt: Sure. I think I heard a couple of different things, and so I'm going to answer the question I think I heard, and it goes something like this. So we did -- I did comment earlier that in addition to the annualization of the core performance and indeed the inflation mitigation that Jason just touched on that there was $60 million of other benefit coming over the course of the year really driven by the three other pillars within the Med Improvement Plan, the contribution of the growth businesses, the simplification and the Cardinal Health brand work. As I was touching on, that work progresses over the course of the year, and we've seen more benefit towards the back half of the year. I want to emphasize the simplification efforts. Steve and the team are working really hard at that every day. We just see the benefit coming more in the back half. The growth businesses are making good progress. They have some seasonality as well. They are certainly a strong contributor to the additional $60 million over the course of the year. And then Jason has already touched on Cardinal Health brand, so I won't go there.\nJason Hollar: Next question please, operator?\nOperator: The next question comes from Daniel Grosslight of Citi.\nDaniel Grosslight: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just have one quick housekeeping question, and then I'll ask my real question. There was a slight change in the language around your inflation mitigation efforts from your ID presentation to your current presentation. You went from fully mitigating by the end of '24 to just mitigating. Curious if there's been some change in how you're thinking about things? Or if it was kind of a simplification of the language?  And then my real question is around the generics business. It seems like you and your competitors have all benefited from a more favorable environment. And it seems like it might have accelerated towards the end of your fiscal year. So I'm just curious to get your thoughts on the generics market potential shortages and how you're thinking about the benefit or tailwind of generics in your fiscal '24 guidance vis-a-vis the strength you saw in fiscal '23. Thanks.\nJason Hollar: Sure. So in terms of the language change for inflation mitigation, I think you said it best. It's a simplification language. The one thing I would highlight is similar to our disclosures with COVID, over time, those became more difficult to precisely measure. So now we are -- and this inflation mitigation was always focused on the incremental inflation because we had spikes, unusual dramatic spikes in inflation. Well, there's normal inflation as well. So this is just a little bit broader language to recognize that over time, it's becoming harder to differentiate between the two. We have a good understanding of the most significant impacts like the international freight. But when you get into labor, what's normal, what's incremental, it becomes more challenging. And we just have a little bit broader language to recognize that it is going to be less precise than it was early on in our measurement. We're still doing as deep of analytics as possible to get a reasonable understanding of it. As it relates to \u2013 I think \u2013 well, I think the key takeaway with that is we are on track, right, the ultimately, the strategy makes sense. It should be pushed down to the final customer, the final user of the products and services, given the business model. And so we believe that the basic tenets are absolutely unchanged. It's just reflecting the level of precision. On your second question as it relates to generics, as I step back and think about performance for the Pharma segment this year, inclusive of generics, I think you can think about the overall segment as well as the generics business. There's a couple of things that have occurred. There is the overall market utilization has been very strong, and our performance has been very good within that. And it's at levels that for all the reasons Aaron highlighted is that a growth rate is a bit higher than what normal is and certainly higher than what our long-term growth targets are. And as I think forward to fiscal '24, we expect that to normalize. We expect it to still be favorable growth. We indicated during Investor Day in the 2% to 3% type of range from a unit volume growth, and we would expect to participate within that. And we expect our performance to continue with areas like Red Oak Sourcing to continue to drive both the cost as well as to your other related point, the product shortages. They have a dual mandate to drive performance for both cost as well as service levels to customers. So while there are product shortages sporadic within the overall Pharmaceutical distribution supply chain, that's not a new phenomenon. There's various demand driven spikes and supply driven spikes. Our goal, of course, is to minimize those challenges within that to give our customers the best possible service. And what we saw, in fact, in fiscal '23, it was a little bit of a benefit by being able to supply products as a second distributor as not the primary distributor, but we had some opportunities where we were able to provide when others were short on product. So overall, that was a slight positive for us this year as well. And we expect those types of things to be more normalized in fiscal '24 and feel well-positioned to participate in that growth.\nAaron Alt: I would just add one thought, which is in Q4, we saw strong volume, as Jason highlighted, but overall consistent market dynamics. And indeed, as we look forward, Jason called out the unit growth, but we are also guiding to consistent market dynamics for the upcoming year as well.\nJason Hollar: Next question please.\nOperator: Next question today comes from A.J. Rice of Credit Suisse.\nA.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. I know on your Medical side, there's a lot going on, and you're a little more skewed toward inpatient than some of the others that have reported. But we've heard this discussion about an uptick in utilization from some of the providers. And I wondered if I peel back everything that's going on in Medical, did you see any change in behavior on the part of your customers to suggest that there was an uptick in utilization? And then just on the PPE comment, you're calling it normalization of profits from here. Do you think sequentially from here, we're pretty steady? And as we return to a normal environment, is there any seasonality around that category to call out to remember when we get back to a normal environment?\nJason Hollar: Yes. The utilization, we think, has been fairly consistent. I wouldn't call it an acceleration or anything. We're seeing pretty consistent underlying same-store sales type of growth. So it's sufficient within our business model and where we laid it out from Investor Day, but I wouldn't call out anything unique there. As it relates to PPE normalization, a couple of points. So normalized is good for us. This is not a category that we've ever made a tremendous amount of money and value. It's an important category for our customers. And so we do everything we can to satisfy their needs. So going forward, our objective is to ensure that we get customers the product they need and minimize the volatility that goes along with that. But I just don't see it being a material driver one way or the other. Recall that the challenges with PPE was that we had volatile price cost and volume all at once. What you have right now is a normalization that's been occurring over the last couple of years of both price and cost has been coming down somewhat steadily. And they've been staying in a relative type of spread close enough to one another that, that's been manageable. And it's that volume that's been a little bit more challenging. We've highlighted that it was destocking beginning about -- well, over a year ago now in terms of the underlying volume there. But given the margins are relatively tight for this type of product, getting those margins right and relatively low margins means that the volume volatility or the lack of volume growth is not much of an issue for us, because it's just not a large contributor of incremental volume or incremental margins. So we're at a level that I think it's fairly stable, and it's our objective to keep it that way. Next question, please operator.\nOperator: Our final question today comes from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning. This is [indiscernible] in for Brian. I had a question about your capital allocation priorities for the fiscal year '24. Generated quite a bit of free cash flow this fiscal year. And I'm just curious if there's any specifics you can get into with regards to where you see capital allocation in the next fiscal year? Thank you.\nAaron Alt: Hi, great question. Thank you for putting it on the table for us. Look, we were very focused on our Investor Day in laying out the disciplined capital allocation decision matrix that we apply. And we were also very pleased to see the overall cash generation for fiscal '23 and Q4 in particular. Here's the simple answer. We're going to do what we said we were going to do at Investor Day in that respect. And just as a quick reminder, there are a couple of things which are table stakes for us, which is first, we're going to invest back into the business to drive the organic growth. We spent 480 in fiscal '23. We've guided we're going to spend about $500 million in CapEx against our business plans across the business. Our second priority, of course, is maintaining our investment-grade balance sheet. And you'll recall from our Investor Day that we don't have short-term maturities. We have some bonds coming due at the end of the year that we will likely just refinance. But we're feeling good about our investment-grade balance sheet  And then we've committed to a baseline of return of capital to shareholders, continuing to grow the dividend. We've raised it 34 years in a row. Similarly, we committed to buy back at least $500 million of shares during fiscal year '23. Those are the table stakes parts of how we're going to use our cash. As we then move through the year, as we assess the opportunities in front of us, as we assess how the business is performing, we have two opportunistic levers that we will also be looking at. The first is active, disciplined and targeted M&A largely in specialty, and we have opportunities there that we're looking at as well. And then on top of that, we will also continue to look at incremental return of capital to shareholders. Nothing additional to announce today on either of those two levers. But we want to be clear that we are going to do what we said we were going to do with respect to our disciplined capital allocation strategy.\nOperator: And that does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's call. I would now like to turn the call over to CEO, Jason Hollar for any additional or closing remarks.\nJason Hollar: Okay, great. Thanks again for joining us this morning. To summarize, fiscal '23 was a great year. It was a year of inflection, and we are excited to continue this momentum into fiscal '24 and beyond. With that, thank you and have a great day.\nOperator: And that does conclude the fourth quarter full year '23 Cardinal Health, Inc. earnings conference call. We thank you all for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Aaron Alt",
            "content": "Thanks, Jason, and good morning. I won't bury the lead. Q4 was a strong finish to a year in which with Jason's guidance, the Cardinal team made significant progress against our strategic initiatives. We delivered fourth quarter EPS of $1.55 and $5.79 for the full year at the high end of our guidance from Investor Day. For both Q4 and the year, our EPS results reached historical high points. We also delivered stronger than expected cash flow, something I will touch on more later. Let's start with the Pharma segment on Slide 6. Fourth quarter revenue increased 15% to $49.7 billion driven by brand and specialty pharmaceutical sales growth from existing customers. We continue to see broad-based strength in Pharmaceutical demand spanning across product categories, brand, specialty, consumer health and generics and from our largest customers. Similar to Q3, GLP-1 medications provided a revenue tailwind in the quarter. Segment profit increased 12% to $504 million in the fourth quarter primarily driven by positive generics program performance. Within our generics program, we saw volume growth and consistent market dynamics, including strong performance from Red Oak. Increased contributions from brand and specialty products along with nuclear were also a positive factor, partially offset by higher investment and operating expenses, including higher costs to support sales growth. Turning to Medical on Slide 7. Fourth quarter revenue was flat at $3.8 billion, an improvement in trend. We saw a decrease in products and distribution sales related to lower PP&E volumes and pricing, partially offset by inflationary impacts, including our mitigation initiatives. This decrease within products and distribution was offset by growth in at-Home Solutions. In the fourth quarter, we delivered Medical segment profit of $82 million, a nearly $100 million increase from the prior year loss. The results for the quarter were consistent with our Investor Day commentary, composed of approximately $60 million or more core performance driven in connection with the Medical Improvement Plan and approximately $20 million of both seasonality and net favorable onetime items. As expected, we saw an improvement in net inflationary impacts, including our mitigation initiatives and the normalization of PP&E margins, which were impacted by unfavorable price/cost timing in the prior year. Of note, we achieved our target of exiting fiscal 2023 with at least 50% inflation mitigation. Consistent with the expectations communicated at Investor Day, we were encouraged to see early indicators of an improvement in trend with respect to our Cardinal Health brand product sales. We also saw a positive overall contribution from our growth businesses, including at-Home Solutions and OptiFreight and from our ongoing cost optimization measures. Though with significant profit growth in both segments, we delivered total operating earnings of $560 million, growth of 24%. Moving below the line. Interest and other decreased by $48 million to $16 million due to increased interest income from cash and equivalents and increased income from our company's deferred compensation plan investments, which, as a reminder, is fully offset above the line in corporate. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate finished at 27% to approximately two percentage points higher than the prior year due to certain discrete items. Fourth quarter average diluted shares outstanding were 256 million, 7% lower than a year ago due to share repurchases, including a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program initiated in the quarter as we announced at Investor Day. The net result of all of this was fourth quarter EPS of $1.55, growth of 48%. Now, transitioning to our consolidated results for the year. We surpassed the $200 billion revenue mark for the first time. Fiscal '23 revenue increased 13% to $205 billion and gross margin increased 5% to $6.9 billion, both driven by the Pharma segment. Total company SG&A increased 6% to $4.8 billion, primarily reflecting inflationary supply chain costs and higher investments in operating expenses such as higher costs to support sales growth, which were partially offset by our comprehensive enterprise-wide cost savings measures. Operating earnings increased 3% to $2.1 billion. Interest and other decreased 46% to $89 million, primarily driven by increased interest income from cash and equivalents. As a reminder, our debt is largely fixed rate, resulting in a net benefit from rising interest rates in the near-term. Our annual effective tax rate finished at 23%. Net result was for fiscal 2023 EPS, $5.79, growth of 14%. As for the segment's full year results, beginning with Pharma on Slide 10. Pharma segment profit increased 13% to $2 billion, driven by positive generics program performance and a higher contribution from brand and specialty products, partially offset by inflationary supply chain costs. Fiscal '23 year-over-year growth also included a modest benefit from branded manufacturer price increases, which we are assuming will not repeat in fiscal '24 as well as a favorable prior year comparison related to higher opioid-related legal costs and costs for technology enhancements in fiscal '22. Moving to Medical on Slide 11. Segment profit decreased 49% to $111 million, primarily due to lower products and distribution volumes and unfavorable sales mix and net inflationary impacts, including mitigation initiatives. This decline was partially offset by normalization of PP&E margins. Now, before I turn to fiscal '24, let's cover the balance sheet. In fiscal '23, we generated robust adjusted free cash flow of $2.8 billion with particularly strong cash flow towards the end of the year. We ended the year with $4 billion of cash on hand. At our Investor Day, we highlighted that cash flow optimization was an area of go-forward focus for our teams, and the Cardinal team delivered across our businesses. This effort will continue in fiscal '24, notwithstanding that it is a tougher calendar from an inflow, outflow days-of-week perspective. We remain focused on deploying capital in a balanced, disciplined, and shareholder-friendly manner. In fiscal '23, we invested approximately $480 million of CapEx back into the business to drive future growth, paid down $550 million in debt to reduce leverage and maintain our strong investment-grade ratings, returned over $2.5 billion to shareholders, including through the dividend that our Board increased in May for the 34th year in a row and $2 billion of share repurchases. Now, for our updated fiscal '24 guidance on Slide 13. Today, we are raising our fiscal '24 EPS guidance to a range of $6.50 to $6.75. This increase reflects the strong finish to fiscal '23, particularly within Pharma where we are now entering the year at a higher jump-off point. We also are tightening our shares range to 250 million to 253 million, which reflects the recent share repurchases as well as our continued expectation of $500 million in base share repurchases over the course of fiscal '24. As you will calculate, the midpoint of our newly raised fiscal '24 EPS guidance is 15% above our fiscal '23 EPS results. There are no changes to the other corporate guidance assumptions provided at Investor Day. Interest and other between $110 million to $130 million, and effective tax rate in the range of 23% to 25% and adjusted free cash flow of approximately $2 billion in fiscal '24.  Our segment outlooks for fiscal '24 are also unchanged with one exception, a high revenue range for Pharma driven by the continued acceleration of GLP-1s, which, as a branded product category, do not meaningfully contribute to segment profit. Slide 14 shows our fiscal '24 outlook for Pharma, our build and grow business. We expect revenue growth in the range of 10% to 12% and segment profit growth in the range of 4% to 6%, which is now on a larger fiscal '23 reference point due to our strong finish to the year. We are reiterating our key assumptions provided at Investor Day. We expect growth from our generics program with volume growth and consistent market dynamics and positive operational execution against our organic specialty efforts. We are not assuming outsized benefits from branded inflation. In contrast, some of the benefits that we did see in fiscal '23. On the Pharma fiscal '24 cadence, we expect the year to follow typical seasonality patterns. As usual, we see our fiscal Q3 being the largest segment profit dollar quarter due to the usual timing of branded manufacturer price increases. Turning to Medical. I want to recognize the progress that the Medical team made during fiscal '23, particularly in Q4, and also acknowledge that we still have blocking and tackling to do against the turnaround to both drive demand and improve our cost. For the full year, we are reiterating our assumptions of revenue growth of approximately 3% and segment profit of approximately $400 million for the year, while providing some additional color. Like fiscal '23, we anticipate segment profit to be significantly back-half weighted. We expect Q1 to be generally consistent with the core performance from Q4 with quarterly sequential improvements thereafter driven by our Medical Improvement Plan initiatives. There are a couple of factors for why Q1 is the low point in the year. First, keep in mind that Q1 is the seasonal low point for our global Medical products and distribution business due to the timing of volume and cost recognition. Second, while we continue to expect to exit fiscal '24 offsetting the impact of gross inflation, those improvements are expected to grow over time, making the impact greater over the course of the year. And finally, we continue to plan for slight Cardinal Health brand volume growth that will largely hit in the second half of the fiscal year. So in summary for Medical for fiscal year '24, continued work in front of us with each quarter improving from our Q1 launching point to get us to the approximately $400 million guidance for the year. Stepping back, we are pleased to see growth across our businesses continuing in fiscal '24. Consistent with our messaging from Investor Day, we are targeting a 12% to 14% EPS growth CAGR for fiscal '24 to 2026, now from the higher fiscal '23 baseline of $5.79. Now regarding our intended deployment of cash, which is consistent with our disciplined capital allocation framework as seen on Slide 18. After investing approximately $500 million back into the business to drive organic growth, making approximately $500 million of litigation payments, including our third payment under the national opioid settlement back in July, and our $1 billion baseline return on capital, we expect to have strong flexibility as we assess further investments in the business, M&A and the possibility of incremental return of capital to shareholders. I want to reiterate that as we shared at Investor Day, neither our fiscal '24 guidance or our long-term targets reflect potential opportunistic deployment of capital, including M&A, which is difficult to predict in timing or magnitude or additional share repurchases beyond our $500 million of baseline repurchases each year. We will continue to evaluate both of these levers opportunistically to drive long-term value. To close, the Cardinal team has a lot to be proud of with respect to their accomplishments in fiscal '23. Jason and I are pleased with the progress our teams have made. We are confident in the plans we have in place, and we are excited for our team to realize the significant value creation opportunities still in front of Cardinal Health. With that, I will turn it back over to Jason. Yes. Good morning, Lisa. Thanks for the question. Yes, the primary reason for the raise in the guidance on the revenue is related to the GLP-1. So we did not call out anything else. We saw a strong finish to the year as it relates to that. And looking forward, we see that there's nothing that we can foresee in the near term that will change those trends. As a reminder, we did call out for the first time GLP-1 as a benefit to our revenue from a year-over-year growth perspective in the third quarter. So we have kind of a -- there was growth before that, but not as significant. And so it was more meaningful in Q3 and Q4. So as you look forward to fiscal '24, you would expect that revenue growth to be stronger in the first half of the year as that's more of a contributor. Now of course, we don't know what that slope is going to look like into '24, but we would anticipate as you start to lap the second half of 2023 that, that will be more muted in terms of the year-over-year benefit. And I guess what -- as it relates to your second part of your question, I would just reiterate that these are branded products. And as such, they're just not a meaningful contributor to segment profit and just leave it at that. Next question please. Well, I'll start, and then toss it over to Jason. You are correct in that the way we're thinking about this is that core performance Q4 to Q1 will be roughly in line. And if you interpret what I was just saying in response to an earlier question, we do have some negative seasonality in Q1 versus Q4. So that's why the jumping off point is core performance versus the Q4 results. Jason? Sure. I think I heard a couple of different things, and so I'm going to answer the question I think I heard, and it goes something like this. So we did -- I did comment earlier that in addition to the annualization of the core performance and indeed the inflation mitigation that Jason just touched on that there was $60 million of other benefit coming over the course of the year really driven by the three other pillars within the Med Improvement Plan, the contribution of the growth businesses, the simplification and the Cardinal Health brand work. As I was touching on, that work progresses over the course of the year, and we've seen more benefit towards the back half of the year. I want to emphasize the simplification efforts. Steve and the team are working really hard at that every day. We just see the benefit coming more in the back half. The growth businesses are making good progress. They have some seasonality as well. They are certainly a strong contributor to the additional $60 million over the course of the year. And then Jason has already touched on Cardinal Health brand, so I won't go there. I would just add one thought, which is in Q4, we saw strong volume, as Jason highlighted, but overall consistent market dynamics. And indeed, as we look forward, Jason called out the unit growth, but we are also guiding to consistent market dynamics for the upcoming year as well. Hi, great question. Thank you for putting it on the table for us. Look, we were very focused on our Investor Day in laying out the disciplined capital allocation decision matrix that we apply. And we were also very pleased to see the overall cash generation for fiscal '23 and Q4 in particular. Here's the simple answer. We're going to do what we said we were going to do at Investor Day in that respect. And just as a quick reminder, there are a couple of things which are table stakes for us, which is first, we're going to invest back into the business to drive the organic growth. We spent 480 in fiscal '23. We've guided we're going to spend about $500 million in CapEx against our business plans across the business. Our second priority, of course, is maintaining our investment-grade balance sheet. And you'll recall from our Investor Day that we don't have short-term maturities. We have some bonds coming due at the end of the year that we will likely just refinance. But we're feeling good about our investment-grade balance sheet  And then we've committed to a baseline of return of capital to shareholders, continuing to grow the dividend. We've raised it 34 years in a row. Similarly, we committed to buy back at least $500 million of shares during fiscal year '23. Those are the table stakes parts of how we're going to use our cash. As we then move through the year, as we assess the opportunities in front of us, as we assess how the business is performing, we have two opportunistic levers that we will also be looking at. The first is active, disciplined and targeted M&A largely in specialty, and we have opportunities there that we're looking at as well.

            "name": "Jason Hollar",
            "content": "Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal '23 was an inflection point for Cardinal Health with improved performance, strong execution and notable progress against both our short and long-term plans. We delivered record financial performance, including our highest non-GAAP EPS ever, reflecting 14% growth in the prior year. We grew Pharma segment profit an impressive 13% and generated $2.8 billion of adjusted free cash flow. And in Medical, we drove significant sequential improvement in operating performance from a segment loss in the first quarter to over $80 million of segment profit in Q4. This year, we took decisive action to advance our three strategic imperatives; building upon the resiliency of our Pharma segment, executing our Medical Improvement Plan and maximizing shareholder value creation. Consistent with what you heard at our June Investor Day, these results were achieved through our team's commitment to ruthlessly prioritize the core of our business and to better serve our customers so they, in turn, can focus on caring for patients. We simplified how we operate by streamlining our organizational structure, exiting non-core product lines and rationalizing our geographic and manufacturing footprint. We made key leadership changes and governance enhancements, adding talent and key positions across the enterprise and to our Board. We formed and extended the business review committee tasked with evaluating our strategy, portfolio, operations and capital deployment. On that note, we completed our review of the Pharma segment, including announcements at Investor Day to further invest in our Nuclear & Precision Health Solutions business and launched our new Navista Network supporting community oncologists, which I will discuss more later in my remarks. We recently closed our Outcomes merger with BlackRock's Transaction Data Systems, which we see as a big win for pharmacies and an important opportunity to accelerate the business' future growth. We also deployed capital responsibly with a continued eye on maximizing value, and we are positioned with the financial flexibility to continue driving value for shareholders. At Investor Day, we provided preliminary guidance for fiscal '24. With a strong finish to the year and increased confidence as we look ahead, I am pleased that we can raise our fiscal '24 outlook. Later in my remarks, I will share further details on our three strategic priorities. But first, let me hand it over to Aaron to walk you through our financial results and guidance. Thanks, Aaron. Let's now dive deeper into the actions we are taking to execute our three strategic priorities, beginning with priority number one and building upon the resiliency of the Pharma segment. In our largest most significant business, the Pharma segment has been performing well by prioritizing what matters most, focusing on the core and delivering for our customers and their patients. The business is positioned at the forefront of favorable secular industry trends and has also benefited from our specific actions and performance. We are pleased to recently raise our long-term segment profit target to 4% to 6% growth, solidly in the mid-single digits and consistent with the segment profit growth we expect in fiscal '24. Our growth is enabled by a scaled, stable and resilient core Pharmaceutical distribution business growing in the low single digits and double-digit growth from our higher-margin specialty and Nuclear businesses. Within the core, our generics program remains a critical component of our overall offering and performance, enabled by Red Oak Sourcing. In addition to its leading scale, Red Oak's proprietary analytical tools and deep industry expertise puts us in the best position possible whenever product shortages occur to continue servicing customers. We're committed to providing customer-focused solutions across our many classes of trade as we noted at Investor Day. More recently, we hosted our 31st Annual Retail Business Conference, where we brought together nearly 4,500 attendees from across the country to celebrate the critical role independent pharmacies play in caring for their communities and showcase our commitment to our customers through our newest innovations. For example, we are offering modern payment solutions through our collaboration with Square to help independent pharmacies seamlessly manage business operations, integrate flexible payment options, and reduce payment processing costs. We've conveyed that specialty is our priority area of focus and a key enabler to our long-term growth. We're continuing to invest to expand downstream across key therapeutic areas such as oncology, rheumatology and other emerging areas. We're excited to build upon our existing capabilities with the recent launch of our Navista Network, a specific suite of offerings for community oncologists, supporting their growth and desire to remain independent. To ensure the Navista Network's success in development, we've recently appointed new leadership with deep industry and clinical experience and continue to build out the organization with internal and external talent. We continue to seek input from customers and have created an advisory board. While still early innings, I'm pleased with the engagement from current and potential customers. Upstream in specialty, we're expecting continued double-digit growth from manufacturer services. In our leading 3PL, we're expanding our ambient and cold chain space to keep up with our business' strong growth. At an excess access and patient support, we delivered on a record number of new client implementations and continue to launch new innovative products to streamline the patient journey. We're also supporting the growth of Pharmaceutical manufacturers in the cell and gene therapy space through our advanced therapy solutions offerings. For example, we're partnering with TrakCel to bring visibility and tracking capabilities to biopharma companies by helping them navigate cell therapies through multiple stages of development and commercialization. Overall in specialty, we're confident that the connection between our downstream and upstream strategies, what we call our specialty growth cycle, will drive double-digit growth well into the future. Our Nuclear business, which is on track to double profits by fiscal '26 as of our fiscal '21 baseline, is strategically positioned for growth at the center of precision medicine. We're further investing in the space with a Phase 2 investment of $30 million over the next several years to expand our center for theranostics advancement and support our manufacturer partners' projects as they advance through the commercial development pipeline. We're encouraged to see Pharmaceutical innovation expanding the breadth of conditions that are being addressed with emerging therapies such as cell and gene and precision medicine. As the future of health care continues to evolve, our breadth of capabilities from Pharmaceutical and specialty distribution, radiopharmaceuticals and theranostics to biopharma and manufacturer services enables us to offer multiple touch points for manufacturers, providers and patients to realize value from these promising new treatment options. Now, turning to Medical and priority number two. When we introduced the Medical Improvement Plan last August, our immediate focus was turning around the performance in the core product and distribution, where we've achieved tremendous progress over the past 12 months. We are on track to address the impact of inflation and global supply chain constraints by the time we exit fiscal '24. This is the number one key to returning to a more normalized level of profitability, and we are now over halfway to our target. We continue to execute our mitigation initiatives to offset elevated inflation and make progress with our commercial contracting efforts. And we are exploring other offsets with urgency such as our manufacturing excellence and sourcing initiatives. While overall costs remain elevated, international freight has generally returned to pre-pandemic levels, and we expect this improvement to be reflected in our fiscal '24 results. We're driving significant progress through our 5-point plan to grow Cardinal Health brand volume and seeing improvements in our leading indicators. This includes better portfolio health for key product categories and higher service levels, customer loyalty index scores and retention rates for distribution. We're driving enhanced customer experience through investments in product availability and automation while optimizing costs. At Investor Day, we highlighted our two-pronged approach to portfolio life cycle management, which has enabled us to completely exit our non-health care portfolio. And we are in the process of reducing over 2,000 SKUs across our Cardinal Health Branded product categories to simplify the business. We're focusing our investments in new product development and capacity expansion in key growth areas such as compression, enteral feeding and incontinence. Within our products that are core to distribution, we've seen continued stabilization with PPE, a smaller part of our portfolio but a source of volatility during the pandemic and growth in our pre-sourced surgical fitting category. In our specialty products portfolio comprised of clinically differentiated products and leading brands like Kangaroo, Kendall and Protexis, we're investing in innovation to meet customers' needs and drive sustainable growth. For example, the launch of our new Kangaroo OMNITM Enteral Feeding system this month. As a result of our combined efforts, commercial momentum is accelerating. During Q4, we renewed several key distribution customers and saw positive net new wins during the quarter. These leading indicators give us confidence that moving forward we'll participate in the growth from an overall improving medical utilization environment. Outside the core, we're on track to accelerate our growth businesses. In at-Home Solutions, we're investing in DC network expansion to keep pace with increased demand as care continues to shift into the home. For example, we've recently begun construction for a new 350,000 square foot Greenville, South Carolina, DC. This facility, the 11th in our national network will be fully operational in 18 to 24 months and equipped with advanced automation technology and robotics to drive operational efficiencies. In OptiFreight, we provide premier logistics management powered by our technology capabilities and expertise. We're continuing to invest in digital tools to support core volume growth and sustain our strong performance. Finally, we continue to execute our simplification and cost savings initiatives such as optimizing our global manufacturing and supply chain and our international footprint. For example, we exited four additional countries and two additional manufacturing sites this year. In short, we are making progress with our Medical Improvement Plan. While there is still execution in front of us, I'm excited for the business to return to more significant profitability in fiscal '24. Finally, priority number three, maximizing shareholder value creation. We're maximizing shareholder value creation through operational performance, robust cash flow generation and the responsible allocation of capital. At Investor Day, Aaron detailed our new long-term capital allocation framework, which builds upon our long-standing priorities with some notable enhancements. We're pleased that with our strong cash flow profile and the significant progress we've made on our balance sheet, we have the flexibility for share repurchases each and every year. And with the residual cash flow that we anticipate, we'll continue to opportunistically evaluate disciplined M&A in specialty and potential additional share repurchases. While our team has made significant progress over the past year, particularly in realigning our operations for focus and simplicity, there is still work and opportunity in front of us. We continue to evaluate additional value creation initiatives, including the progress we are making with our ongoing business and portfolio review. To wrap up, I want to acknowledge our dedicated Cardinal Health employees who are fulfilling our essential role in health care, serving customers and their patients. Thank you for your determination and advancing our key priorities and moving healthcare forward. I'm excited for the opportunities still to come. With that, we will take your questions. Eric, good morning. Good to hear your voice and happy to give you a little more context on that. Look, we were quite pleased with the results for Medical, as you can imagine, delivering that $82 million of results. That was $60 million of what we're referring to as for performance and $20 million in aggregate combined positive seasonality and one-time items in the fourth quarter. And I called -- I call it out purposely that way because it does impact how we think through the cadence of quarters during fiscal '24. Now before giving you a little more context on the quarterly guidance, I do want to go back and just observe that we are reiterating the $400 million profit target for the Medical segment from the year. The Medical Improvement Plan, the key components, that remain unchanged from our description at the Investor Day as well. But we are providing a little more color relative to how we see the year playing out, given the number of moving pieces on the blocking and tackling as I referred to in my prepared remarks as we carry forward. So look, from a full year perspective, the way I would have you think about it is this. As I said at Investor Day, if you take $60 million of core performance and multiply that by 4, that gets you to $240 million of profit, right? If you add $100 million of incremental inflation net on top of that, that gets you to $340 million in total. And as we talked about at Investor Day, that leaves about $60 million of contribution from other elements across the year, the simplification of the Cardinal Health brand, et cetera. That's a full year view of how to think about it. Now as we think about the cadence, though, we are being clear that the profit will be back-half weighted during the year just like it was in fiscal year '23. Our view is that Q1 will have similar core performance with Q4 with sequential performance thereafter. Q1 is the seasonal low point for the Med Products and Distribution business due to both the timing of volume as well as our cost recognition. That's an important point. And similarly, we do expect that continued acceleration of inflation mitigation over the course of the year as well. So that will push the profit from a weighting perspective in the back half. And then don't forget that while we were very pleased to call out a sign of change in trend in Cardinal Health brand, we're also clear at Investor Day that the Cardinal Health brand volume growth is largely back-half weighted. Hope that helps. Next question, please. Yes. I'd think about the Cardinal brand volume growth being back half-loaded through a couple of different lenses. First of all, we do think that the underlying utilization will be -- for the market will continue to be relatively consistent. So we do see same-store sales growth out there, and we anticipate that, that will continue. And within our performance within that, we highlighted that our comparison point to the prior year is becoming easier as we did lose some business over the last 18 months or so that we now are lapping and our five-point plan is working. Our five-point plan to improve -- that includes improving the customer experience and importantly, that supply chain health. We're seeing strong progress as it relates to service levels, CLI scores that gave us very good customer retention in the quarter, net new wins that were positive in the quarter. That gives us the foundation that -- that gives us confidence that we'll grow with the underlying market, especially as we continue to lap that prior year impact, which we think will be more impactful in the second half of the year. So all the leading indicators are going as anticipated and consistent with how we laid it out at the Investor Day and gives us the visibility and the confidence that we'll be able to participate in that market growth that we anticipate that will be there over the course of this next year. Next question, please. Sure. Yes. Great. Thanks for the question, George. Yes, so when we think about Navista, I think it's important to recognize that we had a foundation in place. We have a foundation in place, built off of our existing specialty business. We had plenty of programs and initiatives in platforms like our, Navista TS, where we are already providing capabilities to the community oncologists to help support their value-based care initiatives, of course, other data and insights, clinical research support. So we have a lot of the tools. What Navista Network is doing is, bringing that all together in the form of a business with new additional senior leadership brought in place. So that's one of the key things that's happened since the announcement a couple of months ago, is we have brought in additional leadership to bring on top of the strong team that we already had in place that were already serving these important customers and their patients. So we are building that out further with both internal as well as external talent. We also created an advisory board to ensure that we are working directly with both current and prospective customers, more than anything to make sure that they have a strong voice as to where we go next with the development of this platform in this business. We continue to listen and be out in the field doing a lot of research, but we're also building what we're already notably to be some of the key attributes of this platform and this network that they're demanding. What's key and what we highlighted before is that these are the 1,500 that we're focused on here are very strongly interested in maintaining their independence. We're also hearing a strong desire for ongoing transparency, which as health care's most trusted partner, we feel like we're really well positioned for. So it's only been a couple of months since we rolled this out. But in that time frame, we've got the team in place, better definition of what the platform needs to be built out with and continue to work with those prospective customers to make sure that their needs are met. Next question, please. Okay. I think I caught the essence at least part of that. So let me start. I believe part of the question was related to the next part of the inflation mitigation in the second half. I think the other question related to the corporate cost ramp. So let me start with the second part and then throw it over to Aaron for the first part. So as you think about the inflation mitigation and the next piece, there's -- it's really the same for the second 50% as it was the first 50%. So in both cases, what we've seen is a moderation of the international freight. That spiked significantly about two years ago and started coming down about a year ago and got back down to pre-pandemic levels maybe six to nine months ago. So that has been -- started to benefit us as we especially exited fiscal '23. So we did start to see that. It, of course, was inventoried into our inventory, capitalized those costs into our inventories. So it took a little while for that to benefit our P&L as a cost reduce. And along the way, in parallel with that, of course, we were pricing mainly on a temporary basis the first year for those increases as well as increases in other commodity costs and transportation, domestic transportation, increased labor and all those other costs. All those other costs have plateaued. They are not coming down. We don't see any signs of them coming down. And so we have to price permanently for those items. We priced temporarily for the international freight. And as those costs on the international freight roll off, we need to maintain higher prices. And so we are continuing to price and some of those temporary prices are now being rolled into the permanent prices. And so we would expect that as those contracts renew that we'll continue to see more and more of that pricing recognized. I mean, to be very clear, we're not rolling back prices. We've not increased prices beyond the point of our costs. At the 50% level, we're still only being compensated for half of that overall gross impact that we've incurred. But over the course of this year, we do expect the international freight to come down. And by the time we exit fiscal '24, the prices will continue to increase as we go through the course of the year as we get more of those contracts renewed permanently, and then that will cross over with the lower cost, and then we'll exit in that manner at the end of the year. Aaron, on the first question? Next question please, operator? Sure. So in terms of the language change for inflation mitigation, I think you said it best. It's a simplification language. The one thing I would highlight is similar to our disclosures with COVID, over time, those became more difficult to precisely measure. So now we are -- and this inflation mitigation was always focused on the incremental inflation because we had spikes, unusual dramatic spikes in inflation. Well, there's normal inflation as well. So this is just a little bit broader language to recognize that over time, it's becoming harder to differentiate between the two. We have a good understanding of the most significant impacts like the international freight. But when you get into labor, what's normal, what's incremental, it becomes more challenging. And we just have a little bit broader language to recognize that it is going to be less precise than it was early on in our measurement. We're still doing as deep of analytics as possible to get a reasonable understanding of it. As it relates to \u2013 I think \u2013 well, I think the key takeaway with that is we are on track, right, the ultimately, the strategy makes sense. It should be pushed down to the final customer, the final user of the products and services, given the business model. And so we believe that the basic tenets are absolutely unchanged. It's just reflecting the level of precision. On your second question as it relates to generics, as I step back and think about performance for the Pharma segment this year, inclusive of generics, I think you can think about the overall segment as well as the generics business. There's a couple of things that have occurred. There is the overall market utilization has been very strong, and our performance has been very good within that. And it's at levels that for all the reasons Aaron highlighted is that a growth rate is a bit higher than what normal is and certainly higher than what our long-term growth targets are. And as I think forward to fiscal '24, we expect that to normalize. We expect it to still be favorable growth. We indicated during Investor Day in the 2% to 3% type of range from a unit volume growth, and we would expect to participate within that. And we expect our performance to continue with areas like Red Oak Sourcing to continue to drive both the cost as well as to your other related point, the product shortages. They have a dual mandate to drive performance for both cost as well as service levels to customers. So while there are product shortages sporadic within the overall Pharmaceutical distribution supply chain, that's not a new phenomenon. There's various demand driven spikes and supply driven spikes. Our goal, of course, is to minimize those challenges within that to give our customers the best possible service. And what we saw, in fact, in fiscal '23, it was a little bit of a benefit by being able to supply products as a second distributor as not the primary distributor, but we had some opportunities where we were able to provide when others were short on product. So overall, that was a slight positive for us this year as well. And we expect those types of things to be more normalized in fiscal '24 and feel well-positioned to participate in that growth. Next question please. Yes. The utilization, we think, has been fairly consistent. I wouldn't call it an acceleration or anything. We're seeing pretty consistent underlying same-store sales type of growth. So it's sufficient within our business model and where we laid it out from Investor Day, but I wouldn't call out anything unique there. As it relates to PPE normalization, a couple of points. So normalized is good for us. This is not a category that we've ever made a tremendous amount of money and value. It's an important category for our customers. And so we do everything we can to satisfy their needs. So going forward, our objective is to ensure that we get customers the product they need and minimize the volatility that goes along with that. But I just don't see it being a material driver one way or the other. Recall that the challenges with PPE was that we had volatile price cost and volume all at once. What you have right now is a normalization that's been occurring over the last couple of years of both price and cost has been coming down somewhat steadily. And they've been staying in a relative type of spread close enough to one another that, that's been manageable. And it's that volume that's been a little bit more challenging. We've highlighted that it was destocking beginning about -- well, over a year ago now in terms of the underlying volume there. But given the margins are relatively tight for this type of product, getting those margins right and relatively low margins means that the volume volatility or the lack of volume growth is not much of an issue for us, because it's just not a large contributor of incremental volume or incremental margins. So we're at a level that I think it's fairly stable, and it's our objective to keep it that way. Next question, please operator. Okay, great. Thanks again for joining us this morning. To summarize, fiscal '23 was a great year. It was a year of inflection, and we are excited to continue this momentum into fiscal '24 and beyond. With that, thank you and have a great day."

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jason.\nJason Hollar: Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Overall, we're pleased to deliver another quarter demonstrating progress against our plans with our Q3 results led by continued momentum and growth in the Pharma segment. With a strong overall performance in the quarter and our increased confidence in the rest of the year, we are raising and narrowing our fiscal '23 EPS and adjusted free cash flow guidance. Our Pharma business is a resilient and growing business where we're well positioned given our critical role in the pharmaceutical supply chain and strong and diverse customer base. We've seen ongoing stability in the underlying fundamentals of the business, including consistent market dynamics in our generics program. We've also seen continued broad-based strength in pharmaceutical demand spanning across product categories and classes of trade. Pharma team is executing our plans to build upon this growth, both in our core distribution operations and in Specialty, where we're focused on capturing the increasing demand for Specialty Products and Services. In short, we're pleased with the resiliency and strength of the business and to be able to raise our Pharma outlook for fiscal '23. Medical, we remain confident in our medical improvement plan target of at least $650 million of segment profit by fiscal '25, driven by our inflation mitigation and growth initiatives. While we are making progress with the second consecutive quarter of positive segment profit, we remain focused on taking actions to drive more predictable financial performance in line with this business's underlying potential. For several quarters now, we've seen demand for our higher margin Cardinal Health brand products remain generally stagnant, which we've reflected in our updated fiscal '23 outlook. We continue to achieve progress with inflation mitigation, the number one key to returning the business to a more normalized level of profitability. Across the enterprise, we are operating with urgency to drive our businesses forward. We're collectively focused on our three key strategic priorities of executing on the medical improvement plan, building on the growth and resiliency of the Pharmaceutical segment, and maintaining a relentless focus on maximizing shareholder value. I'll provide some further updates on our continued progress shortly, but first, let me turn it over to Aaron to review our results and updated outlook.\nAaron Alt: Thank you, Jason. I am pleased to join you this morning on my first call since assuming the CFO role with nearly 90 days now under my belt. What I could see from the outside has proven to be true on the inside. Cardinal Health is a business with a strong leadership team and engaged board, a defined strategy, a strong balance sheet and plenty of operational opportunities to promote value creation for our stakeholders. I'll begin today with the enterprise's strong results for the third quarter. Total revenue increased 13% to $50.5 billion and gross margin increased 6% to $1.8 billion, both driven by the Pharma segment. Consolidated SG&A increased 4% to $1.2 billion, primarily reflecting inflationary supply chain costs, which were offset in part by our comprehensive enterprise wide cost savings initiatives. Operating earnings of $606 million were 11% higher than the third quarter of last year, driven by significant Pharma segment profit growth with opportunities remaining for us to achieve Medical segment profit increases in future quarters. Moving below the line interest and other decreased 32% to $28 million, driven primarily by increased interest income from cash and equivalents. As a reminder, our debt is largely fixed rate, resulting in a net benefit from rising interest rates. Our third quarter effective tax rate finished at 22.4%, slightly lower than we had expected, reflecting some positive discrete items in the quarter. Diluted weighted average shares were 258 million, 7% lower than a year ago due to continued share repurchase actions. The net result of the progress against our strategy was adjusted earnings per share of $1.74 in the third quarter growth of 20% versus the prior year. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with strong liquidity with $4 billion of cash on hand. The business generated robust adjusted free cash flow of $1.3 billion in the third quarter. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow is $2.1 billion. Given our cash balances, we ended the period with no outstanding borrowings on our credit facilities. And in further support of our strong investment grade rating, during the quarter, we paid down $550 million of maturing March 2023 notes with cash on hand consistent with our plans. We also extended our $2 billion revolver of backup liquidity until February of 2028. Earlier in my remarks, I referenced return of capital to shareholders. During the quarter, we returned $378 million to shareholders through a $250 million accelerated share repurchase program and payment of our long standing dividend. Year-to-date, we've returned $1.5 billion through share repurchase and made nearly $400 million in dividend payments. Now I will cover our segment performance beginning with Pharma on slide five. Third quarter revenue increased 14% to $47 billion, driven by brand and specialty pharmaceutical sales growth from existing customers. We saw strong, broad based pharmaceutical demand, particularly from our largest customers. GLP1 medications also provided a revenue tailwind in the quarter. Pharma segment profit increased 23% to $600 million. We were pleased to see that this progress was driven by both positive generic program results, including volume and mix, and by a higher contribution from brand and specialty products. Within our generics program, we continue to see consistent market dynamics and strong performance from Red Oak Sourcing. With regards to branded and specialty products, the higher contribution reflects a modest benefit from manufacturer price increases. As a reminder, while over 95% of our overall branded margin is derived from fixed fee-for-service agreements, the contingent portion is highly concentrated in our fiscal third quarter. Moving to the key growth area of Specialty. We've seen strong double-digit growth across specialty distribution along with our upstream manufacturer services. Our nuclear business, which is tracking ahead of plan, continued its double-digit growth, including benefiting from recent launches of Novel Theranostics. Within our pharmaceutical supply chain, we continue to effectively manage through the incremental inflationary cost pressures seen industry wide. And in the third quarter, these net impacts were not material on a year-over-year basis. Finally, in the quarter, we lapped more significant opioid related legal costs and higher costs related to the now completed ERP technology enhancements. Now turning to Medical on slide six. Third quarter revenue decreased 5% to $3.7 billion, driven by lower products and distribution sales, primarily due to expected PPE volume and price declines. Medical segment profit decreased 66% versus prior year to $20 million, primarily due to lower products and distribution volumes and unfavorable sales mix. Additionally, these results reflect both net unfavorable non-recurring adjustments, including simplification actions and some modest year-over-year improvements in PPE margins. Similar to Q2, we observed normalized PPE margins in the third quarter. Regarding the demand environment, we've previously discussed some overall volume softness in our products and distribution business, including Cardinal Health brand. In the quarter, volumes for our Cardinal Health brand products were roughly flat sequentially. We achieved inflation mitigation of over 40% during the quarter, driven by our continued efforts. We also saw benefits from our ongoing cost savings initiatives such as in our manufacturing and supply chain. Now for our updated fiscal '23 outlook beginning on slide eight. Our team is working hard and we are seeing positive results in key parts of our portfolio. As we move into the final quarter of the year, we are narrowing and raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance range from $5.20 to $5.50 to a new range of $5.60 to $5.80. At the midpoint, this represents a $0.35 cent increase and 13% year-over-year growth. This update primarily reflects an improved outlook for the Pharmaceutical segment for the year, as well as a more modest short-term outlook for Medical. While we will save commentary or updates on long-term segment guidance for our upcoming Investor Day on June 8th, we are sharing today that we are reaffirming the long-term financial guidance in the medical improvement plan for the Medical segment. We are also updating some key enterprise wide assumptions as seen on slide eight. Based on year-to-date performance, we now expect interest and other in the range of $95 million to $105 million, a non-GAAP ETR of approximately 22% to 23% for the year and adjusted free cash flow generation of $2 billion to $2.3 billion for the year. We expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the range of 262 million to 263 million, reflecting our year-to-date repurchase activity and continued expectation of $1.5 billion to $2 billion in total share repurchases in fiscal '23. Finally, we now expect capital expenditures of approximately $450 million, reflecting the timing of our continued investment to drive organic growth. Turning to the segments on slide nine. In Pharma, with a strong pharmaceutical demand and performance that we've seen to date, we now expect full year revenue growth in the range of 14% to 15% and segment profit growth between 10.5% to 12% growth. We are extremely pleased with the ongoing resiliency and strength of the business and our plans to drive double-digit profit growth in fiscal year '23. Yet when looking at the more normalized performance of the Pharma business, it's important to note our fiscal '23 outlook includes two non-recurring year-over-year tailwinds. First, as noted, we experienced a modest benefit from branded manufacturer price increases in fiscal year '23 that we assume is unlikely to repeat in future years. Additionally, relative to the prior year comparisons, our previous fiscal year '23 guidance assumed offsetting year-over-year impacts in total between several non-recurring drivers, higher than usual inflationary supply chain costs, lower opioid related legal costs and lower costs for technology enhancements compared to fiscal year '22. However, we now expect the in-year comparison to fiscal year '22 for these items to produce a modest year-over-year tailwind unique to fiscal year '23. We will provide insights into our long-term targets for Pharma during our Investor Day, including some early guidance for fiscal year '24. Turning to Medical, we now expect a revenue decline of approximately 6% and a segment profit decline of approximately 50% for the year. This updated outlook reflects three key changes. First, third quarter actual results, as I've already discussed. Second, updated assumptions around Cardinal Health brand volumes, namely that we will see relatively consistent demand patterns for the remainder of the fiscal year. Third, delayed realization of lower costs, which we have previously incurred primarily related to international freight. Based on our updated volume expectations, we now expect some of the previously anticipated fourth quarter improvements in the P&L to shift into fiscal '24. As a reminder, on the cost side, we've seen significant improvement in incurred international freight costs, which are capitalized into inventory on our balance sheet. These costs are then recognized in our P&L results on a delay as we sell through the products. We continue to have strong line of sight into this eventual benefit. However, due to timing, the impact to our fourth quarter results will be more modest than previously assumed. Importantly, we continue to expect to exit the year, offsetting at least 50% of the gross impact from inflation. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, the approximate $60 million sequential improvement in Medical segment profit embedded in our guidance primarily reflects the combination of three items. First, the normalization from the non-recurring adjustments from Q3. Second, continued improvement in progress on our mitigation initiatives, including the benefit from the previously incurred international freight costs. Third, and to a lesser extent, normal seasonality improvements in the fourth quarter. So in financial summary, an excellent financial quarter overall, our raise to guidance with opportunities still in front of us. With that, I'll now turn it back over to Jason.\nJason Hollar: Thanks, Aaron. Now a few key updates on our three strategic priorities for fiscal '23. First, executing our medical improvement plan initiatives. We remain on track with our mitigation actions for inflation and global supply chain constraints, and I'm pleased with our continued incremental progress on this critical front. We've now mitigated over 40% of the gross impact to our business through our mitigation initiatives. This includes widespread temporary price increases across nearly all of our Cardinal Health brand product categories, supplier distribution fee increases to offset higher transportation, labor and fuel costs, and our focus on other offset opportunities such as additional sourcing efficiencies. We continue to work collaboratively with our industry partners to make pricing adjustments that are reflective of current market conditions on our path to fully mitigating this headwind by the time we exit fiscal '24 through these collective actions. By taking a transparent approach, we are also advancing our re-contracting efforts, successfully adjusting long-term product contracts as they renew, and including language that allows for greater future flexibility. While costs generally remain significantly elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels, we've seen a stabilization across most areas, along with improvement in international freight. We believe we are now past peak overall cost levels as the improved international freight costs will begin to be reflected in our fourth quarter results. We remain committed to our mitigation efforts, as highlighted earlier. To drive growth outside our mitigation actions, we are focused on optimizing and growing our Cardinal Health brand portfolio, accelerating our growth businesses and driving simplification and continued cost optimization. As Aaron indicated, demand for our Cardinal Health brand products has remained generally stagnant over the first three quarters of fiscal '23. We believe market demand will improve in fiscal '24 and '25 coinciding with our ongoing initiatives to increase product availability, drive new product innovation and implement other commercial improvements. As an example of product innovation, we recently unveiled the new Kangaroo OMNI Enteral Feeding platform at the ESPEN Congress. OMNI is the only enteral pump cleared to accurately deliver thick formula and is designed to meet enteral feeding needs from the hospital to home, infancy to end of life. OMNI has received very positive feedback from both clinicians and patients, generating excitement for the launch in early fiscal '24. Outside of US product and distribution, we're driving growth in other key areas of the segment. at-Home Solutions, Medical Services, including OptiFreight Logistics and WaveMark and international products and distribution. For example, in at-Home Solutions, we are expanding our footprint to match the sustained growth of home health care we are seeing in the industry and our business. Our new Central Ohio distribution center is now operational. This new location is the next step in supporting our growth strategy and will be equipped with systems and automation capabilities to improve safety, service and operational efficiencies. A new audited storage and retrieval system will increase throughput and capacity. An ideal technology for at-Home Solutions facilities that are primarily focused on direct-to-patient fulfillment. In OptiFreight Logistics, we are accelerating our growth as a leader in tech-enabled logistics management by driving best-in-class customer experience and continually diversifying our product offerings. And we continue to take action to drive simplification across our Medical business by optimizing our distribution and global supply chain network and through our active approach to product life cycle management. Next, in Pharma, we're building upon the growth and the resiliency of the business. We are privileged to serve and partner with a broad customer base, providing essential health care services in their respective communities, including leaders in retail pharmacy, mail order, grocery and health systems among the many classes of trade. We support our customers by bringing significant scale and leading offerings to market, including our comprehensive generics program anchored by the capabilities of Red Oak Sourcing. To keep pace with the strong and resilient demand we are seeing from our customers, we continue to focus on strengthening our core operations by continually developing customer focused solutions and investing in new technologies across our supply chain. Our goal is to continue providing innovative tools that address the unique challenges of our customers while unlocking value and further efficiencies across our distribution supply chain. We're also prioritizing the area of specialty through our actions and investments. Our new organizational design is driving efficiencies and further effectiveness, enabling us to move quicker and better prioritize the needs of our customers and manufacturer partners. Downstream, we've seen continued double-digit growth across specialty distribution, including in health systems and alternative care. And in the physician office channel, our acquisition of the Bendcare GPO and investment in their MSO continues to drive a differentiated engagement model for rheumatologists through our expanded capabilities. Upstream with biopharma manufacturers. We again saw double-digit growth for manufacturer services in the third quarter. Our leading specialty 3PL continues to win new business, including in the area of cell and gene therapy. Through Q3, we supported 27 product launches with double-digit launches anticipated in the fourth quarter. And in our nuclear business, we're seeing a growing demand pipeline for our Center for Theranostics Advancement in Indianapolis. We've seen strong volumes from recent Theranostics launches, such as radiopharmaceutical supporting prostate-specific PET imaging. With the continued success of the business, combined with the innovation that's occurring in the space, we continue to be excited about this very promising area. And lastly a brief update regarding our relentless focus on shareholder value creation. We have placed a strong emphasis on responsible capital deployment, including the return of capital to shareholders. This is evident through our plans to return over $2 billion to shareholders in fiscal '23 through dividends and share repurchases. We will continue to pursue opportunities for additional shareholder value creation. Our management team has made significant progress in realigning our operations to drive focus and simplicity. Our work is ongoing and we continue to work through a comprehensive review of our company's strategy, portfolio, capital allocation framework and operations with the support of our Board and the business review committee. Given the importance of this work today, we announced that the Board has extended the term of the committee for an additional year through July 15, 2024, and we have also extended the term of the cooperation agreement with Elliot. We are very much looking forward to our upcoming Investor Day on June 8th in New York City and the opportunity to further articulate why we believe Cardinal Health is well positioned for long-term success and our plans to maximize shareholder value. Among other topics, we plan to detail our growth strategies and provide updates on our long-term outlook, capital allocation framework and the ongoing business and portfolio review. Before I conclude, I want to thank our Cardinal Health employees who are advancing our key strategic priorities and fulfilling our essential role in health care, serving customers and their patients. While there's still work to do, I am encouraged by our team's continued progress and excited about our future opportunities. With that, we will take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you very much, sir. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question is coming from Michael Cherny coming from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMichael Cherny: Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Maybe if I can just dig in on the Medical side and just get an understanding, especially given the bridge dynamics between where you're run rating versus the build to the $650 million in '25. Is there any way you can go into more detail about what the quantitative and qualitative components of what led to the nonrecurring piece that's been absorbed within the segment? And then as you think about the dynamics behind that, how does that roll off over time as part of that build towards the longer-term multiyear targets?\nJason Hollar: Sure. Thanks, Michael. Yes. Let's break down the inflation into the components as a way of giving you the pieces I think you're asking for there. And we've given you enough of this, you can back into these numbers, but let me just be really explicit around the impact of inflation across the quarters in fiscal '23 and what that then implies for '24 and beyond. And I think that will get at most of your questions. So the first half of the year, namely within Q2, somewhere around Q1, Q2, we saw the peak net impact of inflation, gross inflation net of the mitigation actions. And then specifically in Q2, we had about $100 million included in our reported Medical segment earnings. Now we have had improvements over the course of the last quarter. So in Q3, we saw both the ongoing pricing dynamics as expected and the costs continue to be incurred at lower levels as expected. And what that did then was drove a P&L benefit related to those mitigation actions of $20 million to $30 million for the quarter. The difference in the quarter is that both Q3 as well as Q4, our volumes are now expected to be lower. So what we see in the P&L is a little bit less than what we had anticipated. But what we're spending on those incurred costs are coming in as expected. So again, that's Q2 to Q3, a $20 million to $30 million improvement in the net impact. And then we expect pricing to continue to improve as we roll over more and more contracts into the new permit structure. And then we have ongoing the international freight especially continue to roll through our P&L, again, at a slower pace than originally anticipated, but we still expect that benefit in the fourth quarter, and that's another $20 million to $30 million. So as you think about that Q2 to Q4 journey, that's $40 million to $60 million or let's call it about $50 million of benefit just related to the mitigation actions. So again, the actions are entirely consistent with our expectations. It's just that volume component is effectively delaying the benefit of what we see until some of it spilling over into fiscal '24 more than what we had anticipated. So that's the biggest part of the bridge because our guidance implies an $80 million-ish type of run rate in the fourth quarter. And so getting that Q2 to Q4, $50 million of that, that kind of gets you there. Now to your point, in Q3, there were some nonrecurring items, some puts and takes that we don't anticipate will continue on into Q4, let alone 2024 and 2025. So that's kind of in and out and not really something to think about so much in terms of that overall bridge. Now the last part of this story then is, okay, so that gets you to the run rate of about $80 million in the fourth quarter. And as I said, we started with $100 million at the beginning of the year, Q2 impacted because of inflation. The $20 million to $30 million each quarter takes you down to the $50 million in Q4. That implies that in that $80 million of profit as we exit the year in our Q4 results, still includes $50 million for the quarter related to the net impact of inflation. That's the opportunity that we remain committed to. Nothing we're talking about here is different than our expectations. I continue to expect us to fully mitigate through pricing of the ongoing renewals as well as this cost will continue to come down in terms of what impacts our P&L. We do not anticipate significant further reductions in other commodity areas, but we do expect that international freight will stay at the low levels that it currently is at. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Next question is coming from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nLisa Gill: Thanks very much and thanks for all the detail. Jason, I know you're going to talk about this at your Analyst Day around the portfolio review. But there's been some speculation around your nuclear business. Can you just talk about the contribution that, that had maybe overall thus far this year and how you see that? Is that a core component of your business going forward? Or is this something that you would think about when you think about your portfolio review? And any insights you have around nuclear would be helpful?\nJason Hollar: As you would expect, Lisa. First of all, good morning. I'm not going to comment on the any of the rumors or speculation. What I'll say is nuclear is a fantastic business. In our segment footnote, we break out the revenue that's trending a little above $1 billion. It did increase a bit here because of some RevRec changes that's taking our revenue growth at well over 30%. But the kind of the normalized level of revenue growth has been in the low double-digit type of revenue growth. So it's been growing nicely. We've never broken out the margin, but we have indicated it's a higher than average margin. So it's a growing business. It's a strong business and a great secular area. And that's all that we're going to say about that. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you very much, sir. We'll now go to Kevin Caliendo calling from UBS. Please go ahead, sir.\nKevin Caliendo: Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. I want to -- I appreciate all the color around the things that you can control on the Medical side. But it's a little confusing to understand why market demand has been stagnant the last couple of quarters for your products. Given what we hear from at least the public hospitals and the like who clearly are doing better, is there a geographic issue? Is it a customer issue that you're not seeing increased demand? Is purchasing changing at the hospital level? Just -- or is it a product portfolio issue? Like what's actually happening in the marketplace that's kind of kept your private portfolio stagnant?\nJason Hollar: Yes. There's a few components I can provide some additional color on. First of all, we've highlighted the some of the categories. So PPE, we've highlighted the destocking situation still. So we're not seeing anything new or different there. We have some other categories like our lab business, which is actually seeing a little bit of a headwind sequentially. Nothing too significant, but it's certainly with COVID originally and then with flu testing, we had some pretty good volume over the last couple of years, and that's getting more normalized. So we have some headwinds like that. For the other non-PPE type of Cardinal Health brand categories that are important to us, especially from a margin perspective, what we have to go back to is just highlight that a couple of years ago, last year, we saw some very significant supply chain constraints. And at that time, we were not able to get our customers the products that they needed. Fortunately, we've been working very hard on that. Our product availability, our product health, our customer service levels are at levels we've not seen since before the pandemic. So we're in really, really good shape now, but we were not getting all the products to our customers that they needed over that period of time. And we lost some opportunity as a result of that. So that's why we're not benefiting from as much of the growth right now. I do think that the underlying utilization is improving. We're not getting our fair share of that. And that's where we're very focused on further investments in our capacity, further investments and product innovation, but also just making certain that we keep our service levels ever increasing to levels that are really exciting our customers, so that they want to buy more and more of that product from us. And we're in the best position we've been in, in years and have more confidence that we'll get there. This is an important part of the medical improvement plan, right? It's one of the four pillars of growth. And so we are anticipating further improvements. It is about 20% of the actions necessary for us to hit the $50 million-plus target. That's why we're very focused on the other actions as well to see if we can over deliver and derisk this. But we do believe that utilization will continue to improve overall for the market, and we are better positioned now than we've been in a long time to participate in that, and I feel good about our prospects to see that growth, especially as we get into fiscal '24.\nKevin Caliendo: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Elizabeth Anderson calling from Evercore. Please go ahead.\nElizabeth Anderson: Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question. One, I was hoping, thanks for all the details on the Medical business. I was wondering if you could just help us on one more thing and sort of exclusively tell us what the contribution of -- or the hit from onetime items was in the quarter on Medical? And then two, can you talk about the pushes and pulls on the Pharma operating profit in the fourth quarter? Because it seems like it could be a little bit of a bit conservative there. So I just want to make sure that we have all the dynamics down there. Thank you.\nJason Hollar: Okay. So I'll make a comment on your first part of your question, I'll turn it over to Aaron for the second one. It's nothing that we've explicitly quantified just wanted to highlight the words that we used, again, that it was a modest net negative impact in Q3. So it's one component. It's a number of puts and takes within there. I did highlight that as an example, one of the types of items are some costs for further simplification actions. We had some of that in the first quarter as well. So we're constantly looking at our portfolio and taking action to improve our ongoing profitability and that required us to take some further adjustments within the quarter, but nothing else to really highlight there other than the key is that we just don't expect them to continue, certainly not the long-term or even into the rest of our guidance for fiscal '24. Aaron?\nAaron Alt: Good morning. Happy to talk about the Pharma business. First, just let me repeat a little bit of what I said in my prepared remarks, which is we are really pleased with the performance of the Pharma business and what the team is accomplishing in that core part of our business the resiliency and the strength that they showed in Q3 based on the progress on the generics platform as well as some strength in the brand portfolio and the double-digit growth in specialty allowed us to be able to lean forward and raise our guidance for the year for the Pharma business. I want to highlight a couple of things as you think about Q4, which I think was the point of your question, which is, while we expect to see continued good news relative to the operational performance and a stable macro environment, with the strong underlying fundamentals we laid out, it is important to note that Q4 last year was a strong quarter for us, and so we're lapping a higher point. It's also the case that we'll have less benefit from some nonrecurring items that we called out in our prepared remarks earlier as well. And so overall, strong performance in Q3, looking forward to a good Q4. But careful in our expectation setting.\nOperator: Thanks very much, sir. We'll now move to Eric Percher of Nephron. Please go ahead.\nEric Percher: Thank you. Staying on the Pharma side, I wanted to ask whether the changes we're seeing to list prices around the insulin products and the potential for more changes in front of the AMP Cap Sunset next year is significant. I understand this is a change to fee-for-service economics, and that gives you a right to renegotiate. But how would you characterize renegotiations that type when they come up? And are you confident you can maintain absolute profit or something close to it?\nJason Hollar: Yes. In short, very confident that we'll continue to appropriately be compensated for our activity-based value. So this is not any different than the various other types of adjustments we've had to make over the years, and it's something that I think we've demonstrated makes sense to make the appropriate adjustments. The other thing I'd highlight is the starting point for a product like this is not real strong margins to start with. So there's not a big profit pool from which to draw value from. So we do expect to be compensated for the value that we provide and we'll continue to monitor and follow. One thing we had talked about in the past on this type of topic is where I have the most concern is when we don't have sufficient visibility to changes and that something would just kind of fall in our lab at the last minute because it does require some renegotiation, restructuring in some cases of how the arrangements are made. This one is a little bit more straightforward, and we feel like we can negotiate the appropriate outcome for it. And we certainly have the time for it. But the distinction is if there's ever any really short-term type of impact, and that would be needed to be addressed separately.\nOperator: Thanks very much, sir. Next question is coming from George Hill of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Hill: Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I guess, first, as it relates to the Cardinal Health branded products in Medical, I guess, Jason, is there any way to evaluate whether or not you guys are losing wallet share with customers and that guy is impacting volumes? And I guess my quick follow-up on that would be as we know that you guys have historically look forward bought commodity-based products. I guess is there any way to provide any more color around the timing of when Medical in flex as it relates to kind of the forward buying and the commodity impact in the inflation mitigation. Just trying to think about when we kind of like when we see the inflation as it relates to these lower costs really pulling through.\nJason Hollar: Yes. So as it relates to share I think when you look back at our volume, we had a step down in volume in Q3 and Q4 of last year. And again that was -- there was a lot of PPE that came out there. We clearly lost share there. It is a business that's a commodity business for us. It's important for our customers. We participate as needed. We source most of that product. So it's a category that's not our priority. What's most important is that we take care of our customer needs. In the non-Cardinal volume, and we also saw some weakness there, as I mentioned before, the supply chain constraints. So as other providers had capacity then we would have had a lower share as a result of that. Again I think there's been very little of that change since then. Our service levels and our product health have improved dramatically even over the course of fiscal '23. So I do not believe that we have everything that we're seeing from a new contracting perspective has been consistent with our expectations here this year. So I don't see anything new there. But we are dealing with some impacts that happened over the last couple of years. That part is the case. Your second question, I think, I answered it before in terms of the timing associated with the commodity impact is really the international freight is the big one that's reduced. And that reduced significantly six to nine months ago. And that's why right now, we're on the cusp of having to hit our P&L favorably or benefit our P&L is because we typically have two to three quarters' worth of inventory. Why it's spilling over into '24 is that our volumes have been lower than anticipated. And so it's taking a little bit longer for us to recognize that benefit. I've not called out any significant movements on other commodities. There's clearly movement. There's some better. There's some that have not improved. Overall, it's consistent with our expectations. We expected a little bit of an improvement across the board, and we just haven't seen anything more than that outside of international freight. We do have some categories that are just staying very high like nonwovens, where there's a bit of a geopolitical impact on those types of costs and not just on raw input costs. And so that is something that may or may not change in the future. It's why we have to have the right structure in the contract, if there's a further shock to be able to have more flexibility with our price adjustments. But overall, we're seeing the other commodities continue to be pretty stable, admittedly at fairly high levels, but they're not changing enough to really impact our overall message here. And by the way, as those change, our pricing will change. Our objective is to offset this. We're not expecting to make a margin on this. But if those come down more quickly, then at some point, I would imagine that those costs will adjust -- those prices will adjust consistent with that. But right now, we are still absorbing $50 million, well, $50 million to $75 million right now per quarter of those costs, and that's why our prices do need to still keep increasing until those two lines converge, which we think will be, again, closer to the end of fiscal '24.\nOperator: Thank you very much, sir. Next question is coming from Eric Coldwell of Baird. Please go ahead, sir.\nEric Coldwell: Thank you. Most of mine have been covered, but I did want to hit on the generics pricing topic. I know you've made some positive comments during the call, but also suggested that market dynamics are generally consistent. We've seen some generic pricing in our data, some generic pricing deflation improvement over the last few months. I'm curious if you're seeing the same thing. And what your outlook might be on that front moving forward? Thank you.\nJason Hollar: Thanks, Eric. We called out favorable volume and mix and consistent market dynamics. As we've highlighted many times before, it's important to look at the total of both sides, buy and sell. And we continue to think those overall dynamics are fairly well balanced. And there will be ongoing volatility on one direction or the other, one side or the other, but it's the importance of Red Oak Sourcing and continue to deliver the best-in-class service levels as well as cost. And we feel very good about our competitive positioning there and why we think the margin per unit will continue to be as expected and not as much a part of the story than as the volume in the mix.\nOperator: Thank you very much, sir. Next question is going to come from Mr. Steven Valiquette calling from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSteven Valiquette: Great. Thanks. Good morning. You might have just touched on this a little bit, but I guess I was curious more just for the overall Pharma segment. You've had obviously a bunch of consecutive quarters now of double-digit top line growth, including 14% this quarter. And you talked about brand inflation, brand volume, generic specialty, all being strong. So I guess my question was related to.\nOperator: Very sorry about that gentlemen. [Operator Instructions] We'll go to Daniel Grosslight of Citi.\nJason Hollar: Well, if I could, I think I might know where he's going with the question. I think he was leading up to -- I'm guessing that he's leading up to, were there any deviations from that. I mean what we saw was really broad-based performance throughout our Pharma segment. I meant -- I've asked -- answered questions about nuclear, nuclear was just like our other businesses this quarter. We referenced generics. We referenced brand. We referenced specialty. We saw a strong performance across the board. Utilization is certainly strong across the board. I also wanted to highlight our performance on delivering this very strong volume was also positive. The one thing to maybe add to this as well, the -- we talked about a new customer that was onboarded Q3 of last year. And that was -- they were onboarded in the prior year Q3, but there's always a ramp-up process there. So we did see some benefit this quarter relative to last year in terms of this customer now being fully onboarded. So we had a bit of a benefit there, not to the extent of what we saw in the last couple of quarters. And then the last piece that has been -- was very robust this quarter as well. That was not the case in the prior year, certainly were the GLP-1s that Aaron had mentioned. So it was a combination of strength across customer class customers, trade -- class of trade as well as the individual business units. All right. So now you can go ahead to the next question.\nOperator: Thank you very much, sir. Sorry about that. Our next question is coming from Daniel Grosslight calling from Citi.\nDaniel Grosslight: Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I had a similar question, but more on the EBIT for Pharma. Nice raise obviously this quarter. But I'm curious if you can kind of break out for us the nonrecurring items in a little more detail in the Pharma EBIT raise and how much will be recurring in fiscal '24? Thanks.\nAaron Alt: Well, I think the benefit of them being nonrecurring items is they won't recur into fiscal '24. If your question is more on Q4, I think the answer is similar in that way. For the Pharma segment, we saw strength across the board. It was a stable macro situation. We had the strong underlying fundamentals. We have the good operational performance as well. We did see some modest benefit from branded manufacturer price increases and this being the third quarter for us as well, which we don't -- we don't predict are going to repeat as we carry forward. And so I think the story for us for Pharma was a good year so far, a good quarter for Q3. We have -- we raised our guidance for the year, and we'll talk more about fiscal '24 and indeed our long-term expectations for the business during our Investor Day on June 8th.\nJason Hollar: Yes. And I'll just add, the way Aaron put it was perfect as it relates to true nonrecurring items, the only one that we could think of that way would have been -- it depends on your assumption of what you think brand inflation will be next year. That was modest. The other part that we did call out that was a benefit from a growth rate perspective year-over-year is that we do see some of our costs related to opioid legal fees and our ERP implementation running a little bit lower than anticipated. Now those are -- that's nonrecurring, right? It just means that we have gotten to a bit more of a normalized level quicker than what we had anticipated. So I do not expect there to be further significant improvements in the out periods out years related to those costs going down even further. It will be something that we'll continue to evaluate and provide updates if that's the case. But it's for those reasons why our implied growth rate in Q4 is more normalized. It's also why we're not communicating anything differently right now for our longer-term targets. And we'll certainly revisit that point when we come together at the Investor Day on June 8th. But generally speaking, we're seeing the strength, whether it's the new customer, the brand inflation or some of these cost drivers trending in the right direction, are all items that we think we are normalizing now on a go-forward basis and why you should expect more normalized margins from here on out.\nDaniel Grosslight: Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Thank you very much, sir. Next question is coming from Charles Rhyee calling from TD Cowen. Please go ahead, sir.\nCharles Rhyee: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to -- just wanted to follow up. I think it was with Eric's question around, you were talking about in that specific instance about insulin pricing and sort of how you can kind of mitigate some of that. Can you just kind of go into, again, for us a little bit, how your fee-for-service contracts are arranged generally? And maybe more specifically, with insulin perhaps ahead of with these changes occurring, and -- because I would have thought that a lot of the language is already built into your contracts that would automate sort of adjudicate to maintain sort of the -- to capture that service that you are providing. And then as a follow-up, you had talked earlier about sort of Red Oak and continuing to perform well in generics. Curious if any work in Red Oak is being done in terms of biosimilars and trying to get better economics on that side as well. Thanks.\nJason Hollar: Well, I'm not going to go into the mechanics of a product level contracts and structure. Just go back and reiterate that we feel very confident about our process, our experience, our history with any type of change that comes any other product. Again, as a distributor, we play a role. We play the role of getting the product from the manufacturers to those who need it. And with that will always be changes in the structure and how we go about it. But we -- nothing is different in today's environment than what's been present for the last 50 years of our existence when we'll have to continue to adapt and evolve with this and that's enough to be said there.\nAaron Alt: And then with respect to biosimilars, what we would say is that we are quite well positioned to support the next phase of growth over the next several years in that expanding therapeutic area on the sites of care. It's going to -- we believe it's going to come predominantly from products with a greater retailer or a specialty pharmacy presence, which plays to our strength as well as new therapeutic areas such as immunology and ophthalmology. And so we -- our expectation is it will be a tailwind for us as we push ahead into the end of fiscal year '23 and beyond.\nJason Hollar: Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you very much, sir. Thank you, sir. Next question is from A.J. Rice of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, sir.\nJonathan Yong: Thanks. It's Jonathan Yong on for A.J. here. Just going back to Medical again. I appreciate the comments on the cost improvements that you're doing and how that's going to set up a good framework for '24. But I guess given some of the volume constraints that you're kind of seeing and not seeing the same flow through, how much of improvement related to the cost side, especially on the freight line is tied to actually improving that volume side that you kind of need to flow through. Thanks.\nJason Hollar: Well, so it depends on the time frame we're talking about, but for fiscal '25, our ultimate goal of the $650 million that volume impact we're talking about will not materially impact at all the recognition of the inflation mitigation. That is something that does have some volatility quarter-to-quarter, which is exactly what we highlighted as one of the drivers in the guidance change for this year. But it's not something that will impact significantly the future quarters let alone when we get to fiscal '25. And so I think about volume, the volume component of the order of magnitude of the impact and the benefit that we expect for growing this volume is that $75 million that we have on one of the slides in the presentation, that volume pillar of growing Cardinal Health brand products, that is the order of magnitude we're talking about. And so I do not believe long-term that, that spills over and impacts the mitigation and the cost side of that. So you can think about those as independent as it relates to the longer term impacts, they are a bit more mix in the terms of the short term and what that does to how quickly we recognize that, that lower cost, but that is very much just a short-term timing effect.\nOperator: Thank you very much, sir. And our last question today is going to be coming from Brian Tanquilut calling from Jefferies. Please go ahead, sir.\nKristen Shuman: Hi. This is Kristen Shuman for Brian. And you might have mentioned this earlier, but I just want to clarify. So could you just give some guidance around how much of the Pharma segment EBITDA guidance range is expected to recur in fiscal '24? Thank you.\nAaron Alt: Well, we have not provided fiscal year '24 guidance. We're pleased to report the strong performance in Q3. As we've talked about, and indeed, we did raise our guidance overall for Pharma. For the year, we're now expecting the profit guidance to be 10.5% to 12% for the full year. That's in contrast to our earlier guidance of low single digit to mid-single digit. So we are expecting a good finish to the year from this business, and we're excited to see you all on June 8th at our Investor Day presentation.\nOperator: Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's Q&A session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Jason Hollar for any additional closing remarks.\nJason Hollar: Yes. Great. Thank you, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I know that we threw a lot out at you today, but we have a lot going on as an organization and just wanted to share the progress with you and give you more insight to a lot of the key drivers. If I step back and just think about what we went through, certainly, feel terrific about the progress that we're making across the enterprise. Pharma has, of course, a fantastic quarter, a fantastic year, broad-based as we talked. On the Medical side of the business, we have opportunity. We're very, very focused on driving the medical improvement plan. We feel really good about the progress we made are clearly making in three of those four pillars. We have work to do on the underlying volume. We'll have more confidence in where the market is going for that volume also have confidence in the leading indicators that will take for us to get our fair share of that volume. Of course, also, we're very pleased with the cash performance that we had and that we talked about today and that raising that guidance, narrowing the guidance as well. It highlights both the strong cash management that we have, but also the responsible capital deployment that's going along with that. So just again, thank you for your time today and look forward to seeing you all of you at the Investor Day on June 8th.\nOperator: Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen that will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your time. You may now disconnect. Have a good day and goodbye.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Aaron Alt",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason. I am pleased to join you this morning on my first call since assuming the CFO role with nearly 90 days now under my belt. What I could see from the outside has proven to be true on the inside. Cardinal Health is a business with a strong leadership team and engaged board, a defined strategy, a strong balance sheet and plenty of operational opportunities to promote value creation for our stakeholders. I'll begin today with the enterprise's strong results for the third quarter. Total revenue increased 13% to $50.5 billion and gross margin increased 6% to $1.8 billion, both driven by the Pharma segment. Consolidated SG&A increased 4% to $1.2 billion, primarily reflecting inflationary supply chain costs, which were offset in part by our comprehensive enterprise wide cost savings initiatives. Operating earnings of $606 million were 11% higher than the third quarter of last year, driven by significant Pharma segment profit growth with opportunities remaining for us to achieve Medical segment profit increases in future quarters. Moving below the line interest and other decreased 32% to $28 million, driven primarily by increased interest income from cash and equivalents. As a reminder, our debt is largely fixed rate, resulting in a net benefit from rising interest rates. Our third quarter effective tax rate finished at 22.4%, slightly lower than we had expected, reflecting some positive discrete items in the quarter. Diluted weighted average shares were 258 million, 7% lower than a year ago due to continued share repurchase actions. The net result of the progress against our strategy was adjusted earnings per share of $1.74 in the third quarter growth of 20% versus the prior year. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with strong liquidity with $4 billion of cash on hand. The business generated robust adjusted free cash flow of $1.3 billion in the third quarter. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow is $2.1 billion. Given our cash balances, we ended the period with no outstanding borrowings on our credit facilities. And in further support of our strong investment grade rating, during the quarter, we paid down $550 million of maturing March 2023 notes with cash on hand consistent with our plans. We also extended our $2 billion revolver of backup liquidity until February of 2028. Earlier in my remarks, I referenced return of capital to shareholders. During the quarter, we returned $378 million to shareholders through a $250 million accelerated share repurchase program and payment of our long standing dividend. Year-to-date, we've returned $1.5 billion through share repurchase and made nearly $400 million in dividend payments. Now I will cover our segment performance beginning with Pharma on slide five. Third quarter revenue increased 14% to $47 billion, driven by brand and specialty pharmaceutical sales growth from existing customers. We saw strong, broad based pharmaceutical demand, particularly from our largest customers. GLP1 medications also provided a revenue tailwind in the quarter. Pharma segment profit increased 23% to $600 million. We were pleased to see that this progress was driven by both positive generic program results, including volume and mix, and by a higher contribution from brand and specialty products. Within our generics program, we continue to see consistent market dynamics and strong performance from Red Oak Sourcing. With regards to branded and specialty products, the higher contribution reflects a modest benefit from manufacturer price increases. As a reminder, while over 95% of our overall branded margin is derived from fixed fee-for-service agreements, the contingent portion is highly concentrated in our fiscal third quarter. Moving to the key growth area of Specialty. We've seen strong double-digit growth across specialty distribution along with our upstream manufacturer services. Our nuclear business, which is tracking ahead of plan, continued its double-digit growth, including benefiting from recent launches of Novel Theranostics. Within our pharmaceutical supply chain, we continue to effectively manage through the incremental inflationary cost pressures seen industry wide. And in the third quarter, these net impacts were not material on a year-over-year basis. Finally, in the quarter, we lapped more significant opioid related legal costs and higher costs related to the now completed ERP technology enhancements. Now turning to Medical on slide six. Third quarter revenue decreased 5% to $3.7 billion, driven by lower products and distribution sales, primarily due to expected PPE volume and price declines. Medical segment profit decreased 66% versus prior year to $20 million, primarily due to lower products and distribution volumes and unfavorable sales mix. Additionally, these results reflect both net unfavorable non-recurring adjustments, including simplification actions and some modest year-over-year improvements in PPE margins. Similar to Q2, we observed normalized PPE margins in the third quarter. Regarding the demand environment, we've previously discussed some overall volume softness in our products and distribution business, including Cardinal Health brand. In the quarter, volumes for our Cardinal Health brand products were roughly flat sequentially. We achieved inflation mitigation of over 40% during the quarter, driven by our continued efforts. We also saw benefits from our ongoing cost savings initiatives such as in our manufacturing and supply chain. Now for our updated fiscal '23 outlook beginning on slide eight. Our team is working hard and we are seeing positive results in key parts of our portfolio. As we move into the final quarter of the year, we are narrowing and raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance range from $5.20 to $5.50 to a new range of $5.60 to $5.80. At the midpoint, this represents a $0.35 cent increase and 13% year-over-year growth. This update primarily reflects an improved outlook for the Pharmaceutical segment for the year, as well as a more modest short-term outlook for Medical. While we will save commentary or updates on long-term segment guidance for our upcoming Investor Day on June 8th, we are sharing today that we are reaffirming the long-term financial guidance in the medical improvement plan for the Medical segment. We are also updating some key enterprise wide assumptions as seen on slide eight. Based on year-to-date performance, we now expect interest and other in the range of $95 million to $105 million, a non-GAAP ETR of approximately 22% to 23% for the year and adjusted free cash flow generation of $2 billion to $2.3 billion for the year. We expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the range of 262 million to 263 million, reflecting our year-to-date repurchase activity and continued expectation of $1.5 billion to $2 billion in total share repurchases in fiscal '23. Finally, we now expect capital expenditures of approximately $450 million, reflecting the timing of our continued investment to drive organic growth. Turning to the segments on slide nine. In Pharma, with a strong pharmaceutical demand and performance that we've seen to date, we now expect full year revenue growth in the range of 14% to 15% and segment profit growth between 10.5% to 12% growth. We are extremely pleased with the ongoing resiliency and strength of the business and our plans to drive double-digit profit growth in fiscal year '23. Yet when looking at the more normalized performance of the Pharma business, it's important to note our fiscal '23 outlook includes two non-recurring year-over-year tailwinds. First, as noted, we experienced a modest benefit from branded manufacturer price increases in fiscal year '23 that we assume is unlikely to repeat in future years. Additionally, relative to the prior year comparisons, our previous fiscal year '23 guidance assumed offsetting year-over-year impacts in total between several non-recurring drivers, higher than usual inflationary supply chain costs, lower opioid related legal costs and lower costs for technology enhancements compared to fiscal year '22. However, we now expect the in-year comparison to fiscal year '22 for these items to produce a modest year-over-year tailwind unique to fiscal year '23. We will provide insights into our long-term targets for Pharma during our Investor Day, including some early guidance for fiscal year '24. Turning to Medical, we now expect a revenue decline of approximately 6% and a segment profit decline of approximately 50% for the year. This updated outlook reflects three key changes. First, third quarter actual results, as I've already discussed. Second, updated assumptions around Cardinal Health brand volumes, namely that we will see relatively consistent demand patterns for the remainder of the fiscal year. Third, delayed realization of lower costs, which we have previously incurred primarily related to international freight. Based on our updated volume expectations, we now expect some of the previously anticipated fourth quarter improvements in the P&L to shift into fiscal '24. As a reminder, on the cost side, we've seen significant improvement in incurred international freight costs, which are capitalized into inventory on our balance sheet. These costs are then recognized in our P&L results on a delay as we sell through the products. We continue to have strong line of sight into this eventual benefit. However, due to timing, the impact to our fourth quarter results will be more modest than previously assumed. Importantly, we continue to expect to exit the year, offsetting at least 50% of the gross impact from inflation. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, the approximate $60 million sequential improvement in Medical segment profit embedded in our guidance primarily reflects the combination of three items. First, the normalization from the non-recurring adjustments from Q3. Second, continued improvement in progress on our mitigation initiatives, including the benefit from the previously incurred international freight costs. Third, and to a lesser extent, normal seasonality improvements in the fourth quarter. So in financial summary, an excellent financial quarter overall, our raise to guidance with opportunities still in front of us. With that, I'll now turn it back over to Jason. Good morning. Happy to talk about the Pharma business. First, just let me repeat a little bit of what I said in my prepared remarks, which is we are really pleased with the performance of the Pharma business and what the team is accomplishing in that core part of our business the resiliency and the strength that they showed in Q3 based on the progress on the generics platform as well as some strength in the brand portfolio and the double-digit growth in specialty allowed us to be able to lean forward and raise our guidance for the year for the Pharma business. I want to highlight a couple of things as you think about Q4, which I think was the point of your question, which is, while we expect to see continued good news relative to the operational performance and a stable macro environment, with the strong underlying fundamentals we laid out, it is important to note that Q4 last year was a strong quarter for us, and so we're lapping a higher point. It's also the case that we'll have less benefit from some nonrecurring items that we called out in our prepared remarks earlier as well. And so overall, strong performance in Q3, looking forward to a good Q4. But careful in our expectation setting. Well, I think the benefit of them being nonrecurring items is they won't recur into fiscal '24. If your question is more on Q4, I think the answer is similar in that way. For the Pharma segment, we saw strength across the board. It was a stable macro situation. We had the strong underlying fundamentals. We have the good operational performance as well. We did see some modest benefit from branded manufacturer price increases and this being the third quarter for us as well, which we don't -- we don't predict are going to repeat as we carry forward. And so I think the story for us for Pharma was a good year so far, a good quarter for Q3. We have -- we raised our guidance for the year, and we'll talk more about fiscal '24 and indeed our long-term expectations for the business during our Investor Day on June 8th. And then with respect to biosimilars, what we would say is that we are quite well positioned to support the next phase of growth over the next several years in that expanding therapeutic area on the sites of care. It's going to -- we believe it's going to come predominantly from products with a greater retailer or a specialty pharmacy presence, which plays to our strength as well as new therapeutic areas such as immunology and ophthalmology. And so we -- our expectation is it will be a tailwind for us as we push ahead into the end of fiscal year '23 and beyond. Well, we have not provided fiscal year '24 guidance. We're pleased to report the strong performance in Q3. As we've talked about, and indeed, we did raise our guidance overall for Pharma. For the year, we're now expecting the profit guidance to be 10.5% to 12% for the full year. That's in contrast to our earlier guidance of low single digit to mid-single digit. So we are expecting a good finish to the year from this business, and we're excited to see you all on June 8th at our Investor Day presentation."

            "name": "Jason Hollar",
            "content": "Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Overall, we're pleased to deliver another quarter demonstrating progress against our plans with our Q3 results led by continued momentum and growth in the Pharma segment. With a strong overall performance in the quarter and our increased confidence in the rest of the year, we are raising and narrowing our fiscal '23 EPS and adjusted free cash flow guidance. Our Pharma business is a resilient and growing business where we're well positioned given our critical role in the pharmaceutical supply chain and strong and diverse customer base. We've seen ongoing stability in the underlying fundamentals of the business, including consistent market dynamics in our generics program. We've also seen continued broad-based strength in pharmaceutical demand spanning across product categories and classes of trade. Pharma team is executing our plans to build upon this growth, both in our core distribution operations and in Specialty, where we're focused on capturing the increasing demand for Specialty Products and Services. In short, we're pleased with the resiliency and strength of the business and to be able to raise our Pharma outlook for fiscal '23. Medical, we remain confident in our medical improvement plan target of at least $650 million of segment profit by fiscal '25, driven by our inflation mitigation and growth initiatives. While we are making progress with the second consecutive quarter of positive segment profit, we remain focused on taking actions to drive more predictable financial performance in line with this business's underlying potential. For several quarters now, we've seen demand for our higher margin Cardinal Health brand products remain generally stagnant, which we've reflected in our updated fiscal '23 outlook. We continue to achieve progress with inflation mitigation, the number one key to returning the business to a more normalized level of profitability. Across the enterprise, we are operating with urgency to drive our businesses forward. We're collectively focused on our three key strategic priorities of executing on the medical improvement plan, building on the growth and resiliency of the Pharmaceutical segment, and maintaining a relentless focus on maximizing shareholder value. I'll provide some further updates on our continued progress shortly, but first, let me turn it over to Aaron to review our results and updated outlook. Thanks, Aaron. Now a few key updates on our three strategic priorities for fiscal '23. First, executing our medical improvement plan initiatives. We remain on track with our mitigation actions for inflation and global supply chain constraints, and I'm pleased with our continued incremental progress on this critical front. We've now mitigated over 40% of the gross impact to our business through our mitigation initiatives. This includes widespread temporary price increases across nearly all of our Cardinal Health brand product categories, supplier distribution fee increases to offset higher transportation, labor and fuel costs, and our focus on other offset opportunities such as additional sourcing efficiencies. We continue to work collaboratively with our industry partners to make pricing adjustments that are reflective of current market conditions on our path to fully mitigating this headwind by the time we exit fiscal '24 through these collective actions. By taking a transparent approach, we are also advancing our re-contracting efforts, successfully adjusting long-term product contracts as they renew, and including language that allows for greater future flexibility. While costs generally remain significantly elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels, we've seen a stabilization across most areas, along with improvement in international freight. We believe we are now past peak overall cost levels as the improved international freight costs will begin to be reflected in our fourth quarter results. We remain committed to our mitigation efforts, as highlighted earlier. To drive growth outside our mitigation actions, we are focused on optimizing and growing our Cardinal Health brand portfolio, accelerating our growth businesses and driving simplification and continued cost optimization. As Aaron indicated, demand for our Cardinal Health brand products has remained generally stagnant over the first three quarters of fiscal '23. We believe market demand will improve in fiscal '24 and '25 coinciding with our ongoing initiatives to increase product availability, drive new product innovation and implement other commercial improvements. As an example of product innovation, we recently unveiled the new Kangaroo OMNI Enteral Feeding platform at the ESPEN Congress. OMNI is the only enteral pump cleared to accurately deliver thick formula and is designed to meet enteral feeding needs from the hospital to home, infancy to end of life. OMNI has received very positive feedback from both clinicians and patients, generating excitement for the launch in early fiscal '24. Outside of US product and distribution, we're driving growth in other key areas of the segment. at-Home Solutions, Medical Services, including OptiFreight Logistics and WaveMark and international products and distribution. For example, in at-Home Solutions, we are expanding our footprint to match the sustained growth of home health care we are seeing in the industry and our business. Our new Central Ohio distribution center is now operational. This new location is the next step in supporting our growth strategy and will be equipped with systems and automation capabilities to improve safety, service and operational efficiencies. A new audited storage and retrieval system will increase throughput and capacity. An ideal technology for at-Home Solutions facilities that are primarily focused on direct-to-patient fulfillment. In OptiFreight Logistics, we are accelerating our growth as a leader in tech-enabled logistics management by driving best-in-class customer experience and continually diversifying our product offerings. And we continue to take action to drive simplification across our Medical business by optimizing our distribution and global supply chain network and through our active approach to product life cycle management. Next, in Pharma, we're building upon the growth and the resiliency of the business. We are privileged to serve and partner with a broad customer base, providing essential health care services in their respective communities, including leaders in retail pharmacy, mail order, grocery and health systems among the many classes of trade. We support our customers by bringing significant scale and leading offerings to market, including our comprehensive generics program anchored by the capabilities of Red Oak Sourcing. To keep pace with the strong and resilient demand we are seeing from our customers, we continue to focus on strengthening our core operations by continually developing customer focused solutions and investing in new technologies across our supply chain. Our goal is to continue providing innovative tools that address the unique challenges of our customers while unlocking value and further efficiencies across our distribution supply chain. We're also prioritizing the area of specialty through our actions and investments. Our new organizational design is driving efficiencies and further effectiveness, enabling us to move quicker and better prioritize the needs of our customers and manufacturer partners. Downstream, we've seen continued double-digit growth across specialty distribution, including in health systems and alternative care. And in the physician office channel, our acquisition of the Bendcare GPO and investment in their MSO continues to drive a differentiated engagement model for rheumatologists through our expanded capabilities. Upstream with biopharma manufacturers. We again saw double-digit growth for manufacturer services in the third quarter. Our leading specialty 3PL continues to win new business, including in the area of cell and gene therapy. Through Q3, we supported 27 product launches with double-digit launches anticipated in the fourth quarter. And in our nuclear business, we're seeing a growing demand pipeline for our Center for Theranostics Advancement in Indianapolis. We've seen strong volumes from recent Theranostics launches, such as radiopharmaceutical supporting prostate-specific PET imaging. With the continued success of the business, combined with the innovation that's occurring in the space, we continue to be excited about this very promising area. And lastly a brief update regarding our relentless focus on shareholder value creation. We have placed a strong emphasis on responsible capital deployment, including the return of capital to shareholders. This is evident through our plans to return over $2 billion to shareholders in fiscal '23 through dividends and share repurchases. We will continue to pursue opportunities for additional shareholder value creation. Our management team has made significant progress in realigning our operations to drive focus and simplicity. Our work is ongoing and we continue to work through a comprehensive review of our company's strategy, portfolio, capital allocation framework and operations with the support of our Board and the business review committee. Given the importance of this work today, we announced that the Board has extended the term of the committee for an additional year through July 15, 2024, and we have also extended the term of the cooperation agreement with Elliot. We are very much looking forward to our upcoming Investor Day on June 8th in New York City and the opportunity to further articulate why we believe Cardinal Health is well positioned for long-term success and our plans to maximize shareholder value. Among other topics, we plan to detail our growth strategies and provide updates on our long-term outlook, capital allocation framework and the ongoing business and portfolio review. Before I conclude, I want to thank our Cardinal Health employees who are advancing our key strategic priorities and fulfilling our essential role in health care, serving customers and their patients. While there's still work to do, I am encouraged by our team's continued progress and excited about our future opportunities. With that, we will take your questions. Sure. Thanks, Michael. Yes. Let's break down the inflation into the components as a way of giving you the pieces I think you're asking for there. And we've given you enough of this, you can back into these numbers, but let me just be really explicit around the impact of inflation across the quarters in fiscal '23 and what that then implies for '24 and beyond. And I think that will get at most of your questions. So the first half of the year, namely within Q2, somewhere around Q1, Q2, we saw the peak net impact of inflation, gross inflation net of the mitigation actions. And then specifically in Q2, we had about $100 million included in our reported Medical segment earnings. Now we have had improvements over the course of the last quarter. So in Q3, we saw both the ongoing pricing dynamics as expected and the costs continue to be incurred at lower levels as expected. And what that did then was drove a P&L benefit related to those mitigation actions of $20 million to $30 million for the quarter. The difference in the quarter is that both Q3 as well as Q4, our volumes are now expected to be lower. So what we see in the P&L is a little bit less than what we had anticipated. But what we're spending on those incurred costs are coming in as expected. So again, that's Q2 to Q3, a $20 million to $30 million improvement in the net impact. And then we expect pricing to continue to improve as we roll over more and more contracts into the new permit structure. And then we have ongoing the international freight especially continue to roll through our P&L, again, at a slower pace than originally anticipated, but we still expect that benefit in the fourth quarter, and that's another $20 million to $30 million. So as you think about that Q2 to Q4 journey, that's $40 million to $60 million or let's call it about $50 million of benefit just related to the mitigation actions. So again, the actions are entirely consistent with our expectations. It's just that volume component is effectively delaying the benefit of what we see until some of it spilling over into fiscal '24 more than what we had anticipated. So that's the biggest part of the bridge because our guidance implies an $80 million-ish type of run rate in the fourth quarter. And so getting that Q2 to Q4, $50 million of that, that kind of gets you there. Now to your point, in Q3, there were some nonrecurring items, some puts and takes that we don't anticipate will continue on into Q4, let alone 2024 and 2025. So that's kind of in and out and not really something to think about so much in terms of that overall bridge. Now the last part of this story then is, okay, so that gets you to the run rate of about $80 million in the fourth quarter. And as I said, we started with $100 million at the beginning of the year, Q2 impacted because of inflation. The $20 million to $30 million each quarter takes you down to the $50 million in Q4. That implies that in that $80 million of profit as we exit the year in our Q4 results, still includes $50 million for the quarter related to the net impact of inflation. That's the opportunity that we remain committed to. Nothing we're talking about here is different than our expectations. I continue to expect us to fully mitigate through pricing of the ongoing renewals as well as this cost will continue to come down in terms of what impacts our P&L. We do not anticipate significant further reductions in other commodity areas, but we do expect that international freight will stay at the low levels that it currently is at. Next question please. As you would expect, Lisa. First of all, good morning. I'm not going to comment on the any of the rumors or speculation. What I'll say is nuclear is a fantastic business. In our segment footnote, we break out the revenue that's trending a little above $1 billion. It did increase a bit here because of some RevRec changes that's taking our revenue growth at well over 30%. But the kind of the normalized level of revenue growth has been in the low double-digit type of revenue growth. So it's been growing nicely. We've never broken out the margin, but we have indicated it's a higher than average margin. So it's a growing business. It's a strong business and a great secular area. And that's all that we're going to say about that. Next question please. Yes. There's a few components I can provide some additional color on. First of all, we've highlighted the some of the categories. So PPE, we've highlighted the destocking situation still. So we're not seeing anything new or different there. We have some other categories like our lab business, which is actually seeing a little bit of a headwind sequentially. Nothing too significant, but it's certainly with COVID originally and then with flu testing, we had some pretty good volume over the last couple of years, and that's getting more normalized. So we have some headwinds like that. For the other non-PPE type of Cardinal Health brand categories that are important to us, especially from a margin perspective, what we have to go back to is just highlight that a couple of years ago, last year, we saw some very significant supply chain constraints. And at that time, we were not able to get our customers the products that they needed. Fortunately, we've been working very hard on that. Our product availability, our product health, our customer service levels are at levels we've not seen since before the pandemic. So we're in really, really good shape now, but we were not getting all the products to our customers that they needed over that period of time. And we lost some opportunity as a result of that. So that's why we're not benefiting from as much of the growth right now. I do think that the underlying utilization is improving. We're not getting our fair share of that. And that's where we're very focused on further investments in our capacity, further investments and product innovation, but also just making certain that we keep our service levels ever increasing to levels that are really exciting our customers, so that they want to buy more and more of that product from us. And we're in the best position we've been in, in years and have more confidence that we'll get there. This is an important part of the medical improvement plan, right? It's one of the four pillars of growth. And so we are anticipating further improvements. It is about 20% of the actions necessary for us to hit the $50 million-plus target. That's why we're very focused on the other actions as well to see if we can over deliver and derisk this. But we do believe that utilization will continue to improve overall for the market, and we are better positioned now than we've been in a long time to participate in that, and I feel good about our prospects to see that growth, especially as we get into fiscal '24. Okay. So I'll make a comment on your first part of your question, I'll turn it over to Aaron for the second one. It's nothing that we've explicitly quantified just wanted to highlight the words that we used, again, that it was a modest net negative impact in Q3. So it's one component. It's a number of puts and takes within there. I did highlight that as an example, one of the types of items are some costs for further simplification actions. We had some of that in the first quarter as well. So we're constantly looking at our portfolio and taking action to improve our ongoing profitability and that required us to take some further adjustments within the quarter, but nothing else to really highlight there other than the key is that we just don't expect them to continue, certainly not the long-term or even into the rest of our guidance for fiscal '24. Aaron? Yes. In short, very confident that we'll continue to appropriately be compensated for our activity-based value. So this is not any different than the various other types of adjustments we've had to make over the years, and it's something that I think we've demonstrated makes sense to make the appropriate adjustments. The other thing I'd highlight is the starting point for a product like this is not real strong margins to start with. So there's not a big profit pool from which to draw value from. So we do expect to be compensated for the value that we provide and we'll continue to monitor and follow. One thing we had talked about in the past on this type of topic is where I have the most concern is when we don't have sufficient visibility to changes and that something would just kind of fall in our lab at the last minute because it does require some renegotiation, restructuring in some cases of how the arrangements are made. This one is a little bit more straightforward, and we feel like we can negotiate the appropriate outcome for it. And we certainly have the time for it. But the distinction is if there's ever any really short-term type of impact, and that would be needed to be addressed separately. Yes. So as it relates to share I think when you look back at our volume, we had a step down in volume in Q3 and Q4 of last year. And again that was -- there was a lot of PPE that came out there. We clearly lost share there. It is a business that's a commodity business for us. It's important for our customers. We participate as needed. We source most of that product. So it's a category that's not our priority. What's most important is that we take care of our customer needs. In the non-Cardinal volume, and we also saw some weakness there, as I mentioned before, the supply chain constraints. So as other providers had capacity then we would have had a lower share as a result of that. Again I think there's been very little of that change since then. Our service levels and our product health have improved dramatically even over the course of fiscal '23. So I do not believe that we have everything that we're seeing from a new contracting perspective has been consistent with our expectations here this year. So I don't see anything new there. But we are dealing with some impacts that happened over the last couple of years. That part is the case. Your second question, I think, I answered it before in terms of the timing associated with the commodity impact is really the international freight is the big one that's reduced. And that reduced significantly six to nine months ago. And that's why right now, we're on the cusp of having to hit our P&L favorably or benefit our P&L is because we typically have two to three quarters' worth of inventory. Why it's spilling over into '24 is that our volumes have been lower than anticipated. And so it's taking a little bit longer for us to recognize that benefit. I've not called out any significant movements on other commodities. There's clearly movement. There's some better. There's some that have not improved. Overall, it's consistent with our expectations. We expected a little bit of an improvement across the board, and we just haven't seen anything more than that outside of international freight. We do have some categories that are just staying very high like nonwovens, where there's a bit of a geopolitical impact on those types of costs and not just on raw input costs. And so that is something that may or may not change in the future. It's why we have to have the right structure in the contract, if there's a further shock to be able to have more flexibility with our price adjustments. But overall, we're seeing the other commodities continue to be pretty stable, admittedly at fairly high levels, but they're not changing enough to really impact our overall message here. And by the way, as those change, our pricing will change. Our objective is to offset this. We're not expecting to make a margin on this. But if those come down more quickly, then at some point, I would imagine that those costs will adjust -- those prices will adjust consistent with that. But right now, we are still absorbing $50 million, well, $50 million to $75 million right now per quarter of those costs, and that's why our prices do need to still keep increasing until those two lines converge, which we think will be, again, closer to the end of fiscal '24. Thanks, Eric. We called out favorable volume and mix and consistent market dynamics. As we've highlighted many times before, it's important to look at the total of both sides, buy and sell. And we continue to think those overall dynamics are fairly well balanced. And there will be ongoing volatility on one direction or the other, one side or the other, but it's the importance of Red Oak Sourcing and continue to deliver the best-in-class service levels as well as cost. And we feel very good about our competitive positioning there and why we think the margin per unit will continue to be as expected and not as much a part of the story than as the volume in the mix. Well, if I could, I think I might know where he's going with the question. I think he was leading up to -- I'm guessing that he's leading up to, were there any deviations from that. I mean what we saw was really broad-based performance throughout our Pharma segment. I meant -- I've asked -- answered questions about nuclear, nuclear was just like our other businesses this quarter. We referenced generics. We referenced brand. We referenced specialty. We saw a strong performance across the board. Utilization is certainly strong across the board. I also wanted to highlight our performance on delivering this very strong volume was also positive. The one thing to maybe add to this as well, the -- we talked about a new customer that was onboarded Q3 of last year. And that was -- they were onboarded in the prior year Q3, but there's always a ramp-up process there. So we did see some benefit this quarter relative to last year in terms of this customer now being fully onboarded. So we had a bit of a benefit there, not to the extent of what we saw in the last couple of quarters. And then the last piece that has been -- was very robust this quarter as well. That was not the case in the prior year, certainly were the GLP-1s that Aaron had mentioned. So it was a combination of strength across customer class customers, trade -- class of trade as well as the individual business units. All right. So now you can go ahead to the next question. Yes. And I'll just add, the way Aaron put it was perfect as it relates to true nonrecurring items, the only one that we could think of that way would have been -- it depends on your assumption of what you think brand inflation will be next year. That was modest. The other part that we did call out that was a benefit from a growth rate perspective year-over-year is that we do see some of our costs related to opioid legal fees and our ERP implementation running a little bit lower than anticipated. Now those are -- that's nonrecurring, right? It just means that we have gotten to a bit more of a normalized level quicker than what we had anticipated. So I do not expect there to be further significant improvements in the out periods out years related to those costs going down even further. It will be something that we'll continue to evaluate and provide updates if that's the case. But it's for those reasons why our implied growth rate in Q4 is more normalized. It's also why we're not communicating anything differently right now for our longer-term targets. And we'll certainly revisit that point when we come together at the Investor Day on June 8th. But generally speaking, we're seeing the strength, whether it's the new customer, the brand inflation or some of these cost drivers trending in the right direction, are all items that we think we are normalizing now on a go-forward basis and why you should expect more normalized margins from here on out. Well, I'm not going to go into the mechanics of a product level contracts and structure. Just go back and reiterate that we feel very confident about our process, our experience, our history with any type of change that comes any other product. Again, as a distributor, we play a role. We play the role of getting the product from the manufacturers to those who need it. And with that will always be changes in the structure and how we go about it. But we -- nothing is different in today's environment than what's been present for the last 50 years of our existence when we'll have to continue to adapt and evolve with this and that's enough to be said there. Next question please. Well, so it depends on the time frame we're talking about, but for fiscal '25, our ultimate goal of the $650 million that volume impact we're talking about will not materially impact at all the recognition of the inflation mitigation. That is something that does have some volatility quarter-to-quarter, which is exactly what we highlighted as one of the drivers in the guidance change for this year. But it's not something that will impact significantly the future quarters let alone when we get to fiscal '25. And so I think about volume, the volume component of the order of magnitude of the impact and the benefit that we expect for growing this volume is that $75 million that we have on one of the slides in the presentation, that volume pillar of growing Cardinal Health brand products, that is the order of magnitude we're talking about. And so I do not believe long-term that, that spills over and impacts the mitigation and the cost side of that. So you can think about those as independent as it relates to the longer term impacts, they are a bit more mix in the terms of the short term and what that does to how quickly we recognize that, that lower cost, but that is very much just a short-term timing effect. Yes. Great. Thank you, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I know that we threw a lot out at you today, but we have a lot going on as an organization and just wanted to share the progress with you and give you more insight to a lot of the key drivers. If I step back and just think about what we went through, certainly, feel terrific about the progress that we're making across the enterprise. Pharma has, of course, a fantastic quarter, a fantastic year, broad-based as we talked. On the Medical side of the business, we have opportunity. We're very, very focused on driving the medical improvement plan. We feel really good about the progress we made are clearly making in three of those four pillars. We have work to do on the underlying volume. We'll have more confidence in where the market is going for that volume also have confidence in the leading indicators that will take for us to get our fair share of that volume. Of course, also, we're very pleased with the cash performance that we had and that we talked about today and that raising that guidance, narrowing the guidance as well. It highlights both the strong cash management that we have, but also the responsible capital deployment that's going along with that. So just again, thank you for your time today and look forward to seeing you all of you at the Investor Day on June 8th."

With that, I'll turn the call over to Jason.\nJason Hollar: Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Before we dive in, I'd like to take a moment to welcome Aaron Alt to Cardinal Health as our incoming Chief Financial Officer. We're excited to have Aaron on board. He brings a breadth of financial and operational experience to our organization, including a background in distribution and he's already hit the ground running in his first few weeks. I'm confident he will be a valuable addition as the leader of our finance organization, contributor to our executive committee and a seamless fit with our company culture.\nAaron Alt: Thank you, Jason. Good morning. I am excited to be part of the team here at Cardinal, particularly at such an important time not only for our company but for the entire health care industry. What attracted me to Cardinal Health was the broad portfolio, the overall culture and the leadership team that is motivated to win. While still early days for me, I can already tell that while there's work to do, Jason and the team have a plan and there are significant opportunities for value creation in front of us. I look forward to interacting with all of you further in the weeks and months to come as I continue to ramp up.\nJason Hollar: Thanks, Aaron. Now let's begin with some high-level perspectives on the second quarter. Overall, our Q2 results demonstrated continued momentum against our plans. In Pharma, we've seen ongoing stability in the macro trends and underlying fundamentals of the business. In the quarter, we saw particular strength in overall pharmaceutical demand and strong performance from our Generics program. We've seen an increase in contributions from Specialty products, which is a key strategic area of focus. And we continue to effectively manage through the inflationary headwinds affecting industry supply chains. In short, Q2 was another data point that Pharma is a resilient and growing business. In Medical, we remain highly focused on our medical improvement plan initiatives. Overall, despite some puts and takes, Medical's Q2 results were consistent with our prior commentary, and we were pleased to see a return to profitability in the quarter. We continue to take actions to drive more predictable financial performance, in line with this business' underlying potential. At an enterprise level, we continue to see benefits below the operating line from our capital deployment actions and favorable capital structure. With the first half of fiscal 2023 behind us, we are pleased to raise our full year EPS guidance and outlook for the Pharmaceutical segment. Our team remains focused on executing our three key strategic priorities of executing on the medical improvement plan, building on the growth and resiliency of the Pharmaceutical segment and maintaining a relentless focus on maximizing shareholder value. I will update you on these priorities in a few moments. Before I turn it over to Trish to review our results from the quarter and revised outlook, I'd like to thank her for stepping in as interim CFO over the past six months. Trish has brought leadership and continuity to the organization and will be instrumental in ensuring a seamless transition with Aaron. Thanks Trish.\nTrish English: Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin today with our consolidated second quarter results. Total company revenue increased 13% and gross margin increased 3%, both driven by the Pharma segment. Consolidated SG&A increased 4%, primarily reflecting inflationary supply chain costs. Benefits from our enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives offset some of this increase. Operating earnings of $467 million were in line with the second quarter of last year, this reflects growth in Pharma segment profit offset by the decline in Medical segment profit, which was anticipated. Moving below the line, interest and others decreased nearly 30% to $18 million driven primarily by increased interest income from cash and equivalents. As a reminder, our debt is largely fixed rate, resulting in a net benefit from rising interest rates. Our second quarter effective tax rate finished at 23%, approximately 3.5 percentage points higher than prior year, primarily due to net positive discrete items in the prior year period. Diluted weighted average shares were $263 million, 6% lower than a year ago due to share repurchases. In the second quarter, we completed our $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program and initiated a new $250 million program, resulting in a total of $1.25 billion deployed year-to-date. We continue to expect $1.5 billion to $2 billion in share repurchases in fiscal 2023, which reflects our continued focus on maximizing shareholder value. The net result for the quarter was earnings per share growth of 4% to $1.32. Now turning to the balance sheet. We generated second quarter adjusted free cash flow of $439 million, bringing year-to-date adjusted free cash flow to $781 million. We ended the period with a cash position of $3.7 billion with no outstanding borrowings on our credit facility. As a reminder, we continue to expect to pay down the $550 million of March 2023 notes at maturity with cash on hand. Now I will cover our segment performance, beginning with Pharma on Slide 5. Second quarter revenue increased 15% to $48 billion, driven by brand and Specialty Pharmaceutical sales growth from existing and net new customers. Pharma segment profit increased 9% to $464 million. This was driven by a higher contribution from Branded Specialty Products and Generics program performance, partially offset by inflationary supply chain costs. During the quarter, we saw strong overall pharmaceutical demand, including from our largest customers, reflecting their strength in the market. To a lesser extent, we also saw year-over-year contributions from the net new customers that we've previously mentioned and a more robust seasonality with cough, cold and flu products as others have noted. Regarding our Generics program, we are pleased with the solid execution and consistent market dynamics we continue to see. This includes strong performance from Red Oak Sourcing, not only controlling costs, but also in maximizing service delivery for our customers. Within our supply chain, we continue to effectively manage through the industry-wide inflationary costs being in the areas of transportation and labor. In the second quarter, these inflationary impacts were generally consistent with our expectations. Similar to last quarter, this headwind was offset by year-over-year tailwinds from our complete ERP technology enhancements and lower opioid-related legal costs. Okay. Turning to Medical on Slide 6. Second quarter revenue decreased 7% to $3.8 billion, driven by lower products and distribution sales, including PPE pricing and volumes. Continued strong growth in our At-Home Solutions business partially offset this decline. Medical segment profit finished in line with our prior commentary, decreasing 66% to $17 million. This was primarily due to lower products and distribution volumes and net inflationary impact, partially offset by an improvement in PPE margin. During the quarter, the net impact from inflation was in line with our expectations, and we achieved inflation mitigation of over 30%. This sequential improvement from the first quarter was driven by the continued acceleration of our mitigation efforts, including the implementation of additional product pricing actions in the quarter. On our last two earnings calls, we have discussed overall volume softness in our Products and Distribution business. In the second quarter, we saw generally consistent overall volumes on a sequential basis, including our Cardinal Health brand products. With respect to PPE, we did see some slight improvement in volumes on a sequential basis. Additionally, we made significant progress in selling through our higher cost inventory on our balance sheet leading to normalized PPE margins in the quarter. Now for our updated fiscal 2023 outlook beginning on Slide 8. We are raising our EPS guidance by $0.15 at the lower end and $0.10 at the higher end to a new range of $5.20 to $5.50, which represents 6% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. This update reflects improved outlooks for the Pharmaceutical segment and for interest in other. We now expect interest in other in the range of $115 million to $130 million with the improvement primarily driven by the increased interest income on cash and equivalents. Our expectations for the remaining items listed on Slide 8 remain unchanged. Turning to Slide 9 in the Pharmaceutical segment. We are raising our outlook for revenue to a new range of 13% to 15% growth and for segment profit to a new range of 4% to 6.5% growth, both of which primarily reflect our strong first half performance. As we look to the second half in pharma, we anticipate the year-over-year profit growth to be fairly balanced between the third and fourth quarters. Turning to medical. We continue to expect a revenue decline of 3% to 6% and segment profit ranging from flat to a decline of 20%. With respect to inflation and our mitigation actions, we continue to expect a net impact of approximately $300 million in fiscal 2023 or a minimal year-over-year impact. On the cost side, while still at elevated levels, we\u2019ve seen a general stabilization across most areas along with improvement in international freight. As a reminder, these product costs are capitalized into inventory and in the current environment of elongated supply chain reflected in our P&L results on an approximate two quarter delay. Importantly, we continue to expect to exit the year with a run rate of at least 50% inflation mitigation. And finally, no changes to the expected cadence of Medical segment profit. We continue to expect segment profit to improve sequentially and be particularly weighted toward the fourth quarter. This sequencing primarily reflects our assumptions around the net impact of inflation, and to a lesser extent, a gradual improvement in overall volumes and the continued implementation of our cost savings measures. For the enterprise, a key factor continues to be the overall utilization and demand environment. In pharma, we expect continued strength in overall pharmaceutical demand in the second half, albeit, at a more moderate rate than we\u2019ve seen to date. In medical, we expect a gradual improvement in overall volume, including with Cardinal Health Brand. Therefore, if the trends from the first half of the year continue, we would anticipate segment profit more towards the upper end of our range in the Pharma segment and more towards the lower end of our range in the Medical segment. With that, I\u2019ll now turn it over to Jason.\nJason Hollar: Thanks, Trish. Let me now provide a few updates on our three key strategic priorities for fiscal 2023. First, executing our medical improvement plan initiatives. Importantly, we remain on track with our mitigation actions for inflation and global supply chain constraints, the number one key to returning the business to a more normalized level of profitability. I am pleased with the incremental progress achieved in the second quarter as we mitigated over 30% of the growth impact to our business in Q2. Taking a step back, over the past nine months, we have made a series of widespread temporary price increases across nearly all of our Cardinal Health brand product categories. We\u2019ve also executed supplier distribution fee increases to offset higher transportation, labor and fuel costs, and continue to explore other opportunities for further offsets with urgency. We\u2019ll continue to monitor cost trends and work with our industry partners to make pricing adjustments that are reflective of current market conditions. As we have taken a transparent approach working collaboratively with our partners, we continue to make progress on this front by successfully adjusting product contracts as they renew. We are also including language that allows for greater flexibility to respond to future macroeconomic dynamics. We continue to expect to exit the year with a run rate of at least 50% inflation mitigation and to fully mitigate inflation by the end of fiscal 2024. Outside our mitigation actions, we are focused on optimizing and growing our Cardinal Health brand portfolio. As Trish indicated, the market demand environment in medical has been relatively stagnant over the last couple quarters. Additionally, some of our higher margin Cardinal Health brand categories remain underpenetrated, which we are addressing through target investments to increase product availability, new product innovation and a continual focus on commercial excellence. For example, we recently expanded our sustainable technologies manufacturing facility in Riverview, Florida, doubling the size to roughly 100,000 square feet. This facility will enable us to better meet increasing demand for single use device collections, reprocessing and recycling services, supporting future growth, while also delivering supply resiliency, sustainable solutions and cost savings for customers. We\u2019re also investing to accelerate our growth businesses primarily at-home solutions where we\u2019ve seen strong growth fueled by the secular trend of care shifting into the home. Our new Central Ohio distribution center equipped with robotics and automation technology will be fully operational soon as we continue to expand our footprint to match the sustained growth of home healthcare we are seeing in the industry and our business. And in our higher margin Medical Services business, OptiFreight Logistics recently expanded its offerings with total view tracking, a new capability offering healthcare providers real-time shipment tracking to enhance supply chain visibility and resiliency. Second, moving to the Pharma segment where we\u2019re building upon the growth and the resiliency of the business. We\u2019re focused on executing in the core and accelerating our growth areas, primarily specialty. In the first couple months, we\u2019ve already seen efficiency and effectiveness gains from our recently combined pharmaceutical and specialty distribution organization. We\u2019ve seen strong growth across specialty distribution, including within acute health systems and alternate care. Additionally, our recent acquisition of the Bendcare GPO and investment in their managed services organization has been positively received by customers. Part of the recent segment organizational changes, we also created a new sourcing and manufacturer services organization, enabling a more holistic approach to enhance our strong pharmaceutical manufacturer partnerships. This includes strategic sourcing along with the high demand area of manufacturer services. In Q2, we saw double digit growth from manufacturer services where we continued to invest to build upon our capabilities such as our leading specialty 3PL and Sonexus, our access and patient support portal. And in the area of cell and gene therapy, we are excited about the work we are doing in this emerging space across all of our service offerings, expanding our capabilities and the opportunities we see in the future. We are investing in automation and enhancing technology across our supply chain today in order to drive operational productivity for the future. We\u2019re striving to deliver a flawless end-to-end customer experience supporting our strong and diverse customer base. For example, a recently announced collaboration with Palantir will offer customers a solution that connects diagnostic and clinical data with real-time purchasing and consumption data. By leveraging AI and machine learning, our customers will be empowered to make better purchasing and inventory management decisions for their businesses and patients. We are privileged to serve and partner with leaders across the various classes of trade, such as retail pharmacy chains, mail order and grocery, as well as retail independence, long-term care and health systems, all of whom provide essential healthcare access for their respective communities. And lastly, a brief update regarding our relentless focus on shareholder value creation. In addition to the shareholder value creation initiatives we\u2019ve already announced such as our governance enhancements and simplification actions, we continue to place a strong emphasis on responsible capital deployment, including the return of capital to shareholders through share repurchases. Our Business Review Committee continues to work through the comprehensive review of our company\u2019s strategy, portfolio, capital allocation framework and operations. We plan to hold an Investor Day in June 8th in New York City, where among other topics we\u2019ll provide an update on our company\u2019s long-term financial outlook, detail our growth strategies, and share any relevant conclusions from the ongoing review. Before I wrap up, I want to touch on our new ESG report, which was released just last week. This expanded report outlines the steps we\u2019re taking to operate in a more sustainable and equitable world through our established ESG and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. We continue to make progress against our long-term targets and are committed to regularly updating our stakeholders. We believe that we can simultaneously drive ESG improvements in support of our ongoing business transformation. In closing, while there remains work to do, I\u2019m encouraged by our team\u2019s progress to date and excited about the opportunities ahead. I want to thank our dedicated Cardinal Health employees for driving the execution of these critical priorities and who keep our customers and their patients at the center of everything they do. With that, we will take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Lisa Gill calling from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nLisa Gill: Thanks very much and thanks for all the details, Jason. Just on the medical side, one of the things that stuck out to me is you talked about the improvement and you talked about needing improvement in volumes. So as we think about that, can you maybe talk about your expectations around surgical procedures as we move into calendar 2023, the back half of the year? And secondly, has part of the issue on the hospital side been staffing issues? And as they start to resolve that, will things get better for Cardinal as well?\nJason Hollar: Yes. Hi, Lisa. I think you\u2019re connecting all the right points there. That\u2019s what we hear from our customers and broadly from our peers in the industry, is that there continues to be some constraints as to getting to the free level of demand there. And we do think that\u2019s a component of what\u2019s impacting the lack of growth that we\u2019re seeing within medical. It\u2019s impossible to tell definitively, but that\u2019s the anecdotal feedback that we are hearing. To help provide a little bit of color around the impact and that\u2019s why we \u2013 Trish had made some comments within her commentary there highlighting that we do anticipate a gradual improvement over the course, so not significant, but getting back to closer to more normalized level of growth. As a reminder, when we provided our medical improvement plan, we highlighted a 3% CAGR total volume growth over the three year period and we anticipated that about half that would be market growth, about half that would be our own innovation and capacity expansion plans for our products. So you\u2019re talking about a couple percent type of growth that would be more normalized and that\u2019s kind of differentiator between our more of a midpoint of our guidance to what would be more in the lower end, and that\u2019s why Trish provided that type of clarity.\nLisa Gill: So is the right way to think about that kind of half of it, Jason, you feel like you have some level of control because it\u2019s new products that you\u2019re bringing to the market, and the other half is you\u2019re going to have to wait to see if those volumes come back? Or do you feel like you really truly have visibility around the whole 3% that you\u2019re talking about?\nJason Hollar: Yes. No, I think you have it generally right. Now remember that a lot of the part that we have control over is new product innovation and fast expansion. So that\u2019s always an element of the three year plan I would expect to be weighted a little bit more towards the later end because it takes time to school up those investments and getting those products into the market. So we didn\u2019t ever indicate it was a linear type of plan. And volumes, we have to be careful too that we\u2019ve had a period here last two to three years that\u2019s been incredibly choppy in terms of the volumes. Obviously down during the beginning of the pandemic and has come back for the most part. The last couple of quarters have been very predictable, very consistent types of volumes, but that\u2019s \u2013 even that\u2019s a bit of an anomaly from what we\u2019ve had over the last few years. So presuming that that maintains then that\u2019s the range that we should be thinking about. But if we get back to an increased level of volatility, which at this time we don\u2019t foresee but that\u2019s certainly a possibility as well.\nLisa Gill: Okay, great. Thank you.\nJason Hollar: Yes. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson calling from Evercore. Please go ahead.\nElizabeth Anderson: Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question. I was wondering if you could talk about a little bit more about the pharma improvement in the back half of the year, specifically like as you\u2019ve had time to sort of think through the pharma reorganization and sort of continued cost cutting benefit is that\u2019s what\u2019s improving the operating profit growth. Are you starting to get pricing in certain places where you hadn\u2019t before? You can help us kind of understand that mix. And then secondly on the interest expense guide, it looks like the back half guide has a big sort of step up versus what you did in the first quarter \u2013 the first two quarters of the year in terms of interest expense. So is that just sort of changes in cash balance in terms of the net interest contribution or is there \u2013 are there other factors going on there? Thank you.\nJason Hollar: Yes. I\u2019ll start with your second question there because you nailed it. It\u2019s really about cash balances. We don\u2019t anticipate there being significant differences in the interest size. Let me just kind of step back. We have a very fixed interest expense for our debts. So our interest expense side is quite predictable and known. It\u2019s really the interest income is the part that we\u2019ve seen favorability in year-to-date and our cash balances were higher than anticipated over the first half of the year. We do have the $550 million note coming due here in March that we anticipate to pay down and there\u2019s just a seasonal aspect of our cash flow as well. So we would not anticipate the same lower levels or I\u2019ll say improved interest income that reduces our interest expense in the second half, like what we saw in the first half. So you should take away that we continue to have a very advantaged balance sheet, especially as it relates to the fixed variables mix of our debt. As it relates to pharma, it\u2019s really more about volume than anything else. We\u2019re not seeing a lot of other key variables underlying the dynamics within the generic business continues to be very consistent. We continue to see very broad-based volume strength. Q2 was certainly very strong quarter as it relates to volume and we saw that broad base, I referenced in my comments between Trish and I, brand, specialty as well as generics. It is a lot of volume drivers within that. And as we think about the growth in the second half of the year, it\u2019s very consistent with what we had indicated at the beginning of the year. So our second half expectations remain consistent with what we had indicated before. A little bit less growth than what we\u2019ve seen in the first half. And that\u2019s just a reflection of, again, Trish\u2019s comments that we anticipated being closer to more normalized level of growth in the second half. But if we maintain the same level of strength that we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of quarters then there\u2019s some opportunity behind of that. And then just other \u2013 one other comment there about the Q2, why it was so strong. If you\u2019re thinking about it from a year-over-year perspective, we also just have the added points that we did introduce a new customer in the third quarter of last year. And that has been a nice tailwind for us the last four quarters. But this will be the last quarter until we start to lap that. So that\u2019s part of the driver from a year-over-year perspective. And then, not significant, but there is an element of cough, cold and flu. That\u2019s a nice little tailwind for the quarter. But at this point we don\u2019t anticipate that being a driver for the full year. In fact, this could be a little bit of a headwind as it relates to Q3 specifically because it looks like the season is ending earlier than normal. So those are all the key moving pieces.\nElizabeth Anderson: Got it. Thank you so much.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny calling from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cherny: Good morning and thanks for taking the question. So just to parse through your numbers a little bit, I just wanted to get a sense. You\u2019ve had strong outperformance here to date based on typical timing, annualization and what you\u2019re calling for relative to growth rates. It seems like there\u2019s more opportunity for upside on your EPS. I know you talked about medical base list that you see now coming at the low end of the range. But can you give us some of the other potential concerns or headwinds that are built into this number? Just mathematically, you could argue that your EPS baseline should be higher and annualizing it, you\u2019d get there too. So I want to make sure I understand all of the \u2013 I guess, takes against the positive puts that you updated in your guidance.\nJason Hollar: Yes. Thanks, Michael. First of all, overall I think it\u2019s a balanced outlook that we have. I think a couple of the key drivers in the first half, second half I just went through on Elizabeth\u2019s question. Interest expense is going to be higher. We expect to be higher in the second half. So that\u2019s one of the components you\u2019re thinking about from an EPS driver. And then pharma is a key driver as well, still solid growth in the middle of that range that we had at the beginning of the year. Not at the same pace of growth that we had in the first half, but still growth. And also just to kind of step back a little bit, and we had a similar level of growth, about 5% growth in the prior fiscal year. So now we\u2019re on 18 to 24 months, a pretty consistent, stable, much more predictable type of growth that we\u2019ve seen in that business as we\u2019ve step farther and farther away from the pandemic. And we think overall that\u2019s balanced. Of course, in the second half of the year there\u2019s a meaningful step up in the Medical segment performance, and that\u2019s of course being driven more than anything by the pricing on inflation and the first instance we would expect of cost stepping down as it relates to the international freight. But all the other drivers I think are fairly consistent with what we outlined. Question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Erin Wright calling from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nErin Wright: Thanks. So you haven\u2019t really participated much in COVID treatment or vaccines, obviously with the contracts that are out there. But as those open up to the private market, could that provide an opportunity for you as we\u2019re looking into next year? And maybe thinking about some of those other anomalies kind of into next year, what are some things that you\u2019re thinking about in terms of opportunity across that core Pharma segment as well in terms of drivers? Or is it a continuation of the same in terms of specialty drivers in other ways? Thanks.\nJason Hollar: Sure. Thanks, Erin. Overall, first of all, as I think about fiscal 2023, it\u2019s a fairly normalized level performance that we have in our current outlook. Again, growth for the reasons I highlighted is a little bit stronger in the first half than what is in our longer-term targets. And we\u2019ve seen that very broad strength that I would not expect to continue long-term at that pace, especially when we consider that incremental new customer. The longer-term, I think what this year reinforces is that we\u2019re on track for those long-term growth targets. Specifically to your question around COVID therapies and vaccines, you have it \u2013 your inclination is correct. We\u2019ve participated very little on any of that. Over the pandemic, frankly, we\u2019ve had more of a headwind than a tailwind because the volume impacts on our underlying utilization. Of course, we\u2019re all the way through that at this point in time and have been so for about a year. So we\u2019re at a very normalized level at this stage. As it relates to commercialization, I think all data points point to that beginning in the summertime, of course, after our fiscal year, so certainly no impacts for 2023. There would be some opportunities for 2024 and beyond. However, I\u2019d highlight the types of products and vaccines we\u2019re talking about historically outside of the pandemic have not been significant drivers of profitability. So it\u2019s something that should be a tailwind, but I would not jump to the conclusion that it will be as significant as what we\u2019ve seen in the marketplace for others, given how the government had isolated that and procured for that. So something we\u2019ll keep an eye on and clearly something we\u2019ll be providing some context for further as we understand it better and as we get closer to the \u2013 that point in time. And the one final point on that is even though the commercialization is scheduled for the summer, there\u2019s certainly a lot of dialogue and uncertainty as to exactly how much a stockpile within the government and how long will it take for that to work through. So while it may go commercial, it could take us some time to actually see a pull in terms of non-governmental sources. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of George Hill calling from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Hill: Yes. Good morning, guys. And I appreciate you taking the question. And I guess, Jason, my question\u2019s probably a derivative of Mike\u2019s question, which is kind of given the guidance for the year and the expectation to the back half, it would seem that the Street is probably too high. So I guess maybe could you talk about the big moving pieces just as it relates to the back half of the year? And should we think about the current guidance as probably a little bit on the conservative side? Or are there real areas of weakness, particularly in medical that we should be worried about in the back half of the year as it relates to where the company claims to deliver results, kind of versus where the Street is?\nJason Hollar: Sure. I\u2019ll try George, but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s going to sound very similar to what I said to Michael. Again, I feel good about the balance that we have here. I feel very good about the progress to date. We have growth \u2013 implied growth in the middle of the range for farming the second half of the year. So if volumes continue at a more recent pace, then we\u2019d have some opportunity. On medical, a lot has to occur still for us to execute upon our plan. It\u2019s very consistent with the plan. We have good step up expected to continue sequential improvements. This guidance provides us sequential improvement for each and every quarter throughout the year. We would anticipate the next quarter \u2013 next two quarters to have sequential improvements as it relates to the ongoing pricing for inflation, the ongoing cost reductions, a gradual improvement in volumes. But importantly the big step up will be in the fourth quarter as we see international freight, which is a very high confidence element now, given that we\u2019re now less than six months by the end of the year. These lower costs are almost certainly going to flow \u2013 start to flow through our P&L here in the fourth quarter, still at levels well below the pricing we\u2019re getting. But nonetheless, that\u2019s a pretty well-known part of that equation. So a lot of action still in front of us, but the plan remains entirely intact. And so when you talk about the first half \u2013 second half, you\u2019re implying there\u2019s some difference somewhere. And I think the primary difference is related to the growth within Pharma, still growing. And maybe one other point that remember, Q4 of last year for Pharma was a very strong quarter \u2013 we had very strong growth. It was a good quarter, and that's one that we still anticipate there being growth on top of that this year as well and that low to mid single-digit range. So we feel good about where we're at. There's opportunity in Pharma. There's some things we got to watch out on Medical, and we continue to execute all the below line items very consistent to our expectations. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Andrea Alfonso calling from UBS. Please go ahead.\nAndrea Alfonso: Thank you so much, Trish and Jason. Appreciate you taking the question. So just on the Med/Surg side, again, you've discussed the different tranches of price increases on the Med/Surg side that you're going to be taking with customers. I guess we just sort of love to get a qualitative update on GPO and customer receptivity in general. And should we expect, as we think about the cadence for the second half that, that would \u2013 those were more fully manifest in the numbers in 4Q? And again, sort of just as a corollary to that, you've highlighted some investments around private label. With the current constraints in the purchasing environment for hospitals, have you observed changes in just the general appetite here for private label? Thanks so much for the question.\nJason Hollar: Terrific. Happy to do so. So on pricing, I would think about pricing as being a fairly stairstep process beginning back with our first temporary price increase in March 2022 so what we have \u2013 and when we first shared was the 20% mitigation of inflation soon after in the fourth quarter of last year, then that went to 25% in the first quarter of this year. And then now we're saying it's over 30%. So you can see that, that's a fairly consistent stairstep. And that's how I think about the pricing side, less on the temporary price increases going forward and more on the rotation to more renewals as they come up, and that's just a national function of where we're at in this process as we get farther away from the initiation of those temporary price adjustments. So a continuation of more of the same. How you get to a widening of that 30% to 50% by the end of the fiscal year is the costs starting to come down. So \u2013 and again, that's largely focused on the international freight. So pricing, I would expect to just continue blocking and tackling all the way through to the end of fiscal 2024 is where most of the prices will adjust. And that's why we indicate that we won't get to full mitigation until about that point in time. As it relates to private label, I think it's an interesting related question to pricing. Because yes, we want to work with our customers. All of our customers are dealing with challenges beyond the inflation in this category. They have actually much bigger challenges in other categories. And the desire on our part is to work with them if there's a possible win-win to find value in other ways, whether that is into more private label. It's \u2013 of course, we're doing everything we can to offset the increase \u2013 of the increases to start with to mitigate the inflation through other nonpricing means. And of course, part of this is also working with the supply base. And we indicated that we're working on the distribution fees as well so that the supply base does their part. We do our part and our customers are going to have to absorb this as well. So if the whole industry has to address this, and that's the collaborative approach that we're taking with it.\nKevin Moran: Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee calling from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nCharles Rhyee: Yes, thanks for taking the question, guys. Just two real quick ones maybe on the model. First, Trish, I think you talked about Pharma distribution. We should think about the \u2013 it sounds like you're kind of saying the contribution should be kind of even through the back half of the fiscal year here. It's a little different than I think when you look back at normal seasonality, anything specific that you'd call out to why that might be this year?\nJason Hollar: Yes, let me take that. So that comment was the growth rates were going to be even year-over-year. So you're exactly right, Charles, that there will continue to be the expectation of a normal seasonality. That largely comes from the brand inflation, albeit much lower than what it has been historically. We're still talking less than 5% contribution, but that is all in the third quarter. So sequentially, we would still expect the third quarter to have that element associated with it. Trish's comments were specifically related to the year-over-year growth rates being relatively equal between the two quarters.\nCharles Rhyee: I see. Okay. I might have misheard. And then maybe if I can just follow up on \u2013 you keep talking about the at home \u2013 I'm sorry, you keep talking about at-home solutions and how that's a good growth driver. In the past, you've kind of given a little bit of a breakout of the size of the business. Is there any kind of additional color you can give us here in terms of sizing of this business? How much it's grown relative to the rest of the segment?\nJason Hollar: Sure. Yes. You can also go to our segments. But note, this is one of the two businesses we, every quarter, provide incremental revenue information on. And that business, I think, last year was $2.4 billion of revenue. And I believe, for both the first and second quarter, we grew it by around 9%. But again, you can look at the segment footnote to get the precise numbers each and every quarter.\nCharles Rhyee: All right, thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette calling from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSteven Valiquette: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So on Page 5 in the slide deck, you talked about \u201cjust generics program\u201d as one of the positive key variables. So I just wanted to get a little bit of color just to confirm kind of what you're referring to as the biggest component within that. When thinking about \u2013 are you just referring to just better generic volume and generate compliance rates with customers? Or is it just better buying through Red Oak. And also it's been really a much stronger new first-time generic launch calendar as well. But just curious, what's the biggest piece within your comment about just the generics program, thanks.\nJason Hollar: Sure. Yes, overall, the biggest component for this particular quarter and most quarters that we've seen more recently has been volume. I continue to use the statement consistent market dynamics that's referencing essentially the margin per unit. Yes, there's ongoing deflation, but the buy-side sell side continues to be relatively in balance. And so when we see a year-over-year driver, it's driven often by volume and/or mix. And we continue to see very broad strength across all the products, whether it be generics, brands, specialty \u2013 and so this particular quarter, we saw that as well. Again, not the biggest driver. But when I talk about cough, cold and flu, a lot of those products have gone generic. They're more mature products, so they do tend to carry with it a little bit lower margin price points, things of that nature. But that would be a component as well. But again, I'm only highlighting that, given how many questions we get on the topic, not that as a significant driver. But overall, the short answer is volume and mix.\nSteven Valiquette: Got it. Okay, thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Eric Percher calling from Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nEric Percher: Thank you. Question on nuclear theranostics, can you remind us where your investments are targeted in 2023 and where and when do we see ROI on those investments? And then given the development around Alzheimer's treatments, what are you looking for relative to approval or policy change on testing that could lead to more significant step up in demand in that business?\nJason Hollar: Sure. So the theranostics business launched sometime last six, nine months, and we are starting to see now more of that contribution over the last couple of quarters. So it's in the ramp up phase. So we are seeing positive returns already on those investments. This is a business, a business case. And the thing about the nuclear business that is both wonderful and also at times a little bit frustrating is that the business is a long-term business. It means that we have good visibility long-term, but also it means that we have to wait until we can get that benefit. Theranostics has been something we've been working on since, well before I arrived here in the organization three years ago, and it's one that we're now seeing the fruits of all those investments and efforts from that team. As it relates to the second part of your question, Eric, I get lots of questions around trying to link our business, our nuclear business to specific approval, specific other drugs and therapies and how we can attach that. I would say that the beauty of this business and the success of this business is that it's not directly linked to a very specific particular outcome. We have broad expertise capabilities, we are not dependent on any one particular area, and is that diversification and of which we're seeing with the theranostics expansion being even more accentuated because we get to work with so many more manufacturers and partners that it just creates a broad opportunity for us to grow across the spectrum. So our business case for continued growth, our goal of achieving \u2013 doubling as a profit in this business from fiscal 2021 to 2026 is predicated on a lot of singles and doubles, not triples and home runs by, by attaching to a blockbuster type of drug.  So beyond that, we don't talk about individual drugs, individual manufacturers or products. And so like I said, I just don't think that's the real draw for this business is the breadth that we have and the broad capabilities.\nEric Percher: Thank you. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut calling from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nTaji Phillips: Thank you. It\u2019s Taji on for Brian. So you mentioned expecting stabilization of supply chain headwinds, particularly in freight transportation. Can you just discuss any sense you might have around the cadence of that proven moving forward?\nJason Hollar: I wish I had more clarity. I would say that it's a lot more stable than it has been over the last few years, and we have to break apart freight into the components. So within international freight that I believe was an anomaly that is unlikely to occur anytime soon, if ever again we need to be prepared for it. We have diversified our supply chain further as a result of the living through that. But where those costs are, they're still elevated in certain areas, right. The main China to North America channels are much, much lower, but there is now a lot of sourcing through other parts of Asia that are higher than historical levels, but nowhere near the peaks. So we're clearly seeing at least an 80% reduction of what those were at the peak. And certainly much closer to pre-pandemic levels. So as it relates to international freight, it's not my big worry at this point, and it's one that we have to continue to keep an eye on and manage. The more elevated remains the domestic transportation it's still \u2013 it's also down from its peak, especially as it relates to anything related to diesel fuel. So that's also off its peak, and we're seeing certain pockets of improvement, but it's still very elevated compared to pre-pandemic. And there, I have less confidence that it's going to materially reduce from here. There's a lot of inputs that go into transportation other than just diesel fuel. You have the equipment and the drivers all which are higher costs and they're not expected to come down any time soon. So I expect domestic transportation to be higher, longer, perhaps forever. And it's why we need to have permanent pricing is because that component. But on the international freight side, that is why we are not pushing for faster price increases right now is because we believe that will be coming down on our P&L this next quarter. And as we get through fiscal 2024, those two lines, the price line and the cost line will finally intersect and we can see that that will be fully mitigated. Question, please.\nOperator: Final question comes from the line of A.J. Rice calling from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: Yes, thanks a lot. I know growing specialty has been a priority for the company and this management team to set out. And you've mentioned that again today that you're having progress there. I guess, can you just maybe tell us where you're seeing success in the specialty area and is the plan progressing about as expected as it was talked about over the last year or so? Or is that an area not performance for you, or how would you describe that?\nJason Hollar: Sure. Yes, it's absolutely meeting our expectations. It was a call out in terms of the broad volume that we had this last quarter. So we had strength across a number of many different categories and customers. We also called out double-digit growth within our sourcing and manufacturer services group which is a key component of the upstream elements of specialty. So the business is strong, it's large, it's growing nicely. We have \u2013 I think like the rest of the industry, biosimilars is a nice tail one that we're seeing, not large enough to call out as an individual driver. Our 3PL business, especially with the regulatory approvals being a little bit more normalized is well positioned. And we're continuing to invest in areas that will be growth opportunities in the future, whether that\u2019d be cell and gene or just where value-based care is going. We have our Navista TS platform, so we're investing organically. And of course, within our inorganic, we've had a nice success with our Bendcare GPO and the investment in the MSO that I think has given us some additional opportunities to think about in the future as well. So not any 1 item to highlight, but there is strong breadth across many different pillars of the specialty business that we feel good is a very strong foundation and platform for future growth. I believe that was our last question. Yes. Thank you. And I'll...\nOperator: Yes, there are no further questions. So I will hand you back to host to conclude today's conference.\nJason Hollar: Yes. Thanks. I appreciate that. Just to summarize real quick. I'm pleased with the continued stability in Pharma, as we just discussed here today. As well as the progress that we're making in the medical business. We are committed to executing on our key priorities, including maintaining a relentless focus on shareholder value creation. So with that, thank you and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect. Hosts, please stay connected on the line.",

            "name": "Trish English",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin today with our consolidated second quarter results. Total company revenue increased 13% and gross margin increased 3%, both driven by the Pharma segment. Consolidated SG&A increased 4%, primarily reflecting inflationary supply chain costs. Benefits from our enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives offset some of this increase. Operating earnings of $467 million were in line with the second quarter of last year, this reflects growth in Pharma segment profit offset by the decline in Medical segment profit, which was anticipated. Moving below the line, interest and others decreased nearly 30% to $18 million driven primarily by increased interest income from cash and equivalents. As a reminder, our debt is largely fixed rate, resulting in a net benefit from rising interest rates. Our second quarter effective tax rate finished at 23%, approximately 3.5 percentage points higher than prior year, primarily due to net positive discrete items in the prior year period. Diluted weighted average shares were $263 million, 6% lower than a year ago due to share repurchases. In the second quarter, we completed our $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program and initiated a new $250 million program, resulting in a total of $1.25 billion deployed year-to-date. We continue to expect $1.5 billion to $2 billion in share repurchases in fiscal 2023, which reflects our continued focus on maximizing shareholder value. The net result for the quarter was earnings per share growth of 4% to $1.32. Now turning to the balance sheet. We generated second quarter adjusted free cash flow of $439 million, bringing year-to-date adjusted free cash flow to $781 million. We ended the period with a cash position of $3.7 billion with no outstanding borrowings on our credit facility. As a reminder, we continue to expect to pay down the $550 million of March 2023 notes at maturity with cash on hand. Now I will cover our segment performance, beginning with Pharma on Slide 5. Second quarter revenue increased 15% to $48 billion, driven by brand and Specialty Pharmaceutical sales growth from existing and net new customers. Pharma segment profit increased 9% to $464 million. This was driven by a higher contribution from Branded Specialty Products and Generics program performance, partially offset by inflationary supply chain costs. During the quarter, we saw strong overall pharmaceutical demand, including from our largest customers, reflecting their strength in the market. To a lesser extent, we also saw year-over-year contributions from the net new customers that we've previously mentioned and a more robust seasonality with cough, cold and flu products as others have noted. Regarding our Generics program, we are pleased with the solid execution and consistent market dynamics we continue to see. This includes strong performance from Red Oak Sourcing, not only controlling costs, but also in maximizing service delivery for our customers. Within our supply chain, we continue to effectively manage through the industry-wide inflationary costs being in the areas of transportation and labor. In the second quarter, these inflationary impacts were generally consistent with our expectations. Similar to last quarter, this headwind was offset by year-over-year tailwinds from our complete ERP technology enhancements and lower opioid-related legal costs. Okay. Turning to Medical on Slide 6. Second quarter revenue decreased 7% to $3.8 billion, driven by lower products and distribution sales, including PPE pricing and volumes. Continued strong growth in our At-Home Solutions business partially offset this decline. Medical segment profit finished in line with our prior commentary, decreasing 66% to $17 million. This was primarily due to lower products and distribution volumes and net inflationary impact, partially offset by an improvement in PPE margin. During the quarter, the net impact from inflation was in line with our expectations, and we achieved inflation mitigation of over 30%. This sequential improvement from the first quarter was driven by the continued acceleration of our mitigation efforts, including the implementation of additional product pricing actions in the quarter. On our last two earnings calls, we have discussed overall volume softness in our Products and Distribution business. In the second quarter, we saw generally consistent overall volumes on a sequential basis, including our Cardinal Health brand products. With respect to PPE, we did see some slight improvement in volumes on a sequential basis. Additionally, we made significant progress in selling through our higher cost inventory on our balance sheet leading to normalized PPE margins in the quarter. Now for our updated fiscal 2023 outlook beginning on Slide 8. We are raising our EPS guidance by $0.15 at the lower end and $0.10 at the higher end to a new range of $5.20 to $5.50, which represents 6% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. This update reflects improved outlooks for the Pharmaceutical segment and for interest in other. We now expect interest in other in the range of $115 million to $130 million with the improvement primarily driven by the increased interest income on cash and equivalents. Our expectations for the remaining items listed on Slide 8 remain unchanged. Turning to Slide 9 in the Pharmaceutical segment. We are raising our outlook for revenue to a new range of 13% to 15% growth and for segment profit to a new range of 4% to 6.5% growth, both of which primarily reflect our strong first half performance. As we look to the second half in pharma, we anticipate the year-over-year profit growth to be fairly balanced between the third and fourth quarters. Turning to medical. We continue to expect a revenue decline of 3% to 6% and segment profit ranging from flat to a decline of 20%. With respect to inflation and our mitigation actions, we continue to expect a net impact of approximately $300 million in fiscal 2023 or a minimal year-over-year impact. On the cost side, while still at elevated levels, we've seen a general stabilization across most areas along with improvement in international freight. As a reminder, these product costs are capitalized into inventory and in the current environment of elongated supply chain reflected in our P&L results on an approximate two quarter delay. Importantly, we continue to expect to exit the year with a run rate of at least 50% inflation mitigation. And finally, no changes to the expected cadence of Medical segment profit. We continue to expect segment profit to improve sequentially and be particularly weighted toward the fourth quarter. This sequencing primarily reflects our assumptions around the net impact of inflation, and to a lesser extent, a gradual improvement in overall volumes and the continued implementation of our cost savings measures. For the enterprise, a key factor continues to be the overall utilization and demand environment. In pharma, we expect continued strength in overall pharmaceutical demand in the second half, albeit, at a more moderate rate than we've seen to date. In medical, we expect a gradual improvement in overall volume, including with Cardinal Health Brand. Therefore, if the trends from the first half of the year continue, we would anticipate segment profit more towards the upper end of our range in the Pharma segment and more towards the lower end of our range in the Medical segment. With that, I'll now turn it over to Jason."

            "name": "Jason Hollar",
            "content": "Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Before we dive in, I'd like to take a moment to welcome Aaron Alt to Cardinal Health as our incoming Chief Financial Officer. We're excited to have Aaron on board. He brings a breadth of financial and operational experience to our organization, including a background in distribution and he's already hit the ground running in his first few weeks. I'm confident he will be a valuable addition as the leader of our finance organization, contributor to our executive committee and a seamless fit with our company culture. Thanks, Aaron. Now let's begin with some high-level perspectives on the second quarter. Overall, our Q2 results demonstrated continued momentum against our plans. In Pharma, we've seen ongoing stability in the macro trends and underlying fundamentals of the business. In the quarter, we saw particular strength in overall pharmaceutical demand and strong performance from our Generics program. We've seen an increase in contributions from Specialty products, which is a key strategic area of focus. And we continue to effectively manage through the inflationary headwinds affecting industry supply chains. In short, Q2 was another data point that Pharma is a resilient and growing business. In Medical, we remain highly focused on our medical improvement plan initiatives. Overall, despite some puts and takes, Medical's Q2 results were consistent with our prior commentary, and we were pleased to see a return to profitability in the quarter. We continue to take actions to drive more predictable financial performance, in line with this business' underlying potential. At an enterprise level, we continue to see benefits below the operating line from our capital deployment actions and favorable capital structure. With the first half of fiscal 2023 behind us, we are pleased to raise our full year EPS guidance and outlook for the Pharmaceutical segment. Our team remains focused on executing our three key strategic priorities of executing on the medical improvement plan, building on the growth and resiliency of the Pharmaceutical segment and maintaining a relentless focus on maximizing shareholder value. I will update you on these priorities in a few moments. Before I turn it over to Trish to review our results from the quarter and revised outlook, I'd like to thank her for stepping in as interim CFO over the past six months. Trish has brought leadership and continuity to the organization and will be instrumental in ensuring a seamless transition with Aaron. Thanks Trish. Thanks, Trish. Let me now provide a few updates on our three key strategic priorities for fiscal 2023. First, executing our medical improvement plan initiatives. Importantly, we remain on track with our mitigation actions for inflation and global supply chain constraints, the number one key to returning the business to a more normalized level of profitability. I am pleased with the incremental progress achieved in the second quarter as we mitigated over 30% of the growth impact to our business in Q2. Taking a step back, over the past nine months, we have made a series of widespread temporary price increases across nearly all of our Cardinal Health brand product categories. We've also executed supplier distribution fee increases to offset higher transportation, labor and fuel costs, and continue to explore other opportunities for further offsets with urgency. We'll continue to monitor cost trends and work with our industry partners to make pricing adjustments that are reflective of current market conditions. As we have taken a transparent approach working collaboratively with our partners, we continue to make progress on this front by successfully adjusting product contracts as they renew. We are also including language that allows for greater flexibility to respond to future macroeconomic dynamics. We continue to expect to exit the year with a run rate of at least 50% inflation mitigation and to fully mitigate inflation by the end of fiscal 2024. Outside our mitigation actions, we are focused on optimizing and growing our Cardinal Health brand portfolio. As Trish indicated, the market demand environment in medical has been relatively stagnant over the last couple quarters. Additionally, some of our higher margin Cardinal Health brand categories remain underpenetrated, which we are addressing through target investments to increase product availability, new product innovation and a continual focus on commercial excellence. For example, we recently expanded our sustainable technologies manufacturing facility in Riverview, Florida, doubling the size to roughly 100,000 square feet. This facility will enable us to better meet increasing demand for single use device collections, reprocessing and recycling services, supporting future growth, while also delivering supply resiliency, sustainable solutions and cost savings for customers. We're also investing to accelerate our growth businesses primarily at-home solutions where we've seen strong growth fueled by the secular trend of care shifting into the home. Our new Central Ohio distribution center equipped with robotics and automation technology will be fully operational soon as we continue to expand our footprint to match the sustained growth of home healthcare we are seeing in the industry and our business. And in our higher margin Medical Services business, OptiFreight Logistics recently expanded its offerings with total view tracking, a new capability offering healthcare providers real-time shipment tracking to enhance supply chain visibility and resiliency. Second, moving to the Pharma segment where we're building upon the growth and the resiliency of the business. We're focused on executing in the core and accelerating our growth areas, primarily specialty. In the first couple months, we've already seen efficiency and effectiveness gains from our recently combined pharmaceutical and specialty distribution organization. We've seen strong growth across specialty distribution, including within acute health systems and alternate care. Additionally, our recent acquisition of the Bendcare GPO and investment in their managed services organization has been positively received by customers. Part of the recent segment organizational changes, we also created a new sourcing and manufacturer services organization, enabling a more holistic approach to enhance our strong pharmaceutical manufacturer partnerships. This includes strategic sourcing along with the high demand area of manufacturer services. In Q2, we saw double digit growth from manufacturer services where we continued to invest to build upon our capabilities such as our leading specialty 3PL and Sonexus, our access and patient support portal. And in the area of cell and gene therapy, we are excited about the work we are doing in this emerging space across all of our service offerings, expanding our capabilities and the opportunities we see in the future. We are investing in automation and enhancing technology across our supply chain today in order to drive operational productivity for the future. We're striving to deliver a flawless end-to-end customer experience supporting our strong and diverse customer base. For example, a recently announced collaboration with Palantir will offer customers a solution that connects diagnostic and clinical data with real-time purchasing and consumption data. By leveraging AI and machine learning, our customers will be empowered to make better purchasing and inventory management decisions for their businesses and patients. We are privileged to serve and partner with leaders across the various classes of trade, such as retail pharmacy chains, mail order and grocery, as well as retail independence, long-term care and health systems, all of whom provide essential healthcare access for their respective communities. And lastly, a brief update regarding our relentless focus on shareholder value creation. In addition to the shareholder value creation initiatives we've already announced such as our governance enhancements and simplification actions, we continue to place a strong emphasis on responsible capital deployment, including the return of capital to shareholders through share repurchases. Our Business Review Committee continues to work through the comprehensive review of our company's strategy, portfolio, capital allocation framework and operations. We plan to hold an Investor Day in June 8th in New York City, where among other topics we'll provide an update on our company's long-term financial outlook, detail our growth strategies, and share any relevant conclusions from the ongoing review. Before I wrap up, I want to touch on our new ESG report, which was released just last week. This expanded report outlines the steps we're taking to operate in a more sustainable and equitable world through our established ESG and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. We continue to make progress against our long-term targets and are committed to regularly updating our stakeholders. We believe that we can simultaneously drive ESG improvements in support of our ongoing business transformation. In closing, while there remains work to do, I'm encouraged by our team's progress to date and excited about the opportunities ahead. I want to thank our dedicated Cardinal Health employees for driving the execution of these critical priorities and who keep our customers and their patients at the center of everything they do. With that, we will take your questions. Yes. Hi, Lisa. I think you're connecting all the right points there. That's what we hear from our customers and broadly from our peers in the industry, is that there continues to be some constraints as to getting to the free level of demand there. And we do think that's a component of what's impacting the lack of growth that we're seeing within medical. It's impossible to tell definitively, but that's the anecdotal feedback that we are hearing. To help provide a little bit of color around the impact and that's why we \u2013 Trish had made some comments within her commentary there highlighting that we do anticipate a gradual improvement over the course, so not significant, but getting back to closer to more normalized level of growth. As a reminder, when we provided our medical improvement plan, we highlighted a 3% CAGR total volume growth over the three year period and we anticipated that about half that would be market growth, about half that would be our own innovation and capacity expansion plans for our products. So you're talking about a couple percent type of growth that would be more normalized and that's kind of differentiator between our more of a midpoint of our guidance to what would be more in the lower end, and that's why Trish provided that type of clarity. Yes. No, I think you have it generally right. Now remember that a lot of the part that we have control over is new product innovation and fast expansion. So that's always an element of the three year plan I would expect to be weighted a little bit more towards the later end because it takes time to school up those investments and getting those products into the market. So we didn't ever indicate it was a linear type of plan. And volumes, we have to be careful too that we've had a period here last two to three years that's been incredibly choppy in terms of the volumes. Obviously down during the beginning of the pandemic and has come back for the most part. The last couple of quarters have been very predictable, very consistent types of volumes, but that's \u2013 even that's a bit of an anomaly from what we've had over the last few years. So presuming that that maintains then that's the range that we should be thinking about. But if we get back to an increased level of volatility, which at this time we don't foresee but that's certainly a possibility as well. Yes. Thanks. Yes. I'll start with your second question there because you nailed it. It's really about cash balances. We don't anticipate there being significant differences in the interest size. Let me just kind of step back. We have a very fixed interest expense for our debts. So our interest expense side is quite predictable and known. It's really the interest income is the part that we've seen favorability in year-to-date and our cash balances were higher than anticipated over the first half of the year. We do have the $550 million note coming due here in March that we anticipate to pay down and there's just a seasonal aspect of our cash flow as well. So we would not anticipate the same lower levels or I'll say improved interest income that reduces our interest expense in the second half, like what we saw in the first half. So you should take away that we continue to have a very advantaged balance sheet, especially as it relates to the fixed variables mix of our debt. As it relates to pharma, it's really more about volume than anything else. We're not seeing a lot of other key variables underlying the dynamics within the generic business continues to be very consistent. We continue to see very broad-based volume strength. Q2 was certainly very strong quarter as it relates to volume and we saw that broad base, I referenced in my comments between Trish and I, brand, specialty as well as generics. It is a lot of volume drivers within that. And as we think about the growth in the second half of the year, it's very consistent with what we had indicated at the beginning of the year. So our second half expectations remain consistent with what we had indicated before. A little bit less growth than what we've seen in the first half. And that's just a reflection of, again, Trish's comments that we anticipated being closer to more normalized level of growth in the second half. But if we maintain the same level of strength that we've seen in the last couple of quarters then there's some opportunity behind of that. And then just other \u2013 one other comment there about the Q2, why it was so strong. If you're thinking about it from a year-over-year perspective, we also just have the added points that we did introduce a new customer in the third quarter of last year. And that has been a nice tailwind for us the last four quarters. But this will be the last quarter until we start to lap that. So that's part of the driver from a year-over-year perspective. And then, not significant, but there is an element of cough, cold and flu. That's a nice little tailwind for the quarter. But at this point we don't anticipate that being a driver for the full year. In fact, this could be a little bit of a headwind as it relates to Q3 specifically because it looks like the season is ending earlier than normal. So those are all the key moving pieces. Yes. Thanks, Michael. First of all, overall I think it's a balanced outlook that we have. I think a couple of the key drivers in the first half, second half I just went through on Elizabeth's question. Interest expense is going to be higher. We expect to be higher in the second half. So that's one of the components you're thinking about from an EPS driver. And then pharma is a key driver as well, still solid growth in the middle of that range that we had at the beginning of the year. Not at the same pace of growth that we had in the first half, but still growth. And also just to kind of step back a little bit, and we had a similar level of growth, about 5% growth in the prior fiscal year. So now we're on 18 to 24 months, a pretty consistent, stable, much more predictable type of growth that we've seen in that business as we've step farther and farther away from the pandemic. And we think overall that's balanced. Of course, in the second half of the year there's a meaningful step up in the Medical segment performance, and that's of course being driven more than anything by the pricing on inflation and the first instance we would expect of cost stepping down as it relates to the international freight. But all the other drivers I think are fairly consistent with what we outlined. Question, please. Sure. Thanks, Erin. Overall, first of all, as I think about fiscal 2023, it's a fairly normalized level performance that we have in our current outlook. Again, growth for the reasons I highlighted is a little bit stronger in the first half than what is in our longer-term targets. And we've seen that very broad strength that I would not expect to continue long-term at that pace, especially when we consider that incremental new customer. The longer-term, I think what this year reinforces is that we're on track for those long-term growth targets. Specifically to your question around COVID therapies and vaccines, you have it \u2013 your inclination is correct. We've participated very little on any of that. Over the pandemic, frankly, we've had more of a headwind than a tailwind because the volume impacts on our underlying utilization. Of course, we're all the way through that at this point in time and have been so for about a year. So we're at a very normalized level at this stage. As it relates to commercialization, I think all data points point to that beginning in the summertime, of course, after our fiscal year, so certainly no impacts for 2023. There would be some opportunities for 2024 and beyond. However, I'd highlight the types of products and vaccines we're talking about historically outside of the pandemic have not been significant drivers of profitability. So it's something that should be a tailwind, but I would not jump to the conclusion that it will be as significant as what we've seen in the marketplace for others, given how the government had isolated that and procured for that. So something we'll keep an eye on and clearly something we'll be providing some context for further as we understand it better and as we get closer to the \u2013 that point in time. And the one final point on that is even though the commercialization is scheduled for the summer, there's certainly a lot of dialogue and uncertainty as to exactly how much a stockpile within the government and how long will it take for that to work through. So while it may go commercial, it could take us some time to actually see a pull in terms of non-governmental sources. Next question, please. Sure. I'll try George, but I'm afraid it's going to sound very similar to what I said to Michael. Again, I feel good about the balance that we have here. I feel very good about the progress to date. We have growth \u2013 implied growth in the middle of the range for farming the second half of the year. So if volumes continue at a more recent pace, then we'd have some opportunity. On medical, a lot has to occur still for us to execute upon our plan. It's very consistent with the plan. We have good step up expected to continue sequential improvements. This guidance provides us sequential improvement for each and every quarter throughout the year. We would anticipate the next quarter \u2013 next two quarters to have sequential improvements as it relates to the ongoing pricing for inflation, the ongoing cost reductions, a gradual improvement in volumes. But importantly the big step up will be in the fourth quarter as we see international freight, which is a very high confidence element now, given that we're now less than six months by the end of the year. These lower costs are almost certainly going to flow \u2013 start to flow through our P&L here in the fourth quarter, still at levels well below the pricing we're getting. But nonetheless, that's a pretty well-known part of that equation. So a lot of action still in front of us, but the plan remains entirely intact. And so when you talk about the first half \u2013 second half, you're implying there's some difference somewhere. And I think the primary difference is related to the growth within Pharma, still growing. And maybe one other point that remember, Q4 of last year for Pharma was a very strong quarter \u2013 we had very strong growth. It was a good quarter, and that's one that we still anticipate there being growth on top of that this year as well and that low to mid single-digit range. So we feel good about where we're at. There's opportunity in Pharma. There's some things we got to watch out on Medical, and we continue to execute all the below line items very consistent to our expectations. Next question, please. Terrific. Happy to do so. So on pricing, I would think about pricing as being a fairly stairstep process beginning back with our first temporary price increase in March 2022 so what we have \u2013 and when we first shared was the 20% mitigation of inflation soon after in the fourth quarter of last year, then that went to 25% in the first quarter of this year. And then now we're saying it's over 30%. So you can see that, that's a fairly consistent stairstep. And that's how I think about the pricing side, less on the temporary price increases going forward and more on the rotation to more renewals as they come up, and that's just a national function of where we're at in this process as we get farther away from the initiation of those temporary price adjustments. So a continuation of more of the same. How you get to a widening of that 30% to 50% by the end of the fiscal year is the costs starting to come down. So \u2013 and again, that's largely focused on the international freight. So pricing, I would expect to just continue blocking and tackling all the way through to the end of fiscal 2024 is where most of the prices will adjust. And that's why we indicate that we won't get to full mitigation until about that point in time. As it relates to private label, I think it's an interesting related question to pricing. Because yes, we want to work with our customers. All of our customers are dealing with challenges beyond the inflation in this category. They have actually much bigger challenges in other categories. And the desire on our part is to work with them if there's a possible win-win to find value in other ways, whether that is into more private label. It's \u2013 of course, we're doing everything we can to offset the increase \u2013 of the increases to start with to mitigate the inflation through other nonpricing means. And of course, part of this is also working with the supply base. And we indicated that we're working on the distribution fees as well so that the supply base does their part. We do our part and our customers are going to have to absorb this as well. So if the whole industry has to address this, and that's the collaborative approach that we're taking with it. Yes, let me take that. So that comment was the growth rates were going to be even year-over-year. So you're exactly right, Charles, that there will continue to be the expectation of a normal seasonality. That largely comes from the brand inflation, albeit much lower than what it has been historically. We're still talking less than 5% contribution, but that is all in the third quarter. So sequentially, we would still expect the third quarter to have that element associated with it. Trish's comments were specifically related to the year-over-year growth rates being relatively equal between the two quarters. Sure. Yes. You can also go to our segments. But note, this is one of the two businesses we, every quarter, provide incremental revenue information on. And that business, I think, last year was $2.4 billion of revenue. And I believe, for both the first and second quarter, we grew it by around 9%. But again, you can look at the segment footnote to get the precise numbers each and every quarter. Sure. Yes, overall, the biggest component for this particular quarter and most quarters that we've seen more recently has been volume. I continue to use the statement consistent market dynamics that's referencing essentially the margin per unit. Yes, there's ongoing deflation, but the buy-side sell side continues to be relatively in balance. And so when we see a year-over-year driver, it's driven often by volume and/or mix. And we continue to see very broad strength across all the products, whether it be generics, brands, specialty \u2013 and so this particular quarter, we saw that as well. Again, not the biggest driver. But when I talk about cough, cold and flu, a lot of those products have gone generic. They're more mature products, so they do tend to carry with it a little bit lower margin price points, things of that nature. But that would be a component as well. But again, I'm only highlighting that, given how many questions we get on the topic, not that as a significant driver. But overall, the short answer is volume and mix. Sure. So the theranostics business launched sometime last six, nine months, and we are starting to see now more of that contribution over the last couple of quarters. So it's in the ramp up phase. So we are seeing positive returns already on those investments. This is a business, a business case. And the thing about the nuclear business that is both wonderful and also at times a little bit frustrating is that the business is a long-term business. It means that we have good visibility long-term, but also it means that we have to wait until we can get that benefit. Theranostics has been something we've been working on since, well before I arrived here in the organization three years ago, and it's one that we're now seeing the fruits of all those investments and efforts from that team. As it relates to the second part of your question, Eric, I get lots of questions around trying to link our business, our nuclear business to specific approval, specific other drugs and therapies and how we can attach that. I would say that the beauty of this business and the success of this business is that it's not directly linked to a very specific particular outcome. We have broad expertise capabilities, we are not dependent on any one particular area, and is that diversification and of which we're seeing with the theranostics expansion being even more accentuated because we get to work with so many more manufacturers and partners that it just creates a broad opportunity for us to grow across the spectrum. So our business case for continued growth, our goal of achieving \u2013 doubling as a profit in this business from fiscal 2021 to 2026 is predicated on a lot of singles and doubles, not triples and home runs by, by attaching to a blockbuster type of drug.  So beyond that, we don't talk about individual drugs, individual manufacturers or products. And so like I said, I just don't think that's the real draw for this business is the breadth that we have and the broad capabilities. I wish I had more clarity. I would say that it's a lot more stable than it has been over the last few years, and we have to break apart freight into the components. So within international freight that I believe was an anomaly that is unlikely to occur anytime soon, if ever again we need to be prepared for it. We have diversified our supply chain further as a result of the living through that. But where those costs are, they're still elevated in certain areas, right. The main China to North America channels are much, much lower, but there is now a lot of sourcing through other parts of Asia that are higher than historical levels, but nowhere near the peaks. So we're clearly seeing at least an 80% reduction of what those were at the peak. And certainly much closer to pre-pandemic levels. So as it relates to international freight, it's not my big worry at this point, and it's one that we have to continue to keep an eye on and manage. The more elevated remains the domestic transportation it's still \u2013 it's also down from its peak, especially as it relates to anything related to diesel fuel. So that's also off its peak, and we're seeing certain pockets of improvement, but it's still very elevated compared to pre-pandemic. And there, I have less confidence that it's going to materially reduce from here. There's a lot of inputs that go into transportation other than just diesel fuel. You have the equipment and the drivers all which are higher costs and they're not expected to come down any time soon. So I expect domestic transportation to be higher, longer, perhaps forever. And it's why we need to have permanent pricing is because that component. But on the international freight side, that is why we are not pushing for faster price increases right now is because we believe that will be coming down on our P&L this next quarter. And as we get through fiscal 2024, those two lines, the price line and the cost line will finally intersect and we can see that that will be fully mitigated. Question, please. Sure. Yes, it's absolutely meeting our expectations. It was a call out in terms of the broad volume that we had this last quarter. So we had strength across a number of many different categories and customers. We also called out double-digit growth within our sourcing and manufacturer services group which is a key component of the upstream elements of specialty. So the business is strong, it's large, it's growing nicely. We have \u2013 I think like the rest of the industry, biosimilars is a nice tail one that we're seeing, not large enough to call out as an individual driver. Our 3PL business, especially with the regulatory approvals being a little bit more normalized is well positioned. And we're continuing to invest in areas that will be growth opportunities in the future, whether that'd be cell and gene or just where value-based care is going. We have our Navista TS platform, so we're investing organically. And of course, within our inorganic, we've had a nice success with our Bendcare GPO and the investment in the MSO that I think has given us some additional opportunities to think about in the future as well. So not any 1 item to highlight, but there is strong breadth across many different pillars of the specialty business that we feel good is a very strong foundation and platform for future growth. I believe that was our last question. Yes. Thank you. And I'll... Yes. Thanks. I appreciate that. Just to summarize real quick. I'm pleased with the continued stability in Pharma, as we just discussed here today. As well as the progress that we're making in the medical business. We are committed to executing on our key priorities, including maintaining a relentless focus on shareholder value creation. So with that, thank you and have a great day."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the First Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Cardinal Health Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. I will now hand the call over to Kevin Moran, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir\nKevin Moran: Good morning, and welcome. Today, we will discuss Cardinal Health's first quarter fiscal 2023 results, along with updates to our full year outlook. You can find today's press release and earnings presentation on the IR section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com. Joining me today are Jason Hollar, Chief Executive Officer; and Trish English, Interim Chief Financial Officer. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in the statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statement slide at the beginning of our presentation for a full description of these risks and uncertainties. Please note that during the discussion today, our comments will be on a non-GAAP basis, unless they are specifically called out as GAAP. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for all relevant periods can be found in the schedules attached to our press release. During the Q&A portion of today's call, we please ask that you try and limit yourself to one question so that we can try and give everyone in the queue an opportunity. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jason.\nJason Hollar: Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Now that I've had a couple of months to settle into the CEO role, I'm feeling even more energized and excited about the opportunities in front of us. By recent conversations with customers, suppliers, employees and shareholders have reinforced my perceptions that our company's role in healthcare and our mission to improve the lives of people every day remain as critical as ever. Our customers and their patients rely on us to deliver the right products to the right places at the right time. And yet, there's also a collective recognition of the need for simplification, focused execution and clarification of our company's strategic direction. Our goal today, along with reviewing our recent results is to summarize the key near-term priorities and progress to date on our plans, which I will discuss later in my remarks. However, before I turn it over to Trish, let me share some initial perspective on the first quarter. Overall, our performance in the first quarter demonstrated continued stable fundamentals in our largest business and tangible progress in Medical. In Pharma, we tracked slightly ahead of our expectations, as we delivered growth while managing industry-wide inflationary headwinds. We are encouraged by the ongoing stability in prescription volumes and strong performance of our generics program. In Medical, the quarter's results were also a little better than expectations we announced in September. While I'm pleased with our team's efforts in the quarter to achieve these results, there is more work to be done to drive better, more predictable financial performance in line with the underlying potential of this business. We are highly focused on executing our Medical Improvement Plan initiatives, which I'll cover in greater detail later in my remarks. Across the company, our team is operating with urgency to drive our businesses forward and committed to creating value for our shareholders. Now, I'll turn it over to Trish to dive deeper into our results and outlook.\nTrish English: Thanks, Jason, and good morning, everyone. It's great to speak with you all. Today, I'll share details on three areas of focus. Our consolidated first quarter results, the key drivers underlying our segment's performance and our updated fiscal 2023 outlook before turning it back to Jason for final remarks. First quarter total company revenue increased 13%, driven by Pharma segment sales growth. Gross margin decreased 2% to $1.6 billion, due to net inflationary impact in medical and one month impact of the Cordis divestiture, partially offset by our Pharma Generics program performance. Consolidated SG&A increased 7%, reflecting inflationary supply chain costs and other operating expenses such as higher costs to support Pharma sales growth. This increase was partially offset by the Cordis divestiture and benefits from enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives. Operating earnings decreased 20% to $423 million, reflecting the decline in Medical segment profit, primarily due to net inflationary impact, and partially offset by growth in Pharma segment profit. Now moving below the line. Interest and Other decreased 25% to $27 million, primarily driven by increased interest income from cash and equivalents. As a reminder, our debt is largely fixed rate, resulting in a net benefit from rising interest rates. Our first quarter effective tax rate finished at 16.9%, approximately 7 percentage points lower than prior year due to certain favorable discrete items. Diluted weighted average shares were $273 million, 6% lower than a year ago due to share repurchases. We are focused on balanced disciplined and shareholder-friendly capital deployment and in mid-September, we initiated a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we expect to complete in the second quarter. The net result for the quarter was earnings per share of $1.20. Now, turning to the balance sheet. We generated first quarter operating cash flow of approximately $25 million. This includes total litigation payments of approximately $390 million, primarily consisting of the second payment under the national opioid settlement. Adjusted free cash flow in our first quarter was $342 million. We ended the period with a cash position of $3.5 billion, with no outstanding borrowings on our credit facility. Now turning to the segments, beginning with Pharma on slide 5. First quarter revenue increased 15% to $46 billion, driven by branded pharmaceutical sales growth from existing and net new Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty customers. Pharma segment profit increased 6% to $431 million, driven by Generic program performance and a higher contribution from Brand and Specialty products, partially offset by inflationary supply chain costs. During the quarter, we were pleased to see strong execution and continued consistent market dynamic in our generic program including Red Oak. As we previously note, inflation continue to impact supply chain cost across the industry, particularly within transportation and labor. We saw an approximate $20 million year-over-year headwind from these areas, which was consistent with our expectations. This headwind was effectively offset by year-over-year tailwind on from our completed ERP technology enhancements and lower opioid-related legal costs. Okay. Turning to Medical on slide 6. First quarter revenue decreased 9% to $3.8 billion, driven by lower products and distribution sales, primarily due to PPE pricing and volumes, and to a lesser extent, the Cordis divestiture. Continued strong growth in our at-Home Solutions business offset some of this revenue decline. Medical segment loss of $8 million was due to net inflationary impact in products and distribution, as well as a lower contribution from PPE, both of which I will discuss in more detail. Importantly, these results reflect approximately $20 million in total inventory charges related to our previously announced simplification actions. This includes the sale of our gloves portfolio that is primarily utilized in non-health care industries. As a reminder, this non-core product line has been a source of volatility and distraction in recent years. These actions, despite the one-time costs are an example of our ongoing commitment to strengthening the medical product and distribution business through simplification. During the quarter, the growth impacts from * incremental inflation in our product and distribution business was in line with our expectations of approximately $150 million, and we successfully achieved our inflation mitigation target of 25%. Our mitigation efforts have continued to accelerate, most notably with the implementation of the second wave of product pricing actions in July. Jason will elaborate on our plans for further mitigation shortly. Now, a quick update on the overall utilization environment. We've previously noticed some overall volume softness in our products and distribution business, including a lower demand for PPE, which we believe primarily reflects customers' higher inventory levels. In the first quarter, we saw generally consistent overall products and distribution volumes sequentially, including with PPE. While we do anticipate gradual improvement in volumes relative to these recent lows, we continue to expect choppiness in demand levels going forward. Now for our fiscal 2023 outlook, beginning on slide eight. We are reiterating our EPS guidance of $5.05 to $5.40. This includes our updated medical segment outlook, which has been adjusted for the impact of simplification actions in the first quarter and a few below-the-line improvement. Based on the first quarter performance, we are confident in lowering the top end of the ranges for interest and other, our effective tax rate and diluted weighted average shares for the fiscal year. We now expect I&O in the range of $140 million to $160 million, an ETR between 23% and 24% and diluted shares between $262 million to $264 million. Our expectations for the remaining items listed on slide eight remain unchanged. We are also reiterating our fiscal 2023 outlook for the Pharma segment seen on slide nine. We continue to expect revenue growth in the range of 10% to 14% and segment profit growth in the range of 2% to 5%. Before transitioning to medical, two key call-outs on the Pharma cadence. First, with stronger start to the year, we now expect more balanced year-over-year profit growth between the first and second half of fiscal 2023. And specifically, for the second quarter, we expect segment profit dollars to be similar to the first quarter. Now turning to Medical. We expect segment profit ranging from flat to a decline of 20%, which, as I indicated, reflects the impact of the simplification actions in the first quarter. With respect to inflation and our mitigation actions, there is no change to our expectation of a net impact of approximately $300 million in fiscal 2023 or a minimal year-over-year impact. The macroeconomic environment remains dynamic. And while we've seen some decreases in spot rates of certain cost drivers, such as international freight, other areas such as commodity costs remain significantly elevated. As a reminder, these product costs are capitalized into inventory. And in the current environment of elongated supply chain reflected in our P&L results on an approximate two-quarter delay. While we now expect growth inflation in the second quarter to be similar to what was seen in Q1, we are implementing additional actions and working proactively to mitigate these pressures. It's important to note that, we continue to expect that as we exit the year, the run rate of our mitigation actions will offset at least 50% of the growth impact from inflation. On Medical's quarterly cadence, in Q2, we expect similar segment profit dollars since the first quarter, excluding the impact of the first quarter simplification actions. As we have noted before, we continue to expect a substantial majority of segment profit to come in the second half of fiscal 2023 and particularly in the fourth quarter. This sequencing primarily reflects our assumptions around inflation, inflation mitigation and PPE. With that, I'll now turn it over to Jason.\nJason Hollar: Thanks, Trish. I concluded our August earnings call with three key takeaways that, I'd like to provide updates on, number one, improving the underlying performance of the Medical segment through our Medical Improvement Plan initiatives. The key driver to achieving our segment profit target of at least $650 million by fiscal 2025 is our mitigation actions for inflation and global supply chain constraints. Though elevated inflation has persisted in the macro environment for longer than expected, we are on track to exit fiscal 2023 offsetting at least 50% of the gross impact on our business. As I previously mentioned, we plan to fully address the impact of inflation and global supply chain constraints through mitigation initiatives by the time we exit fiscal 2024. Our third wave of price increases went into effect on October 1, and we are planning additional actions for the third quarter. To-date, we have adjusted product categories representing nearly 90% of US Cardinal Health brand sales, excluding PPE. Additionally, we successfully adjusted language in product contracts as they've renewed to allow for greater pricing flexibility to respond to macroeconomic dynamics. We've also executed distribution fee increases to offset higher transportation, labor and fuel costs and continue to explore other opportunities for further offsets with urgency. Outside of our mitigation actions, we expect the largest contributor to our growth to be our ability to optimize and grow our $4.6 billion Cardinal Health brand portfolio. This will be achieved through new product innovation and increased product availability as a result of targeted investments. Additionally, I'm confident in our ability to optimize our cost structure and our sourcing and manufacturing footprints as we focus on driving simplification across the medical organization. The team is energized by the goals we have laid out in the medical improvement plan and has already hit the ground running on execution. Moving to item number two, for the Pharma business, continuing to build upon the growth and the resiliency that we've seen by executing in the core and accelerating our growth areas, primarily Specialty. Similarly, continuing on talent and leadership, we are excited by the appointment of Debbie Weitzman to CEO of the Pharma segment. Debbie has a deep understanding of our industry landscape, long-standing and strong relationships with our customers and a proven track record as a commercial and operations leader across her 17 years at Cardinal Health. Debbie's deployment was part of our recently announced segment restructuring designed to reduce complexity, drive productivity and efficiency gains, and simplify how our customers and our manufacturing partners to do business with us. These changes are intended to maximize the strength of our pharmaceutical distribution and Specialty businesses, bringing together similar services under one team, enabling us to respond faster and more effectively to changes in the healthcare landscape, while keeping the customer at the center of everything we do. Simply, it is allowing us to reposition with both the right talent and organizational design. In Specialty, we have a robust service offering, both downstream with providers and upstream with biopharma manufacturers and we continue to build upon our capabilities. In the area of oncology, we've expanded our best-in-class offering for value-based care, the Navista TS, which will continue to serve as a vital resource for oncologists transitioning to the new CMS enhancing oncology model. In rheumatology, we've closed on our recent tuck-in acquisition of the Bendcare GPO and our investment in our managed services organization has expanded our capabilities in the space and contributed to new customer growth. In just 30 days, this cross-functional leadership team worked diligently to onboard over 250 healthcare providers onto our distribution and logistics platforms. With biosimilars, we remain well positioned to distribute and provide the surrounding services as they come to market, particularly in the new therapeutic areas and sites of care. We continue to expect increased contributions from biosimilars in fiscal 2023 and beyond. Upstream and Specialty, our third-party logistics business continues its strong growth with more than double the launches in the first quarter compared to a year ago, as well as double-digit new contract wins. And our continued investment towards the digital transformation of our Sonexus access and patient support business has enabled us to realize benefits from new business wins and expansion of existing clients. And finally, number three, a relentless focus on shareholder value creation. This includes maximizing sustainable, profitable growth and cash flow generation, as well as a return of capital to shareholders. We continue to expect strong and resilient cash flow generation, supporting our capital allocation priorities. We are prioritizing organic growth, deploying CapEx to the highest value projects. We've made tremendous progress in reducing our long-term debt, which has created additional flexibility for shareholder returns. We were pleased to initiate the $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program in the first quarter and continue to expect $1.5 billion to $2 billion in total share repurchases in fiscal 2023, in addition to our ongoing dividend of over $500 million annually. Beyond these actions, we also announced enhancements to our governance structure, including four new independent Board members and a new business review committee, tasked with supporting a comprehensive review of our company's strategy, portfolio, capital allocation framework and operations. Our business review committee, which I chair, has already held multiple meetings and is working through the detailed review covering every business. We expect to share conclusions publicly at an Investor Day in the first half of calendar 2023. In closing, I recognize there is still a lot to accomplish, yet I remain excited about these opportunities to drive growth. I believe that our resilient business models, robust operating cash flow generation, favorable capital structure and capital allocation flexibility differentiates us in this time of macroeconomic uncertainty, and I am confident in our future. Before we open up to Q&A, I do want to spend a moment thanking our dedicated team around the globe. We've had a number of opportunities to connect with them across the last couple of months, and is truly a privilege to lead every day. They are driving the execution of the initiatives that we've discussed to date to deliver for our shareholders, for our customers and for their patients, and we are very much looking forward to the opportunities that remain ahead. With that, we will take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take the first question from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore.\nElizabeth Anderson: Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question. I was just wondering, if you could talk a little bit about the sort of embedded expertise in the back half of the year. You obviously at the first quarter and you had some nice outperformance and hitting some early milestones and key initiatives. But in terms of like, how we think about that outperformance versus sort of how you still see the progression in terms of the quarterly ramp in the back half, more color on that would be very helpful? Thanks.\nJason Hollar: Sure. And as your question, Elizabeth, specific to any particular business, or are you just talking generally?\nElizabeth Anderson: Specifically in terms of Medical, but I would also be curious on the Pharma side as well.\nJason Hollar: Okay. Yeah. For Medical specifically, it's the biggest driver by far will be the mitigation actions to address inflation. That's \u2013 as we talked, our first pricing actions went in place March 1st, of fiscal 2022. And then we had another wave in July of fiscal \u2013 the very beginning of fiscal 2023, and then another price adjustment that occurred October 1. We do expect further price adjustments in the third quarter of the fiscal year. And then at the same time, we would expect, especially in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 to start to see some of the lower costs, especially with the international freight piece, finally starting to hit our P&L. As Trish highlighted in her comments, the supply chain remains very elongated. And so we would anticipate, it's going to take, again, at least a couple of quarters before lower costs actually come through the P&L. But as we indicated in our comments, the international freight is really the only area of any significance that we're seeing cost reductions at this point. We do see some of the other commodities coming down, but not to the same extent. The other key component from a first half, second half perspective for Medical is just the normalization of PPE. We talked about the higher-cost PPE being on our balance sheet when volumes fell quite a bit at the latter part of fiscal 2022, that meant that higher cost save in our balance sheet longer, and while we're pleased to see that it feels like we've come off the lows here from the fourth quarter in terms of demand, it remains still something that will take a few quarters to work through. And then beyond that, really for all of our businesses, it's just a normal cost reduction and other growth initiatives over the course of the year, just build up. Within Pharma, the specific item to remember from a first half, second half, specifically the third quarter is always just the recognition of the brand inflation. While that continues to be a small portion of our overall brand margin less than 5%. It does remain highly concentrated in the third quarter. And that's the biggest driver for that particular business. Next question, please.\nOperator: We will now take the next question from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.\nLisa Gill: All right. Thanks very much. Jason, I want to spend a couple of minutes on the pharmaceutical distribution side of your business. So a few things. One of the things that really stuck out to me is you talked about strong performance in your generic program, and having enhancing programs going forward. I kind of think of where we need to be in generics. So maybe can you talk about what you're seeing in the market and incremental opportunities? And then secondly, when I look at the revenue on pharmaceutical distribution, you're coming in well above where the industry is. Can you maybe just talk about where you see that over time? And again, even your guidance is above where industry rates are? Like what's the key drivers there?\nJason Hollar: Yes. Let me start with the revenue point. So revenue for -- this particular quarter we highlighted was driven by brand products as our -- with our larger customers. So when you think about the flow-through of that, that typically brings with it a lower margin profile, but brand has been very strong, and our larger customers have been an overweight of that. So kind of winning with the winners. We -- our bigger customers have been growing nicely, and that has been driving our revenue quite a bit higher, but that tends to be the lower margin product. And so, that's why you don't see quite the same flow-through in terms of margin dollars. That's fairly consistent to what we've seen for quite some time. We also highlighted in the third quarter fiscal 2022, some new business wins that did benefit our revenue as well. And with that, it means that the first half of fiscal 2023, we would anticipate our revenue having a little bit of a tailwind relative to the full year, because we will then anniversary lap that new business win come the third quarter of fiscal 2023. And so your first question -- I'm sorry, the first question on generics. Yes. So it continues to be a very consistent dynamics in the marketplace. Some of the new business wins have benefited that as well. We continue to have a very strong performance within Red Oak Sourcing. And the underlying utilization continues to be much more consistent and stable and predictable than what we've seen ever since the beginning of the pandemic. So it feels a little bit more as business as usual and less fluctuations and then underlying that, driving margin through sourcing and driving the new business through our system. So those are the primary drivers.\nKevin Moran: Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS.\nKevin Caliendo: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to talk a little bit about the contracting. I think the last time Cardinal went through a lot of contracting through COVID, it ended up kind of working against you, as things reverse. So I just want to understand more about how you're amending these contracts. Are customers comfortable with this? Is there any pushback? There seemingly is efforts on amongst almost all hospital companies to reduce their supply costs right now or reduce costs in general. So just wondering how it works? Does it -- is it impacting you immediately, or is this more of a cushion for longer term? Anything there would be helpful. And then one other follow-up. I read that there was a real estate transaction done, and now that was part of the business review potential outcomes was to maybe monetize some real estate. Can you talk about the opportunity size to be able to do that in terms of generating capital for the business?\nJason Hollar: Sure. So on the contracting, first of all, Kevin, I'm presuming you're talking about the medical inflationary price impacts?\nKevin Caliendo: Yeah.\nJason Hollar: Yeah, okay. So the way the pricing that we've defined, those are temporary in nature to get us to the contracting that you're talking about. So as the contracts renew, those temporary price increases are then flowed through to the permanent structure with then having adjustments within there so that we don't have the same issue again in the future that we've had to experience here. So as you can imagine, those contracts roll over the course of multiple years, we've highlighted three to four years. And we're still in the earlier phases of an innings with that. However, I'll tell you, it's going consistent with my expectations. These are never easy conversations. But to your point and how you even frame the question, inflation is everywhere. And while some of this is more temporary in nature, a lot of it is going to be long-lasting and permanent. When you think about specialty labor, right, those costs are never going to come down and a lot of the transportation costs feel like it's going to be at very elevated levels for quite some time. So there's some components that will be more variable. But ultimately, the one thing that's clear to us is that, there will be a permanent step-up increase in that level of cost. And depending upon exactly how the Fed moves here and how macro economic factors roll into this. We need to be positioned so that we have a structure that allows us to claw this back by the time we exit fiscal 2024. So again, not easy, but it's a process that our customers understand that, we're in the middle of this supply chain, and that we have to have the assistance to be able to offset these costs. And you can just look at our public financial statements to understand that, we're not making anything in addition on this. We are still funding this gap and that's why we have this urgency on this issue and why it's our highest priority as a business. As it relates to the real estate transaction, we've had some small transactions. There's nothing material at all to call out. The \u2013 there's always evaluation. We do own some real estate. It is a component of one of those factors that we look at. At this point, it's too early to talk about any type of opportunity with that. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.\nErin Wright: Great. Thanks. And can you speak a little bit to the long-term strategy and what's feasible in terms of your opportunity to improve mix and increase your exposure to Specialty over time? And as we think about kind of specialty, can you also speak to the biosimilar opportunity and your near-term positioning to participate with like HUMIRA biosimilars as well as others? Thanks.\nJason Hollar: Yeah. Well, first and foremost, absolutely, I appreciate and understand the question. This is a key reason for our recent reorganization within the Pharma segment. We have structured the team to have specialty in PD altogether, reducing the complexity, driving not just productivity, but more importantly, simplifying how we go to market with both our customers as well as the manufacturing partners. So this is all to recognize the importance of driving that favorable mix. The market is going to, in part, be a rising tide but we definitely want to do as much as possible to participate as much of that growth as there is. We did just recently acquired Bendcare that gives us additional exposure here. We have invested organically in all the different businesses and tools that I referenced in my script. So we're investing both inorganically as well as organically and have now a structure and a leadership team that's intensely focused on this. So we feel like we're really well positioned to be able to take advantage of that into the future. On biosimilars, that is absolutely a component of this as well. The same point. We've invested into our capabilities and our team. We participate in that today. It is a nice driver for our business, not large enough that we have called it out specifically. But nonetheless, it is an area that, as we continue to see evolution of the sites of care in the therapeutic areas, then we would anticipate that to be further opportunities for us, and it fits nicely into our capabilities. I know we get a lot of questions specifically about Humira and how that is going to benefit us. There's a lot to be still played out here in terms of how all participants drive the different processes for this, specifically the payers and PBMs, how they go to market and work with the market to implement these evolutions. So a lot to be learned there. But the point is, we are positioned very well, we're able to take advantage of that. But there's some level of uncertainty, but we do have confidence there will be a tailwind for us going forward as it has been in the last few years as well.\nKevin Moran: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Cherny from Bank of America.\nMichael Cherny: Good morning. I have one kind of just technical question and then a bit more on the numbers. So just first, on the ASR, you said you launched it in mid-September. Is there any way to quantify how much of the ASR you completed in 1Q relative to the timing of the 2Q finish? And then, on the guidance, and I hear you on especially the trajectory of medical per Elizabeth's question earlier. But if you think about the moving pieces and what you updated today, it seems like there's more tailwinds when it comes to tax interest expense and share count than there are headwinds on the medical guide down. Any thought about why reiterating the guide versus not maybe bringing up the low end of the minimum?\nJason Hollar: Sure. As it relates to the ASR, the -- your technical question. Yes, about 80% is what you would expect for the immediate benefit. And like you appropriately referenced, it was implemented in mid-September, so a relatively small impact to the current quarter. As it relates to the guidance changes, well, hey, it's the first quarter. It's certainly early. We're also talking about -- still a fairly uncertain macroeconomic environment. We're also talking about a lot of news out there that we're always looking at in addition to our own data in terms of utilization. So as our comments highlighted, we did not see a lot of surprises as it relates to utilization in either of our businesses, either our segments this particular quarter. And that was certainly welcome, given what the last couple of years have looked like. But nonetheless, we continue to see more data points on that through a lot of external references, and that's something that we continue to look at. But mathematically, I don't think there's that much difference in terms of the offsets that we took, both in the takedown with medical driven in part by that simplification efforts, but then also those other items where we took the top end down. It's still a reasonable range considering how early it is in the year as well as the drivers that are all around us.\nKevin Moran: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Percher with Nephron Research.\nEric Percher: Thank you. I'd like to return to Medical and relative to the offset that you're attempting to achieve in 2023, it sounds like we have three factors, the pricing efforts, letting some of the supply chain and cost flow through or normalize and then access to private label. Could you speak to what portion of the offset for fiscal year 2023 falls into those buckets, if you think those are the right buckets? And then as you move to 2024, how does that change in terms of how much is driven by each of those factors?\nJason Hollar: So just make sure I understand the question. So we have our gross inflationary impacts and then we have the mitigation actions that get us to the net. You're specifically asking about the mitigation actions, and how to think about what's driving those, both for 2023 and 2024?\nEric Percher: Exactly. What are the most material factors of the mitigating actions and how do they change 2024 versus 2023?\nJason Hollar: Yeah. By far, it's pricing. That is \u2013 there's opportunity. And of course, what we want to do is work with our customers as much as possible to reduce what is necessary to flow through in terms of pricing, but the amount that can be moved on those items as well as others is relatively small. So, pricing will be the predominant element there. The other component is just the cost coming down naturally as well. So we have two things happening between now and the end of the fiscal year. Pricing will continue to go up period-to-period, quarter-to-quarter. And our costs will, at some point here, peak, which we're pretty close to that. We believe we indicated similar gross costs in Q1 as what we expect in Q2, and especially into Q4 with the international freight piece, that's the one area that we have some confidence is going to come down. And so I know your question is specifically on the mitigation items, but the gross will come down is expected to come down right now, specifically because of the international freight. The other components to inflation and other commodities, especially, we are seeing them come down a little bit in some areas, but not very significantly, and certainly at a pace less than what we had thought. And a handful of them are actually going up. But overall, I would expect to exit the year, with a little bit lower cost run rate than what we have coming into the year. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.\nGeorge Hill: Yeah. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. Jason, I'm going to come back to the MedSurg segment again. I was just wondering if there's kind of a way to quantify like what part of the book has the new contracting terms in place? And I don't know if you can talk about kind of the actions taken by peers. And then kind of \u2013 I kind of roll that into kind of timing of implementation like you kind of talked about the two quarter lag between \u2013 not really the lag, but like kind of the timing of the supply chain in that segment of the book. So I'm just trying to think about how long it takes the entire book to get re-contracted into the new terms? And kind of what is the end date by which we should expect the full MedSurg book to kind of be operating under the new model?\nJason Hollar: Well, it's going to take at least a few more years to get to, the essence where you're going with that to get the full book there. But it will be relatively consistent between now and then. So every \u2013 remember, these are not necessarily massive clip event contracts. Our product \u2013 we've got a couple of dozen different product lines, and they have different dates with different GPOs and different customers. So it's a fairly consistent stair stepping towards that. It's not like one big clip event. So you can think about it as every day, we have to work on this. And every day, it's incredibly important that we roll over the temporary prices into permanent prices given the permanent nature of so much of this cost. So we are considering different ways to give you a little bit more insight to that. I'm not going to go into that further yet, other than to say we are having the success as expected with this. We feel it's the right thing, and we feel very good about this plan, and there's still a lot of work we need to focus on, but it's the right plan. It's the right thing to do and we have not been surprised with this at this stage of the year and at this stage of the plan.\nKevin Moran: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.\nA.J. Rice: Hi. Good morning. I might just ask, obviously, you've got a lot of things going on and seemingly having some success with your simplification and mitigation strategies. Now you have this business review committee. Are the -- and that's -- I know it's still early in getting up and running and going. Are the guardrails as to the things you're already doing to improve performance versus what the business review committee is doing pretty clear? And did I hear you right in the prepared remarks that you think a review committee will have an update at the calendar 2023 Investor Day? I assume that would be preliminary if there's anything to share them.\nJason Hollar: Sure. So, yes, there's a charter for the business review committee. It's very consistent to what I provided in my comments. Of course, there's a portfolio element. There's a strategy and operations element. And importantly, there's a capital allocation framework. As we communicated before, we had these types of evaluations and communication with our board prior. We now have new Board members. Of course, we have the business review committee as well. So it's a bit more of a formalized process. We are taking full advantage of the insights and experience that all of those board members are bringing to the discussion and the business review committee acts as any other Board committee, where we work and provide insights and advice to the broad Board and make it a bit more of a formal process. But the guardrails are, as I just described there and it's very clear what we work on. As I share it and I lead the agenda, I've, of course, also listened to the committee as to what they believe are the key areas of opportunity, and it's very collaborative and constructive. So from my perspective, we're getting good insight. I think that all of our Board members, but the committee specifically is doing the best we tend to think through the lens of the investor and make sure that we're driving the business, we're evaluating the portfolio. And, of course, we're in a fairly uncertain time, both operationally and from a macroeconomic perspective. We have that filter as well that comes through our work that we evaluate. But nonetheless, we -- as I commented already, we are meeting frequently. We are meeting with urgency, and we're very focused on this. As it relates to the readout, yes, you heard that right, the calendar 2023 -- by the first half of calendar 2023, we will have that Investor Day. And we'll have an update as to what is potential to update at that point in time. And I see this as a journey, not necessarily just a sprint, but we are working with urgency to have as much completed by them as possible. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen.\nCharles Rhyee: Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two really here. Just a follow-up, on the Medical guide, I might have missed it, but \u2013 obviously, you've changed it. Was it \u2013 has there been any change in your assumptions in the macro environment between July and now that's \u2013 is it really macro driven is how \u2013 in fact, because it seems like you have control over the pricing part of things \u2013 is it just waiting for the environment itself and some of the natural inflation that's floating around here to come in line to get to your targets? And then secondly, there's been news a lot about shortages in amoxicillin. Just any of your thoughts here on truck shortages, elsewhere possibly in the supply chain, any thoughts on the outlook there? Thanks.\nJason Hollar: Sure. Yeah. In terms of Medical, it's \u2013 the underlying performance that we are anticipating for the business is really unchanged. The key item we highlighted is the simplification cost that has been wrapped into this. But the underlying business volume utilization, other performance elements are relatively unchanged. There's always puts and takes. Not a lot of new news there for really either business. In both businesses, we had a few non-recurring items, a little bit of timing in medical. But overall, not too many surprises there. As it relates to any type of product shortages, there's always some of that in any of our business. There's a few items that are being chased within the Pharma segment. Nothing that, I would call very unusual and certainly. Nothing at this stage that I would anticipate being a significant impact or really any noticeable impact for the segment for the current quarter or the fiscal year. But that's why we believe that, obviously, just sourcing in general is an incredibly important function, specifically to Generics, it's the Red Oak Sourcing is a huge driver for not just cost control, but for delivery. And certainly, there's been some strong demand for some of those products like amoxicillin that you just referenced for respiratory challenges that we're seeing some drive for in the marketplace. But again, it's something that we don't think will be either lasting or any type of impact for us. Next question, please.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays.\nSteven Valiquette: Great. Thanks. Good morning. So you guys touched on this topic a little bit, but this quarter, we saw your largest publicly traded hospital distribution and self-manufacturing MedSurg competitor really struggle with delayed product reorders by their acute care hospital customers who chose to deplete the stockpiled items. So I know you have a different set of SKUs versus that competitor for the self-manufacturing component. But can you just confirm that you generally are able to successfully track the level of inventory sitting within your health system customers in the Medical segment and currently, we hopefully not seeing a similar inventory destocking trend within the health system customer base that could be a risk factor for the recovery as the fiscal year progresses? Thanks.\nJason Hollar: Yes. So those types of comments are very consistent with what we've been saying in the last couple of quarters. So we have seen destocking of our customers' inventory. We are very close with them and have that dialogue all the time and that is what we have been seeing. We referenced in our comments that our volume, specifically to PPE, but even more broadly is fairly consistent sequentially from Q4 of last year to Q1 of this year. So we're not seeing significant changes in the poll, but we did call this out last quarter because it was a fairly significant reduction we saw sequentially at the latter end of fiscal 2022. So the concept we absolutely have referenced ourselves and have seen, but we have seen pretty consistent demand patterns here this last quarter. And while it's still very early in Q2, I can say that we haven't seen anything significantly different so far at the beginning of this quarter as well. But there's really nothing else to add at this point. So I think that's the final -- final question. So I'll just end it with just a couple of closing comments here. I'll end where I began my comments this morning that I am pleased with the progress that we're making in our core business fundamentals. We are driving lasting improvements in both segments while maintaining a relentless focus on shareholder value creation. So with that, thank you, and have a great day.\nEnd of Q&A:\nOperator: Thank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Trish English",
            "content": "Thanks, Jason, and good morning, everyone. It's great to speak with you all. Today, I'll share details on three areas of focus. Our consolidated first quarter results, the key drivers underlying our segment's performance and our updated fiscal 2023 outlook before turning it back to Jason for final remarks. First quarter total company revenue increased 13%, driven by Pharma segment sales growth. Gross margin decreased 2% to $1.6 billion, due to net inflationary impact in medical and one month impact of the Cordis divestiture, partially offset by our Pharma Generics program performance. Consolidated SG&A increased 7%, reflecting inflationary supply chain costs and other operating expenses such as higher costs to support Pharma sales growth. This increase was partially offset by the Cordis divestiture and benefits from enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives. Operating earnings decreased 20% to $423 million, reflecting the decline in Medical segment profit, primarily due to net inflationary impact, and partially offset by growth in Pharma segment profit. Now moving below the line. Interest and Other decreased 25% to $27 million, primarily driven by increased interest income from cash and equivalents. As a reminder, our debt is largely fixed rate, resulting in a net benefit from rising interest rates. Our first quarter effective tax rate finished at 16.9%, approximately 7 percentage points lower than prior year due to certain favorable discrete items. Diluted weighted average shares were $273 million, 6% lower than a year ago due to share repurchases. We are focused on balanced disciplined and shareholder-friendly capital deployment and in mid-September, we initiated a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we expect to complete in the second quarter. The net result for the quarter was earnings per share of $1.20. Now, turning to the balance sheet. We generated first quarter operating cash flow of approximately $25 million. This includes total litigation payments of approximately $390 million, primarily consisting of the second payment under the national opioid settlement. Adjusted free cash flow in our first quarter was $342 million. We ended the period with a cash position of $3.5 billion, with no outstanding borrowings on our credit facility. Now turning to the segments, beginning with Pharma on slide 5. First quarter revenue increased 15% to $46 billion, driven by branded pharmaceutical sales growth from existing and net new Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty customers. Pharma segment profit increased 6% to $431 million, driven by Generic program performance and a higher contribution from Brand and Specialty products, partially offset by inflationary supply chain costs. During the quarter, we were pleased to see strong execution and continued consistent market dynamic in our generic program including Red Oak. As we previously note, inflation continue to impact supply chain cost across the industry, particularly within transportation and labor. We saw an approximate $20 million year-over-year headwind from these areas, which was consistent with our expectations. This headwind was effectively offset by year-over-year tailwind on from our completed ERP technology enhancements and lower opioid-related legal costs. Okay. Turning to Medical on slide 6. First quarter revenue decreased 9% to $3.8 billion, driven by lower products and distribution sales, primarily due to PPE pricing and volumes, and to a lesser extent, the Cordis divestiture. Continued strong growth in our at-Home Solutions business offset some of this revenue decline. Medical segment loss of $8 million was due to net inflationary impact in products and distribution, as well as a lower contribution from PPE, both of which I will discuss in more detail. Importantly, these results reflect approximately $20 million in total inventory charges related to our previously announced simplification actions. This includes the sale of our gloves portfolio that is primarily utilized in non-health care industries. As a reminder, this non-core product line has been a source of volatility and distraction in recent years. These actions, despite the one-time costs are an example of our ongoing commitment to strengthening the medical product and distribution business through simplification. During the quarter, the growth impacts from * incremental inflation in our product and distribution business was in line with our expectations of approximately $150 million, and we successfully achieved our inflation mitigation target of 25%. Our mitigation efforts have continued to accelerate, most notably with the implementation of the second wave of product pricing actions in July. Jason will elaborate on our plans for further mitigation shortly. Now, a quick update on the overall utilization environment. We've previously noticed some overall volume softness in our products and distribution business, including a lower demand for PPE, which we believe primarily reflects customers' higher inventory levels. In the first quarter, we saw generally consistent overall products and distribution volumes sequentially, including with PPE. While we do anticipate gradual improvement in volumes relative to these recent lows, we continue to expect choppiness in demand levels going forward. Now for our fiscal 2023 outlook, beginning on slide eight. We are reiterating our EPS guidance of $5.05 to $5.40. This includes our updated medical segment outlook, which has been adjusted for the impact of simplification actions in the first quarter and a few below-the-line improvement. Based on the first quarter performance, we are confident in lowering the top end of the ranges for interest and other, our effective tax rate and diluted weighted average shares for the fiscal year. We now expect I&O in the range of $140 million to $160 million, an ETR between 23% and 24% and diluted shares between $262 million to $264 million. Our expectations for the remaining items listed on slide eight remain unchanged. We are also reiterating our fiscal 2023 outlook for the Pharma segment seen on slide nine. We continue to expect revenue growth in the range of 10% to 14% and segment profit growth in the range of 2% to 5%. Before transitioning to medical, two key call-outs on the Pharma cadence. First, with stronger start to the year, we now expect more balanced year-over-year profit growth between the first and second half of fiscal 2023. And specifically, for the second quarter, we expect segment profit dollars to be similar to the first quarter. Now turning to Medical. We expect segment profit ranging from flat to a decline of 20%, which, as I indicated, reflects the impact of the simplification actions in the first quarter. With respect to inflation and our mitigation actions, there is no change to our expectation of a net impact of approximately $300 million in fiscal 2023 or a minimal year-over-year impact. The macroeconomic environment remains dynamic. And while we've seen some decreases in spot rates of certain cost drivers, such as international freight, other areas such as commodity costs remain significantly elevated. As a reminder, these product costs are capitalized into inventory. And in the current environment of elongated supply chain reflected in our P&L results on an approximate two-quarter delay. While we now expect growth inflation in the second quarter to be similar to what was seen in Q1, we are implementing additional actions and working proactively to mitigate these pressures. It's important to note that, we continue to expect that as we exit the year, the run rate of our mitigation actions will offset at least 50% of the growth impact from inflation. On Medical's quarterly cadence, in Q2, we expect similar segment profit dollars since the first quarter, excluding the impact of the first quarter simplification actions. As we have noted before, we continue to expect a substantial majority of segment profit to come in the second half of fiscal 2023 and particularly in the fourth quarter. This sequencing primarily reflects our assumptions around inflation, inflation mitigation and PPE. With that, I'll now turn it over to Jason."

            "name": "Jason Hollar",
            "content": "Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Now that I've had a couple of months to settle into the CEO role, I'm feeling even more energized and excited about the opportunities in front of us. By recent conversations with customers, suppliers, employees and shareholders have reinforced my perceptions that our company's role in healthcare and our mission to improve the lives of people every day remain as critical as ever. Our customers and their patients rely on us to deliver the right products to the right places at the right time. And yet, there's also a collective recognition of the need for simplification, focused execution and clarification of our company's strategic direction. Our goal today, along with reviewing our recent results is to summarize the key near-term priorities and progress to date on our plans, which I will discuss later in my remarks. However, before I turn it over to Trish, let me share some initial perspective on the first quarter. Overall, our performance in the first quarter demonstrated continued stable fundamentals in our largest business and tangible progress in Medical. In Pharma, we tracked slightly ahead of our expectations, as we delivered growth while managing industry-wide inflationary headwinds. We are encouraged by the ongoing stability in prescription volumes and strong performance of our generics program. In Medical, the quarter's results were also a little better than expectations we announced in September. While I'm pleased with our team's efforts in the quarter to achieve these results, there is more work to be done to drive better, more predictable financial performance in line with the underlying potential of this business. We are highly focused on executing our Medical Improvement Plan initiatives, which I'll cover in greater detail later in my remarks. Across the company, our team is operating with urgency to drive our businesses forward and committed to creating value for our shareholders. Now, I'll turn it over to Trish to dive deeper into our results and outlook. Thanks, Trish. I concluded our August earnings call with three key takeaways that, I'd like to provide updates on, number one, improving the underlying performance of the Medical segment through our Medical Improvement Plan initiatives. The key driver to achieving our segment profit target of at least $650 million by fiscal 2025 is our mitigation actions for inflation and global supply chain constraints. Though elevated inflation has persisted in the macro environment for longer than expected, we are on track to exit fiscal 2023 offsetting at least 50% of the gross impact on our business. As I previously mentioned, we plan to fully address the impact of inflation and global supply chain constraints through mitigation initiatives by the time we exit fiscal 2024. Our third wave of price increases went into effect on October 1, and we are planning additional actions for the third quarter. To-date, we have adjusted product categories representing nearly 90% of US Cardinal Health brand sales, excluding PPE. Additionally, we successfully adjusted language in product contracts as they've renewed to allow for greater pricing flexibility to respond to macroeconomic dynamics. We've also executed distribution fee increases to offset higher transportation, labor and fuel costs and continue to explore other opportunities for further offsets with urgency. Outside of our mitigation actions, we expect the largest contributor to our growth to be our ability to optimize and grow our $4.6 billion Cardinal Health brand portfolio. This will be achieved through new product innovation and increased product availability as a result of targeted investments. Additionally, I'm confident in our ability to optimize our cost structure and our sourcing and manufacturing footprints as we focus on driving simplification across the medical organization. The team is energized by the goals we have laid out in the medical improvement plan and has already hit the ground running on execution. Moving to item number two, for the Pharma business, continuing to build upon the growth and the resiliency that we've seen by executing in the core and accelerating our growth areas, primarily Specialty. Similarly, continuing on talent and leadership, we are excited by the appointment of Debbie Weitzman to CEO of the Pharma segment. Debbie has a deep understanding of our industry landscape, long-standing and strong relationships with our customers and a proven track record as a commercial and operations leader across her 17 years at Cardinal Health. Debbie's deployment was part of our recently announced segment restructuring designed to reduce complexity, drive productivity and efficiency gains, and simplify how our customers and our manufacturing partners to do business with us. These changes are intended to maximize the strength of our pharmaceutical distribution and Specialty businesses, bringing together similar services under one team, enabling us to respond faster and more effectively to changes in the healthcare landscape, while keeping the customer at the center of everything we do. Simply, it is allowing us to reposition with both the right talent and organizational design. In Specialty, we have a robust service offering, both downstream with providers and upstream with biopharma manufacturers and we continue to build upon our capabilities. In the area of oncology, we've expanded our best-in-class offering for value-based care, the Navista TS, which will continue to serve as a vital resource for oncologists transitioning to the new CMS enhancing oncology model. In rheumatology, we've closed on our recent tuck-in acquisition of the Bendcare GPO and our investment in our managed services organization has expanded our capabilities in the space and contributed to new customer growth. In just 30 days, this cross-functional leadership team worked diligently to onboard over 250 healthcare providers onto our distribution and logistics platforms. With biosimilars, we remain well positioned to distribute and provide the surrounding services as they come to market, particularly in the new therapeutic areas and sites of care. We continue to expect increased contributions from biosimilars in fiscal 2023 and beyond. Upstream and Specialty, our third-party logistics business continues its strong growth with more than double the launches in the first quarter compared to a year ago, as well as double-digit new contract wins. And our continued investment towards the digital transformation of our Sonexus access and patient support business has enabled us to realize benefits from new business wins and expansion of existing clients. And finally, number three, a relentless focus on shareholder value creation. This includes maximizing sustainable, profitable growth and cash flow generation, as well as a return of capital to shareholders. We continue to expect strong and resilient cash flow generation, supporting our capital allocation priorities. We are prioritizing organic growth, deploying CapEx to the highest value projects. We've made tremendous progress in reducing our long-term debt, which has created additional flexibility for shareholder returns. We were pleased to initiate the $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program in the first quarter and continue to expect $1.5 billion to $2 billion in total share repurchases in fiscal 2023, in addition to our ongoing dividend of over $500 million annually. Beyond these actions, we also announced enhancements to our governance structure, including four new independent Board members and a new business review committee, tasked with supporting a comprehensive review of our company's strategy, portfolio, capital allocation framework and operations. Our business review committee, which I chair, has already held multiple meetings and is working through the detailed review covering every business. We expect to share conclusions publicly at an Investor Day in the first half of calendar 2023. In closing, I recognize there is still a lot to accomplish, yet I remain excited about these opportunities to drive growth. I believe that our resilient business models, robust operating cash flow generation, favorable capital structure and capital allocation flexibility differentiates us in this time of macroeconomic uncertainty, and I am confident in our future. Before we open up to Q&A, I do want to spend a moment thanking our dedicated team around the globe. We've had a number of opportunities to connect with them across the last couple of months, and is truly a privilege to lead every day. They are driving the execution of the initiatives that we've discussed to date to deliver for our shareholders, for our customers and for their patients, and we are very much looking forward to the opportunities that remain ahead. With that, we will take your questions. Sure. And as your question, Elizabeth, specific to any particular business, or are you just talking generally? Okay. Yeah. For Medical specifically, it's the biggest driver by far will be the mitigation actions to address inflation. That's \u2013 as we talked, our first pricing actions went in place March 1st, of fiscal 2022. And then we had another wave in July of fiscal \u2013 the very beginning of fiscal 2023, and then another price adjustment that occurred October 1. We do expect further price adjustments in the third quarter of the fiscal year. And then at the same time, we would expect, especially in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 to start to see some of the lower costs, especially with the international freight piece, finally starting to hit our P&L. As Trish highlighted in her comments, the supply chain remains very elongated. And so we would anticipate, it's going to take, again, at least a couple of quarters before lower costs actually come through the P&L. But as we indicated in our comments, the international freight is really the only area of any significance that we're seeing cost reductions at this point. We do see some of the other commodities coming down, but not to the same extent. The other key component from a first half, second half perspective for Medical is just the normalization of PPE. We talked about the higher-cost PPE being on our balance sheet when volumes fell quite a bit at the latter part of fiscal 2022, that meant that higher cost save in our balance sheet longer, and while we're pleased to see that it feels like we've come off the lows here from the fourth quarter in terms of demand, it remains still something that will take a few quarters to work through. And then beyond that, really for all of our businesses, it's just a normal cost reduction and other growth initiatives over the course of the year, just build up. Within Pharma, the specific item to remember from a first half, second half, specifically the third quarter is always just the recognition of the brand inflation. While that continues to be a small portion of our overall brand margin less than 5%. It does remain highly concentrated in the third quarter. And that's the biggest driver for that particular business. Next question, please. Yes. Let me start with the revenue point. So revenue for -- this particular quarter we highlighted was driven by brand products as our -- with our larger customers. So when you think about the flow-through of that, that typically brings with it a lower margin profile, but brand has been very strong, and our larger customers have been an overweight of that. So kind of winning with the winners. We -- our bigger customers have been growing nicely, and that has been driving our revenue quite a bit higher, but that tends to be the lower margin product. And so, that's why you don't see quite the same flow-through in terms of margin dollars. That's fairly consistent to what we've seen for quite some time. We also highlighted in the third quarter fiscal 2022, some new business wins that did benefit our revenue as well. And with that, it means that the first half of fiscal 2023, we would anticipate our revenue having a little bit of a tailwind relative to the full year, because we will then anniversary lap that new business win come the third quarter of fiscal 2023. And so your first question -- I'm sorry, the first question on generics. Yes. So it continues to be a very consistent dynamics in the marketplace. Some of the new business wins have benefited that as well. We continue to have a very strong performance within Red Oak Sourcing. And the underlying utilization continues to be much more consistent and stable and predictable than what we've seen ever since the beginning of the pandemic. So it feels a little bit more as business as usual and less fluctuations and then underlying that, driving margin through sourcing and driving the new business through our system. So those are the primary drivers. Sure. So on the contracting, first of all, Kevin, I'm presuming you're talking about the medical inflationary price impacts? Yeah, okay. So the way the pricing that we've defined, those are temporary in nature to get us to the contracting that you're talking about. So as the contracts renew, those temporary price increases are then flowed through to the permanent structure with then having adjustments within there so that we don't have the same issue again in the future that we've had to experience here. So as you can imagine, those contracts roll over the course of multiple years, we've highlighted three to four years. And we're still in the earlier phases of an innings with that. However, I'll tell you, it's going consistent with my expectations. These are never easy conversations. But to your point and how you even frame the question, inflation is everywhere. And while some of this is more temporary in nature, a lot of it is going to be long-lasting and permanent. When you think about specialty labor, right, those costs are never going to come down and a lot of the transportation costs feel like it's going to be at very elevated levels for quite some time. So there's some components that will be more variable. But ultimately, the one thing that's clear to us is that, there will be a permanent step-up increase in that level of cost. And depending upon exactly how the Fed moves here and how macro economic factors roll into this. We need to be positioned so that we have a structure that allows us to claw this back by the time we exit fiscal 2024. So again, not easy, but it's a process that our customers understand that, we're in the middle of this supply chain, and that we have to have the assistance to be able to offset these costs. And you can just look at our public financial statements to understand that, we're not making anything in addition on this. We are still funding this gap and that's why we have this urgency on this issue and why it's our highest priority as a business. As it relates to the real estate transaction, we've had some small transactions. There's nothing material at all to call out. The \u2013 there's always evaluation. We do own some real estate. It is a component of one of those factors that we look at. At this point, it's too early to talk about any type of opportunity with that. Next question, please. Yeah. Well, first and foremost, absolutely, I appreciate and understand the question. This is a key reason for our recent reorganization within the Pharma segment. We have structured the team to have specialty in PD altogether, reducing the complexity, driving not just productivity, but more importantly, simplifying how we go to market with both our customers as well as the manufacturing partners. So this is all to recognize the importance of driving that favorable mix. The market is going to, in part, be a rising tide but we definitely want to do as much as possible to participate as much of that growth as there is. We did just recently acquired Bendcare that gives us additional exposure here. We have invested organically in all the different businesses and tools that I referenced in my script. So we're investing both inorganically as well as organically and have now a structure and a leadership team that's intensely focused on this. So we feel like we're really well positioned to be able to take advantage of that into the future. On biosimilars, that is absolutely a component of this as well. The same point. We've invested into our capabilities and our team. We participate in that today. It is a nice driver for our business, not large enough that we have called it out specifically. But nonetheless, it is an area that, as we continue to see evolution of the sites of care in the therapeutic areas, then we would anticipate that to be further opportunities for us, and it fits nicely into our capabilities. I know we get a lot of questions specifically about Humira and how that is going to benefit us. There's a lot to be still played out here in terms of how all participants drive the different processes for this, specifically the payers and PBMs, how they go to market and work with the market to implement these evolutions. So a lot to be learned there. But the point is, we are positioned very well, we're able to take advantage of that. But there's some level of uncertainty, but we do have confidence there will be a tailwind for us going forward as it has been in the last few years as well. Sure. As it relates to the ASR, the -- your technical question. Yes, about 80% is what you would expect for the immediate benefit. And like you appropriately referenced, it was implemented in mid-September, so a relatively small impact to the current quarter. As it relates to the guidance changes, well, hey, it's the first quarter. It's certainly early. We're also talking about -- still a fairly uncertain macroeconomic environment. We're also talking about a lot of news out there that we're always looking at in addition to our own data in terms of utilization. So as our comments highlighted, we did not see a lot of surprises as it relates to utilization in either of our businesses, either our segments this particular quarter. And that was certainly welcome, given what the last couple of years have looked like. But nonetheless, we continue to see more data points on that through a lot of external references, and that's something that we continue to look at. But mathematically, I don't think there's that much difference in terms of the offsets that we took, both in the takedown with medical driven in part by that simplification efforts, but then also those other items where we took the top end down. It's still a reasonable range considering how early it is in the year as well as the drivers that are all around us. So just make sure I understand the question. So we have our gross inflationary impacts and then we have the mitigation actions that get us to the net. You're specifically asking about the mitigation actions, and how to think about what's driving those, both for 2023 and 2024? Yeah. By far, it's pricing. That is \u2013 there's opportunity. And of course, what we want to do is work with our customers as much as possible to reduce what is necessary to flow through in terms of pricing, but the amount that can be moved on those items as well as others is relatively small. So, pricing will be the predominant element there. The other component is just the cost coming down naturally as well. So we have two things happening between now and the end of the fiscal year. Pricing will continue to go up period-to-period, quarter-to-quarter. And our costs will, at some point here, peak, which we're pretty close to that. We believe we indicated similar gross costs in Q1 as what we expect in Q2, and especially into Q4 with the international freight piece, that's the one area that we have some confidence is going to come down. And so I know your question is specifically on the mitigation items, but the gross will come down is expected to come down right now, specifically because of the international freight. The other components to inflation and other commodities, especially, we are seeing them come down a little bit in some areas, but not very significantly, and certainly at a pace less than what we had thought. And a handful of them are actually going up. But overall, I would expect to exit the year, with a little bit lower cost run rate than what we have coming into the year. Next question. Well, it's going to take at least a few more years to get to, the essence where you're going with that to get the full book there. But it will be relatively consistent between now and then. So every \u2013 remember, these are not necessarily massive clip event contracts. Our product \u2013 we've got a couple of dozen different product lines, and they have different dates with different GPOs and different customers. So it's a fairly consistent stair stepping towards that. It's not like one big clip event. So you can think about it as every day, we have to work on this. And every day, it's incredibly important that we roll over the temporary prices into permanent prices given the permanent nature of so much of this cost. So we are considering different ways to give you a little bit more insight to that. I'm not going to go into that further yet, other than to say we are having the success as expected with this. We feel it's the right thing, and we feel very good about this plan, and there's still a lot of work we need to focus on, but it's the right plan. It's the right thing to do and we have not been surprised with this at this stage of the year and at this stage of the plan. Sure. So, yes, there's a charter for the business review committee. It's very consistent to what I provided in my comments. Of course, there's a portfolio element. There's a strategy and operations element. And importantly, there's a capital allocation framework. As we communicated before, we had these types of evaluations and communication with our board prior. We now have new Board members. Of course, we have the business review committee as well. So it's a bit more of a formalized process. We are taking full advantage of the insights and experience that all of those board members are bringing to the discussion and the business review committee acts as any other Board committee, where we work and provide insights and advice to the broad Board and make it a bit more of a formal process. But the guardrails are, as I just described there and it's very clear what we work on. As I share it and I lead the agenda, I've, of course, also listened to the committee as to what they believe are the key areas of opportunity, and it's very collaborative and constructive. So from my perspective, we're getting good insight. I think that all of our Board members, but the committee specifically is doing the best we tend to think through the lens of the investor and make sure that we're driving the business, we're evaluating the portfolio. And, of course, we're in a fairly uncertain time, both operationally and from a macroeconomic perspective. We have that filter as well that comes through our work that we evaluate. But nonetheless, we -- as I commented already, we are meeting frequently. We are meeting with urgency, and we're very focused on this. As it relates to the readout, yes, you heard that right, the calendar 2023 -- by the first half of calendar 2023, we will have that Investor Day. And we'll have an update as to what is potential to update at that point in time. And I see this as a journey, not necessarily just a sprint, but we are working with urgency to have as much completed by them as possible. Next question, please. Sure. Yeah. In terms of Medical, it's \u2013 the underlying performance that we are anticipating for the business is really unchanged. The key item we highlighted is the simplification cost that has been wrapped into this. But the underlying business volume utilization, other performance elements are relatively unchanged. There's always puts and takes. Not a lot of new news there for really either business. In both businesses, we had a few non-recurring items, a little bit of timing in medical. But overall, not too many surprises there. As it relates to any type of product shortages, there's always some of that in any of our business. There's a few items that are being chased within the Pharma segment. Nothing that, I would call very unusual and certainly. Nothing at this stage that I would anticipate being a significant impact or really any noticeable impact for the segment for the current quarter or the fiscal year. But that's why we believe that, obviously, just sourcing in general is an incredibly important function, specifically to Generics, it's the Red Oak Sourcing is a huge driver for not just cost control, but for delivery. And certainly, there's been some strong demand for some of those products like amoxicillin that you just referenced for respiratory challenges that we're seeing some drive for in the marketplace. But again, it's something that we don't think will be either lasting or any type of impact for us. Next question, please. Yes. So those types of comments are very consistent with what we've been saying in the last couple of quarters. So we have seen destocking of our customers' inventory. We are very close with them and have that dialogue all the time and that is what we have been seeing. We referenced in our comments that our volume, specifically to PPE, but even more broadly is fairly consistent sequentially from Q4 of last year to Q1 of this year. So we're not seeing significant changes in the poll, but we did call this out last quarter because it was a fairly significant reduction we saw sequentially at the latter end of fiscal 2022. So the concept we absolutely have referenced ourselves and have seen, but we have seen pretty consistent demand patterns here this last quarter. And while it's still very early in Q2, I can say that we haven't seen anything significantly different so far at the beginning of this quarter as well. But there's really nothing else to add at this point. So I think that's the final -- final question. So I'll just end it with just a couple of closing comments here. I'll end where I began my comments this morning that I am pleased with the progress that we're making in our core business fundamentals. We are driving lasting improvements in both segments while maintaining a relentless focus on shareholder value creation. So with that, thank you, and have a great day."

With that, I will now turn the call over to Jason.\nJason Hollar: Thanks Matt and good morning everyone. Fiscal year \u201924 marked a year of strong operational execution and record financial results for Cardinal Health, delivered in tandem with significant strategic progress across the portfolio. On that note, we have three key headlines today. First, we finished the year with momentum, growing EPS 29% in both Q4 and fiscal year \u201924. Our results exceeded guidance and full-year EPS of $7.53 was $0.96 above the midpoint of our original outlook from investor day. We also delivered nearly $4 billion of adjusted free cash flow for the year, positioning us with approximately $5 billion of cash at year end, even after $1.25 billion of capital returned to shareholders this year and funding our growth investments. Second, we have managed through the transition of a significant customer and are raising our guidance for fiscal year \u201925, while also reconfirming our long term financial targets. Finally, we continue to advance our strategy to build upon the growth and resiliency of pharma and specialty, execute our GMPD improvement plan, and accelerate our growth in key areas while optimizing our portfolio to maximize shareholder value creation. More on that momentarily, but first some brief reflections. This year, we continue to take decisive actions to simplify our business and drive performance, highlighted by the reorganization of our operating and segment reporting structure to enhance management focus while enabling efficiencies, accountability and transparency. We grew our largest and most significant business, pharmaceutical and specialty solutions, above our targeted long term growth rate. We saw ongoing stability in pharmaceutical demand, strong performance from our generics program, and our specialty business grew revenue 14% for the year. As of fiscal year \u201924, our specialty business is now over $36 billion and we anticipate continued growth next year despite a large contract expiration. We prioritize key growth areas in specialty with organic investments across therapeutic areas and the acquisition of specialty networks. In GMPD, we executed our improvement plan initiatives, returning the business to profitability and delivering approximately $240 million in year-over-year segment profit improvement. Notably, we achieved our year-end inflation mitigation target, a critical milestone for the business. Across our other operating businesses, we collectively grew revenue 12% and segment profit 7% in fiscal year \u201924. We\u2019ve seen strong demand across nuclear, at-home solutions and OptiFreight, and our purposeful investments and focus on performance excites us about how these businesses are positioned for the future. Overall, these results were achieved through our team\u2019s commitment to execute against a focused set of priorities to create value for our shareholders, our customers, and ultimately for millions of patients. As we turn the page to fiscal year \u201925, our confidence is reinforced by our strong and resilient business with positive industry trends supporting our growth, and we continue to take actions to optimize not only the performance of our businesses but also the financial strength of the broader enterprise. Before I hand the call over to Aaron, let me provide an update on our business and portfolio review which, as a reminder, kicked off in September of 2022. Last June, we concluded our review of the former pharma segment highlighted at investor day with our enhanced organizational focus on specialty and decision to retain and further and invest in our nuclear and precision health solutions business. Then in January, we finalized our review of the growth businesses within the former medical segment, determining the best course of action for shareholder value creation was to invest in and further develop at-home solutions and OptiFreight for long term growth, while also completing our re-segmentation. All along, management in collaboration with the business review committee and board has been reviewing GMPD from every angle as the team executes our turnaround plan. We deeply understand the business\u2019 opportunities and complexities and today have some preliminary conclusions to share through the lens of our portfolio review framework, as seen on Slide 20. In short, we remain committed to executing the GMPD improvement plan and our fiscal year \u201926 target of $300 million in segment profits. We were pleased and unsurprised to see significant interest in GMPD during our review. The business is core to the operations of so many healthcare providers and features not only our formidable distribution expertise but a broad set of Cardinal Health brand products that are critical to patient care. Following our extensive review, we have gained confidence that we are best positioned to continue capitalizing on the meaningful growth and operational opportunities on the horizon for this business. Ultimately, we see more value creation potential ahead for our shareholders by continuing to drive the GMPD turnaround plan. Even more, our analysis uncovered additional opportunities to unlock near term value through further simplification actions and working capital improvements while continuing to drive the plan. From these initiatives, we plan to generate at least $500 million in cash over the next two years to be deployed according to our disciplined capital allocation framework. In recognition, we\u2019re raising our share repurchase expectations for fiscal year \u201925 to a total of $750 million, which is beyond our $500 million baseline. In terms of the mechanics of future reviews as the business continues to improve, the business review committee of our board sunset in July as planned, and the ongoing value creation efforts are now being overseen by the board as a whole. As always, we take a thorough, objective and open-minded approach focused on maximizing long term shareholder value creation while continuing to invest in the business to ensure that our customers receive the products and service they expect. I\u2019ll go deeper into our strategic plans for our segments later in my remarks, but first let me turn it over to Aaron to review our results and guidance.\nAaron Alt: Thank you Jason, and good morning. Before discussing our Q4 success and our raised guidance, I want to highlight that today, we are providing revised prior period financials for fiscal year \u201922 through Q3 fiscal year \u201924, reflecting slight net increases to non-GAAP EPS. During the preparation of our annual financial statements, management identified a longstanding accounting error in part of our at-home solutions business related to revenue recognition from third party payors. As a result, we have corrected this item in prior periods and also updated the timing of other previously recognized immaterial out-of-period items across the full enterprise. The net impact of these changes increases non-GAAP EPS by $0.07 in fiscal year \u201924, $0.06 in fiscal year \u201923, and $0.01 in fiscal year \u201922. To be helpful, we\u2019ve included supplemental schedules in our press release along with further detail in our fiscal year \u201924 10-K. Moving to our results, I am pleased to reinforce that Q4 produced a strong finish to a year in which the Cardinal team made tremendous progress against our financial and strategic priorities. For both Q4 and the year, our EPS results reached historical high points with operating profit growth across pharma, GMPD and other, also supported by improvements below the line in the form of lower interest costs, better tax rates, and lower share count. We delivered strong gross margin growth and matched it with well controlled SG&A, even in an inflationary environment. In Q4, revenue increased 12% to $59.9 billion, reflecting revenue growth in the pharmaceutical and specialty solutions segment, the GMPD segment, and in all of the businesses making up other. Gross margin grew 5% to $1.9 billion, outpacing consolidated SG&A which increased only 2% to $1.3 billion in the quarter, reflecting our disciplined cost management. This translated to total company operating earnings of $605 million, up 14% versus last year. Below the line, interest and other improved $6 million versus prior year to $10 million, benefiting from the quarter\u2019s strong cash outperformance. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate finished at 24.6%, 4.5 percentage points lower than the prior year. Fourth quarter average diluted shares outstanding were 245 million, 4% lower than a year ago due to our previously announced share repurchases. The net result was fourth quarter EPS of $1.84, growth of 29%. Moving into our segment results, beginning with the pharma segment on Slide 11, fourth quarter revenue increased 13% to $55.6 billion, driven by brand and specialty pharmaceutical sales growth from existing customers. We continue to see broad-based strength in pharmaceutical demand spanning across product categories: brand, specialty, consumer health and generics, and from our largest customers. Excluding GLP-1 sales, the segment\u2019s Q4 revenue growth would be 9%. As we have commented previously, GLP-1 sales do not meaningful contribute to the bottom line. Segment profit increased 8% to $482 million in the fourth quarter, driven by positive generics program performance. Within our generics program, we continue to see volume growth and consistent market dynamics, including strong performance from Red Oak. Pharma segment profit growth in the quarter was 8% despite an approximate $15 million margin headwind related to the unwind of the previously announced large customer transition. This unanticipated impact in the quarter was the primary difference between pharma\u2019s Q4 results and the midpoint of our prior guidance. Recall that we\u2019d previously observed that the impact of the contract loss would be offset by new customers, specialty networks, and cost controls as part of our contingency planning. Consistent with these mitigation plans, the team began implementing cost control measures and started to see offsetting savings. We also saw strong growth from biopharma solutions in the quarter, including contributions from specialty networks. Turning to the GMPD segment on Slide 12, we are quite pleased by the Q4 GMPD results which confirmed our team\u2019s continued progress against the GMPD improvement plan. Fourth quarter revenue grew 2% to $3.1 billion, driven by volume growth from existing customers. We again saw growth in Cardinal brand volumes during the quarter. GMPD delivered Q4 segment profit of $47 million, generally consistent with our expectations and our prior guidance of approximately $65 million for the year before the prior period revisions. The $40 million year-over-year increase in Q4 was driven by an improvement in net inflationary impacts, including our mitigation initiatives as we achieved our target of offsetting the gross impact of inflation by the end of fiscal year \u201924. We continue to be encouraged by the tenacity of the team in driving improved execution in customer satisfaction and service levels while identifying additional opportunities to optimize the business. Finishing with the businesses that aggregate into other, as seen on Slide 13, fourth quarter revenue increased 15% to $1.2 billion, driven by growth across all three businesses: at-home solutions, nuclear and precision health solutions, and OptiFreight logistics. Segment profit grew 11% to $111 million primarily driven by the performance of OptiFreight logistics. The OptiFreight business continues to hit on all cylinders as increasing customer demand for our logistics management services is met with strong execution. In nuclear and at-home solutions, we continue to invest strategically to supercharge growth. All three businesses as key parts of our growth story have received and will receive going forward access to capital for expansion of their business models in support of our customers. I will be brief on the full-year commentary. Fiscal \u201924 revenue increased 11% to $227 billion, with growth from all five operating segments. Gross margin increased 8% to $7.4 billion while SG&A increased a more modest 4% to $5 billion, reflecting our year-long efforts to control costs. Together, this resulted in fiscal \u201924 total operating earnings growth of 16% to $2.4 billion. All-in, it was an excellent year across the business. Below the line, interest and other decreased 52% to $42 million, driven by increased interest income on cash and equivalents. Our annual effective tax rate finished at 21.7%. Average diluted shares outstanding were 247 million, 6% lower than a year ago due to share repurchases. The net result was fiscal \u201924 non-GAAP EPS of $7.53, growth of 29%, well above our long term target of 12% to 14% growth. Now before I turn to fiscal \u201925, let\u2019s cover the balance sheet. For fiscal \u201924, our ending cash balance was $5.1 billion. The cash position includes $200 million earmarked for the November 2024 debt maturity, with an additional $200 million to be paid through the time deposits held in prepaid assets and other on the balance sheet. To get there, we generated robust adjusted free cash flow, nearly $4 billion in fiscal year \u201924. Recall that at our investor day last June, I commented that cash flow remained an area of opportunity for us. Our excellent adjusted free cash flow result in 2024 was almost entirely a result of the team\u2019s year-long effort to optimize each element of our working capital while remaining focused on our service levels. To a much lesser degree, the results reflect balanced preparation for the Q1 contract expiration, which has now occurred in July largely as we expected. We attribute only a couple of hundred million dollars of our fiscal \u201924 cash flow to beneficial timing related to the large contract unwind. I\u2019ll talk about the impact of the contract unwind on cash flow shortly as part of our guidance. Also this year, we strengthened our balance sheet and achieved our targeted leverage ratio, which resulted in three positive outlook updates from the credit rating agencies. We also continued to deploy capital in a shareholder-friendly manner, returning more than our baseline commitment of capital returned to shareholders through $750 million of share repurchases and $500 million in dividend payments, and we increased our dividend for the 35th year in a row. Now let\u2019s look forward and discuss our updated fiscal \u201925 guidance on Slide 15. Today, we are increasing our fiscal \u201925 EPS guidance to a new range of $7.55 to $7.70. This is an increase from the preliminary guidance during our Q3 call of at least $7.50. Slide 16 shows our fiscal \u201925 outlook for pharma. On revenue, we expect a decline between 4% and 6%, reflecting the nearly $40 billion revenue headwind from the large customer contract expiration. Normalizing for the large customer, fiscal \u201925 revenue growth would be between 15% and 18%. This reflects underlying growth generally consistent with our long-term targeted rate of 10% due to strong overall pharmaceutical demand, as well as significant growth from the on-boarding of new customers and existing customer expansions, primarily in the second half of the year. We are on track to address the segment profit impact of the large contract expiration with this incremental volume, contributions from specialty networks, and additional operational efficiencies. Note that all three of these offsets will have some level of a ramp to them throughout our fiscal \u201925. We expect consistent market dynamics for our generics program to continue. We also expect increased contributions from brand and specialty products, including biosimilars. We are assuming a modest year-over-year headwind related to the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. On brand manufacturer price increases, we expect an environment generally consistent with the past several years. Summing it all up, we anticipate pharma segment profit growth in the range of 1% to 3%, a testament to the strength and resiliency of this business. It is the case that segment profit growth will be more back half-weighted than usual. We expect first half segment profit to be slightly lower to flat versus the prior year, with profit growth in the back half. Q3 should again be the highest absolute dollar profit quarter for the business. Turning to GMPD on Slide 17, on the top line we expect growth between 3% and 5%, aided by low single digit utilization growth as well as incremental volume from the on-boarding of net new distribution customer wins. On the bottom line, we are reiterating our expectation of approximately $175 million in segment profit for fiscal year \u201925, on our path to approximately $300 million in segment profit by fiscal year \u201926 by executing the GMPD improvement plan. The plan is unchanged from what we shared a quarter ago. After successfully offsetting inflation at the end of this year, the annualization of these benefits will be a fiscal year \u201925 tailwind. The team remains focused on continuing to drive Cardinal brand growth through our five-point plan. In fiscal year \u201925, we expect Cardinal brand sales growth between 3% and 5%. Simplification and cost optimization also continue with further opportunities in the pipeline to drive efficiencies and streamline our operations. Recognizing that while GMPD\u2019s plan may be simple, that does not make it easy. We once again expect a back half-weighted profit year in fiscal \u201925, just like fiscal \u201924. The quarterly cadence will be driven by seasonality and the ongoing commercial and operational improvements in the business. Additionally, we expect unfavorable manufacturing cost timing in the first half of the year, which unlike last year includes some start-up costs and timing associated with expanding production at Cardinal Health-owned domestic manufacturing plants to enhance our supply chain resiliency. Q1 should be the low point of the year due to these factors. Last year\u2019s updated Q1 shows $12 million of profit, and this year we expect Q1 to increase to up to $20 million, with sequential improvements thereafter. Turning to other on Slide 18, for each of nuclear, at-home solution and OptiFreight, we expect profit to be aided by the continued strength in demand, execution of our growth strategies, and benefits from our increased prioritization of these businesses with investments. Collectively, we expect revenue growth in the range of 10% to 12% and segment profit growth of approximately 10%, with all three businesses contributing to these targets. Stepping back, we are pleased to see anticipated profit growth across all of our operating segments in fiscal year \u201925. Moving below the line, we expect interest and other in the range of $140 million to $170 million. The large year-over-year increase continues to be driven by lower average cash balances, lower short term investment rates on our cash, and higher rates on our debt resulting from the refinancing of our calendar 2024 maturities. We continue to expect our fiscal year \u201925 effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 24%. With our near term GMPD value creation initiatives, we have increased our fiscal year \u201925 share repurchase expectations beyond our baseline to $750 million on the year, leading to a share count guidance of approximately 243 million shares. Finally, we expect fiscal year \u201925 adjusted free cash flow of approximately $1 billion, reflecting the Q1 negative impacts from the large contract unwind as well as quarter and day of the week timing. While these dynamics will significantly affect our cash flow in Q1, our strong investment-grade balance sheet positions us well to manage through these fluctuations and continue making strategic investments in the business consistent with our disciplined capital allocation framework. To close, fiscal year \u201924 was a standout year filled with notable milestones. With adjusted EPS growth of 29% and adjusted free cash flow of nearly $4 billion, the Cardinal team delivered. With six weeks of fiscal \u201925 behind us, I\u2019m pleased to say that the team is managing adeptly. Between the leaders we have throughout the organization, our dedicated team working tirelessly to serve our customers, and our clear strategy, we are confident that we will deliver once again. With that, I will turn it back over to Jason.\nJason Hollar: Thanks Aaron. Now I\u2019ll go deeper into our strategic priorities, beginning with pharma and specialty solutions, where we remain focused on building upon our strong core foundation and expanding in specialty. Everything we do starts with the customer. Recently we hosted our 32nd annual retail business conference, the largest in the industry, bringing together 5,000 attendees from across the country. As the trusted partner to retail pharmacy, we understand the critical role retail independent pharmacies play in caring for their communities as they continue to expand their services as community healthcare destinations and demonstrate their remarkable value and resiliency. We continue to invest in our full suite of clinical, business and reimbursement solutions to support our customers and provide industry advocacy to empower retail pharmacy, now and into the future. Our consumer health logistics center slated to open in 2025 will offer a comprehensive selection of over-the-counter medications, treatments and diagnostic solutions. Additionally, our new vaccine alliance program offers cost savings and other benefits from participating manufacturers to help pharmacies engage more patients and expand their immunization programs. We are constantly evaluating ways to bring innovative solutions to our pharmacy and manufacturer partners through the breadth of our offerings and capabilities. As part of that commitment and in collaboration with CVS Health, we have formed Averon, a joint venture to source biosimilars. Averon builds upon our company\u2019s successful partnerships like Red Oak Sourcing with similar overall objectives for biosimilars. Simply put, we are increasing access to additional therapy options that will provide more choice for patients at a lower cost. Averon began by contracting a couple of products, including Humira biosimilars, and we see opportunities for the program to expand over time. Continuing in specialty, we\u2019re pleased with how quickly specialty networks has integrated with our business, and we continue to be impressed with the PPS analytics platform\u2019s insights generation capabilities and the team\u2019s clinical, technology and operational expertise. As expected, we are leveraging specialty networks\u2019 demonstrated capabilities in neurology, the largest area of its fully integrated model, to enhance our offering in oncology. The fully integrated specialty networks market offering is directly aligned with our strategy for Navista, our oncology practice alliance providing advanced technology and services. Over the course of the last year, we\u2019ve built a world-class Navista team consisting of industry experts, defined our offerings and go-to-market strategy, and completed our foundational technology build. The Navista team is engaging with an active pipeline of customers across the oncology marketplace, demonstrating to community oncologists how Navista can help them remain independent for good. Upstream with manufacturers, our leading specialty 3PL has continued its track record of growing faster than market with nearly 20% growth during the year. We\u2019re leveraging these services as part of our comprehensive offering that further facilitates the commercialization and delivery of critical cell and gene therapies to providers and patients. Our new advanced therapy solutions innovation center features a specialized deep frozen storage suite to handle the logistical challenges associated with cell and gene therapies. Additionally, the dedicated space provides opportunities for collaboration and improved process design supporting the ordering, invoicing and accounts receivable process for pharmaceutical products. Across classes of trade, our commitment to service and solutions-oriented commercial approach has resonated with customers. A new health system customer on-boarding that we recently completed and a few in the earlier phases of ramp-up are going smoothly, and we expect over $10 billion in total incremental revenue in fiscal year \u201925 from committed customer wins and expansions. Turning to GMPD, when we originally introduced the former medical improvement plan, we consistently highlighted that the first key to turning around the performance of the business was addressing the significant impact of inflation and global supply chain constraints on our business. Our team got to work with urgency, executing various mitigation actions to cover the significant operating losses we incurred. Fast forward to today, after two years of hard work, the GMPD business is on solid ground. We delivered an approximate $240 million year-over-year improvement in segment profit in fiscal year \u201924. We exited the year successfully offsetting the gross impact of inflation. We\u2019ve seen three consecutive quarters of year-over-year segment revenue growth and four consecutive quarters of Cardinal Health brand volume growth. We grew Cardinal Health brand revenue 3% overall for the year and 4% in the U.S. Our customer loyalty index score for U.S. distribution remains up over 20 points from its pandemic low, and we\u2019re successfully retaining key distribution customers along with some recent wins. As we continue to dive into the business through our portfolio review, it\u2019s clear there are still significant opportunities to capture. I\u2019ll highlight a few. First, as Aaron mentioned, our progress on inflation mitigation in fiscal year \u201924 will annualize and be a significant year-over-year tailwind to our results next year, even with the slight headwind expected from the recent cost increases in international freight. Between the actions we\u2019ve taken to improve our resiliency, the diversity of our global supply chain, and some offsets across our broader portfolio of commodities, we\u2019re confident in our ability to continue to effectively mitigate supply chain inflation. Second, Cardinal Health brand leading indicators remain positive and continue to predict an acceleration in growth. We\u2019ve seen a healthy overall utilization environment for a number of quarters now and our five-point plan continues to produce encouraging results. Third, the disciplined execution of our simplification strategy has driven improved operational performance. With the business stabilized and only recent turned free cash flow positive, we see opportunities to drive targeted working capital improvements over the next two years. Additionally, we can broaden our simplification efforts such as further optimizing our real estate and geographic footprint, while always prioritizing the needs of our customers as our north star. Our team is energized to execute on the next phase of the improvement journey focused on commercial excellence and continued simplification to create additional value for our customers and shareholders. In nuclear and precision health solutions, our leading positioning with 130 nuclear pharmacies and 30 PET sites across the country feeds our differentiated ability to partner with manufacturers in order to bring cutting edge therapies to patients exactly when they need them. Our excitement continues to build around the opportunities to improve patient lives through the use of precision medicine, which we have been investing into heavily with our center for theranostics advancement. We\u2019re seeing the results with our theranostics business growing over 20% in fiscal year \u201924, driven by strong demand for prostate cancer theranostics products such as [indiscernible]. In fiscal year \u201925, we expect similar theranostics growth and will continue to invest to meet the growing pipeline of opportunities, which includes cardiology and neurology, but overall is largely dominated by oncology. As an example, we will be expanding our support of novel prostate radioligand therapies with Novartis\u2019 Pluvicto in fiscal year \u201925. We are also investing in increasing our cyclotron capacity and PET manufacturing geographic footprint to meet increasing demand for PET diagnostics, with a majority of emerging radiotherapeutics requiring a companion PET scan. Fiscal year \u201924 was a foundational year for our $2.9 billion at-home solutions business as we laid the groundwork for future growth and efficiency. This business continues to grow revenue faster than market, not only aided by care moving into the home but also our team\u2019s commercial execution. To drive operating leverage, we\u2019ve been investing our technology capabilities such as new warehouses with state of the art automation. Just last month, we opened our brand-new 350,000 square foot warehouse in South Carolina featuring the fastest order fulfillment system in the market. This system is also operational in our central Ohio facility and planned for the new Texas distribution center we\u2019d previously announced and expect to open in 2025. We\u2019re seeing fruits from our investments with our fill rates currently the highest they\u2019ve been in over three years and our patient net promoter score up over 16% year-over-year. The OptiFreight logistics team delivered this year with exceptional performance. Our TotalVue insights platform continues to help customers uncover shipping inefficiencies and optimize delivery through data-driven insights. As a result, our customer loyalty index is at an all-time high. In fiscal year \u201925, to put it simply, we expect to continue our track record of great execution, helping our customers expand and bringing on new customers to benefit from our program and value. Across the enterprise, we are confident in the Cardinal team to continue our momentum and deliver our targeted growth in fiscal year \u201925 and beyond. Before I wrap up, the former CEO in me can\u2019t help but acknowledge our team\u2019s tremendous progress on cash flow this year. With the record results in fiscal year \u201924, we\u2019re positioned to exceed the adjusted free cash flow expectations we outlined at investor day with at least $7 billion over the fiscal \u201924 to \u201926 period, even despite the large contract expiration. We possess the financial flexibility to continue investing our business, returning capital to shareholders and maximizing long term shareholder value creation. In summary, fiscal year \u201924 was another great year and we are excited to continue driving our company and healthcare forward. I want to thank our dedicated employees who serve our customers and continue our work to be healthcare\u2019s most trusted partner. With that, we will take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you very much, Mr. Hollar. [Operator instructions] Today\u2019s first question is coming from Lisa Gill, calling from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nLisa Gill: Thanks very much, and good morning. Thanks for all the details, Jason. I just want to better understand two things. One, nice driver of the margin going into next year, you had originally said roughly 1%, now you\u2019re talking 1% to 3%. I think you called out a couple of things - the specialty network, new customer, cost mitigation, but I\u2019m just curious, especially in the new customer, is there anything unique about that contract or anything else that you would call out as we think about the margin improvement throughout \u201925?\nAaron Alt: Lisa, good morning, thanks for the question. Happy to talk about it. We are really pleased to raise our guide for the pharma business for fiscal \u201925 - it really reflects our continued confidence in the team and continued confidence in the resiliency of that business, notwithstanding some of the puts and takes that we\u2019ve been talking about over the last couple of quarters. I\u2019ll touch on the profile in a second, but I do want to emphasize on the revenue side of the house from a guidance perspective that we guided down 4% to 6% all-in, reflecting the $40 million headwind on the low margin contract non-renewal, but it\u2019s really up 15% to 18% on an adjusted basis if you take out the impact of that customer loss. Within that 15% to 18% is $10 billion of new revenue, new customers and expansions of service with existing customers - that\u2019s on top of a 10% underlying growth with the existing business, and so from that you can tell that we are growing the portfolio and doing what we said we were going to do with our existing customers and adding on both new customers and expansions with existing customers to get to that revenue base. That supports the increase in guide, the 1% to 3% on the profitability side of the house. The thing we called out during the earnings call is the consistent market dynamics, it\u2019s the generic volume growing, the low single-digit growth in core and the high single-digit growth in specialty, the strong overall Rx demand. There\u2019s a lot of things going on, but we are confident in our plans as we carry forward. Now, we don\u2019t comment on the margin profile of any particular customer, particularly in the context of a new customer, and we were delighted to announce formally the Publix win today in our earnings release. I\u2019m not going to comment on their profitability, but I will observe that we have publicly commented on the low margin nature of the business that we\u2019ve lost, and that certainly doesn\u2019t hurt us as we carry forward. Jason, anything you would add to that?\nJason Hollar: No, nothing to add.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Eric Percher calling from Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nEric Percher: Thank you. I think it\u2019s fair to say there was some concern coming into the quarter on the increase in macro freight trends and other input costs, and I know you mentioned you\u2019re able to offset that. Can you give us a sense of how this looked to you in terms of the size of that increase versus what we\u2019ve seen in the past, was it material, and how it looked under the current or new contracts versus legacy contracts, and the ability to pass that along to your customers?\nJason Hollar: Sure, thanks for the question, Eric. I think it\u2019s important to just go back in time a little bit, this last 12 months. A year ago when we were sitting here, certainly the freight costs had gone all the way back down to historic levels, so we were enjoying--really, the run-up had come all the way back down, and it was the beginning of the calendar year, so in our third quarter when the Red Sea issues first began, and that\u2019s when we saw the first spike, and the reason I remind you of that is that first spike was known come springtime, when we gave our initial guidance for GMPD, and so we knew about that first step-up already, and that\u2019s been factored into the guidance from day one. Yes, there have been further increases since then, but when you look at the combined two increases, the two different steps, first in January, then in the spring, they still are woefully short of where we were a couple of years ago when the whole supply chain was under pressure, where even when we were spending two, three times the current level, we were having difficulty in actually getting reasonable service. So yes, the costs are higher, but not nearly as high as they used to be, and most importantly is the supply chain is functioning a lot more efficiently than it was before. Long way of saying, Eric, that yes, there is a little bit of an increase here, it\u2019s something we monitor and manage very, very tightly, but it\u2019s not the point where it requires widespread price adjustments accordingly, at least not yet. In addition to that, it\u2019s important that we look at the overall inflationary environment, and we talked about this a couple of years ago. At the peak, we had a lot of oil and petroleum-based products, including fuel and other type of freight, that was also a big issue. Those are actually a little bit softer in terms of the cost, so overall net-net, we\u2019re managing through it better than we have before, and overall we have some puts and takes that are all very manageable. We\u2019ll continue to evaluate the pricing necessary within that, but at this stage we haven\u2019t had to exercise that lever to near the extent that we did in the past.\nMatt Sims: Next question, please.\nOperator: Yes, our next question will be coming from Michael Cherny calling from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nMichael Cherny: Good morning and thank you for taking the question. Maybe if I could dive a little bit more into the underlying pharma growth, if you can. You did a good job outlining some of the moving pieces on lost contract versus new. Is there any way you can give us a bit more color on where you expect the profit streams to lie from specialty, and then also a bit more color on the COVID hangover, just so that we can have a better understanding. I guess maybe the simple, straightforward question is where will you be on an exit run rate on pharma growth exiting the year, given all the moving pieces you have to start the year?\nJason Hollar: Yes, let me try to address a few of those pieces. Specialty is absolutely a key part of this story and why we still anticipate being able to grow this business next year. We highlighted in our comments that in fiscal \u201924 for the year, we saw another year of 14% growth. You may recall at our investor day last year, the specialty business CAGR over the prior three years was anticipated at that time to be 14% as well, so another year of strong growth driven by the widespread investments that we have made and continue to make. We talked today about a couple of interesting growth drivers for the future, whether it\u2019s our advanced therapy solutions business, the new venture with CVS for Averson focused on biosimilars. Biosimilars in general has been a rising tide type of benefit over the last several years, and of course then our acquisition of specialty networks, which closed in March and has an eight, nine-month type of year-over-year benefit tailwind, so these are all areas that are driving our specialty business to some degree in fiscal \u201924, but they\u2019re all examples of where we would expect that to continue to grow over fiscal \u201925 to help mitigate for that contract non-renewal, that we think while that growth will be slower in \u201925 due to that. I also made the comment in the remarks that even in spite of this overall revenue reduction for the enterprise for the pharma segment and the impact of that contract non-renewal, we still expect our specialty business to grow in fiscal \u201925 in spite of that. That tells you that our run rate as we lap fiscal \u201925 and that non-renewal, we would anticipate it to be very consistent with the long term algorithm that we\u2019ve highlighted in the past, which from a profit perspective has been defined as low single-digit type of profit growth for our PD core business and double-digit growth for specialty, so we\u2019ll continue to look at other opportunities to invest organically, as well as inorganically to continue to feed that growth.\nMatt Sims: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question today will be coming from Erin Wright calling from Morgan Stanley.\nErin Wright: Great, thanks. In terms of the fiscal \u201925 guide, are there any changes in terms of how you were thinking just the Optum unwind in terms of stranded costs or otherwise, and just given the building contributions, whether it\u2019s specialty networks or the new customer win with that Optum offset, I guess, how should we think about that cadence in terms of the split of first half versus second half, or however you want to define it, on an EPS perspective, given some of those moving pieces in the first half? Thanks.\nJason Hollar: Yes, I\u2019ll have Aaron walk through some of the cadence [indiscernible], to your question, but I wanted to stress just upfront, what you should have heard from these messages are very, very similar words and phrases that we used last quarter. The plan is unchanged. Of course, we get a little bit smarter, we sharpen our pencils a little bit and we get a better understanding of where our exit rate is for \u201924, but all the factors that we are talking about today with this business are very similar to what we walked through in the past, and of course all the investments that we made this last year. Aaron, a few thoughts on the cadence?\nAaron Alt: Sure, so the way to think about it is Optum was an existing customer with us until the end of our Q4, and you can see the results in Q4, we don\u2019t need to go deeper on that. But what did also happen in Q4 was us being incredibly planful around the impacts to our operations, as well as to our financials of that customer unwind. We\u2019ve talked in the past and we talked during our last earnings call around the three offsetting actions, the contribution of specialty networks, of course the new customer win, the expansion with existing customers as well as further cost optimization opportunities, and we\u2019re pleased the team got on it, got ahead of it, and they\u2019ve already been executing in that respect, and so the guidance we\u2019re able to provide today, we view as relatively consistent with what we\u2019ve provided in Q3, but with an additional degree of confidence because the plans are behind us and now we\u2019re acting in that way. The non-renewal will impact our Q1- there\u2019s no way to avoid that. They were a large, low margin customer, and as we\u2019ve talked about, the new customers coming on board are largely back half-loaded, and so we will have a timing difference relative to prior years and that will impact certainly our revenue and profitability timing over the course of the year. There\u2019s also a cash impact, right? The unwind of the negative working capital position there is a Q1 impact for us and a key reason why we are carefully monitoring our cash flow during the first quarter, of course balanced with the fact that we are delighted with the strong adjusted free cash flow and the strong cash balance at the end of our Q4. Look - on balance, the cost optimization is already in play, specialty networks is already in play, and we continue to work on the customer expansions and the new customer on-boarding, and we will make that successful as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today will be coming from Allen Lutz calling from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAllen Lutz: Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. One for Aaron. Can you talk about how gross profit performed relative to your internal model, and then are you seeing any impact from insulin pricing changes or Humira share shifts to gross profit dollar growth? Then are there any insights or thoughts around a biosimilar launch for Stelara? Thanks.\nAaron Alt: I\u2019ll start. Look, I would observe that our gross margin progression went largely as we anticipated over the course of the quarter and the year. We have a very complicated business managing between the various parts, and no real surprises from my chair in that way. The second part of the question was--?\nJason Hollar: Yes, let me take that. It was related to, I think, just the general impact of insulin pricing, but there\u2019s also the Humira element there, so it\u2019s probably a couple different questions. Within the quarter, we did, as Aaron had highlighted before, we saw of course the ongoing benefit of the GLP-1 growth, but we did have a similar offset as it relates to the pricing change for the WAC insulin adjustments that happened at the beginning of the calendar year. Until we get through the second quarter of fiscal \u201925, we\u2019d anticipate there to be a bit of an offset related to that price change. There was also a question around Humira and, I assume, just the biosimilar type of migration. We see that it\u2019s started to move a little bit more. Certainly some of the actions that CVS has done more broadly in the marketplace seem to have moved things along a little bit further. It\u2019s still fairly low penetration throughout the broad industry, but generally speaking, we have seen that start to pick up a little bit, I wouldn\u2019t say meaningfully, within the quarter, maybe a little bit even afterwards, but it\u2019s still at fairly low penetration rates. It\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019re so focused on biosimilars and with our joint venture with Averon, is just to continue to look for ways to increase access for patients that need that therapy at an affordable cost, so we\u2019ll continue to do our part there. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question today will be coming from Kevin Caliendo of UBS. Please go ahead.\nKevin Caliendo: Thanks for taking my question. I\u2019m just trying to triangulate some of the things we\u2019ve learned this quarter about the GMPD business. You\u2019re talking about winning more share of pocket. We\u2019re seeing you make investments in domestic plants, we\u2019ve seen shipping costs go higher. At the same time, we\u2019ve seen Owens & Minor and Medline put up stronger than expected results, and McKesson and Henry Schein put up worse than expected results and guide lower in those segments. Is it maybe fair to say that you and your peers on the hospital side are moving downstream at all to try to capture greater percentage of the health system business that\u2019s not just in the acute care side? Is that a trend that\u2019s happening, and I guess the second part of that is the investments in domestic driven by the idea that now you could be more--because shipping costs are higher, costs overseas, tariffs are coming, that the domestic manufacturing can be more competitive in a price basis versus importing?\nJason Hollar: Yes, so it\u2019s certainly true that GMPD is more acute focused customers, and we do benefit from the migration towards more of an ASC model. We do not participate widely in physician offices, so that\u2019s an element. It\u2019s nothing that we\u2019ve called out as broad trends, so I don\u2019t have much more to go on there, other than on a same store sales basis, we\u2019re seeing the utilization fairly consistent this past year, generally speaking, that low single-digit type of range, so we are seeing that there\u2019s like-for-like growth. What we\u2019ve highlighted fairly consistently is that this last year was--or the end of \u201923, beginning of \u201924 was the inflection point for us. We were not growing with the market at that point. Over the course of \u201924, we\u2019ve largely grown with the market, plus or minus a point here or there, so very consistent with that low single-digit type of growth over--especially after our first quarter. We don\u2019t think there\u2019s widespread shifts there, but we definitely have an ASC presence that we do think we benefit from, but I wouldn\u2019t call that a main driver of what we\u2019re looking at. In terms of the investments we\u2019re making, we did call out some domestic investments, but they\u2019re not limited to domestic. We believe in a very diversified, competitive geographic footprint. We\u2019ve stressed that specifically we don\u2019t have manufacturing, direct manufacturing in China - that\u2019s one of the related questions here as it relates to certainly the ongoing tariff risk, and I can also let you know that we only source less than 10% of our total Cardinal Health branded product in China, so specifically to China, we don\u2019t have a large exposure. But we do have exposure beyond China, and Asia and near-shore Central, South America, we believe a diversified, broad supply base is important, as well as a domestic footprint. We have increased our investments across the supply chain to improve the resiliency, and there\u2019s a couple of areas within the U.S. specifically - you\u2019ve seen some of the tariffs related to syringes is a specific area of focus, and we happen to have that capability in the United States. That\u2019s just one example of where we\u2019re really doubling down on that investment. So yes, costs and freight are always a consideration - you know, we build a financial model behind all that and we look at the risks, but on this particular example, one example of where we\u2019re really leaning in on that investment, that\u2019s more about just ensuring our customers get the product they need. This is more of a volume opportunity than a pure cost and margin opportunity, so you\u2019ve got to look at all those factors. Next question, please.\nOperator: Yes sir. The next question today will be coming from Eric Coldwell of Baird. Please go ahead.\nEric Coldwell: Thank you very much. I wanted to ask quickly about Medicaid disenrollment and the extent you\u2019ve seen impacts in consumer or channel behavior as a result of that, and if so, could you specify where and possibly quantify those impacts? I think specifically, I\u2019m probably tagging onto Kevin\u2019s question and wondering if some of the shifts we\u2019re seeing in the medical segment could be related to roughly 25 million people coming off of Medicaid here in the last several months. Thank you very much.\nJason Hollar: Yes, thanks for the question, Eric. Again, I think my answer is going to be fairly similar to what I said before, but in a different context. We have a very broad base of customers, very broad base of payors behind those customers, so we don\u2019t have necessarily even the insight all the time as to where those reimbursements are coming from. The same store sales type of information, what we see more broadly is just not a lot of fluctuations and variations, and we\u2019re not talking again of any type of growth rate above and beyond what we believe that underlying utilization is. Generally speaking, if there are some of those trends, at this stage I\u2019m not seeing that as a meaningful driver to where our business is going.\nMatt Sims: Next question please.\nOperator: Yes sir, our next question today will be coming from George Hill calling in from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Hill: Hey, good morning guys, thanks for taking the question. A two-parter. Number one, I guess Aaron, would you be willing to provide any more color on earnings cadence expectations for the year, particularly Q1 and Q2 versus the back half, given the large number of moving pieces? Then a quick one for Jason is we know you\u2019ve got the new business coming on, we\u2019ve got the United loss. Would just love an update on the competitive environment in drug distribution. This has been a pretty stable space for a while now. Just want to make sure that nothing\u2019s changed, or nothing should be changing in the dynamic that we should be aware of. Thanks.\nAaron Alt: I\u2019ll start. I would just observe that we\u2019re being very thoughtful in the planning we\u2019re doing for the year, given the number of moving pieces we have both within the pharma business and within the GMPD business, and of course keeping an eye on the three growth businesses within other. Within pharma, what we\u2019ve reference is first half from a cadence perspective will be slightly down to flat versus prior year. That\u2019s only natural given the customer unwind and the back ended nature of the new customer on-boarding. Largely, the drivers within the pharma business are consistent with what would have been true in previous years - Q3 will be where we see the branded inflation rolling through, and so not a lot of different news there that I would call out. From a med perspective, we\u2019re very focused on executing against the plan. We\u2019ve tried to be transparent every quarter about how we\u2019re doing and where we see it going, which is why we were purposeful in calling out Q1 specifically as we push ahead. We\u2019ve had great success during fiscal year \u201925 and accomplished what we told you we were going to do, and we plan to do that again. Just want to be clear that we are investing in the business and there are some near term Q1 drivers that will make that rough number, what we call the up to $20 million as we carry forward. There\u2019s no magic here, though - I want to be clear. The plan and the cadence is generally consistent with how we\u2019ve described the GMPD improvement plan in the past. Of course, we have the benefit of the inflation mitigation now lapping as we push ahead, and of course we can\u2019t forget the important topic of seasonality from a Q4 to Q1 perspective - we\u2019ve called that out before, and that\u2019s why you see a dip from the great results in Q4 into Q1.\nJason Hollar: As it relates to the second question, I\u2019ll say what I said before - we\u2019re 1% industry, so it\u2019s competitive but stable. I would say that the vast majority of contracts don\u2019t change hands period to period. These couple, several that have that more notable, there\u2019s been several that have long term five-year types of agreements, so every five years there is the chance, opportunity or risk for that to occur, but again I\u2019ll just stress the vast majority don\u2019t. We feel really good about our positioning, competitive positioning. We know we\u2019re competitive, we know that our message and our work and our results resonate with our customers. We\u2019re very much focused on that experience, the service levels, the value initiatives and propositions behind it, the tools and platforms. We\u2019ve talked about our InteLogix and our Atrix platforms for health systems as one example of not just going at them with price but going at them with value, and having true value components to those offerings, and we feel really good about where that positioning is, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been able to offset to the degree that we have.\nMatt Sims: Next question please.\nOperator: Yes sir, the next question will be coming from Stephanie Davis of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nAnna Grasinsky: Hi guys. This is Anna Grasinsky [ph] on for Stephanie. Congrats on the quarter, and thank you for taking our questions.  I was hoping to hear more about your AI road map. You\u2019ve highlighted AI and machine learning deployments within the InteLogix platform, and just wondering how we should think about additional AI use cases to improve efficiency and potential cost savings.\nJason Hollar: Yes, thanks for the question. It\u2019s broad-based, it\u2019s varied. We don\u2019t call it out in every call in all areas, but it\u2019s so broad, it really is everywhere. It\u2019s in the core of how we operate. Examples of what we talked about today, without using the phrase AI, especially networks - you know, their PPS analytics is a great example of taking that data, electronic medical records and synthesizing that for manufacturers, as well as providers, and getting actionable insights. I mean, that is AI. When you look at some of the automation I\u2019m commented on in our at-home solutions network, this is now over 25% of our sites just in the last 12 to 18 months. We\u2019re launching a new footprint that is bringing in technology and automation in various forms into the manufacturing--or I\u2019m sorry, into the distribution setting to be even more innovative, even more efficient and productive. As you mentioned, those other platforms, InteLogix, Atrix, working with Palantir and other partners to create value, and then I\u2019m not even getting into the more basic use cases like customer service and back office. I guess I don\u2019t want to just hit the same drumbeat everyone else is. What we\u2019re trying to do in our communication is get beyond the buzzwords and really talk about the essence of where we\u2019re driving our business, and we feel really good about that, and it\u2019s definitely [indiscernible].\nMatt Sims: Next question, please.\nOperator: Yes sir, we\u2019ll now move to Elizabeth Anderson calling from Evercore. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nElizabeth Anderson: Hey guys, thanks so much for the questions. I was wondering if you could maybe expand on your prior comments about two things. One, you talked about customer expansions a couple of times across the course of the call. Can you talk about what those are - generally speaking, are they people moving from pharma to increase in medical, are they moving across different pharma categories? How do we think about that? Then if we think about the cost cutting, obviously there\u2019s some right-sizing for the contract change that you guys mentioned, but how do we think about some of the more--it sounds like some of those changes you\u2019re putting through are sort of more structural, so how do we think about the long term benefits of those going forward? Thanks.\nJason Hollar: Yes, I\u2019ll start. On the customer expansions, these are existing customer relationships where we are already a primary distributor for them, and they are expanding their footprint, whether it\u2019s acquisitions or just taking on more of the business themselves, and we\u2019re supporting their growth, so it\u2019s an existing relationship and expanding upon that, so it\u2019s committed in that sense, where we\u2019re already there, and you can use BioPlus as one of the examples of what I\u2019m talking about there. Perhaps Aaron, you can go into a little bit more detail on the [indiscernible]?\nAaron Alt: Sure, so as I commented earlier, the team did a great job of assessing our opportunities in the face of the customer non-renewal, but I guess I would go back and point out that at the end of the day, we operate a 1% operating margin business, so it\u2019s important for us to always be mindful of the cost structure around us, but with a north star of how do we continue to ensure our customer service. We have been pleased that the reviews we undertook during Q4, the actions we identified will help us to offset the near term impact of customer loss, but more importantly they create a more efficient operational structure for us, and the changes are broad ranging across the enterprise with that north star ensuring we continue our customer service focus as we push ahead. Many of the changes have already been implemented and we\u2019re operating in that new framework already. We continue to assess what are the productive opportunities, and I also would emphasize that the ideas for these changes are coming from our broader teams as they look around and say, okay, how can we operate better in support of our existing customers and the new customers on the line.\nMatt Sims: Next question please.\nOperator: Yes sir, we\u2019ll now move to Stephen Baxter of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nStephen Baxter: Yes, hi. Thanks. I just wanted to ask a couple about the restatement to GMPD. It sounds like you\u2019re saying the higher GMPD base post-restatement in 2024 doesn\u2019t\u2019 change the run rate, because you\u2019re removing out-of-period items. Is that the right way to think about it, so there\u2019s no comparability issue with the $175 million target on that higher base? I guess that\u2019s the first question. Then based on the restatement that you provided, I think the cumulative profit in the business from 2022 to 2024 is $25 million or $30 million higher than previous. I\u2019m just trying to understand why those things don\u2019t net out if we\u2019re thinking about timing issues here. Thank you.\nAaron Alt: Yes, appreciate the question. The answer is there is no comparability issue. The 175 is unimpacted by the revisions that we provided in the financials today. The revisions we provided were for the three-year period. There will be--there is an impact of shifting of income or expense into the prior periods as well, which is why you\u2019re not seeing direct comparability as we carry forward. I do want to emphasize, though, that part of our operation here is building and maintaining a strong [indiscernible] environment, and as we identified the issue in the Edgepark part of our at-home business, which is part of other, it was a revenue recognition issue tied to a business which does less than half a percent of our overall revenue base. We were careful to do the right thing and disclose, and at the same time in partnership with our auditors decided that we would reflect the feedback we\u2019ve gotten from this community and others around comments around non-recurring adjustments in prior periods, etc., and so now we walk into fiscal \u201925 not only with comparability but with a clean set of financials, unimpacted by timing to be able to talk about our progress as we carry forward.\nMatt Sims: Next question please.\nOperator: Yes sir, the next question will be coming from Charles Rhyee with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nLucas : Hi, this is Lucas on for Charles. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask about the other segment. Can you talk about what\u2019s expected from OptiFreight, nuclear and at-home in fiscal \u201925 in terms of growth? Should we be thinking about any of these businesses outperforming the 10% segment target that you\u2019ve set?\nAaron Alt: Well from a guidance perspective, we provide guidance for other on an aggregated basis, but I do want you to take away the enthusiasm present in Jason\u2019s comments and his tone of voice around the opportunity we think that each of these three businesses presents to Cardinal Health as we carry forward. The businesses are unique. They are managed differently. We aggregate them from a financial perspective. It\u2019s also the case that we are investing in each of those businesses, we have in \u201924 and we are in \u201925. At-home has recently opened two new distribution points and is investing in automation. OptiFreight has continued to invest in its digital platform and service of its customer experience. The nuclear business, we\u2019ve talked at length about expanding the PET network as well as our excitement about the theranostic opportunities that that business presents. Again, as I go back to the financial guide, part of what you\u2019re seeing in the other basis is we are presenting a consistent picture on an aggregated view, which reflects in some cases we\u2019ll be investing in a year or a month while reaping the benefit in the same year or month from other parts of the portfolio. Jason?\nJason Hollar: Yes, I would say the one thing we did clarify in the prior comments is that all three businesses are expected to contribute to that growth in fiscal \u201925, and we are investing--you know, fiscal \u201924 was an especially heavy investment period, but we are continuing to invest across the range. Just one example to put into perspective is we talked a lot about our investments in our nuclear and precision health solutions business. This is a business that we\u2019ve highlighted, theranostics now just with our second phase of expansion that we announced about a year ago, or this last year, and then we also have talked about some PET expansion. From a fiscal \u201924 to \u201926, that\u2019s about $100 million, mainly capital that we\u2019re investing into that business, but it\u2019s representative of the big investments that we\u2019re making in addition to the three different distribution centers in at-home solutions that Aaron had mentioned are very representative of the inputs that we\u2019re putting into these businesses, because we deeply believe in their ability to continue to grow, benefit from the secular trends they each enjoy, but then also reflecting the leadership position we have in each, and that is then further bolstered by these very specific investments.\nMatt Sims: Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you sir. Ladies and gentlemen, our last question today will be coming from Daniel Grosslight of Citi. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Grosslight: Hi, thanks for taking the question, and congrats on a strong quarter. Was hoping to get a bit more detail on Averon. Will that just be serving CVS at this point, and how does that kind of interact with Cordavis, and then are there any purchase obligations or quarterly payments associated with that? Then lastly, when does that agreement renew?\nAaron Alt: Okay, so you crammed in about four there. Averon, the first specific question on Averon was--?\nJason Hollar: Just broadly speaking, more color.\nJason Hollar: Yes, so I referenced it a few different times, so I think maybe there\u2019s a more specific question behind it. Oh - I think the question was, does it just service CVS? The answer is no. It\u2019s a consistent concept as what we did with Red Oak Sourcing, reflecting that we both have different needs, different customers if you will, and can jointly benefit those patients through combining our capabilities in this space, so we would expect to operate it in a similar way, where we have different benefits associated with that. There are--I think what you\u2019re talking about, there\u2019s not the same type of payment structure and schedule that we have for Red Oak Sourcing, kind of equalization payments if you will, so that structure does not exist with this. It is structured quite a bit differently in that regard. Then in terms of--I think there was a renewal question there about CVS, and so the contract goes through--the distribution contract goes through \u201927, and then the Red Oak agreement goes through \u201929, so this is certainly outside of those agreements and it\u2019s very much an example of the type of partnership that we look to have with any and all of our customers in various ways to ensure that we\u2019re thinking about how better to serve those underlying patients.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Hollar. We don\u2019t have any further questions, so I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to you for any additional or closing remarks. Thank you.\nJason Hollar: Yes, thank you, and thank you all for joining us. In addition the usual pleasantries I have at this point in the call, I do want to step back for just a minute, reflecting that given it\u2019s our year-end as well as additional guidance, I know that there was a lot to digest within this, but I hope that we clarified many of your points today. I do want to end where I started and just re-emphasize those same three key points I had at the very beginning of the commentary today. First of all, we finished the year with terrific momentum. We grew our earnings per share by 29% for both the quarter and the fiscal year. You add that on top of the growth that we saw last year, that\u2019s a nearly 50% increase in our EPS over the last couple of years, driven by performance across the board but really strong performance in our largest, most significant business, our pharma segment, growing despite having some of those impacts in the quarter from that contract unwind. But we\u2019re also seeing very good utilization across the enterprise, whether it\u2019s pharma as well as GMPD. We see that this industry continues to have a lot of need within the marketplace. That in part is driving our GMPD, but really that $240 million improvement that we saw for that business this year is being driven by the successful mitigation of inflation, a long hard journey but we\u2019ve gotten there, and now we\u2019re able to focus on driving the business going forward. Our other businesses, we\u2019re seeing robust demand across the board, utilization but secular trends as well. Really excited about the ongoing growth there - double digit 10% growth in 2025 while continuing to invest in the business. Cash flow - really strong, not only $4 billion nearly this year but when you take last year and this year in combination, that\u2019s nearly $7 billion that position us very well for financial flexibility going forward. All right, the second point was because of that momentum, we feel very confident about our fiscal \u201925, and that\u2019s why we raised our guidance, both in our largest business with pharma but also driving EPS growth in fiscal \u201925, despite that customer transition. Then thirdly and lastly, we\u2019re doing all that operational and cash flow focus while also driving our strategy going forward, optimizing our portfolio, very consistent transparent dialog we\u2019ve had with you. This management team is focused on those key priorities and will continue to communicate. We\u2019re excited about the progress across a number of areas that we talked about, whether it\u2019s furthering our partnership with our largest customer or the ongoing integration of our largest acquisition of specialty networks that we\u2019ve done in quite some time, and we\u2019re well positioned to continue to grow the business even in spite of any of the headwinds that we\u2019ve identified. Of course, behind all that, we will continue to responsibly prioritize shareholder value creation, and we\u2019ve communicated some additional near term actions specifically within the GMPD business today, and that is translating to even more opportunistic share repurchases in fiscal year \u201925. So a lot there, but a lot to be excited about, and we appreciate your time and attention, and look forward to keeping you updated on our progress.\nOperator: Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your attendance and you may now disconnect. Have a good day, and goodbye.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Aaron Alt",
            "content": "Thank you Jason, and good morning. Before discussing our Q4 success and our raised guidance, I want to highlight that today, we are providing revised prior period financials for fiscal year '22 through Q3 fiscal year '24, reflecting slight net increases to non-GAAP EPS. During the preparation of our annual financial statements, management identified a longstanding accounting error in part of our at-home solutions business related to revenue recognition from third party payors. As a result, we have corrected this item in prior periods and also updated the timing of other previously recognized immaterial out-of-period items across the full enterprise. The net impact of these changes increases non-GAAP EPS by $0.07 in fiscal year '24, $0.06 in fiscal year '23, and $0.01 in fiscal year '22. To be helpful, we've included supplemental schedules in our press release along with further detail in our fiscal year '24 10-K. Moving to our results, I am pleased to reinforce that Q4 produced a strong finish to a year in which the Cardinal team made tremendous progress against our financial and strategic priorities. For both Q4 and the year, our EPS results reached historical high points with operating profit growth across pharma, GMPD and other, also supported by improvements below the line in the form of lower interest costs, better tax rates, and lower share count. We delivered strong gross margin growth and matched it with well controlled SG&A, even in an inflationary environment. In Q4, revenue increased 12% to $59.9 billion, reflecting revenue growth in the pharmaceutical and specialty solutions segment, the GMPD segment, and in all of the businesses making up other. Gross margin grew 5% to $1.9 billion, outpacing consolidated SG&A which increased only 2% to $1.3 billion in the quarter, reflecting our disciplined cost management. This translated to total company operating earnings of $605 million, up 14% versus last year. Below the line, interest and other improved $6 million versus prior year to $10 million, benefiting from the quarter's strong cash outperformance. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate finished at 24.6%, 4.5 percentage points lower than the prior year. Fourth quarter average diluted shares outstanding were 245 million, 4% lower than a year ago due to our previously announced share repurchases. The net result was fourth quarter EPS of $1.84, growth of 29%. Moving into our segment results, beginning with the pharma segment on Slide 11, fourth quarter revenue increased 13% to $55.6 billion, driven by brand and specialty pharmaceutical sales growth from existing customers. We continue to see broad-based strength in pharmaceutical demand spanning across product categories: brand, specialty, consumer health and generics, and from our largest customers. Excluding GLP-1 sales, the segment's Q4 revenue growth would be 9%. As we have commented previously, GLP-1 sales do not meaningful contribute to the bottom line. Segment profit increased 8% to $482 million in the fourth quarter, driven by positive generics program performance. Within our generics program, we continue to see volume growth and consistent market dynamics, including strong performance from Red Oak. Pharma segment profit growth in the quarter was 8% despite an approximate $15 million margin headwind related to the unwind of the previously announced large customer transition. This unanticipated impact in the quarter was the primary difference between pharma's Q4 results and the midpoint of our prior guidance. Recall that we'd previously observed that the impact of the contract loss would be offset by new customers, specialty networks, and cost controls as part of our contingency planning. Consistent with these mitigation plans, the team began implementing cost control measures and started to see offsetting savings. We also saw strong growth from biopharma solutions in the quarter, including contributions from specialty networks. Turning to the GMPD segment on Slide 12, we are quite pleased by the Q4 GMPD results which confirmed our team's continued progress against the GMPD improvement plan. Fourth quarter revenue grew 2% to $3.1 billion, driven by volume growth from existing customers. We again saw growth in Cardinal brand volumes during the quarter. GMPD delivered Q4 segment profit of $47 million, generally consistent with our expectations and our prior guidance of approximately $65 million for the year before the prior period revisions. The $40 million year-over-year increase in Q4 was driven by an improvement in net inflationary impacts, including our mitigation initiatives as we achieved our target of offsetting the gross impact of inflation by the end of fiscal year '24. We continue to be encouraged by the tenacity of the team in driving improved execution in customer satisfaction and service levels while identifying additional opportunities to optimize the business. Finishing with the businesses that aggregate into other, as seen on Slide 13, fourth quarter revenue increased 15% to $1.2 billion, driven by growth across all three businesses: at-home solutions, nuclear and precision health solutions, and OptiFreight logistics. Segment profit grew 11% to $111 million primarily driven by the performance of OptiFreight logistics. The OptiFreight business continues to hit on all cylinders as increasing customer demand for our logistics management services is met with strong execution. In nuclear and at-home solutions, we continue to invest strategically to supercharge growth. All three businesses as key parts of our growth story have received and will receive going forward access to capital for expansion of their business models in support of our customers. I will be brief on the full-year commentary. Fiscal '24 revenue increased 11% to $227 billion, with growth from all five operating segments. Gross margin increased 8% to $7.4 billion while SG&A increased a more modest 4% to $5 billion, reflecting our year-long efforts to control costs. Together, this resulted in fiscal '24 total operating earnings growth of 16% to $2.4 billion. All-in, it was an excellent year across the business. Below the line, interest and other decreased 52% to $42 million, driven by increased interest income on cash and equivalents. Our annual effective tax rate finished at 21.7%. Average diluted shares outstanding were 247 million, 6% lower than a year ago due to share repurchases. The net result was fiscal '24 non-GAAP EPS of $7.53, growth of 29%, well above our long term target of 12% to 14% growth. Now before I turn to fiscal '25, let's cover the balance sheet. For fiscal '24, our ending cash balance was $5.1 billion. The cash position includes $200 million earmarked for the November 2024 debt maturity, with an additional $200 million to be paid through the time deposits held in prepaid assets and other on the balance sheet. To get there, we generated robust adjusted free cash flow, nearly $4 billion in fiscal year '24. Recall that at our investor day last June, I commented that cash flow remained an area of opportunity for us. Our excellent adjusted free cash flow result in 2024 was almost entirely a result of the team's year-long effort to optimize each element of our working capital while remaining focused on our service levels. To a much lesser degree, the results reflect balanced preparation for the Q1 contract expiration, which has now occurred in July largely as we expected. We attribute only a couple of hundred million dollars of our fiscal '24 cash flow to beneficial timing related to the large contract unwind. I'll talk about the impact of the contract unwind on cash flow shortly as part of our guidance. Also this year, we strengthened our balance sheet and achieved our targeted leverage ratio, which resulted in three positive outlook updates from the credit rating agencies. We also continued to deploy capital in a shareholder-friendly manner, returning more than our baseline commitment of capital returned to shareholders through $750 million of share repurchases and $500 million in dividend payments, and we increased our dividend for the 35th year in a row. Now let's look forward and discuss our updated fiscal '25 guidance on Slide 15. Today, we are increasing our fiscal '25 EPS guidance to a new range of $7.55 to $7.70. This is an increase from the preliminary guidance during our Q3 call of at least $7.50. Slide 16 shows our fiscal '25 outlook for pharma. On revenue, we expect a decline between 4% and 6%, reflecting the nearly $40 billion revenue headwind from the large customer contract expiration. Normalizing for the large customer, fiscal '25 revenue growth would be between 15% and 18%. This reflects underlying growth generally consistent with our long-term targeted rate of 10% due to strong overall pharmaceutical demand, as well as significant growth from the on-boarding of new customers and existing customer expansions, primarily in the second half of the year. We are on track to address the segment profit impact of the large contract expiration with this incremental volume, contributions from specialty networks, and additional operational efficiencies. Note that all three of these offsets will have some level of a ramp to them throughout our fiscal '25. We expect consistent market dynamics for our generics program to continue. We also expect increased contributions from brand and specialty products, including biosimilars. We are assuming a modest year-over-year headwind related to the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. On brand manufacturer price increases, we expect an environment generally consistent with the past several years. Summing it all up, we anticipate pharma segment profit growth in the range of 1% to 3%, a testament to the strength and resiliency of this business. It is the case that segment profit growth will be more back half-weighted than usual. We expect first half segment profit to be slightly lower to flat versus the prior year, with profit growth in the back half. Q3 should again be the highest absolute dollar profit quarter for the business. Turning to GMPD on Slide 17, on the top line we expect growth between 3% and 5%, aided by low single digit utilization growth as well as incremental volume from the on-boarding of net new distribution customer wins. On the bottom line, we are reiterating our expectation of approximately $175 million in segment profit for fiscal year '25, on our path to approximately $300 million in segment profit by fiscal year '26 by executing the GMPD improvement plan. The plan is unchanged from what we shared a quarter ago. After successfully offsetting inflation at the end of this year, the annualization of these benefits will be a fiscal year '25 tailwind. The team remains focused on continuing to drive Cardinal brand growth through our five-point plan. In fiscal year '25, we expect Cardinal brand sales growth between 3% and 5%. Simplification and cost optimization also continue with further opportunities in the pipeline to drive efficiencies and streamline our operations. Recognizing that while GMPD's plan may be simple, that does not make it easy. We once again expect a back half-weighted profit year in fiscal '25, just like fiscal '24. The quarterly cadence will be driven by seasonality and the ongoing commercial and operational improvements in the business. Additionally, we expect unfavorable manufacturing cost timing in the first half of the year, which unlike last year includes some start-up costs and timing associated with expanding production at Cardinal Health-owned domestic manufacturing plants to enhance our supply chain resiliency. Q1 should be the low point of the year due to these factors. Last year's updated Q1 shows $12 million of profit, and this year we expect Q1 to increase to up to $20 million, with sequential improvements thereafter. Turning to other on Slide 18, for each of nuclear, at-home solution and OptiFreight, we expect profit to be aided by the continued strength in demand, execution of our growth strategies, and benefits from our increased prioritization of these businesses with investments. Collectively, we expect revenue growth in the range of 10% to 12% and segment profit growth of approximately 10%, with all three businesses contributing to these targets. Stepping back, we are pleased to see anticipated profit growth across all of our operating segments in fiscal year '25. Moving below the line, we expect interest and other in the range of $140 million to $170 million. The large year-over-year increase continues to be driven by lower average cash balances, lower short term investment rates on our cash, and higher rates on our debt resulting from the refinancing of our calendar 2024 maturities. We continue to expect our fiscal year '25 effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 24%. With our near term GMPD value creation initiatives, we have increased our fiscal year '25 share repurchase expectations beyond our baseline to $750 million on the year, leading to a share count guidance of approximately 243 million shares. Finally, we expect fiscal year '25 adjusted free cash flow of approximately $1 billion, reflecting the Q1 negative impacts from the large contract unwind as well as quarter and day of the week timing. While these dynamics will significantly affect our cash flow in Q1, our strong investment-grade balance sheet positions us well to manage through these fluctuations and continue making strategic investments in the business consistent with our disciplined capital allocation framework. To close, fiscal year '24 was a standout year filled with notable milestones. With adjusted EPS growth of 29% and adjusted free cash flow of nearly $4 billion, the Cardinal team delivered. With six weeks of fiscal '25 behind us, I'm pleased to say that the team is managing adeptly. Between the leaders we have throughout the organization, our dedicated team working tirelessly to serve our customers, and our clear strategy, we are confident that we will deliver once again. With that, I will turn it back over to Jason. Lisa, good morning, thanks for the question. Happy to talk about it. We are really pleased to raise our guide for the pharma business for fiscal '25 - it really reflects our continued confidence in the team and continued confidence in the resiliency of that business, notwithstanding some of the puts and takes that we've been talking about over the last couple of quarters. I'll touch on the profile in a second, but I do want to emphasize on the revenue side of the house from a guidance perspective that we guided down 4% to 6% all-in, reflecting the $40 million headwind on the low margin contract non-renewal, but it's really up 15% to 18% on an adjusted basis if you take out the impact of that customer loss. Within that 15% to 18% is $10 billion of new revenue, new customers and expansions of service with existing customers - that's on top of a 10% underlying growth with the existing business, and so from that you can tell that we are growing the portfolio and doing what we said we were going to do with our existing customers and adding on both new customers and expansions with existing customers to get to that revenue base. That supports the increase in guide, the 1% to 3% on the profitability side of the house. The thing we called out during the earnings call is the consistent market dynamics, it's the generic volume growing, the low single-digit growth in core and the high single-digit growth in specialty, the strong overall Rx demand. There's a lot of things going on, but we are confident in our plans as we carry forward. Now, we don't comment on the margin profile of any particular customer, particularly in the context of a new customer, and we were delighted to announce formally the Publix win today in our earnings release. I'm not going to comment on their profitability, but I will observe that we have publicly commented on the low margin nature of the business that we've lost, and that certainly doesn't hurt us as we carry forward. Jason, anything you would add to that? Sure, so the way to think about it is Optum was an existing customer with us until the end of our Q4, and you can see the results in Q4, we don't need to go deeper on that. But what did also happen in Q4 was us being incredibly planful around the impacts to our operations, as well as to our financials of that customer unwind. We've talked in the past and we talked during our last earnings call around the three offsetting actions, the contribution of specialty networks, of course the new customer win, the expansion with existing customers as well as further cost optimization opportunities, and we're pleased the team got on it, got ahead of it, and they've already been executing in that respect, and so the guidance we're able to provide today, we view as relatively consistent with what we've provided in Q3, but with an additional degree of confidence because the plans are behind us and now we're acting in that way. The non-renewal will impact our Q1- there's no way to avoid that. They were a large, low margin customer, and as we've talked about, the new customers coming on board are largely back half-loaded, and so we will have a timing difference relative to prior years and that will impact certainly our revenue and profitability timing over the course of the year. There's also a cash impact, right? The unwind of the negative working capital position there is a Q1 impact for us and a key reason why we are carefully monitoring our cash flow during the first quarter, of course balanced with the fact that we are delighted with the strong adjusted free cash flow and the strong cash balance at the end of our Q4. Look - on balance, the cost optimization is already in play, specialty networks is already in play, and we continue to work on the customer expansions and the new customer on-boarding, and we will make that successful as well. I'll start. Look, I would observe that our gross margin progression went largely as we anticipated over the course of the quarter and the year. We have a very complicated business managing between the various parts, and no real surprises from my chair in that way. The second part of the question was--? I'll start. I would just observe that we're being very thoughtful in the planning we're doing for the year, given the number of moving pieces we have both within the pharma business and within the GMPD business, and of course keeping an eye on the three growth businesses within other. Within pharma, what we've reference is first half from a cadence perspective will be slightly down to flat versus prior year. That's only natural given the customer unwind and the back ended nature of the new customer on-boarding. Largely, the drivers within the pharma business are consistent with what would have been true in previous years - Q3 will be where we see the branded inflation rolling through, and so not a lot of different news there that I would call out. From a med perspective, we're very focused on executing against the plan. We've tried to be transparent every quarter about how we're doing and where we see it going, which is why we were purposeful in calling out Q1 specifically as we push ahead. We've had great success during fiscal year '25 and accomplished what we told you we were going to do, and we plan to do that again. Just want to be clear that we are investing in the business and there are some near term Q1 drivers that will make that rough number, what we call the up to $20 million as we carry forward. There's no magic here, though - I want to be clear. The plan and the cadence is generally consistent with how we've described the GMPD improvement plan in the past. Of course, we have the benefit of the inflation mitigation now lapping as we push ahead, and of course we can't forget the important topic of seasonality from a Q4 to Q1 perspective - we've called that out before, and that's why you see a dip from the great results in Q4 into Q1. Sure, so as I commented earlier, the team did a great job of assessing our opportunities in the face of the customer non-renewal, but I guess I would go back and point out that at the end of the day, we operate a 1% operating margin business, so it's important for us to always be mindful of the cost structure around us, but with a north star of how do we continue to ensure our customer service. We have been pleased that the reviews we undertook during Q4, the actions we identified will help us to offset the near term impact of customer loss, but more importantly they create a more efficient operational structure for us, and the changes are broad ranging across the enterprise with that north star ensuring we continue our customer service focus as we push ahead. Many of the changes have already been implemented and we're operating in that new framework already. We continue to assess what are the productive opportunities, and I also would emphasize that the ideas for these changes are coming from our broader teams as they look around and say, okay, how can we operate better in support of our existing customers and the new customers on the line. Yes, appreciate the question. The answer is there is no comparability issue. The 175 is unimpacted by the revisions that we provided in the financials today. The revisions we provided were for the three-year period. There will be--there is an impact of shifting of income or expense into the prior periods as well, which is why you're not seeing direct comparability as we carry forward. I do want to emphasize, though, that part of our operation here is building and maintaining a strong [indiscernible] environment, and as we identified the issue in the Edgepark part of our at-home business, which is part of other, it was a revenue recognition issue tied to a business which does less than half a percent of our overall revenue base. We were careful to do the right thing and disclose, and at the same time in partnership with our auditors decided that we would reflect the feedback we've gotten from this community and others around comments around non-recurring adjustments in prior periods, etc., and so now we walk into fiscal '25 not only with comparability but with a clean set of financials, unimpacted by timing to be able to talk about our progress as we carry forward. Well from a guidance perspective, we provide guidance for other on an aggregated basis, but I do want you to take away the enthusiasm present in Jason's comments and his tone of voice around the opportunity we think that each of these three businesses presents to Cardinal Health as we carry forward. The businesses are unique. They are managed differently. We aggregate them from a financial perspective. It's also the case that we are investing in each of those businesses, we have in '24 and we are in '25. At-home has recently opened two new distribution points and is investing in automation. OptiFreight has continued to invest in its digital platform and service of its customer experience. The nuclear business, we've talked at length about expanding the PET network as well as our excitement about the theranostic opportunities that that business presents. Again, as I go back to the financial guide, part of what you're seeing in the other basis is we are presenting a consistent picture on an aggregated view, which reflects in some cases we'll be investing in a year or a month while reaping the benefit in the same year or month from other parts of the portfolio. Jason? Okay, so you crammed in about four there. Averon, the first specific question on Averon was--?"

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Jason Hollar",
            "content": "Thanks Matt and good morning everyone. Fiscal year '24 marked a year of strong operational execution and record financial results for Cardinal Health, delivered in tandem with significant strategic progress across the portfolio. On that note, we have three key headlines today. First, we finished the year with momentum, growing EPS 29% in both Q4 and fiscal year '24. Our results exceeded guidance and full-year EPS of $7.53 was $0.96 above the midpoint of our original outlook from investor day. We also delivered nearly $4 billion of adjusted free cash flow for the year, positioning us with approximately $5 billion of cash at year end, even after $1.25 billion of capital returned to shareholders this year and funding our growth investments. Second, we have managed through the transition of a significant customer and are raising our guidance for fiscal year '25, while also reconfirming our long term financial targets. Finally, we continue to advance our strategy to build upon the growth and resiliency of pharma and specialty, execute our GMPD improvement plan, and accelerate our growth in key areas while optimizing our portfolio to maximize shareholder value creation. More on that momentarily, but first some brief reflections. This year, we continue to take decisive actions to simplify our business and drive performance, highlighted by the reorganization of our operating and segment reporting structure to enhance management focus while enabling efficiencies, accountability and transparency. We grew our largest and most significant business, pharmaceutical and specialty solutions, above our targeted long term growth rate. We saw ongoing stability in pharmaceutical demand, strong performance from our generics program, and our specialty business grew revenue 14% for the year. As of fiscal year '24, our specialty business is now over $36 billion and we anticipate continued growth next year despite a large contract expiration. We prioritize key growth areas in specialty with organic investments across therapeutic areas and the acquisition of specialty networks. In GMPD, we executed our improvement plan initiatives, returning the business to profitability and delivering approximately $240 million in year-over-year segment profit improvement. Notably, we achieved our year-end inflation mitigation target, a critical milestone for the business. Across our other operating businesses, we collectively grew revenue 12% and segment profit 7% in fiscal year '24. We've seen strong demand across nuclear, at-home solutions and OptiFreight, and our purposeful investments and focus on performance excites us about how these businesses are positioned for the future. Overall, these results were achieved through our team's commitment to execute against a focused set of priorities to create value for our shareholders, our customers, and ultimately for millions of patients. As we turn the page to fiscal year '25, our confidence is reinforced by our strong and resilient business with positive industry trends supporting our growth, and we continue to take actions to optimize not only the performance of our businesses but also the financial strength of the broader enterprise. Before I hand the call over to Aaron, let me provide an update on our business and portfolio review which, as a reminder, kicked off in September of 2022. Last June, we concluded our review of the former pharma segment highlighted at investor day with our enhanced organizational focus on specialty and decision to retain and further and invest in our nuclear and precision health solutions business. Then in January, we finalized our review of the growth businesses within the former medical segment, determining the best course of action for shareholder value creation was to invest in and further develop at-home solutions and OptiFreight for long term growth, while also completing our re-segmentation. All along, management in collaboration with the business review committee and board has been reviewing GMPD from every angle as the team executes our turnaround plan. We deeply understand the business' opportunities and complexities and today have some preliminary conclusions to share through the lens of our portfolio review framework, as seen on Slide 20. In short, we remain committed to executing the GMPD improvement plan and our fiscal year '26 target of $300 million in segment profits. We were pleased and unsurprised to see significant interest in GMPD during our review. The business is core to the operations of so many healthcare providers and features not only our formidable distribution expertise but a broad set of Cardinal Health brand products that are critical to patient care. Following our extensive review, we have gained confidence that we are best positioned to continue capitalizing on the meaningful growth and operational opportunities on the horizon for this business. Ultimately, we see more value creation potential ahead for our shareholders by continuing to drive the GMPD turnaround plan. Even more, our analysis uncovered additional opportunities to unlock near term value through further simplification actions and working capital improvements while continuing to drive the plan. From these initiatives, we plan to generate at least $500 million in cash over the next two years to be deployed according to our disciplined capital allocation framework. In recognition, we're raising our share repurchase expectations for fiscal year '25 to a total of $750 million, which is beyond our $500 million baseline. In terms of the mechanics of future reviews as the business continues to improve, the business review committee of our board sunset in July as planned, and the ongoing value creation efforts are now being overseen by the board as a whole. As always, we take a thorough, objective and open-minded approach focused on maximizing long term shareholder value creation while continuing to invest in the business to ensure that our customers receive the products and service they expect. I'll go deeper into our strategic plans for our segments later in my remarks, but first let me turn it over to Aaron to review our results and guidance. Thanks Aaron. Now I'll go deeper into our strategic priorities, beginning with pharma and specialty solutions, where we remain focused on building upon our strong core foundation and expanding in specialty. Everything we do starts with the customer. Recently we hosted our 32nd annual retail business conference, the largest in the industry, bringing together 5,000 attendees from across the country. As the trusted partner to retail pharmacy, we understand the critical role retail independent pharmacies play in caring for their communities as they continue to expand their services as community healthcare destinations and demonstrate their remarkable value and resiliency. We continue to invest in our full suite of clinical, business and reimbursement solutions to support our customers and provide industry advocacy to empower retail pharmacy, now and into the future. Our consumer health logistics center slated to open in 2025 will offer a comprehensive selection of over-the-counter medications, treatments and diagnostic solutions. Additionally, our new vaccine alliance program offers cost savings and other benefits from participating manufacturers to help pharmacies engage more patients and expand their immunization programs. We are constantly evaluating ways to bring innovative solutions to our pharmacy and manufacturer partners through the breadth of our offerings and capabilities. As part of that commitment and in collaboration with CVS Health, we have formed Averon, a joint venture to source biosimilars. Averon builds upon our company's successful partnerships like Red Oak Sourcing with similar overall objectives for biosimilars. Simply put, we are increasing access to additional therapy options that will provide more choice for patients at a lower cost. Averon began by contracting a couple of products, including Humira biosimilars, and we see opportunities for the program to expand over time. Continuing in specialty, we're pleased with how quickly specialty networks has integrated with our business, and we continue to be impressed with the PPS analytics platform's insights generation capabilities and the team's clinical, technology and operational expertise. As expected, we are leveraging specialty networks' demonstrated capabilities in neurology, the largest area of its fully integrated model, to enhance our offering in oncology. The fully integrated specialty networks market offering is directly aligned with our strategy for Navista, our oncology practice alliance providing advanced technology and services. Over the course of the last year, we've built a world-class Navista team consisting of industry experts, defined our offerings and go-to-market strategy, and completed our foundational technology build. The Navista team is engaging with an active pipeline of customers across the oncology marketplace, demonstrating to community oncologists how Navista can help them remain independent for good. Upstream with manufacturers, our leading specialty 3PL has continued its track record of growing faster than market with nearly 20% growth during the year. We're leveraging these services as part of our comprehensive offering that further facilitates the commercialization and delivery of critical cell and gene therapies to providers and patients. Our new advanced therapy solutions innovation center features a specialized deep frozen storage suite to handle the logistical challenges associated with cell and gene therapies. Additionally, the dedicated space provides opportunities for collaboration and improved process design supporting the ordering, invoicing and accounts receivable process for pharmaceutical products. Across classes of trade, our commitment to service and solutions-oriented commercial approach has resonated with customers. A new health system customer on-boarding that we recently completed and a few in the earlier phases of ramp-up are going smoothly, and we expect over $10 billion in total incremental revenue in fiscal year '25 from committed customer wins and expansions. Turning to GMPD, when we originally introduced the former medical improvement plan, we consistently highlighted that the first key to turning around the performance of the business was addressing the significant impact of inflation and global supply chain constraints on our business. Our team got to work with urgency, executing various mitigation actions to cover the significant operating losses we incurred. Fast forward to today, after two years of hard work, the GMPD business is on solid ground. We delivered an approximate $240 million year-over-year improvement in segment profit in fiscal year '24. We exited the year successfully offsetting the gross impact of inflation. We've seen three consecutive quarters of year-over-year segment revenue growth and four consecutive quarters of Cardinal Health brand volume growth. We grew Cardinal Health brand revenue 3% overall for the year and 4% in the U.S. Our customer loyalty index score for U.S. distribution remains up over 20 points from its pandemic low, and we're successfully retaining key distribution customers along with some recent wins. As we continue to dive into the business through our portfolio review, it's clear there are still significant opportunities to capture. I'll highlight a few. First, as Aaron mentioned, our progress on inflation mitigation in fiscal year '24 will annualize and be a significant year-over-year tailwind to our results next year, even with the slight headwind expected from the recent cost increases in international freight. Between the actions we've taken to improve our resiliency, the diversity of our global supply chain, and some offsets across our broader portfolio of commodities, we're confident in our ability to continue to effectively mitigate supply chain inflation. Second, Cardinal Health brand leading indicators remain positive and continue to predict an acceleration in growth. We've seen a healthy overall utilization environment for a number of quarters now and our five-point plan continues to produce encouraging results. Third, the disciplined execution of our simplification strategy has driven improved operational performance. With the business stabilized and only recent turned free cash flow positive, we see opportunities to drive targeted working capital improvements over the next two years. Additionally, we can broaden our simplification efforts such as further optimizing our real estate and geographic footprint, while always prioritizing the needs of our customers as our north star. Our team is energized to execute on the next phase of the improvement journey focused on commercial excellence and continued simplification to create additional value for our customers and shareholders. In nuclear and precision health solutions, our leading positioning with 130 nuclear pharmacies and 30 PET sites across the country feeds our differentiated ability to partner with manufacturers in order to bring cutting edge therapies to patients exactly when they need them. Our excitement continues to build around the opportunities to improve patient lives through the use of precision medicine, which we have been investing into heavily with our center for theranostics advancement. We're seeing the results with our theranostics business growing over 20% in fiscal year '24, driven by strong demand for prostate cancer theranostics products such as [indiscernible]. In fiscal year '25, we expect similar theranostics growth and will continue to invest to meet the growing pipeline of opportunities, which includes cardiology and neurology, but overall is largely dominated by oncology. As an example, we will be expanding our support of novel prostate radioligand therapies with Novartis' Pluvicto in fiscal year '25. We are also investing in increasing our cyclotron capacity and PET manufacturing geographic footprint to meet increasing demand for PET diagnostics, with a majority of emerging radiotherapeutics requiring a companion PET scan. Fiscal year '24 was a foundational year for our $2.9 billion at-home solutions business as we laid the groundwork for future growth and efficiency. This business continues to grow revenue faster than market, not only aided by care moving into the home but also our team's commercial execution. To drive operating leverage, we've been investing our technology capabilities such as new warehouses with state of the art automation. Just last month, we opened our brand-new 350,000 square foot warehouse in South Carolina featuring the fastest order fulfillment system in the market. This system is also operational in our central Ohio facility and planned for the new Texas distribution center we'd previously announced and expect to open in 2025. We're seeing fruits from our investments with our fill rates currently the highest they've been in over three years and our patient net promoter score up over 16% year-over-year. The OptiFreight logistics team delivered this year with exceptional performance. Our TotalVue insights platform continues to help customers uncover shipping inefficiencies and optimize delivery through data-driven insights. As a result, our customer loyalty index is at an all-time high. In fiscal year '25, to put it simply, we expect to continue our track record of great execution, helping our customers expand and bringing on new customers to benefit from our program and value. Across the enterprise, we are confident in the Cardinal team to continue our momentum and deliver our targeted growth in fiscal year '25 and beyond. Before I wrap up, the former CEO in me can't help but acknowledge our team's tremendous progress on cash flow this year. With the record results in fiscal year '24, we're positioned to exceed the adjusted free cash flow expectations we outlined at investor day with at least $7 billion over the fiscal '24 to '26 period, even despite the large contract expiration. We possess the financial flexibility to continue investing our business, returning capital to shareholders and maximizing long term shareholder value creation. In summary, fiscal year '24 was another great year and we are excited to continue driving our company and healthcare forward. I want to thank our dedicated employees who serve our customers and continue our work to be healthcare's most trusted partner. With that, we will take your questions. No, nothing to add. Sure, thanks for the question, Eric. I think it's important to just go back in time a little bit, this last 12 months. A year ago when we were sitting here, certainly the freight costs had gone all the way back down to historic levels, so we were enjoying--really, the run-up had come all the way back down, and it was the beginning of the calendar year, so in our third quarter when the Red Sea issues first began, and that's when we saw the first spike, and the reason I remind you of that is that first spike was known come springtime, when we gave our initial guidance for GMPD, and so we knew about that first step-up already, and that's been factored into the guidance from day one. Yes, there have been further increases since then, but when you look at the combined two increases, the two different steps, first in January, then in the spring, they still are woefully short of where we were a couple of years ago when the whole supply chain was under pressure, where even when we were spending two, three times the current level, we were having difficulty in actually getting reasonable service. So yes, the costs are higher, but not nearly as high as they used to be, and most importantly is the supply chain is functioning a lot more efficiently than it was before. Long way of saying, Eric, that yes, there is a little bit of an increase here, it's something we monitor and manage very, very tightly, but it's not the point where it requires widespread price adjustments accordingly, at least not yet. In addition to that, it's important that we look at the overall inflationary environment, and we talked about this a couple of years ago. At the peak, we had a lot of oil and petroleum-based products, including fuel and other type of freight, that was also a big issue. Those are actually a little bit softer in terms of the cost, so overall net-net, we're managing through it better than we have before, and overall we have some puts and takes that are all very manageable. We'll continue to evaluate the pricing necessary within that, but at this stage we haven't had to exercise that lever to near the extent that we did in the past. Yes, let me try to address a few of those pieces. Specialty is absolutely a key part of this story and why we still anticipate being able to grow this business next year. We highlighted in our comments that in fiscal '24 for the year, we saw another year of 14% growth. You may recall at our investor day last year, the specialty business CAGR over the prior three years was anticipated at that time to be 14% as well, so another year of strong growth driven by the widespread investments that we have made and continue to make. We talked today about a couple of interesting growth drivers for the future, whether it's our advanced therapy solutions business, the new venture with CVS for Averson focused on biosimilars. Biosimilars in general has been a rising tide type of benefit over the last several years, and of course then our acquisition of specialty networks, which closed in March and has an eight, nine-month type of year-over-year benefit tailwind, so these are all areas that are driving our specialty business to some degree in fiscal '24, but they're all examples of where we would expect that to continue to grow over fiscal '25 to help mitigate for that contract non-renewal, that we think while that growth will be slower in '25 due to that. I also made the comment in the remarks that even in spite of this overall revenue reduction for the enterprise for the pharma segment and the impact of that contract non-renewal, we still expect our specialty business to grow in fiscal '25 in spite of that. That tells you that our run rate as we lap fiscal '25 and that non-renewal, we would anticipate it to be very consistent with the long term algorithm that we've highlighted in the past, which from a profit perspective has been defined as low single-digit type of profit growth for our PD core business and double-digit growth for specialty, so we'll continue to look at other opportunities to invest organically, as well as inorganically to continue to feed that growth. Yes, I'll have Aaron walk through some of the cadence [indiscernible], to your question, but I wanted to stress just upfront, what you should have heard from these messages are very, very similar words and phrases that we used last quarter. The plan is unchanged. Of course, we get a little bit smarter, we sharpen our pencils a little bit and we get a better understanding of where our exit rate is for '24, but all the factors that we are talking about today with this business are very similar to what we walked through in the past, and of course all the investments that we made this last year. Aaron, a few thoughts on the cadence? Yes, let me take that. It was related to, I think, just the general impact of insulin pricing, but there's also the Humira element there, so it's probably a couple different questions. Within the quarter, we did, as Aaron had highlighted before, we saw of course the ongoing benefit of the GLP-1 growth, but we did have a similar offset as it relates to the pricing change for the WAC insulin adjustments that happened at the beginning of the calendar year. Until we get through the second quarter of fiscal '25, we'd anticipate there to be a bit of an offset related to that price change. There was also a question around Humira and, I assume, just the biosimilar type of migration. We see that it's started to move a little bit more. Certainly some of the actions that CVS has done more broadly in the marketplace seem to have moved things along a little bit further. It's still fairly low penetration throughout the broad industry, but generally speaking, we have seen that start to pick up a little bit, I wouldn't say meaningfully, within the quarter, maybe a little bit even afterwards, but it's still at fairly low penetration rates. It's one of the reasons why we're so focused on biosimilars and with our joint venture with Averon, is just to continue to look for ways to increase access for patients that need that therapy at an affordable cost, so we'll continue to do our part there. Next question please. Yes, so it's certainly true that GMPD is more acute focused customers, and we do benefit from the migration towards more of an ASC model. We do not participate widely in physician offices, so that's an element. It's nothing that we've called out as broad trends, so I don't have much more to go on there, other than on a same store sales basis, we're seeing the utilization fairly consistent this past year, generally speaking, that low single-digit type of range, so we are seeing that there's like-for-like growth. What we've highlighted fairly consistently is that this last year was--or the end of '23, beginning of '24 was the inflection point for us. We were not growing with the market at that point. Over the course of '24, we've largely grown with the market, plus or minus a point here or there, so very consistent with that low single-digit type of growth over--especially after our first quarter. We don't think there's widespread shifts there, but we definitely have an ASC presence that we do think we benefit from, but I wouldn't call that a main driver of what we're looking at. In terms of the investments we're making, we did call out some domestic investments, but they're not limited to domestic. We believe in a very diversified, competitive geographic footprint. We've stressed that specifically we don't have manufacturing, direct manufacturing in China - that's one of the related questions here as it relates to certainly the ongoing tariff risk, and I can also let you know that we only source less than 10% of our total Cardinal Health branded product in China, so specifically to China, we don't have a large exposure. But we do have exposure beyond China, and Asia and near-shore Central, South America, we believe a diversified, broad supply base is important, as well as a domestic footprint. We have increased our investments across the supply chain to improve the resiliency, and there's a couple of areas within the U.S. specifically - you've seen some of the tariffs related to syringes is a specific area of focus, and we happen to have that capability in the United States. That's just one example of where we're really doubling down on that investment. So yes, costs and freight are always a consideration - you know, we build a financial model behind all that and we look at the risks, but on this particular example, one example of where we're really leaning in on that investment, that's more about just ensuring our customers get the product they need. This is more of a volume opportunity than a pure cost and margin opportunity, so you've got to look at all those factors. Next question, please. Yes, thanks for the question, Eric. Again, I think my answer is going to be fairly similar to what I said before, but in a different context. We have a very broad base of customers, very broad base of payors behind those customers, so we don't have necessarily even the insight all the time as to where those reimbursements are coming from. The same store sales type of information, what we see more broadly is just not a lot of fluctuations and variations, and we're not talking again of any type of growth rate above and beyond what we believe that underlying utilization is. Generally speaking, if there are some of those trends, at this stage I'm not seeing that as a meaningful driver to where our business is going. As it relates to the second question, I'll say what I said before - we're 1% industry, so it's competitive but stable. I would say that the vast majority of contracts don't change hands period to period. These couple, several that have that more notable, there's been several that have long term five-year types of agreements, so every five years there is the chance, opportunity or risk for that to occur, but again I'll just stress the vast majority don't. We feel really good about our positioning, competitive positioning. We know we're competitive, we know that our message and our work and our results resonate with our customers. We're very much focused on that experience, the service levels, the value initiatives and propositions behind it, the tools and platforms. We've talked about our InteLogix and our Atrix platforms for health systems as one example of not just going at them with price but going at them with value, and having true value components to those offerings, and we feel really good about where that positioning is, and that's why we've been able to offset to the degree that we have. Yes, thanks for the question. It's broad-based, it's varied. We don't call it out in every call in all areas, but it's so broad, it really is everywhere. It's in the core of how we operate. Examples of what we talked about today, without using the phrase AI, especially networks - you know, their PPS analytics is a great example of taking that data, electronic medical records and synthesizing that for manufacturers, as well as providers, and getting actionable insights. I mean, that is AI. When you look at some of the automation I'm commented on in our at-home solutions network, this is now over 25% of our sites just in the last 12 to 18 months. We're launching a new footprint that is bringing in technology and automation in various forms into the manufacturing--or I'm sorry, into the distribution setting to be even more innovative, even more efficient and productive. As you mentioned, those other platforms, InteLogix, Atrix, working with Palantir and other partners to create value, and then I'm not even getting into the more basic use cases like customer service and back office. I guess I don't want to just hit the same drumbeat everyone else is. What we're trying to do in our communication is get beyond the buzzwords and really talk about the essence of where we're driving our business, and we feel really good about that, and it's definitely [indiscernible]. Yes, I'll start. On the customer expansions, these are existing customer relationships where we are already a primary distributor for them, and they are expanding their footprint, whether it's acquisitions or just taking on more of the business themselves, and we're supporting their growth, so it's an existing relationship and expanding upon that, so it's committed in that sense, where we're already there, and you can use BioPlus as one of the examples of what I'm talking about there. Perhaps Aaron, you can go into a little bit more detail on the [indiscernible]? Yes, I would say the one thing we did clarify in the prior comments is that all three businesses are expected to contribute to that growth in fiscal '25, and we are investing--you know, fiscal '24 was an especially heavy investment period, but we are continuing to invest across the range. Just one example to put into perspective is we talked a lot about our investments in our nuclear and precision health solutions business. This is a business that we've highlighted, theranostics now just with our second phase of expansion that we announced about a year ago, or this last year, and then we also have talked about some PET expansion. From a fiscal '24 to '26, that's about $100 million, mainly capital that we're investing into that business, but it's representative of the big investments that we're making in addition to the three different distribution centers in at-home solutions that Aaron had mentioned are very representative of the inputs that we're putting into these businesses, because we deeply believe in their ability to continue to grow, benefit from the secular trends they each enjoy, but then also reflecting the leadership position we have in each, and that is then further bolstered by these very specific investments. Just broadly speaking, more color. Yes, so I referenced it a few different times, so I think maybe there's a more specific question behind it. Oh - I think the question was, does it just service CVS? The answer is no. It's a consistent concept as what we did with Red Oak Sourcing, reflecting that we both have different needs, different customers if you will, and can jointly benefit those patients through combining our capabilities in this space, so we would expect to operate it in a similar way, where we have different benefits associated with that. There are--I think what you're talking about, there's not the same type of payment structure and schedule that we have for Red Oak Sourcing, kind of equalization payments if you will, so that structure does not exist with this. It is structured quite a bit differently in that regard. Then in terms of--I think there was a renewal question there about CVS, and so the contract goes through--the distribution contract goes through '27, and then the Red Oak agreement goes through '29, so this is certainly outside of those agreements and it's very much an example of the type of partnership that we look to have with any and all of our customers in various ways to ensure that we're thinking about how better to serve those underlying patients. Yes, thank you, and thank you all for joining us. In addition the usual pleasantries I have at this point in the call, I do want to step back for just a minute, reflecting that given it's our year-end as well as additional guidance, I know that there was a lot to digest within this, but I hope that we clarified many of your points today. I do want to end where I started and just re-emphasize those same three key points I had at the very beginning of the commentary today. First of all, we finished the year with terrific momentum. We grew our earnings per share by 29% for both the quarter and the fiscal year. You add that on top of the growth that we saw last year, that's a nearly 50% increase in our EPS over the last couple of years, driven by performance across the board but really strong performance in our largest, most significant business, our pharma segment, growing despite having some of those impacts in the quarter from that contract unwind. But we're also seeing very good utilization across the enterprise, whether it's pharma as well as GMPD. We see that this industry continues to have a lot of need within the marketplace. That in part is driving our GMPD, but really that $240 million improvement that we saw for that business this year is being driven by the successful mitigation of inflation, a long hard journey but we've gotten there, and now we're able to focus on driving the business going forward. Our other businesses, we're seeing robust demand across the board, utilization but secular trends as well. Really excited about the ongoing growth there - double digit 10% growth in 2025 while continuing to invest in the business. Cash flow - really strong, not only $4 billion nearly this year but when you take last year and this year in combination, that's nearly $7 billion that position us very well for financial flexibility going forward. All right, the second point was because of that momentum, we feel very confident about our fiscal '25, and that's why we raised our guidance, both in our largest business with pharma but also driving EPS growth in fiscal '25, despite that customer transition. Then thirdly and lastly, we're doing all that operational and cash flow focus while also driving our strategy going forward, optimizing our portfolio, very consistent transparent dialog we've had with you. This management team is focused on those key priorities and will continue to communicate. We're excited about the progress across a number of areas that we talked about, whether it's furthering our partnership with our largest customer or the ongoing integration of our largest acquisition of specialty networks that we've done in quite some time, and we're well positioned to continue to grow the business even in spite of any of the headwinds that we've identified. Of course, behind all that, we will continue to responsibly prioritize shareholder value creation, and we've communicated some additional near term actions specifically within the GMPD business today, and that is translating to even more opportunistic share repurchases in fiscal year '25. So a lot there, but a lot to be excited about, and we appreciate your time and attention, and look forward to keeping you updated on our progress."

I'll be your coordinator for today's event. Please note, this conference is being recorded and for the duration of the call, your lines will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I'd like to turn the call over to your host today, Matt Sims, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nMatt Sims: Welcome to this morning's Cardinal Health third quarter fiscal '24 earnings conference call, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Cardinal Health's CEO, Jason Hollar; and our CFO, Aaron Alt. You can find this morning's earnings press release and investor presentation on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com. Since we will be making forward-looking statements today, let me remind you that the matters addressed in the statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied.

For the Q&A portion of today's call, we kindly ask that you limit questions to one per participant, so that we can try and give everyone an opportunity. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jason.\nJason Hollar: Good morning, everyone. A year ago at our Investor Day, I reflected upon what attracted me to Cardinal Health, our strong culture, values, and mission to be healthcare's most trusted partner; how the company was uniquely positioned with its breadth and scale to navigate the complexities of the healthcare ecosystem and serve the needs of customers, manufacturers and ultimately, patients. At the same time, I was open about some of the opportunities in front of us as an organization. Together, we laid out a clear but aggressive strategic plan, streamlined our focus, and the team got to work, all the time prioritizing on our core business to emerge as a stronger, more resilient company. And we have a recent proof-point. Over the last several months, we deeply focused on preparing for a variety of alternatives regarding a particular large, low margin customer contract, which has allowed us to quickly navigate the upcoming contract change and confirm that we expect to grow our earnings in fiscal '25. By driving improvements in our core operations, investing to expand our offerings in key areas like specialty and evolving our commercial approach in ways which have resonated elsewhere in the marketplace, we demonstrated that we have made progress on positioning our business for sustained success and growth. As we look ahead, the current quarter's results reinforce our confidence. We're operating from a position of growing strength and resiliency, with industry trends that remain stable and in our favor. In Q3, we delivered broad-based growth, while executing on our four strategic priorities; building upon the growth and resiliency of pharmaceutical and specialty solutions, executing our GMPD improvement plan, accelerating growth in key areas, and maintaining a relentless focus on shareholder value creation. In our most significant business, Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, we again drove solid profit growth on top of a difficult comparison to last year's strong performance. We've seen ongoing stability in pharmaceutical demand, consistent market dynamics in our generics program, and strong performance in specialty, both downstream and upstream, all of which enables us to raise our fiscal '24 profit outlook for the segment to a midpoint of 9% growth. In GMPD, we are pleased to see the strong topline and bottom line performance, with an acceleration in growth reflecting further progress against the business' turnaround plan. GMPD's quarter was overall consistent with our expectations and the team is already working hard on the continued ramp-up in Q4. Among our other operating businesses, our new reporting structure implemented at the start of Q3 is reinforcing our focus on performance and purposeful investment in growth. The strong demand we are seeing across Nuclear, at-Home Solutions, and OptiFreight, fueled by favorable industry trends, excites us about the long-term potential as these markets and businesses continue to develop. And as we've optimized the financial strength of the broader enterprise, we've seen meaningful benefits below the operating line this year. Putting it all together, we're pleased to be in a position to raise our fiscal '24 EPS outlook, provide preliminary guidance for fiscal '25 of profit growth in each of Pharma, GMPD, and Other, as well as overall EPS, and reiterate our long-term targets for our businesses and enterprise. Our strategy and long-term outlook are unaltered and our team remains focused on executing our plan as we serve our customers and continue to drive our company forward. With that, let me turn it over to Aaron to review our Q3 results, fiscal '24 guidance, and early fiscal '25 outlook in more detail.\nAaron Alt: Thank you, Jason. This morning, we are reporting our financial results on the new financial reporting segment structure we implemented at the beginning of Q3. To that end, we released an 8-K on April 23, which provided the recast historical quarterly results for fiscal year '22, fiscal year '23, and fiscal year '24 through Q2, reflective of the new segmentation for Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, GMPD, and Other. As we called out at the time, the new segmentation is designed to provide greater transparency, focus, and accountability across our businesses, and we are already seeing those benefits. Overall, Q3 was a strong quarter with double-digit operating earnings growth and 20% EPS growth. We accomplished that growth, while at the same time leaning in and making significant investments of time, expense and capital against our longer-term strategic plan. With both continued confidence in our strategies and a resilient business and team, we are pleased to once again raise our EPS guidance for fiscal year '24, more on that shortly. As seen on Slide 4, total company revenue increased 9% to $55 billion, reflecting revenue growth in the Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, the GMPD segment, and in all of the businesses making up Other. We were particularly pleased to see the second consecutive quarter of revenue growth in GMPD at 4%. We are also pleased that gross margin increased 9% to $1.9 billion. While consolidated SG&A also increased just under 9% to $1.3 billion in the quarter, the increased amount reflects technology and other purposeful investments against the future of the business and higher costs to support sales growth. With strong broad-based profit growth, we delivered operating earnings of $666 million, 10% higher than last year. Moving below the line, interest and other was generally consistent with the prior year at $26 million, and our third quarter effective tax rate of 20.4% was better than we expected due to positive discrete items. As a result of our prior share repurchases, Q3 average diluted shares outstanding were 245 million, 5% lower than a year ago. As I mentioned earlier, the net result for Q3 was EPS of $2.08, reflecting growth of 20%. Now turning to the segments, beginning with Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions on Slide 5. Third quarter revenue increased 9% to $50.7 billion, driven by brand and specialty pharmaceutical sales growth. We continued to see strong pharmaceutical demand across product categories, brand, specialty, consumer health and generics, and from our largest customers. While we again saw robust demand for GLP-1 medications, recall that we had guided that the revenue growth rate would moderate this quarter, as it did, given the acceleration that we started to realize last year during Q3. Excluding GLP-1 sales, the segment's Q3 revenue growth would be 7%. As we previously noted, these sales did not meaningfully contribute to the bottom line. Segment profit increased 4% to $580 million in the third quarter, driven by positive generics program performance. Our generics program continued to see both volume growth and consistent market dynamics. Within our brand and specialty products, demand for COVID-19 vaccines in the quarter was, consistent with our expectations, not a meaningful contributor. As anticipated and guided, lower branded inflation than last year's relative high point was a year-over-year drag on profit growth. So, overall, we were pleased to deliver 4% segment profit growth in Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, solid growth on top of an exceptionally strong quarter a year ago, which grew 23%. Turning to the GMPD segment on Slide 6. Revenue grew for the second quarter in a row by 4% in Q3 to $3.1 billion. This increase was driven by volume growth from existing customers. The GMPD segment delivered segment profit of $20 million, a $66 million year-over-year increase, driven by an improvement in net inflationary impacts, including our mitigation initiatives. GMPD continued its strong turnaround trajectory, achieving its highest level of quarterly profitability in the last two and a half years. We continue to be encouraged by the underlying improvements in the business, driven by the team's efforts against the GMPD Improvement Plan. As a reminder, the components of the former Medical Improvement Plan are now split between GMPD and Other, and the plan continues to be on track. The team achieved notable progress on inflation mitigation in the quarter, and we again saw a year-over-year improvement and growth in Cardinal Health brand volumes, providing continued fuel for the business' ongoing turnaround. Finishing with the businesses that aggregate into Other, as seen on Slide 7. Third quarter revenue increased 14% to $1.2 billion due to growth across all three businesses, at-Home Solutions, Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions, and OptiFreight Logistics. Collectively, the businesses grew segment profit in the quarter by 5%, with OptiFreight Logistics showing particular strength as we worked during the quarter to create the foundations for future profit growth in all of the businesses. Jason will further discuss our excitement around these businesses and some of the recent trends momentarily. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a strong cash position with $3.7 billion of cash and equivalents on the balance sheet. Year-to-date, we've generated $2.1 billion of adjusted free cash flow and have continued to deploy capital according to our disciplined capital allocation framework, including investing approximately $320 million in CapEx back into the business to drive organic growth and funding the $1.2 billion acquisition of Specialty Networks. Over the past several years, we've made tremendous progress with our balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we received a further update to our ratings outlook with Moody's moving our outlook to positive. We issued $1.15 billion in new notes during the quarter to refinance our upcoming June and November debt maturities. We plan to hold the cash proceeds and time deposits until the calendar year 2024 maturities come due. I'll note, due to the nature of these contracts, only about half of the total cash received is reflected in our Q3 ending cash balance. The remaining $550 million is recorded in prepaid expenses and other on the balance sheet. We have returned over $1 billion total to shareholders year-to-date, which includes approximately $375 million of quarterly dividend payments and $750 million in share repurchases, which is in excess of our committed baseline repurchase of $500 million. Now for our updated fiscal '24 guidance on Slide 9, beginning with the enterprise. We are raising and narrowing our fiscal year '24 non-GAAP EPS guidance. Our new range of $7.30 to $7.40 reflects a midpoint, which is 27% above our fiscal '23 EPS results. We started the year working to deliver our guidance of 14% EPS growth at the midpoint. What a year it has been so far. Before we turn to the segments, a few comments on our enterprise assumptions. With the year-to-date results, we are improving our fiscal '24 effective tax rate guidance to an updated range of 22% to 23%. And we are reiterating our fiscal '24 expectations for adjusted free cash flow of approximately $2.5 billion, for CapEx of around $500 million, for diluted shares of approximately 247 million, and for share repurchases of $750 million which, consistent with our framework, does not assume further repurchase activity this year. Now turning to the fiscal '24 outlook for our new segment reporting structure, as seen on Slide 10. With another solid quarter from Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, we are raising and narrowing our segment profit guidance for the full year to 8.5% to 9.5% growth, which at the midpoint implies continued mid-single digit profit growth in the fourth quarter. We are reiterating our guide for GMPD segment profit of approximately $65 million for fiscal year '24. We continue to expect to address the impact of inflation as we exit fiscal '24, along with continued Cardinal Health brand volume growth and benefits from our continued cost savings initiatives. Additionally, we anticipate a positive impact from seasonality in Q4 compared to Q3. We are also reiterating our segment profit guide for the Other businesses, 6% to 8% segment profit growth for the full year, given that we expect a strong Q4 for those businesses. On the topline, we now expect Other full year revenue growth of approximately 12%. So, as I highlighted earlier, we are raising our guidance for fiscal year '24 to $7.30 to $7.40. Finally, let me conclude my remarks by providing a guidance preview for fiscal year '25. We will provide formal fiscal year '25 guidance during our Q4 and full year earnings call in August. However, with the benefits of our raised fiscal year '24 expectations and the action plans already underway in response to recent market changes, here is our preliminary perspective. For our largest business, Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, while revenue will reset in the year as we offset a recent customer non-renewal, we notably expect to deliver at least 1% segment profit growth in fiscal year '25 before returning to more normalized growth in fiscal year '26. Looking forward, our commercial and operational teams have been busy, and our value proposition is resonating in the marketplace. Over the past several months, we have had some attractive wins with new customers and some existing customers are expanding their own footprints with us. Some of these are already under contract and ordering and others are scheduled for implementation in the second half of next fiscal year. So, over the course of the upcoming year, we expect new volume coming our way at sustainable margins. We completed the Specialty Networks acquisition quickly, which will be additive to our efforts in fiscal year '25. Separately, we have turned a further eye to optimizing our cost structure across our corporate functional footprint and across the Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions portfolio. Regarding environmental factors, we are expecting brand inflation to be roughly equivalent to fiscal '24 levels, while we remain watchful relative to the contribution of COVID-19 vaccines. For the GMPD segment, we expect continued growth in fiscal year '25 on our path to approximately $300 million in segment profit by fiscal year '26, driven by the annualization of inflation mitigation, progress with Cardinal Health brand growth, and continued simplification and cost optimization. We expect approximately $175 million in GMPD segment profit in fiscal year '25. And for the businesses included in Other, we expect the strong demand we've seen across these businesses to continue. With positive industry trends and the strength of our competitive positioning, we expect collective segment profit growth in fiscal year '25 at the top end of our long-term target approximately 10%. During fiscal '25, we will be investing across all of our businesses, with key examples being new facilities like our Consumer Health Logistics Center, at-Home Solutions facilities in Texas and South Carolina, and further geographic reach of our Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions' PET network. We will also continue our build-out of Navista and investments in GMPD supply chain resiliency. Now a few call-outs below the line and with the balance sheet. We anticipate a significant step-up in interest and other next year, primarily due to much lower average cash balances due to cash already deployed for Specialty Networks and due to the one-time unwinding of negative net working capital from the large contract non-renewal. We also expect lower short-term investment rates on cash and higher interest rates on debt resulting from the refinancing of our calendar 2024 maturities, leading to an interest and other range of $160 million to $190 million in fiscal year '25. We expect our fiscal year '25 effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 24%, slightly higher year-over-year due to discrete favorability seen this year. Partially offsetting these impacts, we would expect a lower share count between 244 million and 245 million due to the $500 million of baseline share repurchases we've previously outlined. Finally, while we continue to expect to generate adjusted free cash flow of approximately $2 billion on average from fiscal 2024 to 2026, we think it is important to call out that fiscal 2025 will be lower than that average, primarily due to the large contract unwind, as well as quarter end day of week timing. These dynamics will significantly influence our cash flow in Q1 of next year. However, our strong investment grade balance sheet positions us well to manage through these fluctuations. With respect to the long term, it is full speed ahead. We are reiterating our fiscal year '24 through '26 targets for the enterprise and segments and expect to deliver at least $7.50 of non-GAAP EPS in fiscal year '25, which reflects at least 30% total EPS growth on a two year basis. With that, I will turn it back over to Jason.\nJason Hollar: Thanks, Aaron. Now for some additional perspective on our businesses, beginning with Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, where our focus remains executing in the core to build upon our strong foundation. We're continuing to invest in our core business to drive operational efficiency and provide improved customer focus capabilities. At the same time, we have been evolving our commercial engagement strategies to get closer to the customer, better understand their complex needs, and provide proactive solutions. As an example, we've highlighted our first to market clinically integrated supply chain, the Cardinal Health InteLogix Platform, which deploys AI and machine learning through the Palantir Foundry platform to analyze real-time clinical and purchasing data to help providers reduce costs, optimize drug inventories, and streamline medication supply. We've also developed the Cardinal Health Atrix Elements offering, which is a suite of hospital reimbursement services that help improve hospitals' workflows and efficiencies. We've driven tremendous progress in our services for health systems, leading to the successful onboarding of a new key customer and additional new health system business coming in fiscal '25. We recently broke ground on our new 350,000 square Consumer Health Logistics Center in Central Ohio that we see as a differentiator in the marketplace. Over the past several years, we've experienced growing demand for over the counter consumer health products, which are an important part of our offering for retail pharmacy customers, particularly among our valued retail independent community pharmacies. With innovative technology and automation solutions powering the new facility, which will serve as a centralized replenishment center, we anticipate improved inventory efficiency across our network and providing unparalleled supply chain responsiveness for our customers. We see the rapid development of advanced automation technologies as an ongoing opportunity for our business. During the quarter, we deployed new sortation systems in a number of our distribution centers with a continual focus on employee safety, customer service, and operational efficiency. Turning to specialty, where we have and will continue to invest to accelerate our growth. As Aaron noted, our integration of Specialty Networks is underway and the reaction from the providers we serve and the energy from our new teammates has been extremely encouraging. Specialty Networks' mission as part of Cardinal Health remains creating clinical and economic value for independent physicians by lowering costs, operating more efficiently, and helping them deliver best-in-class care to their patients. We see greater opportunities together with the business' multi-specialty platform, proprietary technology, and deep clinical expertise being a natural extension of Cardinal Health's suite of solutions for specialty practices across the country. Specialty Networks expands our offerings with physicians in the areas of urology, GI, and rheumatology, while providing a proven platform in PPS analytics that we'll further invest into in fiscal '25 and look to extend to other therapeutic areas such as oncology. The platform's insight generation capabilities for clinicians are robust, which accelerates our upstream data and research opportunities with biopharma manufacturers. We see these and other capabilities as supporting our ongoing build-out of Navista, our clinician-designed oncology practice alliance, offering advanced services and technology. Navista's mission is to unlock the power of community oncologists to secure their independence and revolutionize patient centered cancer care. This build-out continues to progress according to plan as we actively pilot next-generation technologies and capabilities with select oncology practices. Upstream with manufacturers, we saw a strong performance from our biopharma solutions business during the quarter. With scaled assets, differentiated solutions, and a tenured team of experts, our leading specialty 3PL has supported 23 launches year-to-date through March with more anticipated in the coming quarters. Our 3PL and regulatory consulting capabilities helped pioneer the commercialization of the first CAR T-cell and gene therapies years ago, and we continue to bring innovative services to the market. Opening in May, our Advanced Therapy Innovation Center that features a deep frozen storage suite will support the complex storage requirements of cell and gene therapies. And we've seen our Advanced Therapy Solutions and Nuclear, Precision Health Solutions businesses successfully collaborating in support of cell and gene manufacturers. Turning to the GMPD business, where we're executing our GMPD Improvement Plan. We continued to drive momentum across the business in Q3 with strong sequential segment profit growth and significant improvement versus prior year. During the quarter, we offset approximately 90% of the gross inflation impact on our business, through the execution of our mitigation initiatives, commercial contracting efforts, and the continued realization of reduced costs for international freight, we're on track with our target to address these impacts by the time we exit fiscal '24. We are pleased to achieve 4% topline growth in the quarter, reflecting the improving health of our business. We saw growth across Cardinal Health brand and core distribution and in our domestic and international businesses. Specifically, our 5 point plan to grow Cardinal Health brand volumes continues to show positive trends across the key leading indicators. Our customer loyalty index score for U.S. distribution has increased by 14 points in the past two years and is up over 20 points from its pandemic low a few years ago. We successfully retained key distribution customers and the team is gearing up for some new customer implementations in the months ahead. Our product back orders remain near multi-year lows and we've continued to develop and commercialize new products, such as our Kendall pediatric sleeve to prevent deep vein thrombosis risk in young patients. We've noted our investments in the resiliency of our supply chain to better service our customers. In Q3, our efforts were recognized as the first distributor to achieve the highest rating by Healthcare Industry Resilience Collaborative's resiliency badge program, a key industry benchmark of our progress. Finally, we are executing our simplification initiatives across our business with a continued focus on optimizing our cost structure and global manufacturing and supply chain. In Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions, we're realizing continued double-digit growth in Theranostics, driven by the successful launch execution of new and advanced Theranostics in oncology. For example, we have realized meaningful growth in fiscal '24 from the adoption and growing demand of prostate cancer radio diagnostics, which are an important tool for healthcare providers to assess and properly treat the disease. We see a large, growing, and diversified pipeline, positioning our business to deliver value long into the future. The pipeline consists of more than 60 opportunities across oncology, cardiology, and neurology that are either contracted, in negotiations, or being actively explored with pharmaceutical companies. As an example, in oncology, we look forward to expanding our support level of novel prostate radioligand therapies in fiscal '25. As we look into the future, when you consider the strength of the Theranostics pipeline, only a handful of successful products are needed to deliver the strong growth outlined in our long-term targets. Our at-Home Solutions plays an instrumental role in providing patients and caregivers the critical products and services they need for care in the home. We continue to see strong demand for home healthcare and over the past decade, we've grown from servicing about 1 million customers annually to around 5 million today. Our business is positioned to accelerate in the coming years as we invest to expand the capacity of our network, the breadth of our offering, and deploy new automation technology. We're excited that our new distribution center being built in South Carolina, featuring the fastest order fulfillment system per square foot in the market, is scheduled to open by early next fiscal year. In OptiFreight Logistics, we continue to hear from our customers the value of our TotalVue Insights technology platform is providing as they seek to control their shipping spend and drive performance. Our technology provides action driving analytics and benchmarks with shipping status and delay visibility. We continue to invest in new technology driven solutions, and true to our commitment to innovation, we collaborate side-by-side with customers. For example, this quarter, we successfully co-developed and introduced a tailored pharmacy shipping solution with a strategic customer across multiple facilities. Across our businesses, opportunities are everywhere we look. We've affirmed our long-term targets for the enterprise and segments, which reflects Cardinal Health's ability to achieve sustained growth and deliver attractive returns for shareholders through an ongoing focus on value creation. We continue to prioritize the prudent management of our balance sheet and responsible capital allocation. We remain well-positioned with the financial flexibility to continue investing in our business and returning capital to shareholders. As part of our simplification journey, we are taking proactive actions to optimize our future cost structure and enhance our ability to grow well into the future. During the quarter, we took substantial steps to reduce our corporate real estate footprint and reorganized certain teams for greater efficiency and effectiveness. Our business review committee continues to make progress on our ongoing review of the GMPD business. We have no further updates to share today, but plan to keep you apprised of our progress. Driving the improvement plan remains our near-term priority and the team is making excellent progress. To close, we've had a strong first-three quarters of the year and are focused on sprinting through the tape. Plans are in place to deliver growth in fiscal '25 and beyond, and we're eager to continue delivering for our many stakeholders. None of this would be possible without our highly engaged and talented team, who continues to lean in, drive our company forward, and fulfill our critical role as healthcare's most trusted partner. With that, we will take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you very much, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Lisa Gill coming from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nLisa Gill: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Jason, I just really want to dig into the 2025 guidance that you've given, especially when we think about Rx and specialty business. We clearly know that revenue will be down because of the change Rx, I'm sorry, because of the OptumRx contract, but...\nOperator: Very sorry about that, gentlemen. Her line appears just to have dropped. So if she could just maybe dial back in, I will put her back in the queue. But now, we will move to Michael Cherny. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cherny: Good morning, and hopefully, my line won't drop. I probably had a similar question on Lisa, so hopefully you can address this directly. Relative to the '25 segment EBIT, as you think about the moving pieces here, maybe a two-part question. First, is there any way you can give us an underlying growth rate beyond the loss of Optum? And then second, as you think about the at least 1% segment performance, can you give us just a further breakdown on how much of that is volume growth versus mix versus new customers? Any more color you can provide on that as we think about the jumping off point and then how that factors into '26 would be great. Thanks so much.\nAaron Alt: Good morning. This is Aaron. I appreciate the question, and happy to provide a little more context. I want to start by observing that the PS&S team has got -- have strong plans for '25 as they continue to deliver against what was a very strong fiscal '24. We had provided long-term guidance for PS&S of 4% to 6% profit growth. As we now think about that in comparison to the guidance we provided today of at least 1% profit growth within that segment, the delta, you should think about it is really the impact of profit -- net impact of profit so far relative to the Optum business. And the simple math I do is, if you take the midpoint of our long-term guidance, the 5%, each percentage point is worth about $20 million. You take it down to the 1% -- at least 1% that we've guided, that's about an $80 million net impact so far that we are working through. So that's the profit guide I would give you. On the revenue side, I would observe that we've already provided the impact that fiscal '23 was about 16% of our revenue. Fiscal '24, not yet done, will land somewhere between $35 billion and $40 billion of revenue. Back that out, but recognizing that the portfolio is still growing 10% or so as we push ahead. And then lastly, on the cash flow side of the house, I hope you noted my comments that we are holding to our average of $2 billion of adjusted cash flow each year in the '24 to '26 period. It will be lower in '25 as we work-through the negative working capital position from that non-renewed contract and a days of week impact. But this is manageable and as you -- I hope you take away from the fact we're calling growth as we push ahead for PS&S. We have plans in place. Jason, anything you want to add?\nJason Hollar: Yeah. Just I'll build out a little bit further the puts and takes for '25. As Aaron highlighted and scoped it, the delta is a net approximately $80 million when you look at the -- those different reference points. So, that obviously implies an Optum impact of something greater than that, that's being partially mitigated through several different items that we've called out. One is the other customer progress that we've had. So this value proposition is definitely resonating well with our customers and so we've had good win rates in other areas. And so, that would allow us some opportunity to partially offset that, that's included in that net $80 million, as well as the inclusion of Specialty Networks. So overall, specialty growth, we expect to continue to be strong. And then we have the Specialty Networks acquisition that closed last month. So we'll get kind of a three quarter type of year-over-year benefit, because we'll have it in our fourth quarter as well and the ongoing growth with that. And then there's some opportunity to further reduce cost by streamlining our processes even further, simplifying even further. So, overall, we feel really good about those offsets and that gets us to that net about 4 percentage points that we're calling out right now.\nMatt Sims: Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. We'll now move to George Hill of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nGeorge Hill: Yeah. Good morning, guys. And Jason, I kind of have a question around the intersection of the competitive environment in specialty. The industry has been pretty stable without any large contract switches for a while, though, we saw two kind of in the last handful of months. And my question is, like, given the composition of assets in the pharmaceutical business right now, are you seeing more of a demand for what I would call like cross functional service where people want to see core pharmaceutical distribution with other parts of specialty with -- as it relates to oncology and just trying to figure out, like, how do you guys deal with the breadth of solutions that you offer as the competitive environment evolves?\nJason Hollar: Yeah. There's a couple of things I think about this, George. First of all, thanks for the question. As I step back and think about just the backdrop of your question on the competitive environment, there -- while there are a couple changing hands, as you highlighted, I think the overall market continues to behave in a very rational way. We continue to be very thoughtful and disciplined in how we participate within it. And it's the exception of those contracts changing hands. The vast majority of contracts don't change hands as they come up for renewal. So I don't think that that -- it changes things. And you -- while you're still stepping back from everything, our role ultimately on the distribution side is to safely, securely, and efficiently deliver these products for our customers, that hasn't changed. Now, I think your question is, are there other elements that make that evolve further. Hey, we've got the full suite of services. We are building those out further. I think our customers always are looking for opportunities where we can add additional value. That hasn't changed either. It just evolves as to where they are most focused, and each customer has a little bit different value proposition from which to build from. So that will resonate better with some customers than others. And our objective is to continue to build out those capabilities, both upstream and downstream, so that we can be that full service supplier and partner to ensure that we can help them grow their business.\nAaron Alt: George, I would add one further thought, which is, as you see from examples like our acquisition of Specialty Networks, of course, we continue to work to get closer to the ultimate practitioner, so that we are prepared to offer the incremental services that the industry is demanding.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now move to Lisa Gill of JP Morgan. Please go ahead again.\nLisa Gill: Good morning, and thank you, and hopefully, this time it will work. So my question was actually asked, but I wanted to just really dig in just a little bit deeper. As I think about the cadence for 2025, I know you're not giving specific guidance, but maybe even first half, second half, as we think about some of the comments you made, for example, simplifying costs, right, that'll...\nOperator: Okay. Very sorry about that. It would appear we're -- I'm very sorry, gentlemen. It's just that her line has dropped.\nJason Hollar: Well -- yeah, I think we can understand where she was going with trying to build out further for first half versus second half. So, the one thing I would stress, let's talk about the puts and takes and the timing of the puts and takes. So this customer migration will be somewhat of a cliff event at the end of the fiscal year. So, the June 30 to July 1, which is exactly the beginning of the fiscal year. So, that first quarter, we'll see that volume drop off fairly precipitously. And then the other business that we've won, some of it is already feathering in, some of it will continue over the course of the year, and we've highlighted in our comments a lot of it will be in the second half of fiscal '25. So, the timing of that, that piece of the puts and takes will be a little bit more second half weighted. Especially networks I referenced, that is a nice tailwind that is going to start benefiting us. It's included in our guidance for the fourth quarter, but we'll have three quarters of year-over-year performance driven by that business being added in and the continued just overall growth of utilization over the course of next year that we expect as well. The other cost actions will be varied. There's some things we've been planning for this for quite some time. And so, some of those cost actions will be in place by the end of the year. Some of those will need to take time to allow our operations to settle with that lower volume. So this is a customer that beyond it being -- it's a large and growing customer. So we definitely liked that volume. At the same time, it was a customer that had a lot of non-standard and customized processes and the demand profile was a bit more volatile. So we'll be able to operate more efficiently as this volume exits, but that won't necessarily be a day one type of thing. It will take us a little bit of time to get the each of the individual sites to be flowing with the new product that is coming in, but also just optimizing with the existing product. So the puts and takes there are all items that we start to see some mitigation at the very beginning of the fiscal year and then build over the course of the year.\nOperator: Thanks.\nMatt Sims: Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. We'll now move to Allen Lutz, calling from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAllen Lutz: Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. We've heard anecdotally that generic prices are a little bit firmer this time versus maybe last year. Can you talk a little bit about buy side and sell side pricing here of generics and maybe how gross profit dollars in that part of the business in generics are trending versus...\nAaron Alt: So, thanks for the question. What we would tell you is, as we continue to be in an environment of consistent market dynamics, where we see stability on the buy and the sell within our generic business. As we've talked about in the past, the stability that comes with that is when we see a rising tide of volume and a strong prescription demand environment, which we have, we continue to see strength in the generics portfolio, and that's where we are. We are aware that others have made comments somewhat variant from that over time, but we see consistent market dynamics and view that stability as a strength of our portfolio.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now move to Kevin Caliendo, calling from UBS. Please go ahead.\nKevin Caliendo: Thanks. I'll try to ask quickly before it gets dropped. Can you help us bridge on the medical side sort of the inputs to get to your fiscal '25 operating income from sort of where we are today? What are the most important factors that will get us from sort of where we are with the run rate through fiscal 3Q of '24 to the expected numbers in fiscal '25? And then just a quick follow-up. Does the loss of Optum and your partner in Red Oak also lost a large payer contract. Has that affected Red Oak in any way, shape, or form or your purchasing power or your economics there? I'm just wondering how to think about that, because it's two sizable chunks of business, but I just don't know how to think about the impact on Red Oak. Thank you.\nAaron Alt: Why don't I start with the med cadence and then turn over to Jason to talk further about Red Oak? Look, the med, the -- or rather the GMPD business, we are executing against the plan that we've now been talking about for several quarters. And a couple of numbers on the page. Fiscal year '23, it was a negative $165 million; in fiscal '24 today, we've confirmed we're calling a positive $65 million. That's about a $230 million swing, which puts us halfway to the fiscal '26 target of $300 million. Fiscal '25, we've called today, will be approximately $175 million, really a midpoint between those. How we get there is how we have gotten -- how we've gotten halfway there so far. The single biggest initiative, single biggest impact to those numbers is continuing to achieve the inflation mitigation that we've been talking about for several quarters. We exited Q3 at about 90%. We expect to achieve full mitigation by the end of the fiscal year. But as we move into next year, of course, we'll be lapping the lower percentage execution. So that will be tailwind. That will be significant tailwind for us certainly in the first half and, indeed, the first -- for the full year. It's also important that we continue to see the good revenue growth and, in particular, the good volume and revenue growth tied to the Cardinal Health brand is that is a broader -- that is a more profitable part of our business. I know you noticed that in Q1, we called out a positive change in trend relative to the revenue in that business. Q2, we saw 2% growth. Q4 we saw 4% growth. And so, we're seeing signs of progress that give us reasons to believe that we can achieve both the $65 million this year and the $175 million next year. Lastly, on the cadence and the importance, the team will continue to do what they've been doing around simplification and cost out, right? It's a very complex business and the team has been doing a good job of simplifying and identifying sources of cost this year, and that will continue into next year as well. Jason, anything you want to add or talk about Red Oak?\nJason Hollar: Nothing to add on that component. As it relates to Red Oak, we feel very good about the scale and competitiveness of that venture -- joint venture that we have with CVS. The combined volume that we both bring is sufficient to have significant scale in the space. The percentage of volume that was related to the lost customer is quite small relative to the total that we have that remains. So we feel good about our -- continuing our mandate of both continued value for our partners and, ultimately, our customers and as well as the dual mandate aspect of also driving supply as much as possible.\nKevin Caliendo: Thank you, sir.\nMatt Sims: Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll now go to Eric Percher, calling from Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nEric Percher: Thank you. A couple of modest items relative to Pharma that I wanted to tick through. One is, in discussing the headwind, penciling out to $80 million, you used the comment so far once or twice. Is that so far reflecting that there may be more mitigation or that this is influx? That would be one. Number two, is there a contemplation of any incentive comp reduction in '25 that would then reset in '26 in that mitigation? And the last one is, Specialty Networks, it sounds like you're expecting a benefit at the op profit line. I believe the comment when you closed it was it would be accretive 12 months following close. Any commentary on contribution there would be helpful as well. Thank you.\nJason Hollar: Yeah. So I -- the so far comment was simply to highlight that we are guiding to at least 1% growth. And so, that reference is entirely around, of course, we continue to look for other opportunities to mitigate further. And depending upon our success with those additional actions will be the answer to your question about incentive comp. We'll, of course, appropriately define a target with the alignment with our Board to ensure that we are motivated to drive the business forward. And then, as it relates to Specialty Networks, our underlying assumptions are unchanged. The accretive comment was -- you're right, Eric, that the reference point was a year after the close and that was including the dilutive effect on the interest. So, the lost interest on $1 billion, $1.2 billion is the offset to the operating earnings that we see within the Pharma business. So it's really just the geography of the plus and minus with that.\nAaron Alt: Eric, you had also asked about the impact to compensation plans. And the point I would make is, we set compensation plans on an annual basis for the management teams. And -- but we also have a long-term element, which is highlighted in our proxy, the targets there, and we'll continue to -- the teams will be continually motivated to hit those objectives.\nMatt Sims: Next question, please.\nOperator: Yes, gentlemen. The next question will be coming from Stephanie Davis of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nStephanie Davis: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. You called out a few new wins and expansions in the prepared remarks and you did highlight some customer progress that offsets the Optum headwinds. So I was hoping we can dig in there a little bit more. Can you tell us about the nature of these wins? Is this more core? Is it onc (ph)? Is it other ologies? And how much the bridge from FY \u201825 to the three year guidance relies on further progress with these wins versus more of the streamlining and cost-out that you've called out?\nJason Hollar: Yeah. So it's across various classes of trade. So it's broad based wins that we've received. We are not anticipating needing additional new wins beyond what we've already completed or in process of completing. And that's why when you think about the embedded guidance that we're talking about in terms of maintaining our long-term targets of that 4% to 6% growth, some years like this year were at the above the high end and next year, it will be a little bit below the low end, but the average is out to that 4% to 6%. And so, it implies a '26 and beyond type of rate that continues to be in that 4% to 6% range, which is kind of a normal -- normalized ongoing type of earnings level. So what -- how I step back and think about our progress to date, it really comes down to our service levels and our customer service and really listening to what is important to those customers and working with them for a solution that is not necessarily customized, it is standardized, but with their needs in mind. And we're getting fantastic feedback from our current customers in terms of what that service level has been that is translating over to the desire by customers that we're not working with today to consider using Cardinal Health. And so, we have the time, attention, and energy now that we're able to devote even more to those existing customers to streamline those processes in a little bit more of a simplified fashion, and we'll continue to drive that value proposition with those new customers. But it's very much a booked business type of perspective that we're now into execution mode. And after this year, fiscal '25, we'd expect it to be even more normalized at that point.\nAaron Alt: I would add a couple of things to that. First, you asked about cost-out, and my response or our response is that simplification has been a priority of ours for the last couple of years, and we will, of course, continue to go looking for ways we can simplify our operations and optimize our cost. But let me be clear, right, we are not backing away from customer support, particularly the new customers coming onboard, so that we do that seamlessly. And we're not backing away from investing in our future across our enterprise. And so, we will continue to talk about the highlights of those as we make them in future earnings calls, but we will optimize as appropriate, while focused on the long term.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. We'll now move to Eric Coldwell, calling from Baird. Please go ahead.\nEric Coldwell: Thanks, and good morning. I wanted to talk a bit about specialty in general and then tie in Specialty Networks. So, in the recent past, you've given a sizing of your overall specialty business in the low-to-mid $30 billion range. You will lose some of that with the Optum roll off, probably $3.5 billion, $4 billion, I'm guessing. You're going to add some with Specialty Networks, and then you have normal market growth. So, netting this all together, what would you anticipate the baseline specialty business to be sized at when you start fiscal '25?\nJason Hollar: So, those are a number of puts and takes that as you noticed, I'm sure, Eric, we did not provide revenue guidance in this update. We will be providing that in the next update, of course. So, certainly, you're in the ballpark on the Optum piece, as I've highlighted before, that is about 10% of that overall book of business. That specialty, everything else would be, PD, non-specialty. And Specialty Networks, the revenue is quite low, because it's the service revenue, it's not distribution revenue. So that's what I would think of independent is that we, of course, would expect our non-Optum specialty revenue to continue to grow nicely and we will frame that, but don't think about that as something specifically related to Specialty Networks.\nOperator: Thank you very much. Next question is coming from Elizabeth Anderson, calling from Evercore. Please go ahead.\nElizabeth Anderson: Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about -- more about GMPD. It seems like the competitive environment maybe is improving in your favor. It seems like maybe there's some benefit from underlying just like utilization demand. Could you please just give us a little bit more color on sort of those underlying changing dynamics in more -- maybe more conceptually and about some of the specific cost-cutting and other inflation offsets that you've already talked about?\nJason Hollar: Yeah. I think the competitive environment, I'm not sure I'd put much into that. Our performance within this industry has improved dramatically. I referenced in my comments, the customer loyalty scores improve -- have improved consistently and dramatically from the bottom of the pandemic a couple of years ago. So, our performance is noticeable. Our customers are feeling it. That customer loyalty index, the scores behind it improving, because we have -- we have the low back order, we have product availability, we have great service levels. We're very engaged from a sales force perspective. So we're out there now selling instead of reacting to the challenges of the pandemic. So our customers are feeling that. We have very stable win/loss types of rates. We're growing at least with the market now. So it's more of us showing up, I think, the right way than the market being overly growing more or growing less. The market utilization continues to be more and more normalized. So there's maybe a little bit of volatility here and there, but it's much more normalized compared to where it has been in the last several years. So, not -- that -- and that's the environment we like. We like to see predictable, consistent lower-single digit type of utilization rates that we can grow a little bit above that through our mix and other actions. And then, of course, as Aaron highlighted, the single biggest driver, not only this past year, but that -- what we expect at least in the first half of next year, would be just the lapping of the inflation impacts and everything we've done to mitigate that. Which -- that's another thing that's helpful for us to get that behind us so that we're focused on selling and talking to our customers about the value that we can help provide them, as opposed to dealing with inflationary fluctuations that have occurred in the past. So we're well-positioned to now drive the other elements of the medical -- the GMPD Improvement Plan, which is the ongoing simplification, the ongoing cost reductions, but just continuing to really prioritize more than anything the Cardinal Health brand volume growth.\nMatt Sims: Next question, please.\nOperator: Yes, sir. The next question will be coming from Stephen Baxter, calling from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nStephen Baxter: Hi, thanks. Just one quick confirmation and the actual question. I think what you're suggesting is that beyond fiscal 2025, there is no direct or indirect impact from the Optum contract loss to contemplate. Just wanted to confirm that point, that there's not any kind of earnings contribution from a transitional period inside the 2025 thinking. And then the actual question is just on the Other segment. The revenue growth has been quite strong. It's taken a little bit for the profit growth to kind of catch up to your long-term expectations. Just remind us what the key kind of moving parts are there to accelerate the profit growth in the next couple of years. Thanks.\nAaron Alt: So, an answer to your first question, our guide today does confirm the long-term growth within the Pharma business of 4% to 6%. It will be off a lower base in fiscal '25 as we grow at least the 1%. We've not commented on an absolute dollar basis, but we will provide more context on that when we get to our year end results and final guidance for fiscal '25 during our August earnings call. With respect to the Other business, we are pleased with what we're seeing so far. We re-segmented the operation to create additional transparency, focus, and accountability, and I referenced in my prepared remarks that we are already seeing the benefit of that. The topline results are good, right? And we guided 6% to 8% profit growth for this year. We were a little bit lower than that in Q3 for the businesses aggregating in Other so far. And of course, we had the impact of some of the non-recurring adjustments that we called out in Q2 tied to the at-Home business, which reports into Other in the second quarter. But I want to emphasize, we did confirm that we are expecting to achieve the higher results, the 8% to 10% for fiscal '24 and we confirm the high end of that range for fiscal '25, as Jason digs in with the businesses now reporting directly to them and as we invest as an enterprise against setting those businesses up for a higher growth trajectory.\nJason Hollar: Yeah. Just a couple of things to add. First, on the first question, just to be real explicit, given it's a cliff event customer transition that we are anticipating for July 1, we'd anticipate that that would be largely in fiscal '25 results and there's nothing that we're calling out or indicating at this point that would carry over into '26. And as it relates to the Other businesses, how I think about them, they're each growing very nicely. They each have strong industry, strong sectors of the industry that are benefiting from their own individual secular tailwinds. So, they each have different reasons for their growth. But ultimately, it's because that each of these three areas provide a real interesting value proposition to customers and, ultimately, to the patients. And each of these three, we have a leadership position in. So we're not only benefiting from that secular trend, but we're leading and maintaining or growing our own fair share within it. So we're well positioned for each one of these three and why we have confidence about them. We are investing into them, as Aaron highlighted. That's driving the growth that we believe will be driving long-term profitability as well.\nMatt Sims: Next question, please.\nOperator: Yes, sir. The next question will be coming from Charles Rhyee of TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nLucas Romanski: Hi. This is Lucas on for Charles. I wanted to ask about Cardinal Health brand and get a sense of where we're at on the path to realizing $50 million in targeted growth by fiscal '26. I understand that you've expanded the number of products you offer under private label and that you're starting to see momentum in growing volumes. Can you help us understand how much of that $50 million has already been realized? And then how much we should expect you guys to realize in fiscal '25? Thanks.\nJason Hollar: Yeah. So I'd -- the -- it's a -- we inflected a couple of quarters ago, right? You saw that with our overall revenue growth that is partly driven by the Cardinal Health brand volume growth. So we saw, for example, this quarter, our revenue growth of 4% was pro-rated within that national brand, as well as Cardinal Health brand, so, we're seeing distribution stabilize. We're seeing that. We've won some business there that has allowed us to grow at or a little bit better than the market. So, overall, we're seeing that this business has now stabilized at a growth consistent with the market. We expect that to continue. This is something that we do have as a component of that growth. As Aaron highlighted, the single biggest driver of profit performance for '25 -- from '24 to '25 is the annualization, the carryover of the inflationary pressure. So that's the biggest item of that implied $100 million, $110 million year-over-year profit improvement. Then beyond that, you have Cardinal Health brand volume growth, cost reductions, and other actions. And so, it is a component, it's not the biggest component. And then it would be a -- from '25 to '26, the primary components that then drive that growth would be Cardinal Health brand volume, as well as further cost reductions as we continue to look to streamline and optimize our footprint, as well as our other supporting cost. So, we're not going to break out the individual pieces there, but those are the biggest pieces then when you go from '25 to '26.\nMatt Sims: Next question, please.\nOperator: Yes, sir. Our last question today will be coming from Daniel Grosslight of Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDaniel Grosslight: Hey, guys. Most of my questions have been asked, but I was hoping to just get an update on Navista and any metrics you're able to share on the market adoption you're seeing there, number of providers aligned to it, etc. And I know one of the key strategic objectives of the Specialty Networks acquisition was to kind of integrate some of their technology, notably PSS Analytics (ph) into Navista and other specialty assets. I'm also curious if you can provide an update on how quickly you can integrate that technology and Murphy, you've already kind of started on that path. Thank you.\nJason Hollar: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Daniel. And so, with Navista, we are on track to everything that we've laid out first raising this about a year ago. I mean, as I think about the progress we've made, I'd break it into a few key buckets. First of all -- first and foremost, we've hired and brought in a fantastic team, a great mixture of internal and external talent, really drawing from industry those that have done this before and understand what that looks like, but also using our own expertise that have been more focused in other therapeutic areas, but a nice augmentation of the two. And then that new team quickly went to work and defined what went in front of our customers and prospective customers and really listened as to what is it that they need to run their practice, their business more efficiently, more effectively. And it was through that work that we then came to the final point, which is defining the tools, the capabilities that we are building within Navista. So, we didn't just go off and build it. We are building it around what the customers are demanding that they need, those community oncologists, those independent community oncologists, really looking at differentiating for what they need to run their business, both again, efficiently, but also effectively to further improve upon the lives of their patients. So that is the work that's been done, and we are every day building out more elements of this. So I wouldn't think about it as a particular date that everything goes live and we suddenly have this influx of volume. This is the type of thing that builds out our capability over time in different ways and working with our current customers, as well as the prospective ones to layer in when they come into this network and which services they utilize within the network. So that leads you to the Specialty Networks piece, which I would think about it as we now have an internal technology and capability set that's augmenting what we had before. But Navista always approached this in terms of the best of the best in the industry. Using what we have is great, but we also are using a lot of third-party partners to bring in their tools and capabilities, because we're going to put the customers' needs first, the providers' needs first and then build around that. So we do see that there is a role for Specialty Networks and their PPS Analytics platform, but we're not going to make that the priority. We're going to listen to the customers and then determine which pieces of that to bring into that network. So we haven't finalized those decisions as it relates to Specialty Networks. But what I will tell you, on day one, just having that team's insight and expertise has been very beneficial to our own Navista team. So having -- and I mentioned this when we announced the acquisition of Specialty Networks. Yeah, the assets are fantastic. The business is fantastic. But the most important thing for us was the leadership team and the capabilities that they're bringing along with it is every bit as great as what we thought it was when we made the announcement. And we're seeing that with boots on the ground now as we work, not just within Navista, but with the broader business to further improve our capabilities across all the therapeutic areas.\nOperator: Thank you very much, gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I turn the call back over to Mr. Jason Hollar for any additional or closing remarks. Thank you.\nJason Hollar: Yeah. Thank you. Just to close, appreciate everyone spending some time with us this morning. We hope the overall message that you took away from the call today is that we have a strong and resilient business and a very clear plan for us for '25 and '26, and we're excited about the opportunities and ensuring that our customers and their patients continue to get fantastic service. So thanks again for joining us today and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your attendance. You may disconnect. Have a good day and goodbye.",

            "name": "Aaron Alt",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason. This morning, we are reporting our financial results on the new financial reporting segment structure we implemented at the beginning of Q3. To that end, we released an 8-K on April 23, which provided the recast historical quarterly results for fiscal year '22, fiscal year '23, and fiscal year '24 through Q2, reflective of the new segmentation for Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, GMPD, and Other. As we called out at the time, the new segmentation is designed to provide greater transparency, focus, and accountability across our businesses, and we are already seeing those benefits. Overall, Q3 was a strong quarter with double-digit operating earnings growth and 20% EPS growth. We accomplished that growth, while at the same time leaning in and making significant investments of time, expense and capital against our longer-term strategic plan. With both continued confidence in our strategies and a resilient business and team, we are pleased to once again raise our EPS guidance for fiscal year '24, more on that shortly. As seen on Slide 4, total company revenue increased 9% to $55 billion, reflecting revenue growth in the Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, the GMPD segment, and in all of the businesses making up Other. We were particularly pleased to see the second consecutive quarter of revenue growth in GMPD at 4%. We are also pleased that gross margin increased 9% to $1.9 billion. While consolidated SG&A also increased just under 9% to $1.3 billion in the quarter, the increased amount reflects technology and other purposeful investments against the future of the business and higher costs to support sales growth. With strong broad-based profit growth, we delivered operating earnings of $666 million, 10% higher than last year. Moving below the line, interest and other was generally consistent with the prior year at $26 million, and our third quarter effective tax rate of 20.4% was better than we expected due to positive discrete items. As a result of our prior share repurchases, Q3 average diluted shares outstanding were 245 million, 5% lower than a year ago. As I mentioned earlier, the net result for Q3 was EPS of $2.08, reflecting growth of 20%. Now turning to the segments, beginning with Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions on Slide 5. Third quarter revenue increased 9% to $50.7 billion, driven by brand and specialty pharmaceutical sales growth. We continued to see strong pharmaceutical demand across product categories, brand, specialty, consumer health and generics, and from our largest customers. While we again saw robust demand for GLP-1 medications, recall that we had guided that the revenue growth rate would moderate this quarter, as it did, given the acceleration that we started to realize last year during Q3. Excluding GLP-1 sales, the segment's Q3 revenue growth would be 7%. As we previously noted, these sales did not meaningfully contribute to the bottom line. Segment profit increased 4% to $580 million in the third quarter, driven by positive generics program performance. Our generics program continued to see both volume growth and consistent market dynamics. Within our brand and specialty products, demand for COVID-19 vaccines in the quarter was, consistent with our expectations, not a meaningful contributor. As anticipated and guided, lower branded inflation than last year's relative high point was a year-over-year drag on profit growth. So, overall, we were pleased to deliver 4% segment profit growth in Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, solid growth on top of an exceptionally strong quarter a year ago, which grew 23%. Turning to the GMPD segment on Slide 6. Revenue grew for the second quarter in a row by 4% in Q3 to $3.1 billion. This increase was driven by volume growth from existing customers. The GMPD segment delivered segment profit of $20 million, a $66 million year-over-year increase, driven by an improvement in net inflationary impacts, including our mitigation initiatives. GMPD continued its strong turnaround trajectory, achieving its highest level of quarterly profitability in the last two and a half years. We continue to be encouraged by the underlying improvements in the business, driven by the team's efforts against the GMPD Improvement Plan. As a reminder, the components of the former Medical Improvement Plan are now split between GMPD and Other, and the plan continues to be on track. The team achieved notable progress on inflation mitigation in the quarter, and we again saw a year-over-year improvement and growth in Cardinal Health brand volumes, providing continued fuel for the business' ongoing turnaround. Finishing with the businesses that aggregate into Other, as seen on Slide 7. Third quarter revenue increased 14% to $1.2 billion due to growth across all three businesses, at-Home Solutions, Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions, and OptiFreight Logistics. Collectively, the businesses grew segment profit in the quarter by 5%, with OptiFreight Logistics showing particular strength as we worked during the quarter to create the foundations for future profit growth in all of the businesses. Jason will further discuss our excitement around these businesses and some of the recent trends momentarily. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a strong cash position with $3.7 billion of cash and equivalents on the balance sheet. Year-to-date, we've generated $2.1 billion of adjusted free cash flow and have continued to deploy capital according to our disciplined capital allocation framework, including investing approximately $320 million in CapEx back into the business to drive organic growth and funding the $1.2 billion acquisition of Specialty Networks. Over the past several years, we've made tremendous progress with our balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we received a further update to our ratings outlook with Moody's moving our outlook to positive. We issued $1.15 billion in new notes during the quarter to refinance our upcoming June and November debt maturities. We plan to hold the cash proceeds and time deposits until the calendar year 2024 maturities come due. I'll note, due to the nature of these contracts, only about half of the total cash received is reflected in our Q3 ending cash balance. The remaining $550 million is recorded in prepaid expenses and other on the balance sheet. We have returned over $1 billion total to shareholders year-to-date, which includes approximately $375 million of quarterly dividend payments and $750 million in share repurchases, which is in excess of our committed baseline repurchase of $500 million. Now for our updated fiscal '24 guidance on Slide 9, beginning with the enterprise. We are raising and narrowing our fiscal year '24 non-GAAP EPS guidance. Our new range of $7.30 to $7.40 reflects a midpoint, which is 27% above our fiscal '23 EPS results. We started the year working to deliver our guidance of 14% EPS growth at the midpoint. What a year it has been so far. Before we turn to the segments, a few comments on our enterprise assumptions. With the year-to-date results, we are improving our fiscal '24 effective tax rate guidance to an updated range of 22% to 23%. And we are reiterating our fiscal '24 expectations for adjusted free cash flow of approximately $2.5 billion, for CapEx of around $500 million, for diluted shares of approximately 247 million, and for share repurchases of $750 million which, consistent with our framework, does not assume further repurchase activity this year. Now turning to the fiscal '24 outlook for our new segment reporting structure, as seen on Slide 10. With another solid quarter from Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, we are raising and narrowing our segment profit guidance for the full year to 8.5% to 9.5% growth, which at the midpoint implies continued mid-single digit profit growth in the fourth quarter. We are reiterating our guide for GMPD segment profit of approximately $65 million for fiscal year '24. We continue to expect to address the impact of inflation as we exit fiscal '24, along with continued Cardinal Health brand volume growth and benefits from our continued cost savings initiatives. Additionally, we anticipate a positive impact from seasonality in Q4 compared to Q3. We are also reiterating our segment profit guide for the Other businesses, 6% to 8% segment profit growth for the full year, given that we expect a strong Q4 for those businesses. On the topline, we now expect Other full year revenue growth of approximately 12%. So, as I highlighted earlier, we are raising our guidance for fiscal year '24 to $7.30 to $7.40. Finally, let me conclude my remarks by providing a guidance preview for fiscal year '25. We will provide formal fiscal year '25 guidance during our Q4 and full year earnings call in August. However, with the benefits of our raised fiscal year '24 expectations and the action plans already underway in response to recent market changes, here is our preliminary perspective. For our largest business, Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, while revenue will reset in the year as we offset a recent customer non-renewal, we notably expect to deliver at least 1% segment profit growth in fiscal year '25 before returning to more normalized growth in fiscal year '26. Looking forward, our commercial and operational teams have been busy, and our value proposition is resonating in the marketplace. Over the past several months, we have had some attractive wins with new customers and some existing customers are expanding their own footprints with us. Some of these are already under contract and ordering and others are scheduled for implementation in the second half of next fiscal year. So, over the course of the upcoming year, we expect new volume coming our way at sustainable margins. We completed the Specialty Networks acquisition quickly, which will be additive to our efforts in fiscal year '25. Separately, we have turned a further eye to optimizing our cost structure across our corporate functional footprint and across the Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions portfolio. Regarding environmental factors, we are expecting brand inflation to be roughly equivalent to fiscal '24 levels, while we remain watchful relative to the contribution of COVID-19 vaccines. For the GMPD segment, we expect continued growth in fiscal year '25 on our path to approximately $300 million in segment profit by fiscal year '26, driven by the annualization of inflation mitigation, progress with Cardinal Health brand growth, and continued simplification and cost optimization. We expect approximately $175 million in GMPD segment profit in fiscal year '25. And for the businesses included in Other, we expect the strong demand we've seen across these businesses to continue. With positive industry trends and the strength of our competitive positioning, we expect collective segment profit growth in fiscal year '25 at the top end of our long-term target approximately 10%. During fiscal '25, we will be investing across all of our businesses, with key examples being new facilities like our Consumer Health Logistics Center, at-Home Solutions facilities in Texas and South Carolina, and further geographic reach of our Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions' PET network. We will also continue our build-out of Navista and investments in GMPD supply chain resiliency. Now a few call-outs below the line and with the balance sheet. We anticipate a significant step-up in interest and other next year, primarily due to much lower average cash balances due to cash already deployed for Specialty Networks and due to the one-time unwinding of negative net working capital from the large contract non-renewal. We also expect lower short-term investment rates on cash and higher interest rates on debt resulting from the refinancing of our calendar 2024 maturities, leading to an interest and other range of $160 million to $190 million in fiscal year '25. We expect our fiscal year '25 effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 24%, slightly higher year-over-year due to discrete favorability seen this year. Partially offsetting these impacts, we would expect a lower share count between 244 million and 245 million due to the $500 million of baseline share repurchases we've previously outlined. Finally, while we continue to expect to generate adjusted free cash flow of approximately $2 billion on average from fiscal 2024 to 2026, we think it is important to call out that fiscal 2025 will be lower than that average, primarily due to the large contract unwind, as well as quarter end day of week timing. These dynamics will significantly influence our cash flow in Q1 of next year. However, our strong investment grade balance sheet positions us well to manage through these fluctuations. With respect to the long term, it is full speed ahead. We are reiterating our fiscal year '24 through '26 targets for the enterprise and segments and expect to deliver at least $7.50 of non-GAAP EPS in fiscal year '25, which reflects at least 30% total EPS growth on a two year basis. With that, I will turn it back over to Jason. Good morning. This is Aaron. I appreciate the question, and happy to provide a little more context. I want to start by observing that the PS&S team has got -- have strong plans for '25 as they continue to deliver against what was a very strong fiscal '24. We had provided long-term guidance for PS&S of 4% to 6% profit growth. As we now think about that in comparison to the guidance we provided today of at least 1% profit growth within that segment, the delta, you should think about it is really the impact of profit -- net impact of profit so far relative to the Optum business. And the simple math I do is, if you take the midpoint of our long-term guidance, the 5%, each percentage point is worth about $20 million. You take it down to the 1% -- at least 1% that we've guided, that's about an $80 million net impact so far that we are working through. So that's the profit guide I would give you. On the revenue side, I would observe that we've already provided the impact that fiscal '23 was about 16% of our revenue. Fiscal '24, not yet done, will land somewhere between $35 billion and $40 billion of revenue. Back that out, but recognizing that the portfolio is still growing 10% or so as we push ahead. And then lastly, on the cash flow side of the house, I hope you noted my comments that we are holding to our average of $2 billion of adjusted cash flow each year in the '24 to '26 period. It will be lower in '25 as we work-through the negative working capital position from that non-renewed contract and a days of week impact. But this is manageable and as you -- I hope you take away from the fact we're calling growth as we push ahead for PS&S. We have plans in place. Jason, anything you want to add? George, I would add one further thought, which is, as you see from examples like our acquisition of Specialty Networks, of course, we continue to work to get closer to the ultimate practitioner, so that we are prepared to offer the incremental services that the industry is demanding. So, thanks for the question. What we would tell you is, as we continue to be in an environment of consistent market dynamics, where we see stability on the buy and the sell within our generic business. As we've talked about in the past, the stability that comes with that is when we see a rising tide of volume and a strong prescription demand environment, which we have, we continue to see strength in the generics portfolio, and that's where we are. We are aware that others have made comments somewhat variant from that over time, but we see consistent market dynamics and view that stability as a strength of our portfolio. Why don't I start with the med cadence and then turn over to Jason to talk further about Red Oak? Look, the med, the -- or rather the GMPD business, we are executing against the plan that we've now been talking about for several quarters. And a couple of numbers on the page. Fiscal year '23, it was a negative $165 million; in fiscal '24 today, we've confirmed we're calling a positive $65 million. That's about a $230 million swing, which puts us halfway to the fiscal '26 target of $300 million. Fiscal '25, we've called today, will be approximately $175 million, really a midpoint between those. How we get there is how we have gotten -- how we've gotten halfway there so far. The single biggest initiative, single biggest impact to those numbers is continuing to achieve the inflation mitigation that we've been talking about for several quarters. We exited Q3 at about 90%. We expect to achieve full mitigation by the end of the fiscal year. But as we move into next year, of course, we'll be lapping the lower percentage execution. So that will be tailwind. That will be significant tailwind for us certainly in the first half and, indeed, the first -- for the full year. It's also important that we continue to see the good revenue growth and, in particular, the good volume and revenue growth tied to the Cardinal Health brand is that is a broader -- that is a more profitable part of our business. I know you noticed that in Q1, we called out a positive change in trend relative to the revenue in that business. Q2, we saw 2% growth. Q4 we saw 4% growth. And so, we're seeing signs of progress that give us reasons to believe that we can achieve both the $65 million this year and the $175 million next year. Lastly, on the cadence and the importance, the team will continue to do what they've been doing around simplification and cost out, right? It's a very complex business and the team has been doing a good job of simplifying and identifying sources of cost this year, and that will continue into next year as well. Jason, anything you want to add or talk about Red Oak? Eric, you had also asked about the impact to compensation plans. And the point I would make is, we set compensation plans on an annual basis for the management teams. And -- but we also have a long-term element, which is highlighted in our proxy, the targets there, and we'll continue to -- the teams will be continually motivated to hit those objectives. I would add a couple of things to that. First, you asked about cost-out, and my response or our response is that simplification has been a priority of ours for the last couple of years, and we will, of course, continue to go looking for ways we can simplify our operations and optimize our cost. But let me be clear, right, we are not backing away from customer support, particularly the new customers coming onboard, so that we do that seamlessly. And we're not backing away from investing in our future across our enterprise. And so, we will continue to talk about the highlights of those as we make them in future earnings calls, but we will optimize as appropriate, while focused on the long term. So, an answer to your first question, our guide today does confirm the long-term growth within the Pharma business of 4% to 6%. It will be off a lower base in fiscal '25 as we grow at least the 1%. We've not commented on an absolute dollar basis, but we will provide more context on that when we get to our year end results and final guidance for fiscal '25 during our August earnings call. With respect to the Other business, we are pleased with what we're seeing so far. We re-segmented the operation to create additional transparency, focus, and accountability, and I referenced in my prepared remarks that we are already seeing the benefit of that. The topline results are good, right? And we guided 6% to 8% profit growth for this year. We were a little bit lower than that in Q3 for the businesses aggregating in Other so far. And of course, we had the impact of some of the non-recurring adjustments that we called out in Q2 tied to the at-Home business, which reports into Other in the second quarter. But I want to emphasize, we did confirm that we are expecting to achieve the higher results, the 8% to 10% for fiscal '24 and we confirm the high end of that range for fiscal '25, as Jason digs in with the businesses now reporting directly to them and as we invest as an enterprise against setting those businesses up for a higher growth trajectory."

            "name": "Jason Hollar",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. A year ago at our Investor Day, I reflected upon what attracted me to Cardinal Health, our strong culture, values, and mission to be healthcare's most trusted partner; how the company was uniquely positioned with its breadth and scale to navigate the complexities of the healthcare ecosystem and serve the needs of customers, manufacturers and ultimately, patients. At the same time, I was open about some of the opportunities in front of us as an organization. Together, we laid out a clear but aggressive strategic plan, streamlined our focus, and the team got to work, all the time prioritizing on our core business to emerge as a stronger, more resilient company. And we have a recent proof-point. Over the last several months, we deeply focused on preparing for a variety of alternatives regarding a particular large, low margin customer contract, which has allowed us to quickly navigate the upcoming contract change and confirm that we expect to grow our earnings in fiscal '25. By driving improvements in our core operations, investing to expand our offerings in key areas like specialty and evolving our commercial approach in ways which have resonated elsewhere in the marketplace, we demonstrated that we have made progress on positioning our business for sustained success and growth. As we look ahead, the current quarter's results reinforce our confidence. We're operating from a position of growing strength and resiliency, with industry trends that remain stable and in our favor. In Q3, we delivered broad-based growth, while executing on our four strategic priorities; building upon the growth and resiliency of pharmaceutical and specialty solutions, executing our GMPD improvement plan, accelerating growth in key areas, and maintaining a relentless focus on shareholder value creation. In our most significant business, Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, we again drove solid profit growth on top of a difficult comparison to last year's strong performance. We've seen ongoing stability in pharmaceutical demand, consistent market dynamics in our generics program, and strong performance in specialty, both downstream and upstream, all of which enables us to raise our fiscal '24 profit outlook for the segment to a midpoint of 9% growth. In GMPD, we are pleased to see the strong topline and bottom line performance, with an acceleration in growth reflecting further progress against the business' turnaround plan. GMPD's quarter was overall consistent with our expectations and the team is already working hard on the continued ramp-up in Q4. Among our other operating businesses, our new reporting structure implemented at the start of Q3 is reinforcing our focus on performance and purposeful investment in growth. The strong demand we are seeing across Nuclear, at-Home Solutions, and OptiFreight, fueled by favorable industry trends, excites us about the long-term potential as these markets and businesses continue to develop. And as we've optimized the financial strength of the broader enterprise, we've seen meaningful benefits below the operating line this year. Putting it all together, we're pleased to be in a position to raise our fiscal '24 EPS outlook, provide preliminary guidance for fiscal '25 of profit growth in each of Pharma, GMPD, and Other, as well as overall EPS, and reiterate our long-term targets for our businesses and enterprise. Our strategy and long-term outlook are unaltered and our team remains focused on executing our plan as we serve our customers and continue to drive our company forward. With that, let me turn it over to Aaron to review our Q3 results, fiscal '24 guidance, and early fiscal '25 outlook in more detail. Thanks, Aaron. Now for some additional perspective on our businesses, beginning with Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, where our focus remains executing in the core to build upon our strong foundation. We're continuing to invest in our core business to drive operational efficiency and provide improved customer focus capabilities. At the same time, we have been evolving our commercial engagement strategies to get closer to the customer, better understand their complex needs, and provide proactive solutions. As an example, we've highlighted our first to market clinically integrated supply chain, the Cardinal Health InteLogix Platform, which deploys AI and machine learning through the Palantir Foundry platform to analyze real-time clinical and purchasing data to help providers reduce costs, optimize drug inventories, and streamline medication supply. We've also developed the Cardinal Health Atrix Elements offering, which is a suite of hospital reimbursement services that help improve hospitals' workflows and efficiencies. We've driven tremendous progress in our services for health systems, leading to the successful onboarding of a new key customer and additional new health system business coming in fiscal '25. We recently broke ground on our new 350,000 square Consumer Health Logistics Center in Central Ohio that we see as a differentiator in the marketplace. Over the past several years, we've experienced growing demand for over the counter consumer health products, which are an important part of our offering for retail pharmacy customers, particularly among our valued retail independent community pharmacies. With innovative technology and automation solutions powering the new facility, which will serve as a centralized replenishment center, we anticipate improved inventory efficiency across our network and providing unparalleled supply chain responsiveness for our customers. We see the rapid development of advanced automation technologies as an ongoing opportunity for our business. During the quarter, we deployed new sortation systems in a number of our distribution centers with a continual focus on employee safety, customer service, and operational efficiency. Turning to specialty, where we have and will continue to invest to accelerate our growth. As Aaron noted, our integration of Specialty Networks is underway and the reaction from the providers we serve and the energy from our new teammates has been extremely encouraging. Specialty Networks' mission as part of Cardinal Health remains creating clinical and economic value for independent physicians by lowering costs, operating more efficiently, and helping them deliver best-in-class care to their patients. We see greater opportunities together with the business' multi-specialty platform, proprietary technology, and deep clinical expertise being a natural extension of Cardinal Health's suite of solutions for specialty practices across the country. Specialty Networks expands our offerings with physicians in the areas of urology, GI, and rheumatology, while providing a proven platform in PPS analytics that we'll further invest into in fiscal '25 and look to extend to other therapeutic areas such as oncology. The platform's insight generation capabilities for clinicians are robust, which accelerates our upstream data and research opportunities with biopharma manufacturers. We see these and other capabilities as supporting our ongoing build-out of Navista, our clinician-designed oncology practice alliance, offering advanced services and technology. Navista's mission is to unlock the power of community oncologists to secure their independence and revolutionize patient centered cancer care. This build-out continues to progress according to plan as we actively pilot next-generation technologies and capabilities with select oncology practices. Upstream with manufacturers, we saw a strong performance from our biopharma solutions business during the quarter. With scaled assets, differentiated solutions, and a tenured team of experts, our leading specialty 3PL has supported 23 launches year-to-date through March with more anticipated in the coming quarters. Our 3PL and regulatory consulting capabilities helped pioneer the commercialization of the first CAR T-cell and gene therapies years ago, and we continue to bring innovative services to the market. Opening in May, our Advanced Therapy Innovation Center that features a deep frozen storage suite will support the complex storage requirements of cell and gene therapies. And we've seen our Advanced Therapy Solutions and Nuclear, Precision Health Solutions businesses successfully collaborating in support of cell and gene manufacturers. Turning to the GMPD business, where we're executing our GMPD Improvement Plan. We continued to drive momentum across the business in Q3 with strong sequential segment profit growth and significant improvement versus prior year. During the quarter, we offset approximately 90% of the gross inflation impact on our business, through the execution of our mitigation initiatives, commercial contracting efforts, and the continued realization of reduced costs for international freight, we're on track with our target to address these impacts by the time we exit fiscal '24. We are pleased to achieve 4% topline growth in the quarter, reflecting the improving health of our business. We saw growth across Cardinal Health brand and core distribution and in our domestic and international businesses. Specifically, our 5 point plan to grow Cardinal Health brand volumes continues to show positive trends across the key leading indicators. Our customer loyalty index score for U.S. distribution has increased by 14 points in the past two years and is up over 20 points from its pandemic low a few years ago. We successfully retained key distribution customers and the team is gearing up for some new customer implementations in the months ahead. Our product back orders remain near multi-year lows and we've continued to develop and commercialize new products, such as our Kendall pediatric sleeve to prevent deep vein thrombosis risk in young patients. We've noted our investments in the resiliency of our supply chain to better service our customers. In Q3, our efforts were recognized as the first distributor to achieve the highest rating by Healthcare Industry Resilience Collaborative's resiliency badge program, a key industry benchmark of our progress. Finally, we are executing our simplification initiatives across our business with a continued focus on optimizing our cost structure and global manufacturing and supply chain. In Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions, we're realizing continued double-digit growth in Theranostics, driven by the successful launch execution of new and advanced Theranostics in oncology. For example, we have realized meaningful growth in fiscal '24 from the adoption and growing demand of prostate cancer radio diagnostics, which are an important tool for healthcare providers to assess and properly treat the disease. We see a large, growing, and diversified pipeline, positioning our business to deliver value long into the future. The pipeline consists of more than 60 opportunities across oncology, cardiology, and neurology that are either contracted, in negotiations, or being actively explored with pharmaceutical companies. As an example, in oncology, we look forward to expanding our support level of novel prostate radioligand therapies in fiscal '25. As we look into the future, when you consider the strength of the Theranostics pipeline, only a handful of successful products are needed to deliver the strong growth outlined in our long-term targets. Our at-Home Solutions plays an instrumental role in providing patients and caregivers the critical products and services they need for care in the home. We continue to see strong demand for home healthcare and over the past decade, we've grown from servicing about 1 million customers annually to around 5 million today. Our business is positioned to accelerate in the coming years as we invest to expand the capacity of our network, the breadth of our offering, and deploy new automation technology. We're excited that our new distribution center being built in South Carolina, featuring the fastest order fulfillment system per square foot in the market, is scheduled to open by early next fiscal year. In OptiFreight Logistics, we continue to hear from our customers the value of our TotalVue Insights technology platform is providing as they seek to control their shipping spend and drive performance. Our technology provides action driving analytics and benchmarks with shipping status and delay visibility. We continue to invest in new technology driven solutions, and true to our commitment to innovation, we collaborate side-by-side with customers. For example, this quarter, we successfully co-developed and introduced a tailored pharmacy shipping solution with a strategic customer across multiple facilities. Across our businesses, opportunities are everywhere we look. We've affirmed our long-term targets for the enterprise and segments, which reflects Cardinal Health's ability to achieve sustained growth and deliver attractive returns for shareholders through an ongoing focus on value creation. We continue to prioritize the prudent management of our balance sheet and responsible capital allocation. We remain well-positioned with the financial flexibility to continue investing in our business and returning capital to shareholders. As part of our simplification journey, we are taking proactive actions to optimize our future cost structure and enhance our ability to grow well into the future. During the quarter, we took substantial steps to reduce our corporate real estate footprint and reorganized certain teams for greater efficiency and effectiveness. Our business review committee continues to make progress on our ongoing review of the GMPD business. We have no further updates to share today, but plan to keep you apprised of our progress. Driving the improvement plan remains our near-term priority and the team is making excellent progress. To close, we've had a strong first-three quarters of the year and are focused on sprinting through the tape. Plans are in place to deliver growth in fiscal '25 and beyond, and we're eager to continue delivering for our many stakeholders. None of this would be possible without our highly engaged and talented team, who continues to lean in, drive our company forward, and fulfill our critical role as healthcare's most trusted partner. With that, we will take your questions. Yeah. Just I'll build out a little bit further the puts and takes for '25. As Aaron highlighted and scoped it, the delta is a net approximately $80 million when you look at the -- those different reference points. So, that obviously implies an Optum impact of something greater than that, that's being partially mitigated through several different items that we've called out. One is the other customer progress that we've had. So this value proposition is definitely resonating well with our customers and so we've had good win rates in other areas. And so, that would allow us some opportunity to partially offset that, that's included in that net $80 million, as well as the inclusion of Specialty Networks. So overall, specialty growth, we expect to continue to be strong. And then we have the Specialty Networks acquisition that closed last month. So we'll get kind of a three quarter type of year-over-year benefit, because we'll have it in our fourth quarter as well and the ongoing growth with that. And then there's some opportunity to further reduce cost by streamlining our processes even further, simplifying even further. So, overall, we feel really good about those offsets and that gets us to that net about 4 percentage points that we're calling out right now. Yeah. There's a couple of things I think about this, George. First of all, thanks for the question. As I step back and think about just the backdrop of your question on the competitive environment, there -- while there are a couple changing hands, as you highlighted, I think the overall market continues to behave in a very rational way. We continue to be very thoughtful and disciplined in how we participate within it. And it's the exception of those contracts changing hands. The vast majority of contracts don't change hands as they come up for renewal. So I don't think that that -- it changes things. And you -- while you're still stepping back from everything, our role ultimately on the distribution side is to safely, securely, and efficiently deliver these products for our customers, that hasn't changed. Now, I think your question is, are there other elements that make that evolve further. Hey, we've got the full suite of services. We are building those out further. I think our customers always are looking for opportunities where we can add additional value. That hasn't changed either. It just evolves as to where they are most focused, and each customer has a little bit different value proposition from which to build from. So that will resonate better with some customers than others. And our objective is to continue to build out those capabilities, both upstream and downstream, so that we can be that full service supplier and partner to ensure that we can help them grow their business. Well -- yeah, I think we can understand where she was going with trying to build out further for first half versus second half. So, the one thing I would stress, let's talk about the puts and takes and the timing of the puts and takes. So this customer migration will be somewhat of a cliff event at the end of the fiscal year. So, the June 30 to July 1, which is exactly the beginning of the fiscal year. So, that first quarter, we'll see that volume drop off fairly precipitously. And then the other business that we've won, some of it is already feathering in, some of it will continue over the course of the year, and we've highlighted in our comments a lot of it will be in the second half of fiscal '25. So, the timing of that, that piece of the puts and takes will be a little bit more second half weighted. Especially networks I referenced, that is a nice tailwind that is going to start benefiting us. It's included in our guidance for the fourth quarter, but we'll have three quarters of year-over-year performance driven by that business being added in and the continued just overall growth of utilization over the course of next year that we expect as well. The other cost actions will be varied. There's some things we've been planning for this for quite some time. And so, some of those cost actions will be in place by the end of the year. Some of those will need to take time to allow our operations to settle with that lower volume. So this is a customer that beyond it being -- it's a large and growing customer. So we definitely liked that volume. At the same time, it was a customer that had a lot of non-standard and customized processes and the demand profile was a bit more volatile. So we'll be able to operate more efficiently as this volume exits, but that won't necessarily be a day one type of thing. It will take us a little bit of time to get the each of the individual sites to be flowing with the new product that is coming in, but also just optimizing with the existing product. So the puts and takes there are all items that we start to see some mitigation at the very beginning of the fiscal year and then build over the course of the year. Nothing to add on that component. As it relates to Red Oak, we feel very good about the scale and competitiveness of that venture -- joint venture that we have with CVS. The combined volume that we both bring is sufficient to have significant scale in the space. The percentage of volume that was related to the lost customer is quite small relative to the total that we have that remains. So we feel good about our -- continuing our mandate of both continued value for our partners and, ultimately, our customers and as well as the dual mandate aspect of also driving supply as much as possible. Yeah. So I -- the so far comment was simply to highlight that we are guiding to at least 1% growth. And so, that reference is entirely around, of course, we continue to look for other opportunities to mitigate further. And depending upon our success with those additional actions will be the answer to your question about incentive comp. We'll, of course, appropriately define a target with the alignment with our Board to ensure that we are motivated to drive the business forward. And then, as it relates to Specialty Networks, our underlying assumptions are unchanged. The accretive comment was -- you're right, Eric, that the reference point was a year after the close and that was including the dilutive effect on the interest. So, the lost interest on $1 billion, $1.2 billion is the offset to the operating earnings that we see within the Pharma business. So it's really just the geography of the plus and minus with that. Yeah. So it's across various classes of trade. So it's broad based wins that we've received. We are not anticipating needing additional new wins beyond what we've already completed or in process of completing. And that's why when you think about the embedded guidance that we're talking about in terms of maintaining our long-term targets of that 4% to 6% growth, some years like this year were at the above the high end and next year, it will be a little bit below the low end, but the average is out to that 4% to 6%. And so, it implies a '26 and beyond type of rate that continues to be in that 4% to 6% range, which is kind of a normal -- normalized ongoing type of earnings level. So what -- how I step back and think about our progress to date, it really comes down to our service levels and our customer service and really listening to what is important to those customers and working with them for a solution that is not necessarily customized, it is standardized, but with their needs in mind. And we're getting fantastic feedback from our current customers in terms of what that service level has been that is translating over to the desire by customers that we're not working with today to consider using Cardinal Health. And so, we have the time, attention, and energy now that we're able to devote even more to those existing customers to streamline those processes in a little bit more of a simplified fashion, and we'll continue to drive that value proposition with those new customers. But it's very much a booked business type of perspective that we're now into execution mode. And after this year, fiscal '25, we'd expect it to be even more normalized at that point. So, those are a number of puts and takes that as you noticed, I'm sure, Eric, we did not provide revenue guidance in this update. We will be providing that in the next update, of course. So, certainly, you're in the ballpark on the Optum piece, as I've highlighted before, that is about 10% of that overall book of business. That specialty, everything else would be, PD, non-specialty. And Specialty Networks, the revenue is quite low, because it's the service revenue, it's not distribution revenue. So that's what I would think of independent is that we, of course, would expect our non-Optum specialty revenue to continue to grow nicely and we will frame that, but don't think about that as something specifically related to Specialty Networks. Yeah. I think the competitive environment, I'm not sure I'd put much into that. Our performance within this industry has improved dramatically. I referenced in my comments, the customer loyalty scores improve -- have improved consistently and dramatically from the bottom of the pandemic a couple of years ago. So, our performance is noticeable. Our customers are feeling it. That customer loyalty index, the scores behind it improving, because we have -- we have the low back order, we have product availability, we have great service levels. We're very engaged from a sales force perspective. So we're out there now selling instead of reacting to the challenges of the pandemic. So our customers are feeling that. We have very stable win/loss types of rates. We're growing at least with the market now. So it's more of us showing up, I think, the right way than the market being overly growing more or growing less. The market utilization continues to be more and more normalized. So there's maybe a little bit of volatility here and there, but it's much more normalized compared to where it has been in the last several years. So, not -- that -- and that's the environment we like. We like to see predictable, consistent lower-single digit type of utilization rates that we can grow a little bit above that through our mix and other actions. And then, of course, as Aaron highlighted, the single biggest driver, not only this past year, but that -- what we expect at least in the first half of next year, would be just the lapping of the inflation impacts and everything we've done to mitigate that. Which -- that's another thing that's helpful for us to get that behind us so that we're focused on selling and talking to our customers about the value that we can help provide them, as opposed to dealing with inflationary fluctuations that have occurred in the past. So we're well-positioned to now drive the other elements of the medical -- the GMPD Improvement Plan, which is the ongoing simplification, the ongoing cost reductions, but just continuing to really prioritize more than anything the Cardinal Health brand volume growth. Yeah. Just a couple of things to add. First, on the first question, just to be real explicit, given it's a cliff event customer transition that we are anticipating for July 1, we'd anticipate that that would be largely in fiscal '25 results and there's nothing that we're calling out or indicating at this point that would carry over into '26. And as it relates to the Other businesses, how I think about them, they're each growing very nicely. They each have strong industry, strong sectors of the industry that are benefiting from their own individual secular tailwinds. So, they each have different reasons for their growth. But ultimately, it's because that each of these three areas provide a real interesting value proposition to customers and, ultimately, to the patients. And each of these three, we have a leadership position in. So we're not only benefiting from that secular trend, but we're leading and maintaining or growing our own fair share within it. So we're well positioned for each one of these three and why we have confidence about them. We are investing into them, as Aaron highlighted. That's driving the growth that we believe will be driving long-term profitability as well. Yeah. So I'd -- the -- it's a -- we inflected a couple of quarters ago, right? You saw that with our overall revenue growth that is partly driven by the Cardinal Health brand volume growth. So we saw, for example, this quarter, our revenue growth of 4% was pro-rated within that national brand, as well as Cardinal Health brand, so, we're seeing distribution stabilize. We're seeing that. We've won some business there that has allowed us to grow at or a little bit better than the market. So, overall, we're seeing that this business has now stabilized at a growth consistent with the market. We expect that to continue. This is something that we do have as a component of that growth. As Aaron highlighted, the single biggest driver of profit performance for '25 -- from '24 to '25 is the annualization, the carryover of the inflationary pressure. So that's the biggest item of that implied $100 million, $110 million year-over-year profit improvement. Then beyond that, you have Cardinal Health brand volume growth, cost reductions, and other actions. And so, it is a component, it's not the biggest component. And then it would be a -- from '25 to '26, the primary components that then drive that growth would be Cardinal Health brand volume, as well as further cost reductions as we continue to look to streamline and optimize our footprint, as well as our other supporting cost. So, we're not going to break out the individual pieces there, but those are the biggest pieces then when you go from '25 to '26. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Daniel. And so, with Navista, we are on track to everything that we've laid out first raising this about a year ago. I mean, as I think about the progress we've made, I'd break it into a few key buckets. First of all -- first and foremost, we've hired and brought in a fantastic team, a great mixture of internal and external talent, really drawing from industry those that have done this before and understand what that looks like, but also using our own expertise that have been more focused in other therapeutic areas, but a nice augmentation of the two. And then that new team quickly went to work and defined what went in front of our customers and prospective customers and really listened as to what is it that they need to run their practice, their business more efficiently, more effectively. And it was through that work that we then came to the final point, which is defining the tools, the capabilities that we are building within Navista. So, we didn't just go off and build it. We are building it around what the customers are demanding that they need, those community oncologists, those independent community oncologists, really looking at differentiating for what they need to run their business, both again, efficiently, but also effectively to further improve upon the lives of their patients. So that is the work that's been done, and we are every day building out more elements of this. So I wouldn't think about it as a particular date that everything goes live and we suddenly have this influx of volume. This is the type of thing that builds out our capability over time in different ways and working with our current customers, as well as the prospective ones to layer in when they come into this network and which services they utilize within the network. So that leads you to the Specialty Networks piece, which I would think about it as we now have an internal technology and capability set that's augmenting what we had before. But Navista always approached this in terms of the best of the best in the industry. Using what we have is great, but we also are using a lot of third-party partners to bring in their tools and capabilities, because we're going to put the customers' needs first, the providers' needs first and then build around that. So we do see that there is a role for Specialty Networks and their PPS Analytics platform, but we're not going to make that the priority. We're going to listen to the customers and then determine which pieces of that to bring into that network. So we haven't finalized those decisions as it relates to Specialty Networks. But what I will tell you, on day one, just having that team's insight and expertise has been very beneficial to our own Navista team. So having -- and I mentioned this when we announced the acquisition of Specialty Networks. Yeah, the assets are fantastic. The business is fantastic. But the most important thing for us was the leadership team and the capabilities that they're bringing along with it is every bit as great as what we thought it was when we made the announcement. And we're seeing that with boots on the ground now as we work, not just within Navista, but with the broader business to further improve our capabilities across all the therapeutic areas. Yeah. Thank you. Just to close, appreciate everyone spending some time with us this morning. We hope the overall message that you took away from the call today is that we have a strong and resilient business and a very clear plan for us for '25 and '26, and we're excited about the opportunities and ensuring that our customers and their patients continue to get fantastic service. So thanks again for joining us today and have a great day."

With that, I will now turn the call over to Jason.\nJason Hollar: Good morning, everyone. In the last few weeks, we've made several notable announcements regarding our company's continued progress, including yesterday's news on our agreement to acquire specialty networks, which will further our specialty growth strategy and create value for specialty providers, manufacturers, and patients in exciting new ways. And as we highlighted at a recent industry conference, we're continuing to take actions to become a simplified and more focused company with further progress achieved on our ongoing business and portfolio review and our updated enterprise operating and segment reporting structure, which will be reflected in our financial reporting beginning next quarter. We plan to go further into our recent updates with you today, but first, let me begin with a few brief comments on our results. In Q2, we delivered strong profit growth in both segments, demonstrating continued operating momentum and execution against our strategic priorities. Pharma again delivered strong performance. Overall, the business is performing consistent with our expectations, and we're pleased to reiterate our outlook for 7% to 9% segment profit growth in fiscal \u201824. We've seen ongoing stability in macro trends, including in our generic program, and continued broad-based strength in overall pharmaceutical demand. Our specialty distribution business also continued to see strong demand, including with COVID-19 vaccines in the first part of the quarter. Turning to medical, Q2 segment profit was consistent with Q1, despite the non-recurring adjustments in the second quarter, which we've reflected in our updated fiscal \u201824 outlook for the former medical segment. We're encouraged by the underlying improvements in operating performance, reflecting further progress with our medical improvement plan efforts, focused on our global medical products and distribution business. Notably, we saw a change in trend in revenue growth for the medical segment in the second quarter. Along with continued growth from at-Home Solutions, we're seeing the effects of our five-point plan to grow Cardinal Health brand volumes yield positive results. And as we continue to optimize not only the performance of our businesses, but also the financial strength of the broader enterprise, we're generating robust cashflow and seeing meaningful benefits below the operating line. As a result of our first-half performance and increased confidence as we look ahead, we're pleased to raise our fiscal \u201824 EPS guidance and our outlook for adjusted free cashflow. Of course, our customers remain at the center of everything we do, and our team continues to prioritize core operational execution to best serve them and their patients with essential products and services as we drive our company forward. Now let me turn it over to Aaron to review our results and updated guidance in more detail.\nAaron Alt: Thanks, Jason, and good morning. Before we begin let me remind you that our Q2 segment commentary will be according to our former segment structure pharma and medical. Let's start with total company results for the second quarter. Q2 delivered another strong quarter across the enterprise with EPS of $1.82, growth of 38%, which included operating earnings growth of 20%. We also delivered strong cash flow and ended the quarter with $4.6 billion of cash, even following incremental share repurchase activity in the quarter. As seen on slide four, total company revenue increased 12% to $57.4 billion, reflecting growth in both the pharma and medical segments. We drove operating leverage for the enterprise despite incremental investments in the business and higher costs to support sales growth. Gross margin increased 11% to $1.8 billion, driven by both segments, and consolidated SG&A increased 8% to $1.3 billion. With the strong profit growth in both segments, we deliver operating earnings of $562 million, 20% higher than a year ago. Moving below the line, interest and other decreased by $26 million to $8 million in income due to increased interest income on cash and equivalents from higher cash balances and higher rates. As we've noted, our debt is largely fixed rate, resulting in a net benefit from rising interest rates in the near-term. Additionally Q2 interest and other benefited from nearly $10 million in income from the quarterly revaluation of our company's deferred compensation plan investments, which as a reminder has a matching offset above the line. Our second quarter effective tax rate of 21.3% was 1.7 percentage points lower than a year ago and better than we anticipated due to positive discrete items in the period. Q2 average diluted shares outstanding were $246 million, 6% lower than a year ago due to share repurchases in each of the last four quarters. And as I mentioned earlier, the net result for Q2 was EPS of $1.82, reflecting growth of 38%. Let's turn to the pharma segment on slide five. Second quarter revenue increased 12% to $53.5 billion, driven by brand and specialty pharmaceutical sales growth from existing customers. We saw strong pharmaceutical demand across product categories, brand, specialty, consumer health, and generics, and from our largest customers. We also continue to see robust demand for GLP-1 medications, which provided a revenue tailwind in the quarter. Segment profit increased 12% to $518 million in the second quarter, driven by positive generics program performance and the higher contribution from brand and specialty products, including distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. Our positive generics program performance continue to reflect volume growth and consistent market dynamics. With respect to COVID-19 vaccines, we saw the strength and demand from September for the fall immunization season carry into October before peaking mid-month and trending to a much lower run rate as we exited the second quarter. The Q2 increase in segment profit includes a partial offset from higher costs to support sales growth driven by increased pharmaceutical volumes. Turning to the medical segment on slide six. Second quarter revenue increased 3% to $3.9 billion, which as Jason alluded to, reflects quarterly revenue growth for the medical segment for the first time in over two years. This increase was driven by growth in both at-Home Solutions and global medical products and distribution, with the GMPD growth primarily related to higher Cardinal Health brand volumes. Medical delivered segment profit of $71 million, a $54 million year-over-year increase, driven by an improvement in net inflationary impacts, including our mitigation initiatives. Consistent with the expectations communicated a few weeks ago, segment profit was generally consistent with Q1, despite some non-recurring adjustments in the quarter. We continue to be encouraged by the underlying performance of the business, which through the first two quarters of the year has tracked consistent with our original plans. Now turning to the balance sheet. We generated robust adjusted free cash flow of $1 billion in Q2, bringing our year-to-date adjusted free cash flow to $2 billion. And as I noted earlier, end of the quarter with $4.6 billion of cash on hand. We remain focused on doing what we said we would, deploying capital according to our disciplined capital allocation framework. Thus far, through the first-half of fiscal \u201824, we've continued to invest against our highest priorities, including investing back into the businesses to drive organic growth with over $200 million in year-to-date CapEx. In the first-half, we have returned $1 billion total to shareholders, which includes our quarterly dividend payments and $750 million in year-to-date share repurchases. These share repurchases are in excess of our committed baseline repurchases of $500 million. And in January, we made certain opioid settlement prepayments of $238 million at a pre-negotiated discount, which is expected to result in a [gap] (ph) only gain of approximately $100 million in the third quarter. Now for our updated fiscal \u201824 guidance on slide eight, beginning with the enterprise. With our strong first-half performance and positive outlook, we are again raising our fiscal \u201824 EPS guidance. Our new range of $7.20 to $7.35 reflects a $0.45 increase at the bottom end and a $0.35 cent increase at the top end from our Q1 guidance range. And a midpoint which is 26% above our fiscal \u201823 EPS results. We are encouraged by the operating performance of our businesses and our strong cash regeneration, which is certainly contributing to the improvements below the line. Interest in other is reduced to a range of $50 million to $65 million, which primarily reflects increased interest income from higher than anticipated cash balances. We expect lower average cash balances in the second-half of the year due in part to the seasonal timing of anticipated cash flows. We are evaluating opportunities to refinance our upcoming 2024 debt maturities in the back half of the year. We are lowering the top end of our effective tax rate guidance to a new range of 23% to 24% to reflect the positive discrete items we've seen in the first-half of the year. We also are lowering our shares outlook to approximately $247 million, which reflects the $250 million accelerated share repurchase program we completed in Q2. No additional share repurchases are assumed in our updated guidance for fiscal year \u201824. Now turning to the fiscal \u201824 outlook for our segments. While we will be transitioning to our new segment structure reporting beginning in Q3, let me start with our former segments as a comparison point for the updated structure. No changes to the outlook for the former pharma segment. We are reiterating the 10% to 12% revenue growth and 7% to 9% segment profit growth. For the former medical segment, the fiscal \u201824 outlook is updated to approximately $380 million a segment profit to reflect the net impact of Q2 non-recurring adjustments. Outside of these, our overall operational expectations are consistent with delivering the prior $400 million in segment profit for the year, as well as the corresponding prior expectation of $650 million in segment profit for fiscal year \u201826. We have consistently highlighted the back half weighting of the medical guidance, driven by progress within GMPD on Cardinal Health brand volume growth, the cumulative impact of inflation mitigation, and some business specific seasonality. Our expectations there continue. For example, with inflation mitigation, we have strong visibility to overall cost improvements in the second-half of the year, driven by reductions we've observed in international freight, which is a reminder reflecting our income statement on a two to three quarter delay and as we exit January the mitigation initiatives necessary to achieve our year-end target are now largely in place. Now as seen on slide 10, let me comment on how this fiscal year \u201824 guidance translates to our updated segment structure. To go along with the preliminary recast fiscal \u201823 actuals and long-term targets we provided a few weeks back. Our new structure went into effect January 1. So beginning in Q3, we will report results and provide drivers reporting to the new segment structure, pharmaceutical and specialty solutions and GMPD and separate from these two segments, nuclear at-Home, an OptiFreight aggregated in other. At that time, we also plan to provide a recast of the results for fiscal \u201822 to \u201824 on the new segmentation. Beginning with the pharmaceutical and specialty solutions segment, the guidance ranges are consistent with the former pharma segment, even excluding our higher growth nuclear business. We expect 10% to 12% revenue growth and 7% to 9% segment profit outlook for fiscal \u201824 and a 4^ to 6% segment profit growth CAGR over the long-term. Turning to GMPD where we remain encouraged by the improvements in this business. For the execution of the medical improvement plan initiatives, we expect to drive GMPD from an operating loss of approximately $165 million in fiscal \u201823 to operating income of approximately $65 million in fiscal \u201824. From the fiscal \u201823 low point, this $230 million year-over-year improvement would position us roughly half way towards our fiscal \u201926 target of approximately $300 million for segment profit. Finally we expect the businesses including other, at-Home Solutions, Nuclear & Precision Health Solutions and OptiFreight Logistics to collectively deliver 6% to 8% segment profit growth in fiscal year \u201824. The difference between this fiscal \u201824 growth rate and the long-term CAGR of 8% to 10% for fiscal \u201824 to \u201826 reflects the portion of the Q2 non-recurring adjustments within at-Home Solutions with the remainder residing in GMPD. Before I close a couple of comments on our recently announced acquisition. We've noted that the specialty category has been our highest priority for potential M&A and a primary consideration for our opportunistic capital employment as part of our disciplined capital allocation framework. Given our financial flexibility and strong presence in the other 60% of the specialty market in therapeutic areas outside of oncology, we have evaluated a range of potential acquisition candidates to further accelerate our specialty strategy. We are thrilled to reach an agreement for specialty networks to become a part of the Cardinal Health family. Jason will elaborate on the strategic aspects of the deal, but we plan to include the expected financial impacts of the transaction in our guidance upon closing, which of course is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals. For general modeling purposes, we expect the deal to be accretive 12 months following close. So, to wrap up, tremendous progress in the first-half of the year with exciting value creation opportunities still in front of us. We are confident in our plans and grateful for the efforts of our team, who continue to drive our ongoing initiatives and prioritize the needs of our customers. With that, I will turn it back over to Jason.\nJason Hollar: Thanks, Aaron. Now for some additional perspective on our strategic priorities beginning with priority number one and building upon the growth of pharma and specialty solutions, our largest and most significant business. Though this segment structure has slightly changed, our focus on executing in the core remains. We're building upon our strong foundation, while investing to accelerate growth in specialty both downstream and upstream. We believe that this new segment structure further enables those efforts by enhancing management focus, leveraging the connectivity between pharmaceutical distribution and specialty, and positioning the business for long-term growth and investment. More on that front shortly. A key component of our strong core foundation is our generics program anchored by Red Oak, which continues to do an excellent job fulfilling its dual mandate, managing both cost and supply. Red Oak leverages proprietary analytical tools and their deep industry expertise to help maximize service delivery for customers. We're continuing to invest in our business to provide customer-focused solutions and evolve our commercial engagement strategies to prioritize addressing the complex challenges our customers face every day. For example, at Investor Day, we highlighted our first-to-market clinically integrated supply chain, the Cardinal Health InteLogix platform. This innovative solution leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning through the Palantir Foundry platform to help providers reduce costs, optimize drug inventories, and generate actionable insights to simplify and streamline medication supply. We've continued to develop our offerings, such as the contract optimizer tool, which drives savings and value through contract compliance, cost controls, and product alternatives like brand generics, blood plasma, and more. Key health system customers are already benefiting from these capabilities, and we see opportunities for further future expansion. Shifting to specialty, where we have also been investing to expand our offering into complementary areas. The acquisition of specialty networks is exciting to us on a number of fronts. This is a business with which we were already very familiar, given the long-standing partnership to service their members through our specialty distribution. Specialty networks is a technology-enabled, multi-specialty group purchasing and practice enhancement organization serving 11,500 total providers today, including more than 7,000 physicians across 1,200 independent urology, gastroenterology, and rheumatology practices. We see their service capabilities as accelerating our efforts in critical ways. First, further extending our reach, expertise, and offerings in key therapeutic areas to provide increased clinical and economic value for specialty providers. Specialty networks is a leader in specialty practice management, research, and technologies that support physicians in lowering costs, operating more efficiently, and delivering best-in-class care to their patients. For example, the company provides solutions that improve clinical and economic outcomes to over 3,000 urologists through its leading euro GPO. Second, creating a platform for our expansion across specialty therapeutic areas. The company's PPS analytics solution is a subscription-based advanced technology platform that utilizes artificial intelligence, such as continuous learning algorithms and natural language processing to analyze data for electronic medical records, practice management, imaging and dispensing systems, and transform it into actionable insights for providers and other stakeholders. We see this complementing our suite of clinical practice management and distribution solutions to specialty practices nationwide. Specialty networks experience and capabilities and clinical engagement are robust, which also accelerates our upstream data and research opportunities with biopharma manufacturers. Third, enhancing the capabilities of our specialty business, including supporting the ongoing build of the Navista network. Specialty networks have a deep understanding of independent physician practices, and we see capabilities and expertise that will accelerate our ongoing development of the Navista network, which is focused on supporting the clinical and operational needs of independent community oncologists. In summary, this transaction enhances our specialty strategy by providing new capabilities that strengthen the link between our downstream and upstream services, enabling us to create further value for customers, manufacturer partners, and patients. Turning to priority number two in the GMPD business, where we're executing the medical improvement plan. While the business and portfolio review of GMPD continues, the team continues to prioritize and make significant progress in turning around the operational performance of this business, as Aaron indicated, with our expectation that the business returns to profitability in fiscal 2024. The number one priority remains mitigating supply chain inflation, where we remain on track to address the impact by the time we exit fiscal \u201924. As of Q2 we're approximately 75% to target. On the cost side, while overall still elevated, we've seen lower international freight costs reflected in our results as anticipated, and we have strong line of sight to continued improvement in the second-half of the fiscal year. We've continued to make progress with our mitigation initiatives and commercial contracting efforts and are continually taking additional actions to offset elevated inflation, such as through sourcing initiatives. As Aaron indicated, the work we've accomplished to-date provides increased confidence in achieving our fiscal year-end target as overall cost improvements continue to reflect in our second-half results. We're continuing to invest in the resiliency of our supply chain and our manufacturing and distribution capacity. We have opened three new distribution centers in the past year, adding capacity for growth, while featuring state-of-the-art automation technology to streamline operations. For example, our new Greater Toronto area DC expands capacity to serve Cardinal Health Canada customers, while leveraging autonomous mobile robots to increase picking and packing accuracy and drive efficiencies. We're also continuing to invest in new product innovation and portfolio expansion in key categories in alignment with our disciplined portfolio management approach. As a result of our team's collective efforts, we're seeing our five-point plan to grow Cardinal Health brand volume result in improvements in our leading indicators and most importantly, strong customer retention and product volume growth. Finally, we continue to drive simplification and optimize our cost structure by exiting non-core product lines, rationalizing our network and streamlining our international footprint. We believe our new structure will further enable our medical improvement plan efforts as we continue to execute the plan and deliver value for customers. Now, priority number three, accelerating growth in key areas. We are excited about the strong demand we are seeing in our at-Home Solutions and OptiFreight businesses, and our recent determination to further invest in and develop these businesses for long-term value creation as part of our portfolio. In at-Home Solutions, we continue to focus on enabling and supporting comfortable home-based care for patients with acute and chronic conditions. To support the growing demand for home health care, we're investing to expand the capacity of our network, the breadth of our offering, and a new technology to drive operating efficiencies. We recently announced plans for a new distribution center to be built in Texas with increased capacity, advanced automation technology, and robotics within the facility. And our previously announced 350,000 square foot facility being built in South Carolina is on track to open this calendar year. In OptiFreight Logistics, we're continuing to invest in digital tools to enable healthcare supply chain leaders to better manage their shipping spend and support the core volume growth in our business. We've launched new offerings to give our customers more supply chain visibility, and we are receiving great feedback. For example, we now have more than 1,000 healthcare providers leveraging our total view insights platform to gain valuable insights on their operations. In nuclear and precision health solutions, we're continuing to see above market growth in both our core business and Theranostics, as we're a premier partner of choice due to our strong core foundation and differentiation with pharmaceutical manufacturers looking for commercialization success of their future radiopharmaceutical portfolios. For example, in Theranostics prostate cancer radio diagnostics are important tools for healthcare providers to assess and properly treat the disease. We saw meaningful year-over-year revenue growth in the first-half of fiscal \u201824 from the ramp up in demand of these diagnostics. From a pipeline perspective, we're investing to expand our Center for Theranostics Advancement with demand from pharmaceutical manufacturer partners currently oversubscribed. And we're investing to expand the capabilities and resiliency of our pet manufacturing network to enable portfolio diversification and accommodate growth from the increasing demand for pet agents. This is driven by trends such as an aging population, cancer prevalence, emerging Alzheimer's therapy, availability and reimbursement and increasing clinical trial needs. Finally, priority number four, maximizing shareholder value creation. We're continuing to maximize shareholder value creation through our improved operational performance, robust cash flow, and responsible allocation of capital. As Aaron noted, our robust cash flow generation is not only driving benefits below the operating line, it is enabling our opportunistic capital deployment with additional share repurchases in the quarter beyond our baseline plan and our ability to pursue value-creating M&A in specialty. We remain well-positioned with the financial flexibility to continue opportunistically evaluating disciplined M&A not only in specialty, but in our other growth areas and potential additional share repurchases. With our recent conclusions on our business portfolio review, we do not have further updates to share today, but plan to keep you apprised of our progress. To close, we had a strong first-half of the year and are excited about the many initiatives underway to build upon our momentum. I would like to thank our highly engaged and talented team for driving our progress and prioritizing our customers as we fulfill our critical role as healthcare's most trusted partner. With that, we will take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you very much, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Stephanie Davis, calling from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nStephanie Davis: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question and congrats on the continued progress. Jason you already shared a lot of color around the acquisition, but I was hoping you could dig in just a little bit further on specialty networks' mix and capabilities, just given the higher margin nature of both GPO and analytics solutions? And then just following up, given the pipeline that you mentioned, I was hoping you could share some thoughts on hurdle rates for future deals as that becomes a bigger part of the story? Thank you.\nJason Hollar: Okay, great. Thanks. Good morning, Stephanie. Yes, we're really excited about specialty networks. And as I -- I love how you asked the question, Stephanie, because there's a lot that goes into this business, and we love all of it, whether it's the GPO or the analytics and technology behind it. Specifically, PPS analytics is something we thought was really special, not just in terms of how this team has created this capability for their original primary business of urology, but then how they've expanded it into other therapeutic areas, and we felt we could learn from that further and use that technology across potentially other therapeutic areas beyond the three that they're in today. So that was really exciting to us and certainly a key part of the value. So we definitely attributed good value to that technology and where we believe that can go. And not only that good for our business, but importantly we see that technology is really solving a lot of customer both provider and manufacturer challenges and ultimately giving a much better solutions to the end-patient. So it's a win-win across the industry and one that plugs in nicely to our strategy and to be throughout the specialty space. So we feel great about that and I certainly don't want to miss that we are also through this transaction acquiring a fantastic leadership team that will plug in very nicely to our own existing team. And so it's a culture that I think will work very well together. We've had a fantastic, very quick process. We've known specialty networks for quite a while, but from the point that we started talking about a possible tie up, we went from the beginning to the end of course doing a deep and thorough diligence, but nonetheless knowing the business well, so that we could quickly understand the value for us. As it relates to your second question on hurdle rates, I'm not sure exactly which part of the business you're referring to. But generally speaking, I think no matter what part of our business we're talking about it's a competitive, it's stable type of environment and so I'm not normally going to go deeper into that anyways, but generally you know speaking we're not really calling out anything from the overall market perspective today regardless of what our business we're talking about utilization continues to be quite good and predictable so we're in a nice environment for ongoing growth both organically, as well as enable to look optimistically at transactions like this.\nAaron Alt: Probably worth noting that it is a profitable business today and as Jason highlighted we do intend to invest in the business early on to expand the scope of what they are doing across not only their own initiatives, but our initiatives within specialty as well.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen our next question is going to be coming from Lisa Gill calling from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nLisa Gill: Thanks very much for taking my question and good morning. Just really wanted to ask two things, Jason. One, on the strategic side as we think about your core medical business. One, do you still feel a commitment to that business going forward? And then secondly, as we think about the shift and the new reporting structure, it does look like you're taking down the margin on the core business. Is there something that's either changing in the timeline of the turnaround? Is there something else that's shifting competitively or incremental cost? If you could just help us to understand that? Thanks so much.\nJason Hollar: Sure, Lisa. Very clear here. No, there's no change in our commitment to this business. It has been there from the very beginning and continues to be. As I highlighted from the first moment when we talked about medical in the context of the business portfolio review, our number one priority has always been and continues to be turning the business around. Everything that we are working on has been in service of, first of all, the five-point plan to drive Cardinal Health plan volumes to mitigate inflation and drive additional value through simplification and cost reductions. That message and the progress we made is entirely consistent with that. The core operational performance of the business is exactly how we've laid it out. So the only update that we've had today were in recognition of some of those non-recurring items, but the plan and the fiscal year \u201826 aggregate targets that we're going after are absolutely unchanged to this resegmentation. We did have to bucket the medical improvement plan into the various buckets, because we did have the growth businesses that were a component of that. But that was just moving the pieces. The pieces are absolutely unchanged and the overall aggregate profitability in that long-term plan is absolutely unchanged and our commitment is absolutely unchanged to this business. And I'm really excited about the progress that the team is making in service of all those goals.\nMatt Sims: Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you very much sir. And our next question will be coming from Elizabeth Anderson calling from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nElizabeth Anderson: Hi, guys, thanks so much for the question. I have two sort of maybe more financial questions going forward. Can you talk us sort of the interest expense. Obviously they had a pretty big step down. Just wanted to understand that in terms of that and your sort of ongoing thoughts on the capital structure? And can you also talk about the free cash flow improvement, that was nice to see that step up in the quarter as well in terms of the guidance?\nAaron Alt: We're happy to offer some perspective. We're quite pleased with the below the line results of course you know for the quarter. I'm going to start with the fact that as we announced we ended the quarter with $4.6 billion of cash on hand and of course that's driven by the strong cash generation, which was the end part of your question. If you think back to our investor day we had highlighted that further optimization of our cash flow position was something we were focused on doing and the team has delivered against those efforts internally and generated strong cash flow in the first-half for the business thus the balance. Of course the knock-on consequence of that is when we have more cash on hand particularly in the higher interest rate environment, which we've been operating, we'll get a higher return, right? And we have indeed benefited from greater rate of return on the larger cash balances that we've had in place. It's also the case that there is some geography within our statement, because deferred comp was a positive for us below the line. That's an offsetting negative above the line in the quarter as well. And so, it's really the aggregation of those three things, of those several things which led to the results for the quarter. Now you asked about the financing as well. And I should be clear on a couple of things just as we think about our models going forward. We do have maturities coming in June and November. We\u2019re assessing when our opportunities are there, nothing to announce today in that respect that we will address that, you know, at some point as we carry forward. And there is also the case that our cash balances fluctuate seasonally in the back half as well and so we wouldn\u2019t expect the high balance to remain where it is just given the seasonal demand on the business.\nMatt Sims: Next question, please.\nOperator: Yes, sir. Our next question is coming from Mr. Eric Percher of Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nEric Percher: Thank you. On the medical side, it\u2019s hard to see through the one-time items. I want to ask what you can give us on the nature of those one-time items? What the trajectory looked like excluding one-timers in the quarter? And any views on the exit trajectory for the year and kind of going from $140 million first-half to $240 million second-half how you're pacing relative to that?\nAaron Alt: Thank you. We were really encouraged by the underlying performance in Q2 of the medical business. And just to restate the results, the Q2 results were consistent with the expectations we communicated several weeks ago at the JPMorgan Conference and generally consistent with Q1, despite some of those adjustments that we took in the quarter. I want to emphasize that as you move away from the adjustments that we took, the underlying elements of the Medical Improvement Plan, they are on track, right? You heard some of my preferred remarks relative to our progress against the mitigation of inflation and how our cost structure is building. The benefits of each actions we've taken will benefit our cost structure in the back half of the year. You heard us announce that we had revenue growth for the first time in two years in the quarter as well, and we were pleased with the Cardinal Health brand growth that comes with that. And the team continues to execute against the simplification initiatives that have been a core part of the medical improvement plan all along. So let me go back to where I started, which is we were quite pleased with the operational performance in the quarter. I also want to point out that from a guidance perspective, while we updated the guidance for the year to reflect the relative impact of the non-recurring adjustments, that was the sum change of the guidance, to reflect that which is behind us, not that which is ahead. And if you think through how we have guided medical for the year all along, there's always been a very back half focused trajectory for our guidance for the year and that remains unchanged along with how pleased we are with the core operational performance.\nJason Hollar: Yeah, if I could just add, you know, when you think about that first-half, second-half things and why we still anticipate the same step up in the second-half versus the first-half. There's a couple of key points. First of all, inflation mitigation, this is one where it's a significant part of that combined with Cardinal Health brand volume growth, which I'll get to in a moment. But on the inflation mitigation, there's of course two elements. There's the cost side, and then there's a price side. In both cases we have very good line of sight. On the cost side as we've talked really for quite a while now it's been the international freight and that while we have a little bit of noise with the Red Sea it is largely as anticipated so and that cost is already on our balance sheet and is rolling through as expected, especially given our volumes have been as expected. So, we have a very high line of sight and confidence the cost is going to continue to step down in the second-half of the year. And then on the pricing side, as we talked before, there's always the contract roll-through that we then update the pricing on. We do have a little bit more at the beginning of the calendar year of some of the price adjustments. So January being behind us, we have a really good line of sight to the pricing side as well. So there's some time now for the next couple of quarters needed to get that to roll through our income statement. But the actions now are largely behind us as it relates to inflation mitigation. We've always had confidence we would get to this stage, but we're now at this stage and have even more confidence actually seeing it start to come through in the second-half of the year. Now the other component is the Cardinal Health brand volume. You know, part of that's going to be market-driven, and the market volume, that utilization continues to be quite good. And what was exciting about the second quarter is seeing that further inflection and actually participating in that market growth really for the first time at the extent that what the market is growing. So that gives us much greater confidence that we'll continue to see that growth and that stuff as we get over the course of the year. But there's some variables like the market itself that will always be an impact here, good or bad, that will continue to monitor and track. So that those are the key points that I get us from the first-half to the second-half.\nAaron Alt: Eric, it's probably worth offering one additional point of perspective. We're not reporting on the new segment structure this structure that will follow on Q3, but we can offer the observation that the GMPD core part of the medical business has operated at near breakeven levels in the first-half of fiscal \u201824. And I offer you that in contrast with where they were from a fiscal \u201823 perspective and where we're going from an overall guidance perspective, we view that as a key sign of positive progress.\nOperator: Thank you very much, gentlemen. [Indiscernible]. Our next question is going to be coming from Erin Wright of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nErin Wright: Great, thanks. On the drug pricing front, you do continue to mention generics as a key driver. Are you still seeing that using deflationary dynamics that others have noted too? And how material is that for you and also how sustainable is it you know what are some of the key drivers that you're looking at there? And how are you thinking about that for the balance of the year, as well as we think about the quarterly cadence here for that that U.S. pharma or for the pharma segment particularly with the COVID dynamics too? Thanks.\nJason Hollar: Appreciate the question. I think as we called out in commenting on the strong quarter that our pharma business had was that the continued consistent market dynamics within the generic space matched with volume, strong volume was a reason for -- one of the reasons for success in the business. We often talk about the two sides of the equation being in balance and indeed that's what we continue to see within our generic business and that is indeed a core component of our guidance for the pharma as we carry forward. One last reminder, I do want to remind that last quarter we actually took our pharma guidance up from a profit perspective to 7% to 9%. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. We'll now move to Allen Lutz calling from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAllen Lutz: Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Can you talk about growth of SG&A in the quarter? You flagged incremental investments in the business and higher selling costs. Can you unpack exactly what those expenses are? And then how should we think about SG&A growth for the remainder of the year? Thanks.\nAaron Alt: Happy to offer some perspective. We were pleased in the quarter to actually achieve operating leverage with gross profit growing faster than SG&A. SG&A did grow, of course volume also grew, and so the primary component of our increase in cost was tied to the variable cost of serving higher volumes. It is also the case though that as Jason has highlighted in his strategic remarks, we are investing against our business and some of the SG&A growth was purposeful relative to the investments we're making in places like the Navista and other elements of our growth plans. But I will end with the fact that we are very focused on SG&A as a whole and the team continues to look for further opportunities as we have in prior years to optimize our cost structure.\nOperator: Thank you very much sir. We'll now move to Kevin Caliendo of UBS. Please go ahead.\nKevin Caliendo: Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. I have two. Can you give us an update on the progress of the United contracts renewal timing, any updates you have there? And just to follow-up on that SG&A question, were there purposeful investments made when you saw sort of upside from interest in other things in SG&A in the quarter? I'm just trying to quantify how much was in the original plan versus maybe how much was incremental given some of the upside that you saw below the line?\nJason Hollar: Yes, sure. I'll touch on both points here. There's no updates with the Optum contracted those through this fiscal year. And as I highlighted before, they are a great customer of ours, long-standing customer, one that brings a lot of innovation to healthcare, and one that we've worked very hard over the years to attempt to exceed their expectations, and we think we're doing a great job of that, and we'd love to keep working with them, of course. Now, I do get a lot of questions around the order of magnitude of this, and I'm not going to go into details, but just a couple of points, you know, given the number of questions I've received, is we have disclosed in the past, and I think it comes through in every K, just the order of magnitude, so last year they were over $30 billion customer of ours, and I see a lot of people attempting to try to model out impacts and things of that nature. And there's a couple things that I'm not sure is real clear about the scope of business we have with them today. It is a prime, the majority of the revenue we have with them is through our base PD business and a lot of that is mail order volume. So what you have here are the typical markers of a large customer, PD majority and mail order. So those are all, you know, markers of lower than average margin type of business and so we do have other business with them of course too. They are very large and have a lot of breadth into various parts of the industry, but for us those tend to be a little bit of the overweight of how we support them. As it relates to the SG&A, the only thing I would say is no it's not like that what we do is we look at the capabilities and the necessities needed both short-term and long-term. Short-term is going to be on volume and making sure we can support our customers in getting that strong volume growth across the enterprise and in place we are then looking to balance that with longer term investments whether it's the Navista network we've called out before as investments, but we also have others that we went through during investor day and have had a number of updates even today, within our at-Home business we have three new facilities that we're bringing online over the course of the next year or two within the medical distribution three facilities I talked about today, we have on the pharma side the consumer health new logistics center. So I also made some comments around some of the IT capabilities within pharma, some of the e-commerce and intralogics capability. So we are investing where it makes sense efficiently, very well aligned to our strategy. And these are non-investments that you can just turn on and off. So it's something that we're going to invest as appropriate, but only what we have to do as well. We want to take away waste and invest it where there's growth is the key objective.\nAaron Alt: For those working on their models, it's probably worth pointing out that with respect to the Q2 profitability in the business, it was the case that last year we called out unusual strength in the overall farm of demand, particularly from large customers, as well as a very strong cough, cold and flu season, so as you're looking at your comparisons keep that in mind.\nOperator: Thank you very much sir. [Operator Instructions] We'll now move to Mr. George Hill of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Hill: Yes. Good morning, Jason and Aaron. And forgive me if I kind of missed this or if you guys talked through this already, but as it relates to the planned restatement of the other segment, it looks like the growth in the near-term is coming in, but termed kind of the long-term targets. I just kind of wonder if you could address kind of or disagree in which sub-segments you're seeing the softness relative to the long-term expectations for the balance of the year or this year versus what you think kind of accelerates coming out and kind of closes the gap in the longer-term guidance?\nAaron Alt: The businesses that report through other for us going forward will be our at-Home business, our Nuclear Precision Health Business, and our OptiFreight business. Those are what we have traditionally called our growth businesses as part of other segments. And indeed over the long-term we expect them, the CAGR on their collective growth to be 8% to 10 percent. The disconnect you're referencing which is the 6% to 8% in fiscal \u201824 is only driven by the impact of the non-recurring adjustments from Q2 on the at-Home business that we referenced a couple of weeks ago as we talked about our expectations for Q2. Each of the businesses contribute to the revenue and profit growth for other. For instance, we carry forward in our earlier disclosures, I think you can get pretty close we disclosed the revenue of the individual pieces. And indeed, we've talked about nuclear, doubling its profit off of its fiscal \u201821 baseline by fiscal \u201826 as well. I believe and so you're able to get to that component of other through that.\nGeorge Hill: Thanks.\nMatt Sims: Next question, please.\nOperator: Yes, sir. We'll now take a Stephen Baxter of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead sir.\nStephen Baxter: Yes hi, good morning. Thanks for the questions, a couple of quick ones. On COVID vaccines and commercial channel, I think last quarter you kind of indicated or implied that the contribution was around $25 million. I was hoping you could update it on what the performance was this quarter and whether you factor anything into the balance of the year. And, and then just to try one more time on the non-recurring medical adjustment. Can you just tell us on the $20 million, if what does that actually represent in terms of the underlying accounting or business activity? Thank you.\nJason Hollar: Yes. So for the vaccine, we just kind of walk through the last couple of quarters and I'll give you a flavor of the benefits and the trends and such. So as we talked last quarter, we've highlighted in Q1 with the FDA approval at the beginning of September we were staged to hit the ground running and we had fairly significant volume in that first quarter, but as anticipated we indicated that point that we would expect it to peak within Q2 and so we expected higher volume, higher contribution in Q2 versus Q1 and that was because we saw October as the largest month within that season. And then as expected, we saw that wind down over the course of November and December, still seeing some level of volume in Q3, but I would expect it to be quite insignificant, compared to what we saw in Q1 and then Q2. Overall, I think the key message is that this is consistent with our expectations, as Aaron highlighted in his comments already. We had multiple drivers of growth for the pharma segment in the second quarter. It was strength with the generics program within brand. It was COVID driving that component and then we had these investments and primarily the cost to serve partial offset to those other two drivers. So overall, Phil feel good about the overall health of the business and the contribution of COVID within it.\nAaron Alt: Yes with respect to the non-recurring adjustments. We previewed this back at the JP Morgan conference and when we updated our commentary around the medical business and our comment that -- is our coming out, which is and we have continued to dig deep across the portfolio, we've taken a decision to take some non-recurring adjustments, which the majority of which hit the at-Home business, which now reports or will report as part of other in Q3, as well as component hitting the wave mark business which is part of the new GMPD business. So if you read through the update to our guidance for the year where we moved from approximately 400 to approximately 380 driven by the impact of the non-recurring adjustments you can reach your own conclusions as to the relative quantification and the distribution given those comments. Thanks. Operator Thank you very much, sir. Our next question is coming Charles Rhyee from TD Cowen, please go ahead.\nCharles Rhyee: Yes, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to follow-up on Allen\u2019s question there on the vaccine impact. I understand your saying that it kind of, you expect it to peak in the December quarter. Would you say that the contribution, though, from vaccine was higher than in the first quarter given that you had still three months of overall and if we look at that relative to what you had expected the higher costs that you incurred? Did you use that to fund those kind of investments? Just wanted to get a sense on relative contribution?\nJason Hollar: Yes, as I highlighted, October was the peak month and since we only had a partial September, it is clearly higher in Q2 than in Q1. We did have November and December contributions as well, but it really tailed off by the time we got to the end of the quarter and that's why you would expect there it be very little it was just typical for vaccines in general, so there's nothing we're seeing there. And again I think that the way you ask the question around the funding of investments I'll just go back to my prior answer to that question. There were costs associated with the vaccine rollout. As you can imagine, that's a lot of volume to ramp up for really two months-worth of support. Our team did a fantastic job working with the manufacturers and our customers to play that role when we were not involved in the vaccine distribution before for COVID. So I feel very good about our role and we did have to incur cost associated with the ramp up and ramp down in such a short period of time. But that was not necessarily used as currency to fund other programs, where the programs are important strategically and all very consistent with the plans and the actions and the forecast we\u2019ve laid out here, so there is no changes as it relates to how we are approaching these both short-term requirements, as well as long-term investments.\nAaron Alt: Probably worth emphasizing that Jason\u2019s point is that September and October were the high points for COVID for us from a distribution perspective would we tailing off thereafter.\nMatt Sims: Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you very much, gentlemen. And our last question today will be coming from Mr. Daniel Grosslight of Citi. Please go ahead, sir.\nDaniel Grosslight: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I want to just go back quickly to the medical profitability question and confirm one thing, that $20 million one-time item that was wholly kind of concentrated this quarter. So without that, the medical profitability would have been around $90 million. And then on your commentary around shipping rates coming down and benefiting you, and the volatility in Red Sea, if you look at the -- China to Westcoast shipping rates, they have spiked materially in January. So I\u2019m wondering how, I guess couple of thigs there; one how that may kind of roll through you contracts. And then given that you capitalize those costs and expenses over two to three quarters post those cost being capitalized. How that might impact the cadence of your medical improvement plan in fiscal \u201925? Thank you.\nAaron Alt: So the first-half of that question, you are thinking about things correctly. I'll go back and emphasize we were really pleased with the operational performance of the business and given that we've adjusted our yearly guidance just to reflect the impact of the non-recurring adjustments in Q2, your conclusion on the math would be reasonable.\nJason Hollar: Yes and the second component, you are correct that shipping rates have spiked. I think the word used was materially. And how I would characterize it is yes, that's accurate, but substantially less materially than where they were in the past. So the order of magnitude we're talking about is vastly smaller. It is also something that we do not believe that that will be the permanent level. Yes, we have more flexibility in our contracts, and that will continue to be a lever and a component that will be evaluating, determining on whether, you know, how permanent these are or not. I would also say that our maturity our capability within this space has substantially improved as well as we've invested in the underlying processes and procedures to manage through these types of this type of volatility. So you know overall we feel very good about where we stand and generally don't see this being as a material item, but we'll continue to watch it closely.\nOperator: Thank you very much sir. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today\u2019s Q&A session. I turn the call back over to Mr. Jason Hollar for the additional or closure remarks. Thank you.\nJason Hollar: Yes, thanks everyone for joining us this morning. We're clearly excited about the momentum that we have in our business, both the shorter term operational elements that we talked a lot about today, but also about the longer term strategy with the announcement especially networks this week it just highlights that we are looking and acting both short-term and long-term and are really excited about the opportunity still in front of us. So thanks again for joining us today and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you so much sir. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today\u2019s conference and thank you for your attendance. You may now disconnect. Good day and goodbye.",

            "name": "Aaron Alt",
            "content": "Thanks, Jason, and good morning. Before we begin let me remind you that our Q2 segment commentary will be according to our former segment structure pharma and medical. Let's start with total company results for the second quarter. Q2 delivered another strong quarter across the enterprise with EPS of $1.82, growth of 38%, which included operating earnings growth of 20%. We also delivered strong cash flow and ended the quarter with $4.6 billion of cash, even following incremental share repurchase activity in the quarter. As seen on slide four, total company revenue increased 12% to $57.4 billion, reflecting growth in both the pharma and medical segments. We drove operating leverage for the enterprise despite incremental investments in the business and higher costs to support sales growth. Gross margin increased 11% to $1.8 billion, driven by both segments, and consolidated SG&A increased 8% to $1.3 billion. With the strong profit growth in both segments, we deliver operating earnings of $562 million, 20% higher than a year ago. Moving below the line, interest and other decreased by $26 million to $8 million in income due to increased interest income on cash and equivalents from higher cash balances and higher rates. As we've noted, our debt is largely fixed rate, resulting in a net benefit from rising interest rates in the near-term. Additionally Q2 interest and other benefited from nearly $10 million in income from the quarterly revaluation of our company's deferred compensation plan investments, which as a reminder has a matching offset above the line. Our second quarter effective tax rate of 21.3% was 1.7 percentage points lower than a year ago and better than we anticipated due to positive discrete items in the period. Q2 average diluted shares outstanding were $246 million, 6% lower than a year ago due to share repurchases in each of the last four quarters. And as I mentioned earlier, the net result for Q2 was EPS of $1.82, reflecting growth of 38%. Let's turn to the pharma segment on slide five. Second quarter revenue increased 12% to $53.5 billion, driven by brand and specialty pharmaceutical sales growth from existing customers. We saw strong pharmaceutical demand across product categories, brand, specialty, consumer health, and generics, and from our largest customers. We also continue to see robust demand for GLP-1 medications, which provided a revenue tailwind in the quarter. Segment profit increased 12% to $518 million in the second quarter, driven by positive generics program performance and the higher contribution from brand and specialty products, including distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. Our positive generics program performance continue to reflect volume growth and consistent market dynamics. With respect to COVID-19 vaccines, we saw the strength and demand from September for the fall immunization season carry into October before peaking mid-month and trending to a much lower run rate as we exited the second quarter. The Q2 increase in segment profit includes a partial offset from higher costs to support sales growth driven by increased pharmaceutical volumes. Turning to the medical segment on slide six. Second quarter revenue increased 3% to $3.9 billion, which as Jason alluded to, reflects quarterly revenue growth for the medical segment for the first time in over two years. This increase was driven by growth in both at-Home Solutions and global medical products and distribution, with the GMPD growth primarily related to higher Cardinal Health brand volumes. Medical delivered segment profit of $71 million, a $54 million year-over-year increase, driven by an improvement in net inflationary impacts, including our mitigation initiatives. Consistent with the expectations communicated a few weeks ago, segment profit was generally consistent with Q1, despite some non-recurring adjustments in the quarter. We continue to be encouraged by the underlying performance of the business, which through the first two quarters of the year has tracked consistent with our original plans. Now turning to the balance sheet. We generated robust adjusted free cash flow of $1 billion in Q2, bringing our year-to-date adjusted free cash flow to $2 billion. And as I noted earlier, end of the quarter with $4.6 billion of cash on hand. We remain focused on doing what we said we would, deploying capital according to our disciplined capital allocation framework. Thus far, through the first-half of fiscal \u201824, we've continued to invest against our highest priorities, including investing back into the businesses to drive organic growth with over $200 million in year-to-date CapEx. In the first-half, we have returned $1 billion total to shareholders, which includes our quarterly dividend payments and $750 million in year-to-date share repurchases. These share repurchases are in excess of our committed baseline repurchases of $500 million. And in January, we made certain opioid settlement prepayments of $238 million at a pre-negotiated discount, which is expected to result in a [gap] (ph) only gain of approximately $100 million in the third quarter. Now for our updated fiscal \u201824 guidance on slide eight, beginning with the enterprise. With our strong first-half performance and positive outlook, we are again raising our fiscal \u201824 EPS guidance. Our new range of $7.20 to $7.35 reflects a $0.45 increase at the bottom end and a $0.35 cent increase at the top end from our Q1 guidance range. And a midpoint which is 26% above our fiscal \u201823 EPS results. We are encouraged by the operating performance of our businesses and our strong cash regeneration, which is certainly contributing to the improvements below the line. Interest in other is reduced to a range of $50 million to $65 million, which primarily reflects increased interest income from higher than anticipated cash balances. We expect lower average cash balances in the second-half of the year due in part to the seasonal timing of anticipated cash flows. We are evaluating opportunities to refinance our upcoming 2024 debt maturities in the back half of the year. We are lowering the top end of our effective tax rate guidance to a new range of 23% to 24% to reflect the positive discrete items we've seen in the first-half of the year. We also are lowering our shares outlook to approximately $247 million, which reflects the $250 million accelerated share repurchase program we completed in Q2. No additional share repurchases are assumed in our updated guidance for fiscal year \u201824. Now turning to the fiscal \u201824 outlook for our segments. While we will be transitioning to our new segment structure reporting beginning in Q3, let me start with our former segments as a comparison point for the updated structure. No changes to the outlook for the former pharma segment. We are reiterating the 10% to 12% revenue growth and 7% to 9% segment profit growth. For the former medical segment, the fiscal \u201824 outlook is updated to approximately $380 million a segment profit to reflect the net impact of Q2 non-recurring adjustments. Outside of these, our overall operational expectations are consistent with delivering the prior $400 million in segment profit for the year, as well as the corresponding prior expectation of $650 million in segment profit for fiscal year \u201826. We have consistently highlighted the back half weighting of the medical guidance, driven by progress within GMPD on Cardinal Health brand volume growth, the cumulative impact of inflation mitigation, and some business specific seasonality. Our expectations there continue. For example, with inflation mitigation, we have strong visibility to overall cost improvements in the second-half of the year, driven by reductions we've observed in international freight, which is a reminder reflecting our income statement on a two to three quarter delay and as we exit January the mitigation initiatives necessary to achieve our year-end target are now largely in place. Now as seen on slide 10, let me comment on how this fiscal year \u201824 guidance translates to our updated segment structure. To go along with the preliminary recast fiscal \u201823 actuals and long-term targets we provided a few weeks back. Our new structure went into effect January 1. So beginning in Q3, we will report results and provide drivers reporting to the new segment structure, pharmaceutical and specialty solutions and GMPD and separate from these two segments, nuclear at-Home, an OptiFreight aggregated in other. At that time, we also plan to provide a recast of the results for fiscal \u201822 to \u201824 on the new segmentation. Beginning with the pharmaceutical and specialty solutions segment, the guidance ranges are consistent with the former pharma segment, even excluding our higher growth nuclear business. We expect 10% to 12% revenue growth and 7% to 9% segment profit outlook for fiscal \u201824 and a 4^ to 6% segment profit growth CAGR over the long-term. Turning to GMPD where we remain encouraged by the improvements in this business. For the execution of the medical improvement plan initiatives, we expect to drive GMPD from an operating loss of approximately $165 million in fiscal \u201823 to operating income of approximately $65 million in fiscal \u201824. From the fiscal \u201823 low point, this $230 million year-over-year improvement would position us roughly half way towards our fiscal '26 target of approximately $300 million for segment profit. Finally we expect the businesses including other, at-Home Solutions, Nuclear & Precision Health Solutions and OptiFreight Logistics to collectively deliver 6% to 8% segment profit growth in fiscal year \u201824. The difference between this fiscal \u201824 growth rate and the long-term CAGR of 8% to 10% for fiscal \u201824 to \u201826 reflects the portion of the Q2 non-recurring adjustments within at-Home Solutions with the remainder residing in GMPD. Before I close a couple of comments on our recently announced acquisition. We've noted that the specialty category has been our highest priority for potential M&A and a primary consideration for our opportunistic capital employment as part of our disciplined capital allocation framework. Given our financial flexibility and strong presence in the other 60% of the specialty market in therapeutic areas outside of oncology, we have evaluated a range of potential acquisition candidates to further accelerate our specialty strategy. We are thrilled to reach an agreement for specialty networks to become a part of the Cardinal Health family. Jason will elaborate on the strategic aspects of the deal, but we plan to include the expected financial impacts of the transaction in our guidance upon closing, which of course is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals. For general modeling purposes, we expect the deal to be accretive 12 months following close. So, to wrap up, tremendous progress in the first-half of the year with exciting value creation opportunities still in front of us. We are confident in our plans and grateful for the efforts of our team, who continue to drive our ongoing initiatives and prioritize the needs of our customers. With that, I will turn it back over to Jason. Probably worth noting that it is a profitable business today and as Jason highlighted we do intend to invest in the business early on to expand the scope of what they are doing across not only their own initiatives, but our initiatives within specialty as well. We're happy to offer some perspective. We're quite pleased with the below the line results of course you know for the quarter. I'm going to start with the fact that as we announced we ended the quarter with $4.6 billion of cash on hand and of course that's driven by the strong cash generation, which was the end part of your question. If you think back to our investor day we had highlighted that further optimization of our cash flow position was something we were focused on doing and the team has delivered against those efforts internally and generated strong cash flow in the first-half for the business thus the balance. Of course the knock-on consequence of that is when we have more cash on hand particularly in the higher interest rate environment, which we've been operating, we'll get a higher return, right? And we have indeed benefited from greater rate of return on the larger cash balances that we've had in place. It's also the case that there is some geography within our statement, because deferred comp was a positive for us below the line. That's an offsetting negative above the line in the quarter as well. And so, it's really the aggregation of those three things, of those several things which led to the results for the quarter. Now you asked about the financing as well. And I should be clear on a couple of things just as we think about our models going forward. We do have maturities coming in June and November. We're assessing when our opportunities are there, nothing to announce today in that respect that we will address that, you know, at some point as we carry forward. And there is also the case that our cash balances fluctuate seasonally in the back half as well and so we wouldn't expect the high balance to remain where it is just given the seasonal demand on the business. Thank you. We were really encouraged by the underlying performance in Q2 of the medical business. And just to restate the results, the Q2 results were consistent with the expectations we communicated several weeks ago at the JPMorgan Conference and generally consistent with Q1, despite some of those adjustments that we took in the quarter. I want to emphasize that as you move away from the adjustments that we took, the underlying elements of the Medical Improvement Plan, they are on track, right? You heard some of my preferred remarks relative to our progress against the mitigation of inflation and how our cost structure is building. The benefits of each actions we've taken will benefit our cost structure in the back half of the year. You heard us announce that we had revenue growth for the first time in two years in the quarter as well, and we were pleased with the Cardinal Health brand growth that comes with that. And the team continues to execute against the simplification initiatives that have been a core part of the medical improvement plan all along. So let me go back to where I started, which is we were quite pleased with the operational performance in the quarter. I also want to point out that from a guidance perspective, while we updated the guidance for the year to reflect the relative impact of the non-recurring adjustments, that was the sum change of the guidance, to reflect that which is behind us, not that which is ahead. And if you think through how we have guided medical for the year all along, there's always been a very back half focused trajectory for our guidance for the year and that remains unchanged along with how pleased we are with the core operational performance. Eric, it's probably worth offering one additional point of perspective. We're not reporting on the new segment structure this structure that will follow on Q3, but we can offer the observation that the GMPD core part of the medical business has operated at near breakeven levels in the first-half of fiscal \u201824. And I offer you that in contrast with where they were from a fiscal \u201823 perspective and where we're going from an overall guidance perspective, we view that as a key sign of positive progress. Happy to offer some perspective. We were pleased in the quarter to actually achieve operating leverage with gross profit growing faster than SG&A. SG&A did grow, of course volume also grew, and so the primary component of our increase in cost was tied to the variable cost of serving higher volumes. It is also the case though that as Jason has highlighted in his strategic remarks, we are investing against our business and some of the SG&A growth was purposeful relative to the investments we're making in places like the Navista and other elements of our growth plans. But I will end with the fact that we are very focused on SG&A as a whole and the team continues to look for further opportunities as we have in prior years to optimize our cost structure. For those working on their models, it's probably worth pointing out that with respect to the Q2 profitability in the business, it was the case that last year we called out unusual strength in the overall farm of demand, particularly from large customers, as well as a very strong cough, cold and flu season, so as you're looking at your comparisons keep that in mind. The businesses that report through other for us going forward will be our at-Home business, our Nuclear Precision Health Business, and our OptiFreight business. Those are what we have traditionally called our growth businesses as part of other segments. And indeed over the long-term we expect them, the CAGR on their collective growth to be 8% to 10 percent. The disconnect you're referencing which is the 6% to 8% in fiscal \u201824 is only driven by the impact of the non-recurring adjustments from Q2 on the at-Home business that we referenced a couple of weeks ago as we talked about our expectations for Q2. Each of the businesses contribute to the revenue and profit growth for other. For instance, we carry forward in our earlier disclosures, I think you can get pretty close we disclosed the revenue of the individual pieces. And indeed, we've talked about nuclear, doubling its profit off of its fiscal \u201821 baseline by fiscal \u201826 as well. I believe and so you're able to get to that component of other through that. Yes with respect to the non-recurring adjustments. We previewed this back at the JP Morgan conference and when we updated our commentary around the medical business and our comment that -- is our coming out, which is and we have continued to dig deep across the portfolio, we've taken a decision to take some non-recurring adjustments, which the majority of which hit the at-Home business, which now reports or will report as part of other in Q3, as well as component hitting the wave mark business which is part of the new GMPD business. So if you read through the update to our guidance for the year where we moved from approximately 400 to approximately 380 driven by the impact of the non-recurring adjustments you can reach your own conclusions as to the relative quantification and the distribution given those comments. Thanks. Operator Thank you very much, sir. Our next question is coming Charles Rhyee from TD Cowen, please go ahead. Probably worth emphasizing that Jason's point is that September and October were the high points for COVID for us from a distribution perspective would we tailing off thereafter. So the first-half of that question, you are thinking about things correctly. I'll go back and emphasize we were really pleased with the operational performance of the business and given that we've adjusted our yearly guidance just to reflect the impact of the non-recurring adjustments in Q2, your conclusion on the math would be reasonable."

            "name": "Jason Hollar",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. In the last few weeks, we've made several notable announcements regarding our company's continued progress, including yesterday's news on our agreement to acquire specialty networks, which will further our specialty growth strategy and create value for specialty providers, manufacturers, and patients in exciting new ways. And as we highlighted at a recent industry conference, we're continuing to take actions to become a simplified and more focused company with further progress achieved on our ongoing business and portfolio review and our updated enterprise operating and segment reporting structure, which will be reflected in our financial reporting beginning next quarter. We plan to go further into our recent updates with you today, but first, let me begin with a few brief comments on our results. In Q2, we delivered strong profit growth in both segments, demonstrating continued operating momentum and execution against our strategic priorities. Pharma again delivered strong performance. Overall, the business is performing consistent with our expectations, and we're pleased to reiterate our outlook for 7% to 9% segment profit growth in fiscal \u201824. We've seen ongoing stability in macro trends, including in our generic program, and continued broad-based strength in overall pharmaceutical demand. Our specialty distribution business also continued to see strong demand, including with COVID-19 vaccines in the first part of the quarter. Turning to medical, Q2 segment profit was consistent with Q1, despite the non-recurring adjustments in the second quarter, which we've reflected in our updated fiscal \u201824 outlook for the former medical segment. We're encouraged by the underlying improvements in operating performance, reflecting further progress with our medical improvement plan efforts, focused on our global medical products and distribution business. Notably, we saw a change in trend in revenue growth for the medical segment in the second quarter. Along with continued growth from at-Home Solutions, we're seeing the effects of our five-point plan to grow Cardinal Health brand volumes yield positive results. And as we continue to optimize not only the performance of our businesses, but also the financial strength of the broader enterprise, we're generating robust cashflow and seeing meaningful benefits below the operating line. As a result of our first-half performance and increased confidence as we look ahead, we're pleased to raise our fiscal \u201824 EPS guidance and our outlook for adjusted free cashflow. Of course, our customers remain at the center of everything we do, and our team continues to prioritize core operational execution to best serve them and their patients with essential products and services as we drive our company forward. Now let me turn it over to Aaron to review our results and updated guidance in more detail. Thanks, Aaron. Now for some additional perspective on our strategic priorities beginning with priority number one and building upon the growth of pharma and specialty solutions, our largest and most significant business. Though this segment structure has slightly changed, our focus on executing in the core remains. We're building upon our strong foundation, while investing to accelerate growth in specialty both downstream and upstream. We believe that this new segment structure further enables those efforts by enhancing management focus, leveraging the connectivity between pharmaceutical distribution and specialty, and positioning the business for long-term growth and investment. More on that front shortly. A key component of our strong core foundation is our generics program anchored by Red Oak, which continues to do an excellent job fulfilling its dual mandate, managing both cost and supply. Red Oak leverages proprietary analytical tools and their deep industry expertise to help maximize service delivery for customers. We're continuing to invest in our business to provide customer-focused solutions and evolve our commercial engagement strategies to prioritize addressing the complex challenges our customers face every day. For example, at Investor Day, we highlighted our first-to-market clinically integrated supply chain, the Cardinal Health InteLogix platform. This innovative solution leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning through the Palantir Foundry platform to help providers reduce costs, optimize drug inventories, and generate actionable insights to simplify and streamline medication supply. We've continued to develop our offerings, such as the contract optimizer tool, which drives savings and value through contract compliance, cost controls, and product alternatives like brand generics, blood plasma, and more. Key health system customers are already benefiting from these capabilities, and we see opportunities for further future expansion. Shifting to specialty, where we have also been investing to expand our offering into complementary areas. The acquisition of specialty networks is exciting to us on a number of fronts. This is a business with which we were already very familiar, given the long-standing partnership to service their members through our specialty distribution. Specialty networks is a technology-enabled, multi-specialty group purchasing and practice enhancement organization serving 11,500 total providers today, including more than 7,000 physicians across 1,200 independent urology, gastroenterology, and rheumatology practices. We see their service capabilities as accelerating our efforts in critical ways. First, further extending our reach, expertise, and offerings in key therapeutic areas to provide increased clinical and economic value for specialty providers. Specialty networks is a leader in specialty practice management, research, and technologies that support physicians in lowering costs, operating more efficiently, and delivering best-in-class care to their patients. For example, the company provides solutions that improve clinical and economic outcomes to over 3,000 urologists through its leading euro GPO. Second, creating a platform for our expansion across specialty therapeutic areas. The company's PPS analytics solution is a subscription-based advanced technology platform that utilizes artificial intelligence, such as continuous learning algorithms and natural language processing to analyze data for electronic medical records, practice management, imaging and dispensing systems, and transform it into actionable insights for providers and other stakeholders. We see this complementing our suite of clinical practice management and distribution solutions to specialty practices nationwide. Specialty networks experience and capabilities and clinical engagement are robust, which also accelerates our upstream data and research opportunities with biopharma manufacturers. Third, enhancing the capabilities of our specialty business, including supporting the ongoing build of the Navista network. Specialty networks have a deep understanding of independent physician practices, and we see capabilities and expertise that will accelerate our ongoing development of the Navista network, which is focused on supporting the clinical and operational needs of independent community oncologists. In summary, this transaction enhances our specialty strategy by providing new capabilities that strengthen the link between our downstream and upstream services, enabling us to create further value for customers, manufacturer partners, and patients. Turning to priority number two in the GMPD business, where we're executing the medical improvement plan. While the business and portfolio review of GMPD continues, the team continues to prioritize and make significant progress in turning around the operational performance of this business, as Aaron indicated, with our expectation that the business returns to profitability in fiscal 2024. The number one priority remains mitigating supply chain inflation, where we remain on track to address the impact by the time we exit fiscal '24. As of Q2 we're approximately 75% to target. On the cost side, while overall still elevated, we've seen lower international freight costs reflected in our results as anticipated, and we have strong line of sight to continued improvement in the second-half of the fiscal year. We've continued to make progress with our mitigation initiatives and commercial contracting efforts and are continually taking additional actions to offset elevated inflation, such as through sourcing initiatives. As Aaron indicated, the work we've accomplished to-date provides increased confidence in achieving our fiscal year-end target as overall cost improvements continue to reflect in our second-half results. We're continuing to invest in the resiliency of our supply chain and our manufacturing and distribution capacity. We have opened three new distribution centers in the past year, adding capacity for growth, while featuring state-of-the-art automation technology to streamline operations. For example, our new Greater Toronto area DC expands capacity to serve Cardinal Health Canada customers, while leveraging autonomous mobile robots to increase picking and packing accuracy and drive efficiencies. We're also continuing to invest in new product innovation and portfolio expansion in key categories in alignment with our disciplined portfolio management approach. As a result of our team's collective efforts, we're seeing our five-point plan to grow Cardinal Health brand volume result in improvements in our leading indicators and most importantly, strong customer retention and product volume growth. Finally, we continue to drive simplification and optimize our cost structure by exiting non-core product lines, rationalizing our network and streamlining our international footprint. We believe our new structure will further enable our medical improvement plan efforts as we continue to execute the plan and deliver value for customers. Now, priority number three, accelerating growth in key areas. We are excited about the strong demand we are seeing in our at-Home Solutions and OptiFreight businesses, and our recent determination to further invest in and develop these businesses for long-term value creation as part of our portfolio. In at-Home Solutions, we continue to focus on enabling and supporting comfortable home-based care for patients with acute and chronic conditions. To support the growing demand for home health care, we're investing to expand the capacity of our network, the breadth of our offering, and a new technology to drive operating efficiencies. We recently announced plans for a new distribution center to be built in Texas with increased capacity, advanced automation technology, and robotics within the facility. And our previously announced 350,000 square foot facility being built in South Carolina is on track to open this calendar year. In OptiFreight Logistics, we're continuing to invest in digital tools to enable healthcare supply chain leaders to better manage their shipping spend and support the core volume growth in our business. We've launched new offerings to give our customers more supply chain visibility, and we are receiving great feedback. For example, we now have more than 1,000 healthcare providers leveraging our total view insights platform to gain valuable insights on their operations. In nuclear and precision health solutions, we're continuing to see above market growth in both our core business and Theranostics, as we're a premier partner of choice due to our strong core foundation and differentiation with pharmaceutical manufacturers looking for commercialization success of their future radiopharmaceutical portfolios. For example, in Theranostics prostate cancer radio diagnostics are important tools for healthcare providers to assess and properly treat the disease. We saw meaningful year-over-year revenue growth in the first-half of fiscal \u201824 from the ramp up in demand of these diagnostics. From a pipeline perspective, we're investing to expand our Center for Theranostics Advancement with demand from pharmaceutical manufacturer partners currently oversubscribed. And we're investing to expand the capabilities and resiliency of our pet manufacturing network to enable portfolio diversification and accommodate growth from the increasing demand for pet agents. This is driven by trends such as an aging population, cancer prevalence, emerging Alzheimer's therapy, availability and reimbursement and increasing clinical trial needs. Finally, priority number four, maximizing shareholder value creation. We're continuing to maximize shareholder value creation through our improved operational performance, robust cash flow, and responsible allocation of capital. As Aaron noted, our robust cash flow generation is not only driving benefits below the operating line, it is enabling our opportunistic capital deployment with additional share repurchases in the quarter beyond our baseline plan and our ability to pursue value-creating M&A in specialty. We remain well-positioned with the financial flexibility to continue opportunistically evaluating disciplined M&A not only in specialty, but in our other growth areas and potential additional share repurchases. With our recent conclusions on our business portfolio review, we do not have further updates to share today, but plan to keep you apprised of our progress. To close, we had a strong first-half of the year and are excited about the many initiatives underway to build upon our momentum. I would like to thank our highly engaged and talented team for driving our progress and prioritizing our customers as we fulfill our critical role as healthcare's most trusted partner. With that, we will take your questions. Okay, great. Thanks. Good morning, Stephanie. Yes, we're really excited about specialty networks. And as I -- I love how you asked the question, Stephanie, because there's a lot that goes into this business, and we love all of it, whether it's the GPO or the analytics and technology behind it. Specifically, PPS analytics is something we thought was really special, not just in terms of how this team has created this capability for their original primary business of urology, but then how they've expanded it into other therapeutic areas, and we felt we could learn from that further and use that technology across potentially other therapeutic areas beyond the three that they're in today. So that was really exciting to us and certainly a key part of the value. So we definitely attributed good value to that technology and where we believe that can go. And not only that good for our business, but importantly we see that technology is really solving a lot of customer both provider and manufacturer challenges and ultimately giving a much better solutions to the end-patient. So it's a win-win across the industry and one that plugs in nicely to our strategy and to be throughout the specialty space. So we feel great about that and I certainly don't want to miss that we are also through this transaction acquiring a fantastic leadership team that will plug in very nicely to our own existing team. And so it's a culture that I think will work very well together. We've had a fantastic, very quick process. We've known specialty networks for quite a while, but from the point that we started talking about a possible tie up, we went from the beginning to the end of course doing a deep and thorough diligence, but nonetheless knowing the business well, so that we could quickly understand the value for us. As it relates to your second question on hurdle rates, I'm not sure exactly which part of the business you're referring to. But generally speaking, I think no matter what part of our business we're talking about it's a competitive, it's stable type of environment and so I'm not normally going to go deeper into that anyways, but generally you know speaking we're not really calling out anything from the overall market perspective today regardless of what our business we're talking about utilization continues to be quite good and predictable so we're in a nice environment for ongoing growth both organically, as well as enable to look optimistically at transactions like this. Sure, Lisa. Very clear here. No, there's no change in our commitment to this business. It has been there from the very beginning and continues to be. As I highlighted from the first moment when we talked about medical in the context of the business portfolio review, our number one priority has always been and continues to be turning the business around. Everything that we are working on has been in service of, first of all, the five-point plan to drive Cardinal Health plan volumes to mitigate inflation and drive additional value through simplification and cost reductions. That message and the progress we made is entirely consistent with that. The core operational performance of the business is exactly how we've laid it out. So the only update that we've had today were in recognition of some of those non-recurring items, but the plan and the fiscal year \u201826 aggregate targets that we're going after are absolutely unchanged to this resegmentation. We did have to bucket the medical improvement plan into the various buckets, because we did have the growth businesses that were a component of that. But that was just moving the pieces. The pieces are absolutely unchanged and the overall aggregate profitability in that long-term plan is absolutely unchanged and our commitment is absolutely unchanged to this business. And I'm really excited about the progress that the team is making in service of all those goals. Yeah, if I could just add, you know, when you think about that first-half, second-half things and why we still anticipate the same step up in the second-half versus the first-half. There's a couple of key points. First of all, inflation mitigation, this is one where it's a significant part of that combined with Cardinal Health brand volume growth, which I'll get to in a moment. But on the inflation mitigation, there's of course two elements. There's the cost side, and then there's a price side. In both cases we have very good line of sight. On the cost side as we've talked really for quite a while now it's been the international freight and that while we have a little bit of noise with the Red Sea it is largely as anticipated so and that cost is already on our balance sheet and is rolling through as expected, especially given our volumes have been as expected. So, we have a very high line of sight and confidence the cost is going to continue to step down in the second-half of the year. And then on the pricing side, as we talked before, there's always the contract roll-through that we then update the pricing on. We do have a little bit more at the beginning of the calendar year of some of the price adjustments. So January being behind us, we have a really good line of sight to the pricing side as well. So there's some time now for the next couple of quarters needed to get that to roll through our income statement. But the actions now are largely behind us as it relates to inflation mitigation. We've always had confidence we would get to this stage, but we're now at this stage and have even more confidence actually seeing it start to come through in the second-half of the year. Now the other component is the Cardinal Health brand volume. You know, part of that's going to be market-driven, and the market volume, that utilization continues to be quite good. And what was exciting about the second quarter is seeing that further inflection and actually participating in that market growth really for the first time at the extent that what the market is growing. So that gives us much greater confidence that we'll continue to see that growth and that stuff as we get over the course of the year. But there's some variables like the market itself that will always be an impact here, good or bad, that will continue to monitor and track. So that those are the key points that I get us from the first-half to the second-half. Appreciate the question. I think as we called out in commenting on the strong quarter that our pharma business had was that the continued consistent market dynamics within the generic space matched with volume, strong volume was a reason for -- one of the reasons for success in the business. We often talk about the two sides of the equation being in balance and indeed that's what we continue to see within our generic business and that is indeed a core component of our guidance for the pharma as we carry forward. One last reminder, I do want to remind that last quarter we actually took our pharma guidance up from a profit perspective to 7% to 9%. Thank you. Yes, sure. I'll touch on both points here. There's no updates with the Optum contracted those through this fiscal year. And as I highlighted before, they are a great customer of ours, long-standing customer, one that brings a lot of innovation to healthcare, and one that we've worked very hard over the years to attempt to exceed their expectations, and we think we're doing a great job of that, and we'd love to keep working with them, of course. Now, I do get a lot of questions around the order of magnitude of this, and I'm not going to go into details, but just a couple of points, you know, given the number of questions I've received, is we have disclosed in the past, and I think it comes through in every K, just the order of magnitude, so last year they were over $30 billion customer of ours, and I see a lot of people attempting to try to model out impacts and things of that nature. And there's a couple things that I'm not sure is real clear about the scope of business we have with them today. It is a prime, the majority of the revenue we have with them is through our base PD business and a lot of that is mail order volume. So what you have here are the typical markers of a large customer, PD majority and mail order. So those are all, you know, markers of lower than average margin type of business and so we do have other business with them of course too. They are very large and have a lot of breadth into various parts of the industry, but for us those tend to be a little bit of the overweight of how we support them. As it relates to the SG&A, the only thing I would say is no it's not like that what we do is we look at the capabilities and the necessities needed both short-term and long-term. Short-term is going to be on volume and making sure we can support our customers in getting that strong volume growth across the enterprise and in place we are then looking to balance that with longer term investments whether it's the Navista network we've called out before as investments, but we also have others that we went through during investor day and have had a number of updates even today, within our at-Home business we have three new facilities that we're bringing online over the course of the next year or two within the medical distribution three facilities I talked about today, we have on the pharma side the consumer health new logistics center. So I also made some comments around some of the IT capabilities within pharma, some of the e-commerce and intralogics capability. So we are investing where it makes sense efficiently, very well aligned to our strategy. And these are non-investments that you can just turn on and off. So it's something that we're going to invest as appropriate, but only what we have to do as well. We want to take away waste and invest it where there's growth is the key objective. Yes. So for the vaccine, we just kind of walk through the last couple of quarters and I'll give you a flavor of the benefits and the trends and such. So as we talked last quarter, we've highlighted in Q1 with the FDA approval at the beginning of September we were staged to hit the ground running and we had fairly significant volume in that first quarter, but as anticipated we indicated that point that we would expect it to peak within Q2 and so we expected higher volume, higher contribution in Q2 versus Q1 and that was because we saw October as the largest month within that season. And then as expected, we saw that wind down over the course of November and December, still seeing some level of volume in Q3, but I would expect it to be quite insignificant, compared to what we saw in Q1 and then Q2. Overall, I think the key message is that this is consistent with our expectations, as Aaron highlighted in his comments already. We had multiple drivers of growth for the pharma segment in the second quarter. It was strength with the generics program within brand. It was COVID driving that component and then we had these investments and primarily the cost to serve partial offset to those other two drivers. So overall, Phil feel good about the overall health of the business and the contribution of COVID within it. Yes, as I highlighted, October was the peak month and since we only had a partial September, it is clearly higher in Q2 than in Q1. We did have November and December contributions as well, but it really tailed off by the time we got to the end of the quarter and that's why you would expect there it be very little it was just typical for vaccines in general, so there's nothing we're seeing there. And again I think that the way you ask the question around the funding of investments I'll just go back to my prior answer to that question. There were costs associated with the vaccine rollout. As you can imagine, that's a lot of volume to ramp up for really two months-worth of support. Our team did a fantastic job working with the manufacturers and our customers to play that role when we were not involved in the vaccine distribution before for COVID. So I feel very good about our role and we did have to incur cost associated with the ramp up and ramp down in such a short period of time. But that was not necessarily used as currency to fund other programs, where the programs are important strategically and all very consistent with the plans and the actions and the forecast we've laid out here, so there is no changes as it relates to how we are approaching these both short-term requirements, as well as long-term investments. Yes and the second component, you are correct that shipping rates have spiked. I think the word used was materially. And how I would characterize it is yes, that's accurate, but substantially less materially than where they were in the past. So the order of magnitude we're talking about is vastly smaller. It is also something that we do not believe that that will be the permanent level. Yes, we have more flexibility in our contracts, and that will continue to be a lever and a component that will be evaluating, determining on whether, you know, how permanent these are or not. I would also say that our maturity our capability within this space has substantially improved as well as we've invested in the underlying processes and procedures to manage through these types of this type of volatility. So you know overall we feel very good about where we stand and generally don't see this being as a material item, but we'll continue to watch it closely. Yes, thanks everyone for joining us this morning. We're clearly excited about the momentum that we have in our business, both the shorter term operational elements that we talked a lot about today, but also about the longer term strategy with the announcement especially networks this week it just highlights that we are looking and acting both short-term and long-term and are really excited about the opportunity still in front of us. So thanks again for joining us today and have a great day."

With that, I will now turn the call over to Jason.\nJason Hollar: Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Overall, it was a great start to our fiscal year, with strong first quarter results and an improved outlook for the year, we are continuing our operating momentum into fiscal 2024. In the first quarter, we delivered significant profit growth in both segments. In Pharma, the results were driven by the strength across our business, including continued positive performance from our generics program. We also benefited from our role distributing the recently commercialized COVID-19 vaccines, which I'll elaborate on later in my remarks. Macro trends in the core distribution business remains stable, and we continue to see strong pharmaceutical demand, including the GLP-1 medications. And both our higher-growth specialty nuclear businesses tracked ahead of plan in the quarter. In Medical, the first quarter was another proof point of the inflection we began to see last Q2 in this business. Recall, the segment was unprofitable only a year ago. Overall, results tracked slightly ahead of our expectations, and we continue to execute our Medical Improvement Plan initiatives to drive better and more predictable financial performance. In particular, we made notable progress on inflation mitigation in the quarter. At an enterprise level, we realized notable operating leverage from our efforts to manage costs across the segments. And below the operating line, our favorable capital structure and responsible capital deployment provided tailwinds, enabled by our strong cash flow generation. In short, the broad-based performance to-date gives us confidence to raise fiscal 2024 EPS guidance only a quarter into the year. Our team continues to prioritize focused execution to best serve our customers and create value for shareholders. I'll update you on our progress in advancing our three key strategic imperatives shortly, but first, let me turn it over to Aaron to review our results and updated guidance in more detail.\nAaron Alt: Thanks, Jason, and good morning. Q1 delivered a strong financial start to the year, with EPS of $1.73, surpassing our expectations in Pharma and Medical. The strength of our pharma business, the progress on our medical turnaround efforts and our disciplined approach to capital allocation contributed to new first quarter highs for the enterprise on both revenue and EPS. We also delivered strong cash flow and ended the quarter with $3.9 billion of cash. Let's start with the consolidated enterprise results, as seen on Slide 4. Total revenue increased 10% to $54.8 billion, driven by the Pharma segment. Gross margin also increased 10% to $1.8 billion, driven by both the Medical and Pharma segments. Consolidated SG&A was generally in line with the prior year at $1.2 billion, reflecting our disciplined cost management across the enterprise. With the significant profit growth in both segments, we delivered total operating earnings of $571 million, growth of 35%. Moving below the line. Interest and Other decreased by $15 million to $12 million, due to increased interest income from cash and equivalents. As a reminder, our debt is largely fixed rate, resulting in a net benefit from rising interest rates in the near-term. Our first quarter effective tax rate finished at 22.5%, an increase of approximately 5.5 percentage points. We saw positive discrete items in both the current and prior year periods, which were more beneficial a year ago. First quarter average diluted shares outstanding were 250 million, 8% lower than a year ago due to share repurchases. And as I mentioned earlier, the net result was first quarter EPS of $1.73, an all-time first quarter high point, reflecting growth of 44%. Let's turn to the Pharma segment on Slide 5. First quarter revenue increased 11% to $51 billion, driven by brand and specialty pharmaceutical sales growth from existing customers. We continue to see broad-based strength in pharmaceutical demand spanning across product categories brand, specialty, consumer health and generics and from our largest customers. Similar to trends last year, GLP-1 medications provided a revenue tailwind in the quarter. Segment profit increased 18% to $507 million in the first quarter, driven by a higher contribution from brand and specialty products, including distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, which provided a modest contribution as customers stocked up in preparation for the fall vaccination season. We also saw positive generics program performance with continued volume growth and consistent market dynamics. Turning to Medical on Slide 6. First quarter revenue at $3.8 billion was largely flat to prior year and prior quarter. In the first quarter, we saw lower PP&E volume and pricing, including the impact from the prior year exit of our non-health care gloves portfolio, offset by growth in at-Home Solutions and inflationary impacts, including mitigation initiatives. Medical slightly exceeded our expectations in Q1 and delivered segment profit of $71 million, which represents an approximate $80 million increase from the prior year's first quarter loss. Consistent with the expectations communicated at Investor Day and last quarter, we continue to be encouraged by the indicators of improvement in trends with respect to our Cardinal Health brand product sales. In Q1, we saw a slight year-over-year volume growth. As expected, we saw an improvement in net inflationary impacts, including our mitigation initiatives. We also continue to see normalized PP&E margins, which were impacted by unfavorable price/cost timing in the prior year. In the quarter, we also recorded a $581 million non-cash pretax goodwill impairment charge related to the Medical segment, which is excluded from our non-GAAP results. This Q1 accounting charge is due to an increase in the discount rate used in goodwill impairment analysis. Now turning to the balance sheet. As I alluded to earlier, in the first quarter, we generated robust adjusted free cash flow of $1 billion and ended the quarter with $3.9 billion of cash on hand. We remain focused on doing what we said we would and deploying capital in balanced, disciplined and shareholder-friendly manner. In the first quarter, we continued to invest against our highest priorities, including investing $92 million of CapEx back into the business to drive organic growth. We made our third annual payment on our national opioid settlement obligation. We did not draw on our credit facilities and received a positive change to the outlook on our investment-grade rating from Fitch as well as from S&P in Q2. We returned over $630 million to shareholders through payment of our quarterly dividend and the launch of a new $500 million accelerated share repurchase program, which completed in October. Now for our updated fiscal 2024 guidance, on Slide 8. Today, we are raising our fiscal 2024 EPS guidance to a range of $6.75 to $7, the midpoint of which is 19% above our fiscal 2023 EPS result. This $0.25 increase to our EPS range primarily reflects an improvement to our Pharma outlook as well as some improvement below the line. We are raising our Pharma segment profit guide to 7% to 9% growth for the year and are pleased with the momentum in the business. Our updated guidance reflects the strong first quarter performance, higher than originally assumed contributions from COVID-19 vaccine distribution, which continued into October; the ongoing strength of our business, consistent with a 4% to 6% growth trajectory for the segment on a normalized basis. Finally, as a reminder, on the Pharma quarterly cadence, we continue to assume Q3 branded inflation will not repeat at fiscal 2023 levels. In Medical, we are reiterating our outlook of $400 million of segment profit for the year. Recall, that we previously guided that Medical segment profit would be significantly back-half weighted. That assumption remains unchanged. The first half-second half cadence continues to be driven by progress on Cardinal Health brand volume growth, the cumulative impact of inflation mitigation and some business-specific seasonality. While we are encouraged that the business slightly overperformed relative to our expectation in Q1, due to execution against our plans and our cost management efforts, our expectation for Q2 segment profit is unchanged from our original guidance, which reflected some seasonality in Q2-specific expenses like health and wellness. Altogether, Q2 segment profit should be slightly higher than Q1, which benefited from overdelivery. We expect continued progress from our Medical Improvement Plan initiatives over the course of the year. Below the line, interest and other is reduced to a range of $100 million to $120 million, while we are maintaining an effective tax rate in the range of 23% to 25%. We do expect the tax favorability we saw in the first quarter to be offset in Q2. We are also lowering our shares outlook to approximately $249 million, which reflects the already completed $500 million of our baseline share repurchase. I want to reiterate that, as we shared at Investor Day, neither our fiscal 2024 guidance nor our long-term targets reflect M&A, which is difficult to predict in timing or magnitude, or additional opportunistic deployments of capital to share repurchases beyond our baseline repurchase. We will continue to evaluate both opportunistically to drive long-term value. So, an overall successful first quarter. The Cardinal team is a lot to be proud of with respect to our accomplishments. We are confident in the plans we have in place, and we are excited for our team to realize the significant value creation opportunities still in front of us. With that, I will turn it back over to Jason.\nJason Hollar: Thanks, Aaron Now for a few updates regarding our recent progress on our three key strategic priorities, beginning with priority number one and building upon the resiliency of the Pharma segment. The key enabler to the pharma business is outstanding performance over a number of quarters now, has been the team's consistent prioritization of what matters most, operational execution in the core. We're leveraging our scale, efficiency and breadth of essential products and service capabilities to deliver for our customers and their patients. Within the core, our generics program remains a critical component. Our performance is anchored by Red Oak Sourcing, which continues to do a fantastic job fulfilling its dual mandate, managing both cost and supply to help maximize service delivery for customers. I recently saw our customer-focused mindset on display when I visited our specialty pharmaceutical distribution facility in La Vergne, Tennessee, where team worked extensively to prepare for commercial distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, while maintaining their terrific service for our other specialty products. Our team successfully navigated complex cold chain requirements for the vaccines, enabling us to quickly meet demand and begin making shipments immediately following FDA approval in time for the fall immunization season. We're pleased to support our customers in this manner, which patients rely upon for care, convenience and accessibility. We're committed to supporting customers and manufacturers, and our strategic sourcing and manufacturer services team recently hosted hundreds of our supplier partners for our annual business partners' conference. It was energizing to hear the excitement around various industry opportunities, such as biosimilars and emerging areas like cell and gene. We are confident about our ability to continue to be a strategic partner for manufacturers, investing in the important drugs being developed and commercialized in this space. We've continued to see strong momentum across our specialty business, both downstream and upstream, and have reiterated our focus on this space. We are very sizable today in specialty with over $30 billion in fiscal '23 revenue, which we noted at Investor Day has grown at a 14% CAGR over the last three years. We are making progress building out our Navista network offerings, with investments in the platform that will scale over time. Our differentiated model in community oncology is focused on driving practice growth and sharing value, while maintaining practice independence. Our approach is being refined through engagement with clinicians and our customer advisory board. Overall, we are developing solutions strategically aligned supporting the clinical and operational needs of community oncologists that drive long-term practice independence and allow physicians to focus on patient care. In nuclear, the business continues its double-digit growth trajectory, with strong performance across our core categories and Theranostics. We continue to experience increasing demand for our Center for Theranostics Advancement, with more than 60 projects at various stages in our pipeline with our pharmaceutical manufacturer partners. We're progressing on our Phase II investment that we announced at Investor Day. Our innovation center and pre-commercial manufacturing center are already highly utilized. We're underway in progressing according to plan with the expansions of our central pharmacy capability and our commercial manufacturing center. With our strong foundation and continued investment, the nuclear business is well on track to deliver its long-term target of doubling profits by fiscal '26 relative to our fiscal '21 baseline. Now, turning to medical and priority number two. The medical business has now delivered back-to-back quarters of meaningfully improved profitability, and we expect more to come. As part of our medical improvement plan, we've been taking action to address the challenges in the core products and distribution business, with the number one priority being mitigating supply chain inflation. We remain on track to address the impact of inflation and global supply chain constraints by the time we exit fiscal '24, and we're pleased to note we are now over 70% to target. On the cost side, while overall still elevated, we've seen lower international freight costs reflected in our results as anticipated. We continue to execute our mitigation initiatives to offset elevated inflation are making progress with our commercial contracting efforts and are seeing benefits from our additional actions, such as our sourcing initiatives. Additionally, we've been taking action through our five-point plan to grow Cardinal Health brand volume, which has yielded improvements. We are utilizing a balanced portfolio approach and have made important line extensions within our core products to fill portfolio gaps critical to our distribution offering. We've also highlighted investments we're making in new product development and commercialization for our clinically differentiated specialty medical products, which culminated in two notable product launches during the quarter. We launched our anticipated Kangaroo OMNI Enteral Feeding Pump in the U.S., designed to help provide enteral feeding patients with more options to meet their nutritional needs throughout their enteral feeding journey, from hospital to home. We also announced the launch of our next-generation NTrainer System 2.0, a medical device designed to help premature in newborn infants develop with the oral coordination skills to make the transition to independent feeding faster and help reduce their NICU length of stay. I'm excited about what our products can do for patients and the progress we're making as we now turn to playing more offense to grow our Cardinal Health brand portfolio.  We're continuing to see the results of our actions benefiting our leading indicators, such as our customer experience metrics and portfolio health for key categories, which gives us confidence that we'll be able to better participate in the growth from an overall improving medical utilization environment moving forward. For example, we've seen further improvement in our Customer Loyalty Index score for U.S. distribution beyond the 13-point increase in the last two years that we noted at Investor Day. And we've seen a continued reduction in our product back orders, which are now at a multiyear low and consistent with pre-pandemic levels. Outside of product and distribution, we're continuing to accelerate our growth businesses. In at-Home Solutions, we continue to see strong demand as care increasingly shifts to the home. Our team's focus on operational efficiency is producing better operating leverage in this business, resulting in increased contributions to the bottom-line. To wrap-up the Medical, we're continuing to execute our simplification and cost savings initiatives across the segment, which contributed to the strong SG&A management in the quarter. Finally, priority number 3, maximizing shareholder value creation. We're maximizing shareholder value creation through our improved operational performance, robust cash flow and responsible allocation of capital. As Aaron detailed, our confidence in our cash flow generation enabled execution of our fiscal 2024 baseline share repurchases, continued evidence of our willingness to return excess capital to shareholders and our value creation through capital deployment. With our financial flexibility, we'll continue to opportunistically evaluate disciplined M&A in specialty and potential additional share repurchases. We continue to actively evaluate a range of potential partners or acquisition candidates for both the downstream and upstream elements for our specialty strategy, but have been clear that our long-term growth targets are not predicated on inorganic investment. We are making progress with our ongoing business and portfolio review focused on the Medical segment. While across the company, our team has made significant progress over the past year realigning our operations for focus and simplicity, there is still work and opportunity in front of us. We continue to work collaboratively with our Business Review Committee to evaluate additional value creation initiatives and expect to provide further updates in the coming quarters. To close, we had a great first quarter and are excited to build upon last year's momentum. This was driven by our highly engaged and talented team, and I would like to thank them for all their efforts fulfilling our critical role as health care's most trusted partner. With that, we will take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nLisa Gill: Thanks very much and congratulations on the quarter. Jason, I just wanted to understand the COVID-19 vaccines. Can you maybe just talk about the economics of that? Is that substantially better than kind of traditional drug distribution? And I know you said it only goes through October, but are there other vaccine opportunities that would be similar and incremental opportunities for Cardinal?\nJason Hollar: Yes. Thanks, Lisa. How I think about the vaccines is, again, we're not going to get into, obviously, product and customer level type of detail. But overall, it all comes down to the value that we provide. And so, when you think about COVID-19 vaccines and vaccines in general, you really have to understand what's the requirements. And so with COVID and with some vaccines, it requires more complex distribution, cold chain capacity and capabilities. And of course, there's also - the unique thing about vaccines is that you scale up and down quickly and so you're spreading a lot of that cost over a pretty short period of time. So it's - there's not a one-size-fits-all answer to your question. And we provided a little bit of color for you in Aaron's comments there, so you can get a general understanding of the benefit that we had. And to go a little bit further, I can say that about one-third of the growth for the Pharma segment this quarter was related to vaccines. So it was a component of it, but certainly not the majority of the driver of the business. The core part of the business remained very strong within the segment for the quarter, and our guidance continues that core to continue to be strong. We do expect the vaccine benefit to be a bit greater in the second quarter because, of course, there's more volume in Q2 than in Q1, just given the nature of the October most likely being the peak volume that we would expect to see for vaccine distribution. And then we'd expect that to ramp down as we get the pipeline. We've got the pipeline pretty full here as we exited October. And now the future volumes will be much more predicated on what the actual demand is, which, of course, at this point in time is hard to anticipate.\nMatt Sims: Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll now move to our next question from Eric Percher from Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nEric Percher: Thank you. A question on Medical, specifically the over-delivery this quarter or upside that you showed versus expectations. How much of that is core medical and mitigation efforts. What will carry through to the future versus not? And then were there any one-time items in Q1 we should keep an eye on? Any update on factors driving Q2 to Q4, including the incremental oil price and commodity pressure over the last few months?\nAaron Alt: Eric, good morning. It's Aaron. Look, we were really pleased to see Q1 results slightly exceeding our external or rather our expectations. The results of the team doing what they had planned to do as well as being good managers and always looking for optimization opportunities across the portfolio, and so they did what they were expected to on the first part - or first part of the year for the medical improvement plan, and there were no notable one-time items contrary to some earlier quarters that complicated the results. So we were quite pleased with the results that we gave. And we do expect that to continue. You will have noted from our guidance for the year that we do expect slight continued improvement quarter-over-quarter. We are not changing our guidance for the year on medical. I want to emphasize that we've taken a balanced approach and believe that the $400 million profit number for the year is the right target and the right guidance for that business. And the plans also haven't changed, right? It's going to start with the continued execution of the Medical Improvement Plan and inflation mitigation elements that we've been talking about. Jason highlighted that we had hit 70% plus in the quarter as well, and they're going to continue to optimize and grow the Cardinal Health brand We're continuing to focus on driving more out of at home and the other growth businesses as well as simplification and cost optimization and so overall, a great quarter and good expectations for the year to come.\nJason Hollar: Yes. The other thing I'd add, Eric, I think the component of your question was just asking about commodities, and there's any impact there. There was not anything significant. So I know we've all been on this long journey as it relates to the impacts of commodities. So let me just spend a moment on that. As I think about the commodity and just general inflation, let me answer the question that way. I'd put our work into a couple of key buckets. The international freight piece is the only component that we've seen a meaningful change. And of course, that started about a year ago, and it was a dramatic reduction. So that reduction is as expected and given the elongated supply chain we had at that time, it took some time for that to work through and hit our P&L, but we're now seeing the more significant benefits of that over the last couple of quarters. So that is certainly a key component of it. What I would say about all the other commodities or all the other inflation, specifically the commodity impacts, whether it's the oil-based products polypropylene, polyethylene or unwovens and other types of inputs, which are varied. I would say that they are generally remain elevated a little bit volatile here and there, but generally elevated and not real different than what we had anticipated. So certainly noise, but how I think about it going forward and what my anticipation is we're just not seeing the volatility that we did back 18 months ago. So there is volatility, no doubt. There will always be volatility, but it's to a much lesser degree and much more balanced and kind of in a normal environment right now. And that's why you don't hear us talking about it is because it's just not meaningful in the context of everything else that we have going on.\nOperator: Next question from Kevin Caliendo, UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nKevin Caliendo: Hi. Thanks. I guess, what we're trying to figure out is in the change in the pharma guidance, how much of it was incrementally coming from the vaccine incremental versus what you had originally expected if you don't want to give us that number specifically, maybe explain there was a 5 basis point improvement in the pharma margin year-over-year. How much of that was coming from vaccines? Or maybe you can just break out where the benefits came from. I assume GLP-1s were negative on the margin. So something had to be better on a year-over-year basis. I'd love to explore that?\nAaron Alt: We're happy to provide a little more context. Look, it was a strong start to the year, and we remain very encouraged about the runway for the pharma business. And we did raise the guidance to 7% to 9%. It's really a result of three factors. First was just the strong Q1. And as Jason alluded to, we did have a contribution from the COVID vaccine distribution. And it was higher - that contribution was higher than what we had assumed in our original plans, just based on the timing of when the approvals came through. And frankly, our team's ability to jump on it and execute the way they did. Third element, though, was just the ongoing strength of the business under - other than the COVID vaccines, which is really consistent from an outlook perspective with the 4% to 6% guidance that we gave previously on a normalized basis. And just to remind you on that, what we had guided previously is that we expected low single-digit growth - profit growth from the core pharma business. We're expecting stability from the generics business, consistent market dynamics you often hear us say. We are expecting double-digit growth in the Specialty and Nuclear business, and Jason highlighted that progress in his comments earlier. And importantly, we are expecting brand inflation more in line with fiscal 2022, not the modest benefit that we saw in fiscal 2023, right? So look, we are early in the year. As we have done, we'll continue to update as we push ahead, but we're pleased with the results so far and the raise to the guidance.\nOperator: The next question comes from Erin Wright from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nErin Wright: Hi. Thanks. Another question on the pharma business. You mentioned the consistent generics environment, but can you elaborate on that a little bit? I guess, can you speak to the generic drug pricing environment? Are you seeing any easing deflationary dynamics across generics? And how material is that for you in terms of your guidance raise across that segment? And does consistent mean essentially a continuation of those favorable pricing trends going forward I guess, throughout the rest of the year?\nJason Hollar: Yes. Thanks, Erin. It's very consistent to the prior messages. So we're not seeing any change in the underlying market. And so my comments are going to be very similar to what it's been in the past. So let me just start with just underlying utilization continues to be strong. We've seen - in our commentary this morning, we made a number of comments around just the broad-based utilization being strong in the pharma industry. So we generally benefited from that. So volume is absolutely a key component of that. The consistent market dynamics that Aaron just referenced again is an indication that the buy and sell side continues to be very balanced. So overall, as in the past, I'm not going to break apart all the different pieces. We think it's best to look at them on a net basis. And within that, what I will say, though, is we continue to have very strong performance with our Red Oak Sourcing joint venture. So we continue to have that team, very focused on the dual mandate of, of course, driving down the best cost. But also as important and their mandate is to ensure that service levels are optimized as much as possible as well. So we feel very good about their progress, both in controlling costs, but also in driving great service for our customers. So again, those should be very similar words what we've said in the past. So that's why we used the phrase consistent market dynamics because we're not seeing any significant change in the underlying dynamics of this part of our business.\nMatt Sims: Next question, please.\nOperator: George Hill of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nGeorge Hill: Good morning guys. And thanks for taking the question. I think like a lot of the other people on the line here, I'm really intrigued by what seems to be going on in the generic drug business. You guys called out Red Oak, GLP-1s were really strong in the quarter, but they have to be significantly margin dilutive. I guess, Jason, I'd love if you could talk about like if anything is changing on the contracting side? Are you seeing like increased rebates for purchasing compliance or supply compliance? Just kind of interesting, any more color that you can provide on what's going on in the generic drug space as it relates to profitability would be super helpful.\nJason Hollar: Yes, so it's a fair question, George. And there's always going to be an evolution customer to customer, contract to contract. The balance of brand versus generic and then within brand and within generic, the mix always is ever evolving. And so over time, I would expect there to be more and more separation between some of these elements as the weighting of the products change. So it's - even though this volume has been dramatic for the GLP-1s, it's also been over a pretty short period of time and probably still early in this journey. So you used the phrase, and I think it was used earlier is significantly margin dilutive. I'm not sure - I'm sure we've never said words like that because it's very rare you hear us talking about margin rates, which you hear us talking about is margin dollars, and I even joked about this at Investor Day. I'm not sure I've ever said the words out loud in my career about the margin rate not being the most important or a significant metric for us. And it's because of products like the GLP-1s, products that are incredibly important to that underlying patient, which means it's important to our customers, which means it's important to us. It is not the most profitable class of progress today, but it's important for our patients and important for the industry what we value more than anything else is innovation in the distribution channel in the industry. Innovation brings good things for us. Maybe not in the short-term and maybe not for every single product, but innovation ultimately brings opportunities, whether it's services or whether it's - when these products become other opportunities to contract or other opportunities over time for them to go generic, there's just lots of different ways in which you can create economic value on a particular transaction, particular product. And so GLP-1s, today, you don\u2019t hear us talk about from revenue, it's not a meaningful contributor to our earnings. And so we're not going to talk about it from an earnings perspective. Contracting back to your original question, we'll continue to evolve underneath that dynamic. But ultimately, we are well-protected customer by customer in certain corridors to ensure that we don't flip upside down on a particular customer. And so that needs to evolve over time as those concentrations evolve over time. But our model has proven very, very resilient over the years and decades because this is the latest mix challenge that there is or mix change, I should say. But it's not the first time that there's been a mix change in our industry. And so our model has proven to be resilient in that regard. So it's unique and different products, but it's not unique in terms of impacts and influences that a particular product category has on the pharma distribution industry.\nOperator: The next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson of Evercore. Please go ahead.\nElizabeth Anderson: Hi, guys. Thanks for the questions or the comments about the pacing of the year. One thing that was just kind of - I heard what you said about calling out the inflation and how that doesn't quite flow through the same way as it did last year. Can you speak to how you're thinking about the first half of the year versus the second half of the year? Because I would say you had a\u2026\nOperator: Sorry, if I think we lost the previous caller, and we'll move on to the next question from Daniel Grosslight from Citi. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Grosslight: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe we'll go back to the COVID vaccine for a second here. You mentioned that you're seeing talking of vaccine ahead of the season, the winter season. Are you also taking more share in vaccine distribution and perhaps your overall market share would suggest. And then as we think about therapeutics moving into the commercial channel in a couple of months here, how is that factored into your guidance? And then lastly, you've been operating well above your longer-term pharma EBIT guidance of 4% to 6% for a few quarters here. I'm curious if there's been any change to how you're thinking longer term about the business and some of the secular tailwinds that might be driving growth higher than your longer-term 4% to 6% guidance.\nJason Hollar: You're getting all the value out of your one question. So let me see if I can touch on each one. I think there's some connectivity between these. So overall, for vaccines, I think the best way to think about vaccine distribution is more about it from the customer standpoint. So I think what you'll see is that COVID-19 vaccines like other vaccines typically will follow the distribution network. So the real question is, are our customers getting more than their fair share, and I don't necessarily want to talk about them from that perspective other than to say we are very happy with the customers we have. We've often used a phrase for other situations winning with the winners, and we feel very well aligned with great customers. And so - but I think that's how you should think about it. And that it most likely the vast majority of the volume will follow the distribution network. I think your second element of that question was on the COVID therapeutics. How I think about that is a little bit differently than vaccines in terms of just the rollout, where the vaccines were a bit of an obsolete old product, new product type of situation where all that government stockpile. When we were asked about vaccines nearly a year ago, when it was first communicated to be commercialized, that was part of our response as well. We didn't know the FDA approval date. We also didn't know what was going to happen with the in-stock inventory, which seems to not have been a relevant usage at this stage given the variance evolution. As it relates to therapeutics, you don't have that same challenge, right? There's a lot of product out there still and the rollout will be slower. And you're talking about an oral solid type of brand product, which typically does not carry very - the same type of specialization necessary in the distribution channel that does drive higher-margin products like our specialty products. And then the last question is on the long-term growth outlook. I think one of the key messages that is behind your question and behind how we think about it. And partly why we're calling out those elements that may be a little unusual. Again, just like with GLP-1s COVID vaccines, and other form of innovation. We like innovation. It provides us new opportunities and new growth as an enterprise. And so part of the answer to this question is, well, how do these innovative products evolve and transition over time? Is that a continued opportunity. Is it lumpy? Is this year may be higher or lower than what that volume will be in the future? That - those are all hard questions to answer. But what we saw here is a bit of an influx of innovation that we've been able to benefit from while using the same infrastructure. So one thing that's really important to highlight about our performance this quarter, so we had really nice gross margin growth and we had very flat SG&A. I made the comment about the operating leverage in my comments. That's what I'm getting at is that we were able to execute very efficiently this quarter and whether we're talking about vaccines or other products, having that gross margin because it's an incremental product category for us because, of course, we do not participate in that volume last year but we're able to leverage the same capacity, the same team, that's an efficient use of our distribution channel. And as we get more opportunities like that, then there's some opportunity. But one of the key things that Aaron highlighted in a number of his comments, whether it's his comments, whether it's his comments or his answers to the question, is that our underlying growth and we feel very good about that long-term target. And a lot of what we've seen here was the Q1 overperformance both from vaccines, but also just the core utilization being very strong. That's not the same level of strength that we have indicated, we should be thinking about long-term. It's an opportunity for us, but that's not what we're expecting at this point in time. And it's not what we're guiding for the balance of the year in terms of the core growth. We expect that core growth to still be in that 4% to 6% range. But again, innovation can create some opportunities for us. That's hard to see right now, but we're not planning for that.\nAaron Alt: So maybe if I can just wrap a bow around that from a guidance perspective, just to reiterate what our guidance is look for the - as we sit here today, the Medical segment guidance is $400 million of profit for this year, and we've talked about that extensively, leading to $650 million of profit in fiscal year 2026. While we are pleased with the progress on Pharma, one quarter into the year and are raising our guidance for this year for Pharma, the 7% to 9% profit growth. Our longer-term algorithm remains the 4% to 6% profit growth that we had called out at our Investor Day, leading to 12% to 14% adjusted EPS growth long-term as our overall guidance. We're not seeing changes to our long-term guidance as we sit here today. Now some may ask, and I've seen in some of the headlines well, you beat by a particular amount, but your raise is a little bit less than what that amount is. And the short answer to maybe get ahead of the question is that we had above-the-line benefits for which we and below-the-line benefits relative to consensus or expectations. And the real difference between our raise and how you might do that math is just we're not carrying forward the tax benefit that we saw in Q1 into the updated guidance for reasons I called out during my prepared remarks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Charles Rhyee from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nCharles Rhyee: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Jason, I wanted to follow-up on your comments on commodity prices. And you said that you're seeing less volatility in pricing than before. Would you say that when you look at sort of the increase in oil over the past six months or so, is that - would you say that's within the - your expectations of volatility? And - or would you might expect to see that get reflected into freight and/or some of your other input costs at some point? Thanks.\nJason Hollar: Yes. No, that's a great question. And it's - so when I step back and think about 18 months ago, what the root issue was, of course, we had international freight that was driving up the cost of everything in a multiple that was crazy, but you also had these other commodities that were - okay, so there are some commodities that are oil-based, so the oil input costs, but then you had the supply-demand factors going on too that I think overemphasized that issue because we don't buy oil, we buy products that contain oil. And so as oil goes up and down, that's often absorbed within the supply chain in a normal steady state, unless it gets outside of a certain band. So it did get outside that band, right? Oil went above $100 per barrel. And then you had other demand factors that were driving those commodity costs well beyond what the input cost impacts were. So you had a bit of an exponential increase in a number of commodities. So today, given that we're in a much more muted demand environment, as a broad industry because this is way outside of healthcare, right? This is a general economy not being as hot as it was at that point in time. When you see these types of input costs going up and down, it goes back to a bit more of a normal model, which is they're not being exaggerated and multiplied, they're just flowing through in a much more normalized steady state. So that's the reason why that I would not expect this under this current environment to get outside of normal bounds. So if you see the input costs going up and you see a heated economic environment that can further compound that impact, that's when we need to start worrying more about this. I know the importance of this will certainly be - day-to-day, we certainly spend a lot of time on this, but we'll continue to provide any insight that we see going forward. Of course, when we get into the very significant changes, that's the changes to our contracting structure that we've put into place. That's never going to be perfect. It's never going to be a one-for-one offset, but it's meant to really be active and impactful when you have those more extraordinary types of impacts that really kind of compound these items like I just referenced, and not just the normal types of more muted movements.\nCharles Rhyee: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Allen Lutz from Bank of America. Please go ahead. \nAllen Lutz: Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. I want to go after the Pharma margin dynamic a little bit differently. So they were up 5 bps year-over-year. It sounds like the vaccine benefit is going to peak in your fiscal 2Q. So is the right way to think about the margin growth in the Pharma segment year-over-year is it could peak or the growth could peak in 2Q and then kind of more of a normalized lower margin trajectory in the back half? Just trying to get a sense of the seasonality there? Thanks.\nJason Hollar: We really haven't provided quarterly guidance at the margin level for the pharma business. We were - we leaned in a bit in describing the impact to Q1 from the COVID vaccine distribution as well as Jason's comments around the expectations for Q2. Beyond that, I think you just need to take into account what we typically say about our business, which is, first, that we expect the consistent market dynamics from a generic perspective, right? And we are not assuming some of the benefits from a brand perspective in Q3 that we have previously seen. And that's how we are offering up today.\nOperator: We will now take our final question today from Elizabeth Anderson, Evercore. Please go ahead.\nElizabeth Anderson: Hi, guys. Apologies about the audio issues before. My question was just on the non-operating items, it seems like both on interest expense and maybe on the share count, based on the ASR that you talked about and the interest expense in the first quarter, that there's a little bit of conservatism in that number in those - both of those numbers\nOperator: And it seems we have lost\u2026\nAaron Alt: I'll answer the question. I think she was seeking to ask. The question from what I heard was interest and other, are we being conservative as well on what's going on with our share count? And I guess I would offer the following. We were pleased to see continued benefit in the quarter from I&O, driven by the fact that we have such high cash balances and the return we're receiving on those cash balances. We are, of course, also benefiting in the quarter from the fact that we are largely fixed rates. We have been now for several quarters. And so we haven't been exposed to the interest rate increases that some other companies may be dealing with, and that's just driven by the good stewardship previously. We do have a maturity coming at the end of fiscal 2024. It's about $750 million or so from recollection. And we've commented that we're likely to refinance that. I haven't commented on the timing of that as we care forward. And so we believe the guide - the updated guide we provided on I&O reflects the benefits and the various trade-offs in that. With respect to the share count, I do think it's important to call out that as we have consistently said, we don't guide for share count changes beyond the baseline share repurchase. We made a commitment at this during our Investor Day in June that our baseline share repurchase was going to be $500 million during fiscal year 2024. We completed that in the first quarter. That is the share repurchase we're talking about today, and our guide reflects the impact of that - of the completion of that share repurchase program. It does not reflect any other changes to share repurchase over the course of the year. As Jason called out earlier, we have the benefit of our cash balance. And having invested, having the plans that we do to invest in the business, CapEx-wise, $92 million in the first quarter, targeting $500 million for the year, and continue to make progress on our investment grade rating and the two outlook changes - positive outlook changes that we received during the quarter, having made our baseline share repurchase during Q1 as well as continuing to pay our dividend. As we are, as a dividend aristocrat and now we have the opportunity and support of the plans to take the resources we have available to us to invest back in the business with that specialty focus that Jason has called out several times to look at M&A in a disciplined manner, as Jason called out, and then to also consider further opportunistic share repurchase in due time as we assess how the year is performing. I think that's where Elizabeth was going.\nOperator: Thank you. With this, we conclude today's question-and-answer session. And now I'd like to hand the call back over to Jason Hollar for any additional or closing remarks. Over to you, sir.\nJason Hollar: Yes. Thanks again, everyone, for joining us this morning. As we've said a few times, it was a great start to the year. We're pleased with our broad-based performance and to be in the position that we are today to raise our guidance after just the first quarter. We look forward to, certainly, continuing to update you on our progress against these plans throughout the year. And with that, thank you, and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. Ladies and gentlemen, you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Aaron Alt",
            "content": "Thanks, Jason, and good morning. Q1 delivered a strong financial start to the year, with EPS of $1.73, surpassing our expectations in Pharma and Medical. The strength of our pharma business, the progress on our medical turnaround efforts and our disciplined approach to capital allocation contributed to new first quarter highs for the enterprise on both revenue and EPS. We also delivered strong cash flow and ended the quarter with $3.9 billion of cash. Let's start with the consolidated enterprise results, as seen on Slide 4. Total revenue increased 10% to $54.8 billion, driven by the Pharma segment. Gross margin also increased 10% to $1.8 billion, driven by both the Medical and Pharma segments. Consolidated SG&A was generally in line with the prior year at $1.2 billion, reflecting our disciplined cost management across the enterprise. With the significant profit growth in both segments, we delivered total operating earnings of $571 million, growth of 35%. Moving below the line. Interest and Other decreased by $15 million to $12 million, due to increased interest income from cash and equivalents. As a reminder, our debt is largely fixed rate, resulting in a net benefit from rising interest rates in the near-term. Our first quarter effective tax rate finished at 22.5%, an increase of approximately 5.5 percentage points. We saw positive discrete items in both the current and prior year periods, which were more beneficial a year ago. First quarter average diluted shares outstanding were 250 million, 8% lower than a year ago due to share repurchases. And as I mentioned earlier, the net result was first quarter EPS of $1.73, an all-time first quarter high point, reflecting growth of 44%. Let's turn to the Pharma segment on Slide 5. First quarter revenue increased 11% to $51 billion, driven by brand and specialty pharmaceutical sales growth from existing customers. We continue to see broad-based strength in pharmaceutical demand spanning across product categories brand, specialty, consumer health and generics and from our largest customers. Similar to trends last year, GLP-1 medications provided a revenue tailwind in the quarter. Segment profit increased 18% to $507 million in the first quarter, driven by a higher contribution from brand and specialty products, including distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, which provided a modest contribution as customers stocked up in preparation for the fall vaccination season. We also saw positive generics program performance with continued volume growth and consistent market dynamics. Turning to Medical on Slide 6. First quarter revenue at $3.8 billion was largely flat to prior year and prior quarter. In the first quarter, we saw lower PP&E volume and pricing, including the impact from the prior year exit of our non-health care gloves portfolio, offset by growth in at-Home Solutions and inflationary impacts, including mitigation initiatives. Medical slightly exceeded our expectations in Q1 and delivered segment profit of $71 million, which represents an approximate $80 million increase from the prior year's first quarter loss. Consistent with the expectations communicated at Investor Day and last quarter, we continue to be encouraged by the indicators of improvement in trends with respect to our Cardinal Health brand product sales. In Q1, we saw a slight year-over-year volume growth. As expected, we saw an improvement in net inflationary impacts, including our mitigation initiatives. We also continue to see normalized PP&E margins, which were impacted by unfavorable price/cost timing in the prior year. In the quarter, we also recorded a $581 million non-cash pretax goodwill impairment charge related to the Medical segment, which is excluded from our non-GAAP results. This Q1 accounting charge is due to an increase in the discount rate used in goodwill impairment analysis. Now turning to the balance sheet. As I alluded to earlier, in the first quarter, we generated robust adjusted free cash flow of $1 billion and ended the quarter with $3.9 billion of cash on hand. We remain focused on doing what we said we would and deploying capital in balanced, disciplined and shareholder-friendly manner. In the first quarter, we continued to invest against our highest priorities, including investing $92 million of CapEx back into the business to drive organic growth. We made our third annual payment on our national opioid settlement obligation. We did not draw on our credit facilities and received a positive change to the outlook on our investment-grade rating from Fitch as well as from S&P in Q2. We returned over $630 million to shareholders through payment of our quarterly dividend and the launch of a new $500 million accelerated share repurchase program, which completed in October. Now for our updated fiscal 2024 guidance, on Slide 8. Today, we are raising our fiscal 2024 EPS guidance to a range of $6.75 to $7, the midpoint of which is 19% above our fiscal 2023 EPS result. This $0.25 increase to our EPS range primarily reflects an improvement to our Pharma outlook as well as some improvement below the line. We are raising our Pharma segment profit guide to 7% to 9% growth for the year and are pleased with the momentum in the business. Our updated guidance reflects the strong first quarter performance, higher than originally assumed contributions from COVID-19 vaccine distribution, which continued into October; the ongoing strength of our business, consistent with a 4% to 6% growth trajectory for the segment on a normalized basis. Finally, as a reminder, on the Pharma quarterly cadence, we continue to assume Q3 branded inflation will not repeat at fiscal 2023 levels. In Medical, we are reiterating our outlook of $400 million of segment profit for the year. Recall, that we previously guided that Medical segment profit would be significantly back-half weighted. That assumption remains unchanged. The first half-second half cadence continues to be driven by progress on Cardinal Health brand volume growth, the cumulative impact of inflation mitigation and some business-specific seasonality. While we are encouraged that the business slightly overperformed relative to our expectation in Q1, due to execution against our plans and our cost management efforts, our expectation for Q2 segment profit is unchanged from our original guidance, which reflected some seasonality in Q2-specific expenses like health and wellness. Altogether, Q2 segment profit should be slightly higher than Q1, which benefited from overdelivery. We expect continued progress from our Medical Improvement Plan initiatives over the course of the year. Below the line, interest and other is reduced to a range of $100 million to $120 million, while we are maintaining an effective tax rate in the range of 23% to 25%. We do expect the tax favorability we saw in the first quarter to be offset in Q2. We are also lowering our shares outlook to approximately $249 million, which reflects the already completed $500 million of our baseline share repurchase. I want to reiterate that, as we shared at Investor Day, neither our fiscal 2024 guidance nor our long-term targets reflect M&A, which is difficult to predict in timing or magnitude, or additional opportunistic deployments of capital to share repurchases beyond our baseline repurchase. We will continue to evaluate both opportunistically to drive long-term value. So, an overall successful first quarter. The Cardinal team is a lot to be proud of with respect to our accomplishments. We are confident in the plans we have in place, and we are excited for our team to realize the significant value creation opportunities still in front of us. With that, I will turn it back over to Jason. Eric, good morning. It's Aaron. Look, we were really pleased to see Q1 results slightly exceeding our external or rather our expectations. The results of the team doing what they had planned to do as well as being good managers and always looking for optimization opportunities across the portfolio, and so they did what they were expected to on the first part - or first part of the year for the medical improvement plan, and there were no notable one-time items contrary to some earlier quarters that complicated the results. So we were quite pleased with the results that we gave. And we do expect that to continue. You will have noted from our guidance for the year that we do expect slight continued improvement quarter-over-quarter. We are not changing our guidance for the year on medical. I want to emphasize that we've taken a balanced approach and believe that the $400 million profit number for the year is the right target and the right guidance for that business. And the plans also haven't changed, right? It's going to start with the continued execution of the Medical Improvement Plan and inflation mitigation elements that we've been talking about. Jason highlighted that we had hit 70% plus in the quarter as well, and they're going to continue to optimize and grow the Cardinal Health brand We're continuing to focus on driving more out of at home and the other growth businesses as well as simplification and cost optimization and so overall, a great quarter and good expectations for the year to come. We're happy to provide a little more context. Look, it was a strong start to the year, and we remain very encouraged about the runway for the pharma business. And we did raise the guidance to 7% to 9%. It's really a result of three factors. First was just the strong Q1. And as Jason alluded to, we did have a contribution from the COVID vaccine distribution. And it was higher - that contribution was higher than what we had assumed in our original plans, just based on the timing of when the approvals came through. And frankly, our team's ability to jump on it and execute the way they did. Third element, though, was just the ongoing strength of the business under - other than the COVID vaccines, which is really consistent from an outlook perspective with the 4% to 6% guidance that we gave previously on a normalized basis. And just to remind you on that, what we had guided previously is that we expected low single-digit growth - profit growth from the core pharma business. We're expecting stability from the generics business, consistent market dynamics you often hear us say. We are expecting double-digit growth in the Specialty and Nuclear business, and Jason highlighted that progress in his comments earlier. And importantly, we are expecting brand inflation more in line with fiscal 2022, not the modest benefit that we saw in fiscal 2023, right? So look, we are early in the year. As we have done, we'll continue to update as we push ahead, but we're pleased with the results so far and the raise to the guidance. So maybe if I can just wrap a bow around that from a guidance perspective, just to reiterate what our guidance is look for the - as we sit here today, the Medical segment guidance is $400 million of profit for this year, and we've talked about that extensively, leading to $650 million of profit in fiscal year 2026. While we are pleased with the progress on Pharma, one quarter into the year and are raising our guidance for this year for Pharma, the 7% to 9% profit growth. Our longer-term algorithm remains the 4% to 6% profit growth that we had called out at our Investor Day, leading to 12% to 14% adjusted EPS growth long-term as our overall guidance. We're not seeing changes to our long-term guidance as we sit here today. Now some may ask, and I've seen in some of the headlines well, you beat by a particular amount, but your raise is a little bit less than what that amount is. And the short answer to maybe get ahead of the question is that we had above-the-line benefits for which we and below-the-line benefits relative to consensus or expectations. And the real difference between our raise and how you might do that math is just we're not carrying forward the tax benefit that we saw in Q1 into the updated guidance for reasons I called out during my prepared remarks. I'll answer the question. I think she was seeking to ask. The question from what I heard was interest and other, are we being conservative as well on what's going on with our share count? And I guess I would offer the following. We were pleased to see continued benefit in the quarter from I&O, driven by the fact that we have such high cash balances and the return we're receiving on those cash balances. We are, of course, also benefiting in the quarter from the fact that we are largely fixed rates. We have been now for several quarters. And so we haven't been exposed to the interest rate increases that some other companies may be dealing with, and that's just driven by the good stewardship previously. We do have a maturity coming at the end of fiscal 2024. It's about $750 million or so from recollection. And we've commented that we're likely to refinance that. I haven't commented on the timing of that as we care forward. And so we believe the guide - the updated guide we provided on I&O reflects the benefits and the various trade-offs in that. With respect to the share count, I do think it's important to call out that as we have consistently said, we don't guide for share count changes beyond the baseline share repurchase. We made a commitment at this during our Investor Day in June that our baseline share repurchase was going to be $500 million during fiscal year 2024. We completed that in the first quarter. That is the share repurchase we're talking about today, and our guide reflects the impact of that - of the completion of that share repurchase program. It does not reflect any other changes to share repurchase over the course of the year. As Jason called out earlier, we have the benefit of our cash balance. And having invested, having the plans that we do to invest in the business, CapEx-wise, $92 million in the first quarter, targeting $500 million for the year, and continue to make progress on our investment grade rating and the two outlook changes - positive outlook changes that we received during the quarter, having made our baseline share repurchase during Q1 as well as continuing to pay our dividend. As we are, as a dividend aristocrat and now we have the opportunity and support of the plans to take the resources we have available to us to invest back in the business with that specialty focus that Jason has called out several times to look at M&A in a disciplined manner, as Jason called out, and then to also consider further opportunistic share repurchase in due time as we assess how the year is performing. I think that's where Elizabeth was going."

            "name": "Jason Hollar",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Overall, it was a great start to our fiscal year, with strong first quarter results and an improved outlook for the year, we are continuing our operating momentum into fiscal 2024. In the first quarter, we delivered significant profit growth in both segments. In Pharma, the results were driven by the strength across our business, including continued positive performance from our generics program. We also benefited from our role distributing the recently commercialized COVID-19 vaccines, which I'll elaborate on later in my remarks. Macro trends in the core distribution business remains stable, and we continue to see strong pharmaceutical demand, including the GLP-1 medications. And both our higher-growth specialty nuclear businesses tracked ahead of plan in the quarter. In Medical, the first quarter was another proof point of the inflection we began to see last Q2 in this business. Recall, the segment was unprofitable only a year ago. Overall, results tracked slightly ahead of our expectations, and we continue to execute our Medical Improvement Plan initiatives to drive better and more predictable financial performance. In particular, we made notable progress on inflation mitigation in the quarter. At an enterprise level, we realized notable operating leverage from our efforts to manage costs across the segments. And below the operating line, our favorable capital structure and responsible capital deployment provided tailwinds, enabled by our strong cash flow generation. In short, the broad-based performance to-date gives us confidence to raise fiscal 2024 EPS guidance only a quarter into the year. Our team continues to prioritize focused execution to best serve our customers and create value for shareholders. I'll update you on our progress in advancing our three key strategic imperatives shortly, but first, let me turn it over to Aaron to review our results and updated guidance in more detail. Thanks, Aaron Now for a few updates regarding our recent progress on our three key strategic priorities, beginning with priority number one and building upon the resiliency of the Pharma segment. The key enabler to the pharma business is outstanding performance over a number of quarters now, has been the team's consistent prioritization of what matters most, operational execution in the core. We're leveraging our scale, efficiency and breadth of essential products and service capabilities to deliver for our customers and their patients. Within the core, our generics program remains a critical component. Our performance is anchored by Red Oak Sourcing, which continues to do a fantastic job fulfilling its dual mandate, managing both cost and supply to help maximize service delivery for customers. I recently saw our customer-focused mindset on display when I visited our specialty pharmaceutical distribution facility in La Vergne, Tennessee, where team worked extensively to prepare for commercial distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, while maintaining their terrific service for our other specialty products. Our team successfully navigated complex cold chain requirements for the vaccines, enabling us to quickly meet demand and begin making shipments immediately following FDA approval in time for the fall immunization season. We're pleased to support our customers in this manner, which patients rely upon for care, convenience and accessibility. We're committed to supporting customers and manufacturers, and our strategic sourcing and manufacturer services team recently hosted hundreds of our supplier partners for our annual business partners' conference. It was energizing to hear the excitement around various industry opportunities, such as biosimilars and emerging areas like cell and gene. We are confident about our ability to continue to be a strategic partner for manufacturers, investing in the important drugs being developed and commercialized in this space. We've continued to see strong momentum across our specialty business, both downstream and upstream, and have reiterated our focus on this space. We are very sizable today in specialty with over $30 billion in fiscal '23 revenue, which we noted at Investor Day has grown at a 14% CAGR over the last three years. We are making progress building out our Navista network offerings, with investments in the platform that will scale over time. Our differentiated model in community oncology is focused on driving practice growth and sharing value, while maintaining practice independence. Our approach is being refined through engagement with clinicians and our customer advisory board. Overall, we are developing solutions strategically aligned supporting the clinical and operational needs of community oncologists that drive long-term practice independence and allow physicians to focus on patient care. In nuclear, the business continues its double-digit growth trajectory, with strong performance across our core categories and Theranostics. We continue to experience increasing demand for our Center for Theranostics Advancement, with more than 60 projects at various stages in our pipeline with our pharmaceutical manufacturer partners. We're progressing on our Phase II investment that we announced at Investor Day. Our innovation center and pre-commercial manufacturing center are already highly utilized. We're underway in progressing according to plan with the expansions of our central pharmacy capability and our commercial manufacturing center. With our strong foundation and continued investment, the nuclear business is well on track to deliver its long-term target of doubling profits by fiscal '26 relative to our fiscal '21 baseline. Now, turning to medical and priority number two. The medical business has now delivered back-to-back quarters of meaningfully improved profitability, and we expect more to come. As part of our medical improvement plan, we've been taking action to address the challenges in the core products and distribution business, with the number one priority being mitigating supply chain inflation. We remain on track to address the impact of inflation and global supply chain constraints by the time we exit fiscal '24, and we're pleased to note we are now over 70% to target. On the cost side, while overall still elevated, we've seen lower international freight costs reflected in our results as anticipated. We continue to execute our mitigation initiatives to offset elevated inflation are making progress with our commercial contracting efforts and are seeing benefits from our additional actions, such as our sourcing initiatives. Additionally, we've been taking action through our five-point plan to grow Cardinal Health brand volume, which has yielded improvements. We are utilizing a balanced portfolio approach and have made important line extensions within our core products to fill portfolio gaps critical to our distribution offering. We've also highlighted investments we're making in new product development and commercialization for our clinically differentiated specialty medical products, which culminated in two notable product launches during the quarter. We launched our anticipated Kangaroo OMNI Enteral Feeding Pump in the U.S., designed to help provide enteral feeding patients with more options to meet their nutritional needs throughout their enteral feeding journey, from hospital to home. We also announced the launch of our next-generation NTrainer System 2.0, a medical device designed to help premature in newborn infants develop with the oral coordination skills to make the transition to independent feeding faster and help reduce their NICU length of stay. I'm excited about what our products can do for patients and the progress we're making as we now turn to playing more offense to grow our Cardinal Health brand portfolio.  We're continuing to see the results of our actions benefiting our leading indicators, such as our customer experience metrics and portfolio health for key categories, which gives us confidence that we'll be able to better participate in the growth from an overall improving medical utilization environment moving forward. For example, we've seen further improvement in our Customer Loyalty Index score for U.S. distribution beyond the 13-point increase in the last two years that we noted at Investor Day. And we've seen a continued reduction in our product back orders, which are now at a multiyear low and consistent with pre-pandemic levels. Outside of product and distribution, we're continuing to accelerate our growth businesses. In at-Home Solutions, we continue to see strong demand as care increasingly shifts to the home. Our team's focus on operational efficiency is producing better operating leverage in this business, resulting in increased contributions to the bottom-line. To wrap-up the Medical, we're continuing to execute our simplification and cost savings initiatives across the segment, which contributed to the strong SG&A management in the quarter. Finally, priority number 3, maximizing shareholder value creation. We're maximizing shareholder value creation through our improved operational performance, robust cash flow and responsible allocation of capital. As Aaron detailed, our confidence in our cash flow generation enabled execution of our fiscal 2024 baseline share repurchases, continued evidence of our willingness to return excess capital to shareholders and our value creation through capital deployment. With our financial flexibility, we'll continue to opportunistically evaluate disciplined M&A in specialty and potential additional share repurchases. We continue to actively evaluate a range of potential partners or acquisition candidates for both the downstream and upstream elements for our specialty strategy, but have been clear that our long-term growth targets are not predicated on inorganic investment. We are making progress with our ongoing business and portfolio review focused on the Medical segment. While across the company, our team has made significant progress over the past year realigning our operations for focus and simplicity, there is still work and opportunity in front of us. We continue to work collaboratively with our Business Review Committee to evaluate additional value creation initiatives and expect to provide further updates in the coming quarters. To close, we had a great first quarter and are excited to build upon last year's momentum. This was driven by our highly engaged and talented team, and I would like to thank them for all their efforts fulfilling our critical role as health care's most trusted partner. With that, we will take your questions. Yes. Thanks, Lisa. How I think about the vaccines is, again, we're not going to get into, obviously, product and customer level type of detail. But overall, it all comes down to the value that we provide. And so, when you think about COVID-19 vaccines and vaccines in general, you really have to understand what's the requirements. And so with COVID and with some vaccines, it requires more complex distribution, cold chain capacity and capabilities. And of course, there's also - the unique thing about vaccines is that you scale up and down quickly and so you're spreading a lot of that cost over a pretty short period of time. So it's - there's not a one-size-fits-all answer to your question. And we provided a little bit of color for you in Aaron's comments there, so you can get a general understanding of the benefit that we had. And to go a little bit further, I can say that about one-third of the growth for the Pharma segment this quarter was related to vaccines. So it was a component of it, but certainly not the majority of the driver of the business. The core part of the business remained very strong within the segment for the quarter, and our guidance continues that core to continue to be strong. We do expect the vaccine benefit to be a bit greater in the second quarter because, of course, there's more volume in Q2 than in Q1, just given the nature of the October most likely being the peak volume that we would expect to see for vaccine distribution. And then we'd expect that to ramp down as we get the pipeline. We've got the pipeline pretty full here as we exited October. And now the future volumes will be much more predicated on what the actual demand is, which, of course, at this point in time is hard to anticipate. Yes. The other thing I'd add, Eric, I think the component of your question was just asking about commodities, and there's any impact there. There was not anything significant. So I know we've all been on this long journey as it relates to the impacts of commodities. So let me just spend a moment on that. As I think about the commodity and just general inflation, let me answer the question that way. I'd put our work into a couple of key buckets. The international freight piece is the only component that we've seen a meaningful change. And of course, that started about a year ago, and it was a dramatic reduction. So that reduction is as expected and given the elongated supply chain we had at that time, it took some time for that to work through and hit our P&L, but we're now seeing the more significant benefits of that over the last couple of quarters. So that is certainly a key component of it. What I would say about all the other commodities or all the other inflation, specifically the commodity impacts, whether it's the oil-based products polypropylene, polyethylene or unwovens and other types of inputs, which are varied. I would say that they are generally remain elevated a little bit volatile here and there, but generally elevated and not real different than what we had anticipated. So certainly noise, but how I think about it going forward and what my anticipation is we're just not seeing the volatility that we did back 18 months ago. So there is volatility, no doubt. There will always be volatility, but it's to a much lesser degree and much more balanced and kind of in a normal environment right now. And that's why you don't hear us talking about it is because it's just not meaningful in the context of everything else that we have going on. Yes. Thanks, Erin. It's very consistent to the prior messages. So we're not seeing any change in the underlying market. And so my comments are going to be very similar to what it's been in the past. So let me just start with just underlying utilization continues to be strong. We've seen - in our commentary this morning, we made a number of comments around just the broad-based utilization being strong in the pharma industry. So we generally benefited from that. So volume is absolutely a key component of that. The consistent market dynamics that Aaron just referenced again is an indication that the buy and sell side continues to be very balanced. So overall, as in the past, I'm not going to break apart all the different pieces. We think it's best to look at them on a net basis. And within that, what I will say, though, is we continue to have very strong performance with our Red Oak Sourcing joint venture. So we continue to have that team, very focused on the dual mandate of, of course, driving down the best cost. But also as important and their mandate is to ensure that service levels are optimized as much as possible as well. So we feel very good about their progress, both in controlling costs, but also in driving great service for our customers. So again, those should be very similar words what we've said in the past. So that's why we used the phrase consistent market dynamics because we're not seeing any significant change in the underlying dynamics of this part of our business. Yes, so it's a fair question, George. And there's always going to be an evolution customer to customer, contract to contract. The balance of brand versus generic and then within brand and within generic, the mix always is ever evolving. And so over time, I would expect there to be more and more separation between some of these elements as the weighting of the products change. So it's - even though this volume has been dramatic for the GLP-1s, it's also been over a pretty short period of time and probably still early in this journey. So you used the phrase, and I think it was used earlier is significantly margin dilutive. I'm not sure - I'm sure we've never said words like that because it's very rare you hear us talking about margin rates, which you hear us talking about is margin dollars, and I even joked about this at Investor Day. I'm not sure I've ever said the words out loud in my career about the margin rate not being the most important or a significant metric for us. And it's because of products like the GLP-1s, products that are incredibly important to that underlying patient, which means it's important to our customers, which means it's important to us. It is not the most profitable class of progress today, but it's important for our patients and important for the industry what we value more than anything else is innovation in the distribution channel in the industry. Innovation brings good things for us. Maybe not in the short-term and maybe not for every single product, but innovation ultimately brings opportunities, whether it's services or whether it's - when these products become other opportunities to contract or other opportunities over time for them to go generic, there's just lots of different ways in which you can create economic value on a particular transaction, particular product. And so GLP-1s, today, you don't hear us talk about from revenue, it's not a meaningful contributor to our earnings. And so we're not going to talk about it from an earnings perspective. Contracting back to your original question, we'll continue to evolve underneath that dynamic. But ultimately, we are well-protected customer by customer in certain corridors to ensure that we don't flip upside down on a particular customer. And so that needs to evolve over time as those concentrations evolve over time. But our model has proven very, very resilient over the years and decades because this is the latest mix challenge that there is or mix change, I should say. But it's not the first time that there's been a mix change in our industry. And so our model has proven to be resilient in that regard. So it's unique and different products, but it's not unique in terms of impacts and influences that a particular product category has on the pharma distribution industry. You're getting all the value out of your one question. So let me see if I can touch on each one. I think there's some connectivity between these. So overall, for vaccines, I think the best way to think about vaccine distribution is more about it from the customer standpoint. So I think what you'll see is that COVID-19 vaccines like other vaccines typically will follow the distribution network. So the real question is, are our customers getting more than their fair share, and I don't necessarily want to talk about them from that perspective other than to say we are very happy with the customers we have. We've often used a phrase for other situations winning with the winners, and we feel very well aligned with great customers. And so - but I think that's how you should think about it. And that it most likely the vast majority of the volume will follow the distribution network. I think your second element of that question was on the COVID therapeutics. How I think about that is a little bit differently than vaccines in terms of just the rollout, where the vaccines were a bit of an obsolete old product, new product type of situation where all that government stockpile. When we were asked about vaccines nearly a year ago, when it was first communicated to be commercialized, that was part of our response as well. We didn't know the FDA approval date. We also didn't know what was going to happen with the in-stock inventory, which seems to not have been a relevant usage at this stage given the variance evolution. As it relates to therapeutics, you don't have that same challenge, right? There's a lot of product out there still and the rollout will be slower. And you're talking about an oral solid type of brand product, which typically does not carry very - the same type of specialization necessary in the distribution channel that does drive higher-margin products like our specialty products. And then the last question is on the long-term growth outlook. I think one of the key messages that is behind your question and behind how we think about it. And partly why we're calling out those elements that may be a little unusual. Again, just like with GLP-1s COVID vaccines, and other form of innovation. We like innovation. It provides us new opportunities and new growth as an enterprise. And so part of the answer to this question is, well, how do these innovative products evolve and transition over time? Is that a continued opportunity. Is it lumpy? Is this year may be higher or lower than what that volume will be in the future? That - those are all hard questions to answer. But what we saw here is a bit of an influx of innovation that we've been able to benefit from while using the same infrastructure. So one thing that's really important to highlight about our performance this quarter, so we had really nice gross margin growth and we had very flat SG&A. I made the comment about the operating leverage in my comments. That's what I'm getting at is that we were able to execute very efficiently this quarter and whether we're talking about vaccines or other products, having that gross margin because it's an incremental product category for us because, of course, we do not participate in that volume last year but we're able to leverage the same capacity, the same team, that's an efficient use of our distribution channel. And as we get more opportunities like that, then there's some opportunity. But one of the key things that Aaron highlighted in a number of his comments, whether it's his comments, whether it's his comments or his answers to the question, is that our underlying growth and we feel very good about that long-term target. And a lot of what we've seen here was the Q1 overperformance both from vaccines, but also just the core utilization being very strong. That's not the same level of strength that we have indicated, we should be thinking about long-term. It's an opportunity for us, but that's not what we're expecting at this point in time. And it's not what we're guiding for the balance of the year in terms of the core growth. We expect that core growth to still be in that 4% to 6% range. But again, innovation can create some opportunities for us. That's hard to see right now, but we're not planning for that. Yes. No, that's a great question. And it's - so when I step back and think about 18 months ago, what the root issue was, of course, we had international freight that was driving up the cost of everything in a multiple that was crazy, but you also had these other commodities that were - okay, so there are some commodities that are oil-based, so the oil input costs, but then you had the supply-demand factors going on too that I think overemphasized that issue because we don't buy oil, we buy products that contain oil. And so as oil goes up and down, that's often absorbed within the supply chain in a normal steady state, unless it gets outside of a certain band. So it did get outside that band, right? Oil went above $100 per barrel. And then you had other demand factors that were driving those commodity costs well beyond what the input cost impacts were. So you had a bit of an exponential increase in a number of commodities. So today, given that we're in a much more muted demand environment, as a broad industry because this is way outside of healthcare, right? This is a general economy not being as hot as it was at that point in time. When you see these types of input costs going up and down, it goes back to a bit more of a normal model, which is they're not being exaggerated and multiplied, they're just flowing through in a much more normalized steady state. So that's the reason why that I would not expect this under this current environment to get outside of normal bounds. So if you see the input costs going up and you see a heated economic environment that can further compound that impact, that's when we need to start worrying more about this. I know the importance of this will certainly be - day-to-day, we certainly spend a lot of time on this, but we'll continue to provide any insight that we see going forward. Of course, when we get into the very significant changes, that's the changes to our contracting structure that we've put into place. That's never going to be perfect. It's never going to be a one-for-one offset, but it's meant to really be active and impactful when you have those more extraordinary types of impacts that really kind of compound these items like I just referenced, and not just the normal types of more muted movements. We really haven't provided quarterly guidance at the margin level for the pharma business. We were - we leaned in a bit in describing the impact to Q1 from the COVID vaccine distribution as well as Jason's comments around the expectations for Q2. Beyond that, I think you just need to take into account what we typically say about our business, which is, first, that we expect the consistent market dynamics from a generic perspective, right? And we are not assuming some of the benefits from a brand perspective in Q3 that we have previously seen. And that's how we are offering up today. Yes. Thanks again, everyone, for joining us this morning. As we've said a few times, it was a great start to the year. We're pleased with our broad-based performance and to be in the position that we are today to raise our guidance after just the first quarter. We look forward to, certainly, continuing to update you on our progress against these plans throughout the year. And with that, thank you, and have a great day."
