[Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investors Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.\nStacey Brodbar: Thank you, Mary. And good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results. Today's call will be led by Scott Stephenson, Verisk's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, who will provide an overview of our business. Lee Shavel, Chief Financial Officer and Group President, will follow the financial - with the financial review. Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer and Group President; and Ken Thompson, General Counsel, will join the team for the Q&A session. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-K can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30-days on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance, including, but not limited to, the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Now, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\nScott Stephenson: Thanks, Stacey. Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our Q4 2020 earnings conference call. While 2020 was the year like no other for everyone, at Verisk, it was a year that demonstrated the resilience and stability of our business model, the relevance and mission-critical nature of our solutions and our relentless focus on our customers. And this was all powered by the strength and creativity of our over 9,000 Verisk teammates around the globe, who I want to thank for their dedication and commitment to deliver on our core mission to serve, add value, and innovate during these challenging times. The net results in 2020 was another strong year in financial performance marked by organic constant currency revenue growth of 4.1% and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth of 11.6% after normalizing for the impact of the injunction related to roof measurement solutions. More importantly, in 2020, we delivered 6.9% organic constant currency revenue growth in the 85% of our revenues that we identified as non-COVID-sensitive, essentially in line with our long-term growth target. Conversely, our COVID-sensitive revenues declined 11% on an OCC basis, yet, those revenue streams continue to show resilience as the underlying causal factors improved and we have confidence in this relationship. Throughout the year, we've been very deliberate in our cost actions and have protected profitability by matching headcount growth with the trend in our revenue growth. As such, the pace of our hiring and our overall headcount growth has increased sequentially following the moves that we took at the onset of the pandemic in early spring 2020. As a result, Verisk delivered strong organic adjusted EBITDA growth and solid margin expansion throughout the year. Lee will provide more details on our performance in his financial review. 2020 also exhibited the importance of our strong cash flow, the disciplined capital allocation mindset and our emphasis on creating long-term durable shareholder value. Despite the challenges of the operating environment during 2020, we were deliberate about our continued investment in our innovation agenda by inventing new solutions and enhancing existing ones. We also partnered with our customers to bring them solutions to help them be more automated and digitally connected during the pandemic. We funded the continued transformation of our technical infrastructure through cloud migration, tokenization of key data assets, and the development of cutting-edge data fabric to underlie our analytics solutions. This is a journey we embarked on in earnest two years ago and we have made significant progress within our datasets and solutions for the cloud. Yet, we still returned over $500 million in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved a 7% increase in our cash dividend and a $300 million increase in our share repurchase authorization to support ongoing capital return. On the innovation front, our Insurance business continued to advance our existing solutions and introduced new innovations. In our commercial property business, we substantially enhanced and updated our database of commercial properties by building an advanced analytic model for over 8 million commercial properties that give insurers information for five key building attributes, including building use, construction class, building age, number of storeys and area. This brings the database to a total of 12.2 million commercial properties and this data can be delivered to our insurance customers' workflows in an automated and easy-to-use format. Additionally, during the quarter, we continue to advance our analytics and offerings in the fast-growing area of cyber risk, with the addition of Nationwide to the Verisk Cyber Data Exchange. The Cyber Data Exchange has a contributory database of aggregated and anonymized insurance data from participating cyber insurers globally. The insights and analytics that Verisk derives from this data help our insurance customers make intelligent strategic decisions about their portfolios and select risk and benchmark their performance against peers. The cyber exchange is an important part of Verisk's cyber solutions fleet, which is an end-to-end ecosystem that helps insurers and reinsurers more quickly deliver new cyber programs or enhance existing ones. I'd like to take a minute to observe on recent developments related to our ongoing patent dispute with EagleView Technologies. We continue to disagree with the current outcome of the case and are aggressively pursuing all [indiscernible] and operational options. In September 2019, we recorded $125 million legal reserve related to this matter. We filed our appeal of the original ruling at the end of the fourth quarter 2020. On February 16, the trial court granted EVT's motion for trouble damages, as well as some interest and fees. We intend to appeal this ruling as well. As discussed in more detail on our 10-K because our appeal is pending, we're unable to predict the ultimate outcome of this matter. Still, we remain committed to providing our customers with superior aerial imagery solutions and remain very excited about our partnership with Vexcel, which has not been impacted by this ruling. At Wood Mackenzie, we continued to expand our Lens energy analytic platform. In the fourth quarter, we released Lens subsurface discovery on-time and on-budget, rounding out our five upstream solutions within the Lens platform. This module enables faster, more accurate decision-making for exploration and resource development teams as they have access to a comprehensive global dataset and can run custom analyzes and perform benchmarking studies right into the workflows. Despite the softness in the energy end market driving industry consolidation, we continue to see demand for Lens across our different customer segments, which is reflected in increased adoption, constructive pricing and longer contract terms. Looking ahead, we are on track to launch a suite of modules related to the energy transition into the Lens platform, namely Lens Power, which will include global discovery and valuation, as well as carbon-emissions benchmarking solutions. In Financial Services, we've launched small business attributes, a new solution in partnership with Enigma Technologies that provides greater insights into the financial health of small businesses, which have been the hardest hit part of the economy during the pandemic. This solution offers our bank customers near real-time information about sales trends that can be used by a bank's risk underwriting and marketing teams, so they can better serve small business customers. This partnership is a great example of how VFS is leveraging our unique data assets to send and serve new segments of the Financial Services end market. On the acquisition front, in the fourth quarter, Verisk closed on the acquisition of Jornaya, a leading provider of consumer behavioral data and intelligence. The acquisition will add Jornaya's proprietary view of consumer buying journeys to Verisk's growing set of marketing solutions for the insurance and financial service markets, delivering better experiences and improving customer acquisition and retention for our customers. In addition, we've made great strides throughout 2020 with recently acquired companies. We have now own FAST and Genscape for a full year. And I'm happy to share that we are having great success expanding and accelerating the adoption of their solutions across our customer set, as well as improving profitability through cost synergies. We're very pleased with these results, as they're tracking ahead of our plans at the time of acquisition, and are great example of management's focus on delivering strong returns on the capital invested in acquisition. 2020 also marked another high-point for our company's culture and our commitment to investing in our people and their skills. Despite the remote work environment, the Verisk team increased productivity, boosted connection and collaboration through internal communication tools and engaged in training and development courses through our many different platforms and across all levels in the organization. This year alone we trained more than 700 teammates in our leadership and management development programs. And in our Lean Six Sigma programs, Verisk teammates earned 900 yellow belt certifications and 70 greenbelt certifications. Lean Six Sigma is an embedded mindset across Verisk and we continue to leverage this established methodology and set of tools to serve our customers better every day. Some examples of important accomplishments this year include, first, model developers work to reduce the time spent collecting data and creating models, improving time to market from new models. Second, field representatives develop new timesaving procedures for completing and updating property surveys, increasing their productivity. Third, sales and support teams develop new processes to execute new contracts or amend current ones quicker with our customers. The benefits are reflected in increased productivity, high customer satisfaction and improved employee engagement. In fact, this year, our employee engagement score increased 8 points to 78%, and for the fifth consecutive year, Verisk received US certification from the Great Place to Work Institute for outstanding workplace culture. We also received first-time certification in the United Kingdom, India, and Spain. Finally, I'd like to share my enthusiasm and my views on the recently announced leadership changes and expanded responsibilities for our executive management team. These changes reflect the thoughtful and strategic approach to our long-term growth in planning for the global organization and are a testament to the deep bench of talented leaders we have at Verisk. I'm pleased to share that both Mark Anquillare, Lee Shavel are taking on new leadership responsibilities within Verisk and both have been elevated to the position of Group President. Mark Anquillare, who currently serves as Verisk's Chief Operating Officer is adding oversight of the Company's enterprise risk management function to his current responsibilities of leading the Company's Insurance business and government-facing businesses. Our risk management operations will continue to be led by our very talented and seasoned team that work diligently every day to make sure that our technical infrastructure remain secure and then we are always using the most advanced data protection techniques. This move also more closely tied to our enterprise risk assessment and management with core - the core operations of our business. Lee Shavel, who currently serves as Verisk's Chief Financial Officer will add oversight responsibility for the operations of our Energy and Specialized Markets segment and our Financial Services segment, bringing in an even more direct link between our capital allocation discipline and our business unit operations. Lee will continue to be supported by our Eaton [ph] tenured finance organization, including our Chief Accounting Officer and Controller, David Grover and our Treasurer, Brian Aird. Finally, I'm pleased to publicly welcome Kathy Card Beckles to Verisk, that's our new General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. Kathy joins us from Chase Consumer Bank, where she most recently served as General Counsel. Kathy brings with her extensive experience in intellectual property and technology and significant expertise partnering with an advisory boards of directors and management teams. I look forward to having Kathy formally join the team on April 5 and working with her to advance our long-term strategy. Kathy will replace Ken Thompson, who announced his retirement late last year. To ensure a smooth transition, Ken will continue with the Company as Executive Counsel. Over the last 14 years, Ken has been an integral part of Verisk' success and a valued partner and a friend to many across the organization. On behalf of the entire organization, I want to personally thank Ken for his dedication to Verisk and his counsel through this transition. We wish him much health and happiness in his retirement. And now, I will turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results.\nLee Shavel: Thanks, Scott. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. Moving to the financial results for the fourth quarter, on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 5.4% to $713 million, net income increased 33% to $176 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share grew 33.8% to $1.07, reflecting a $28 million acquisition-related earn-out expense in the prior year that did not reoccur. Moving to our organic constant currency results, adjusted for non-operating items, as defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of our press release, we are very pleased with our operating results considering the impact from COVID-19. In the fourth quarter, organic constant currency revenue grew 3.5% led by continued strength in our Insurance segment. Our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, as we defined at the start of the pandemic, grew approximately 6.5% on an organic constant currency basis. This sustained growth in our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, representing approximately 85% of our total revenues, reflects the durability and resilience of our primarily subscription-based business model. We did continue to experience, as we have since the onset of the pandemic, a negative impact from COVID-19 on certain of our products and services, largely transactional in nature, which represent the balance or approximately 15% of our consolidated revenues. These COVID-sensitive revenues declined approximately 12.5% on an OCC basis during the fourth quarter, though, the performance across our three segments deferred. In our Insurance segment, we continue to experience sequential improvement in these revenues as the underlying causal factors continue to abate, though, the pace of recovery varies across the different solutions. On the Energy side, our consulting business remained under pressure from lower CapEx budgets at our customers, but trends appear to have stabilized. And finally, within Financial Services, our COVID-sensitive revenues took a further step down as our bank customers reduced their spending levels in response to weakness across their lending portfolios. Despite the impact on revenue in the fourth quarter, we are pleased to report that we delivered solid EBITDA growth and expanded margins as the result of effective expense management. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 4.9% in the fourth quarter. Total adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter, which includes both organic and inorganic revenue and adjusted EBITDA was 48.2% in the quarter, representing leverage across the business. This margin level includes roughly 220 basis points of benefit from lower travel expenses, but also reflects a return to more normal pace of headcount growth and an increase in the pace of investment in our technological transformation, including our cloud transition costs. On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. In the fourth quarter, Insurance segment revenues increased 7.4%, reflecting healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, catastrophe modeling solutions, repair cost estimating solutions, and insurance software solutions. Similar to the third quarter, we experienced a modest benefit from storm related revenues as a result of a more normal storm season in 2020 as compared to the very slow season in 2019. This was offset in part by a decline in certain transactional revenues that were negatively impacted by COVID-19. Adjusted EBITDA grew 12.2% in the fourth quarter demonstrating strong margin expansion despite certain revenue declines, investment in our breakout areas and our cloud transition. Energy and Specialized Markets revenue decreased 3.9% in the fourth quarter due to declines in consulting and implementation projects and some modest headwinds related to consolidation in the end market. We were very pleased to see continued growth in our subscription-based core research and data analytic platforms and environmental health and safety service solutions, resulting in outperformance relative to the end market. We believe our strong performance is a function of the criticality of our solutions, the diversification of our revenue streams into breakout areas like the energy transition and the strength of our relationships in the industry. Adjusted EBITDA declined 19.5% in the fourth quarter, reflecting a catch-up of certain compensation expenses associated with furloughed employees that are one-time in nature. As a key partner to our energy customers, we continue to closely monitor the operating environment with a focus on consolidation in the upstream space and the potential impact of a broader, more climate-focused political agenda in the United States. We have a track record of managing through volatile times effectively and believe we are well positioned with our energy transition practice to capitalize on the global growth in spending across zero-carbon technologies like solar, wind and energy storage. Financial Services revenue declined 13% in the quarter, reflecting the impact of certain contract transitions, as well as lower levels of project spending from our bank customers stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and fewer bankruptcies versus 2019 as a result of government support and forbearance programs. Adjusted EBITDA declined 28.1%, reflecting the negative impact of lower sales, while margins were impacted by certain portfolio transactions we took earlier in the year. We continue on the journey to transition VFS to a more sustainable subscription-based business and have taken actions that we believe benefit the business in the long run, but are likely to negatively impact our growth over the next few quarters. Our reported effective tax rate was 18.4% for the quarter, compared to the 23.2% in the prior year quarter. The quarterly rate came in lower than our expectations, owing to increased levels of stock option exercise, which depend on personal employee decisions and the Verisk stock price. Looking forward to 2021, we expect that our full-year tax rate will be between 20% and 22%, though, there will likely be some quarterly variability related to the pace of employee stock option exercise. Adjusted net income was $209 million and adjusted diluted - I'm sorry, and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.27 for the fourth quarter 2020, up 10.8% and 12.4% from the prior year, respectively. These increases reflect solid top line growth, cost discipline in the business, a reduction in travel expenses as a result of COVID-19 and a lower average share count. Net cash provided by operating activities was $249 million for the quarter, up 41% from the prior year period, primarily due to increased customer collections, a reduction in income tax payments, owing to higher levels of stock option exercise, the deferral of certain employer payroll taxes resulting from the CARES Act, and a reduction in travel payments as a result of COVID-19. Capital expenditures were $72 million for the quarter and $247 million for 2020, including some one-time expenses associated with our office consolidations in Boston and London. CapEx came in at the lower end of our initial range as certain expenditures were delayed owing to the pandemic. For the full-year 2020, CapEx represented 8.9% of total revenues. As we look to 2021, we expect CapEx to be in the range of $250 million to $280 million, reflecting our continued investment in our innovation agenda, our technological transformation and our people, as well as the carry-over certain expenditures that were delayed in 2020 as a result of the pandemic. Related to CapEx, we expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization to be within the range of $200 million to $215 million and intangible amortization to be approximately $165 million in 2020. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to FX variability, the timing of purchases and the completion of projects, and future M&A activity. During the fourth quarter, we returned $94 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. As Scott mentioned, I'm pleased to report that our Board of Directors has approved a 7% increase in our cash dividend to $0.29 per share this quarter and has authorized an additional $300 million for share repurchases, bringing our total available authorization to more than $500 million. For the full year 2020, we generated $1.1 billion in cash flow from operating activities, an increase of 11.7% over 2019, a strong result considering the challenging operating environment. We invested this cash flow back into our business through $247 million in capital expenditures and funded $285 million in acquisitions. We also returned $176 million in capital to shareholders in dividends and an additional $349 million through share repurchases. As we look to 2021, our strategy to deliver long-term sustainable growth remains unchanged and we believe the stability and predictability of our subscription revenues will persist. However, we do expect certain COVID-19-related pressures on top line growth to continue, though, we expect the impact to be less than it was in 2020. We remain confident these impacts do not represent a structural change in our fundamental growth drivers and believe that as the underlying causal factors abate, we will show strong resilience in recovery. We also have confidence in our ability to manage the cost structure effectively to protect profitability, so we would remind you that cost comparisons will be more challenging as we begin to anniversary the onset of the pandemic in the second quarter. Taking this all together, we believe that as the COVID impacts abate, we can return to our long-term growth model of 7% organic constant currency revenue growth with core operating leverage allowing EBITDA to grow faster than revenue, although it's difficult to predict that timing. We hope this provides some useful context for you, and we look forward to addressing your questions. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of the analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have our first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. I just had a broader question on how you guys are looking at the company portfolio today? Because, I guess, has over the last five years, I think declined. And even the Energy business has been flat to slight growth. And I'm just curious, like, how long before major changes need to be made to clients spur that growth to match, which obviously a phenomenal insurance asset?\nScott Stephenson: Yeah. So, we spend a lot of time thinking about the way that we're deploying capital around the company and that thought process really occurs in a couple of levels. So, we do think about the shape of our business overall and it's very evident to everybody that we have a very strong insurance franchise. We believe that we know what are the elements of a trade data analytic business and our primary focus has been trying to bring those qualities bear across everything that we do. And we have definitely given a lot of attention in Energy to trying to make those investments and make them productive across all parts of the portfolio. And so, we're constantly reviewing what we're doing kind of at the segment level and at the individual solution level and we won't stop doing that and if - and those who are familiar with the history of the company know that if we ever get to the point where we conclude that something that we are doing is unlikely to be productive into the future, then we are not reluctant to respond to that kind of a conclusion. So, this is an ongoing thought process. It's consistently a part of what we think about at the company.\nStacey Brodbar: Operator, next question?\nOperator: We have our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nGreg Peters: Good morning. I was interested, there has been a lot of activity in the insurance industry around insurance tech IPOs and rhetoric around cyber. Let's just focus my question on your telematics business. Can you give us some detail of how big that business is for you? And what your key differentiation in terms of the products and services you're offering relative to some of these recent IPOs, I think that they have solved the matrix for telematics and auto insurance?\nScott Stephenson: Mark, could you take that, please?\nMark Anquillare: Sure. Thanks for the question. So, first of all, let me kind of describe what we've done and what we think is rather unique. We have moved primarily to the OEM side of the equation. So think of GM, Honda, Hyundai and Ford, and we have aggregated information from those vehicles. And remember, access to those vehicles, those data is being harvested off of newer cars, right, because the history doesn't go back to allow harvesting. So every day we have more cars, more miles and we are now tapped in two of the largest insurers, many of the largest personal auto writers. Cuate [ph] they are either using that [indiscernible] to do their own modeling. It's an opt-in service by the way. Or more likely, they're using our score to assess the driving behavior to offer discounts, market or actually price insurance. So, if you think about kind of the future of insurance, which I think is where you're going, historic rating algorithm is driven by sets, driving behavior from the standpoint of moving violations and accidents, age, those type of things. Clearly, understanding the driving behavior from what's happening behind the wheel is probably more accurate and more relevant. So we think we're very well positioned. We think it will nicely integrate and does integrate with all the underwriting work we do when we talk about moving the data forward in underwriting an insurance policy, picking, selecting a risk and pricing it. To kind of answer your question generally, it is still a small part of our business, especially around the personal auto line of business, but we do believe it will grow, it will become the approach for rating going forward. Now, I think your second question was a little bit about competitive advantage. We have some very unique and exclusive rule [ph] arrangements with, a, the OEMs. But more importantly, we feel that our data being at the center of those OEMs and all the insurers that we know so well and we are integrated with creates a unique relationship where they come to us once as opposed to integrate many times. We are trying to extend then out - that information out beyond what I'll refer to as just the car manufacturers. But I think that hopefully, describes to you a little bit about what we do and how we do it really more focused on insurance than some of these other telematic solutions that are extending beyond insurance and trying to provide to - marketing and other verticals.\nGreg Peters: Thank you for the answer.\nOperator: Your next question is from Andrew Jeffrey from Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hi. Good morning. Appreciate you taking the question. Scott or Mark, I wonder if I could ask for an update on a couple of newer lines of business that I didn't hear called out specifically. One would be Life and the other is LightSpeed. I know you touched on auto book, seem like big TAMs with potential pricing leverage. So I wonder if you could just comment on sort of contribution to growth and any changes in that contribution prospectively.\nScott Stephenson: Yeah. So two topics about which we're very excited. Mark, those are both in your column. Do you want to speak to those?\nMark Anquillare: Yeah. You can't see me, but I have a smile on my face, only here a little bit about that. First of all, what we're doing in Life is led by that acquisition of FAST, which is this, I'll call it, low-code, no-code solution for life insurers. What we've added is a bit of relationship and some analytics to the underwriting approach, so things like understanding from your voice, whether you're a smoker, those are the type of things that we've added and the Life business in whole has done exceptionally well. We probably are not talking about it quite as much is because we typically focus a little bit on organic revenue growth. So, I look forward to having some conversations probably in first quarter of next year when we become a little bit become an organic part of our math. Separately, distinctly, when we talk about the resurgence and the great growth at [indiscernible] ISO our underwriting business, we've had a very stable and strong business as it relates to our historic loss culturals [ph] and forms. But the growth that you're seeing in most part is driven by just LightSpeed conscious. It is taking a lot of data, not just our own proprietary data, but that in combination with other third-parties scoring it so that we have a confidence level, so that as opposed to doing first a quote, providing that rate to potential policyholder, they like it and they need to - and they're underwriting to understand if there is any other accidents, moving violations, traffic. Typically 33% of the time that rate changes. That's very, very much. And inventory attracted to the policyholder not the digital engagement looking for. So a bindable quote is really the heart of what has driven a lot of our underwriting and rating growth over the last year and we are doing more and we are extending kind of, I'll call it, from an investment perspective doubling down as we speak.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question is from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi. Lee, I remembered you talked about the normalization of T&E on the third quarter call. So I just thought I'd revisit the subject, kind of, given that '21 does appear to be a year of rebound in organic revenue growth, that's just, you know, the assumption around the COVID drags abating, yet, do you still think that the normalization of T&E will be more of a drag to margin that core operating leverage? And could you just mentioned what T&E expense level was in the fourth quarter and how you envision kind of normalization of T&E post-COVID?\nLee Shavel: Yeah. Thank you, Andrew. And it's certainly something that we're watching very carefully and expect to manage very actively in 2021. I think you characterized it accurately. In terms of the - we are expecting that as and if the pandemic impacts continue to abate over time, the revenue impact relative to our targeted growth rate should be more modest. So, we're certainly hoping for improvement in that regard. However, as you saw in our expense management in 2020 and not just including the T&E expense, which as we mentioned represented about a 220 basis point benefit to our margin, but also our management of headcount levels, incentive compensation levels in the fourth quarter and over the course of 2020 reflected an ability to manage that expense impact. Now, naturally as we move into what is hopefully a more constructive environment, we will want to normalize the earnings level \u2014 normalize the headcount level for the business to pursue the very attractive opportunities that we have with our clients. We have control both over the level of certainly headcount that we are taking on and T&E and our objective will be to manage that in a way where we hold on to as much of the benefit that we experienced in 2020 as we can. But we are expecting that on year-over-year, particularly as we anniversary the onset of the pandemic that we will see an uptick. But we - overall, we'll try to manage that in a way where we preserve our operating leverage and that becomes a clear, as we talk about it, through the course of the year.\nAndrew Steinerman: Okay. Thanks, Lee.\nLee Shavel: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is open.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi. Good morning. Lee, you added Group President of the Energy and Financial Services businesses to your list of responsibilities. Obviously, as CFO, you have plenty involvement previously. But is there anything specific you'd call out for us that you're particularly focused on in that role? Any changes you'd like to make or strategic priorities you've identified that you're willing to share?\nLee Shavel: Well, thank you very much. I would say, we'll get - at this stage, it's very early. I do know and respect those teams and what they have accomplished. I'm looking forward to working with them more closely. Our overall objective as it has been - at a corporate level has been focusing on how we can invest in those businesses, generate good returns and support the strong position that they operate in and really extend the growth that they represent. So, at this stage, no clear determinations. I'm really just looking forward to spending more time with them on the operating side and determining how we can make them more effective, enhance the growth story and continue to find good opportunities to invest.\nAndrew Nicholas: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good morning. Bridging to an earlier question on the Financial Services business. Do you think you have the right mix of services for bank card issuers in that business? We've seen a big change in demand trends, at least what Visa and Mastercard have called out in their similar businesses during COVID a big shift towards cyber. Could you maybe comment on the services that you're offering in that business currently? And whether you're intending any, let's say, shift in services mix and offerings as a result of COVID?\nScott Stephenson: Yeah. We feel good about the range of solutions that we're able to issue \u2014 we're able to offer to a credit card issuer. In fact, that has been explicitly a part of the way that we have built the portfolio of solutions that we offer. And to the point you just made, David, that we do believe that working on issues of risk and fraud are really important issues and we feel that we have some unique intellectual property to help our customers work on that. So - and there are a variety of other things that any one customer can also look to us for. In fact, we have a fairly broad portfolio of solutions. And so, we feel as if we are positioned well in terms of being able to be a partner that a customer could look to for help and support across a variety of dimensions. We're not - even though it would be very easy for folks to kind of look at us and say, okay, well, that phenomenal dataset, which is transactional in nature and so kind of building around that, what we have built around that, but we've extended around that as well. Lee, I don't know if there's anything you want to add to that?\nLee Shavel: The only thing I would add is that, as with all of the businesses within Financial Services, we are leveraging an exceptional dataset in that core business that allows us to triangulate in on issues like fraud in ways that other players in the industry can't. So, we're looking for angles where we can utilize that insight to create a differentiated product.\nDavid Togut: Understood. Thank you very much.\nScott Stephenson: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open.\nJeff Meuler: Yeah. Thank you. So my question is on Energy and Specialized, and I understand what's up and what's down but it's less clear to me, I guess, what stable, what's better, what's worse from a trending perspective from one quarter into the next? I think you said consulting fairly stable. But if I look at the overall worsening year-over-year trend, is it - that the core subs revenue is still growing but decelerating? Was the issue the tougher power advocate implementation comp or the consolidation that you called out? Just any help on the Q4 year-over-year trend relative to what it was the last quarter or two? Thanks.\nLee Shavel: Yeah. Thank you, Jeff. This is Lee. So, I would break it down into a couple of influences. Within Wood Mackenzie, the things that we would point out is that, we saw a modest but positive growth in the subscription side of the business. And so, that I think is a reflection of the durability and the value of those products, even in this more challenging environment. And so, it also, I think is reflective of the value of the investment that we've made in Lens because that subscription component and particularly the pricing on renewals that has benefited from our clients receptivity to what Lens provides them. So, I think that's the core positive and of particular note in a challenging environment for the industry, where the end market, I think, has had a different experience. On the consulting side, that's where on a year-over-year basis, we're \u2014 in reported revenues, we are still seeing that 30% year-over-year decline within that business. However, our sense is that, our clients are engaging more actively on the consulting dialogue and we feel better about where the pipeline is headed in that area. So, that is not been demonstrated the financial impact yet, but we feel a little bit better about the level of engagement with clients. And then within Power Advocate, we are experiencing some pressure, particularly on the implementation side of the equation for our clients. We've had some of our clients that experiencing the pressure of this environment have pulled back or reduced, but we still seeing strong demand over the near-term for the cost management and supply chain dimensions of that product side as a whole. And I don't want to overlook also our health and safety business, which continues to contribute strong revenue growth within this segment as a whole, as well as strong EBITDA growth and operating leverage within that business. So that gives you I think the three primary areas within that segment, and some of the elements of the growth for that.\nJeff Meuler: Okay. Thank you, Lee.\nOperator: Your next question is from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDavid Chu: Hi. This is David Chu for Gary. So, on margins, cost rose $33 million sequentially or about 10% versus the revenue, up $11 million or 1.5%. This is despite, like, lower T&E. So how much is cost that were deferred earlier in this year building back versus like other investments or other factors?\nLee Shavel: So - and, I guess, the way I will address it and happy to spend time later in talking through your build back analysis. But when we think about the expenses, we want to kind of remove the inorganic component, so that we understand the trends. And I think simplistically, while our overall revenue growth rate was in kind of the 3.5% level, we were able to reduce overall expenses on a year-over-year basis as a function of headcount controlled and T&E. And so, our frame of mind as we're looking at the organic growth of the business that we were able to make that adjustment in expenses downward, which allowed us to deliver the strong EBITDA growth performance even despite that decline in the revenue growth. As we look ahead to 2020, we are expecting a higher level of growth if these trends continue with regard to the pandemic. And as a consequence, from an expense standpoint, we are expecting a higher growth rate. We're not expecting expenses to decline. And so, the year-over-year comparisons are higher, but we're going to try to manage those in a way where we preserve that operating leverage and hold onto as much of that benefit - as much of that benefit as we practically can while still pursuing our client events. I know that doesn't put that in the context that you're asking, but it's kind of the I think the best way to think about the overall performance of trends, absent the - naturally the impact from an M&A standpoint. But we'll be happy to spend more time with you later on the way you're thinking about it.\nDavid Chu: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nHamzah Mazari: Yes. Hi, good morning. My question is just on the non - on the transactional side of the business. I guess, it was down 12.5%, Q3 it was down 10%. Could you maybe talk about what has to happen for that business to come back? Is it a vaccine? Is there anything structural going on in that side of the business that it may just take a lot longer to recover? Maybe just if you could parse the transactional side out of the business?\nLee Shavel: Yeah. Hamzah, this is Lee. So, it is a - and while you were referring to, it's kind of in aggregate as a transactional business, we're really talking about probably a dozen to 20 individual products that have various transactional elements, everything from the consulting business at Wood Mackenzie, some of the consulting and the analytics projects in Financial Services, the claims business with auto claims that are driven by it. So, you have a lot of different, different factors. And so, if you can think about it over time and if I describe it in 2020, we had some businesses that demonstrated as the year progressed pick up in driving activity. And so, when we talked about the improved performance within Insurance on our COVID-sensitive revenues, it was reflecting in earlier impact and benefit from the uptick in driving and driving activity and those - that portion of that transactional business. While the consulting revenue on the Energy side, which is not going to be tied as directly to a possible impact is going to improve over a longer period. And in Financial Services, we were seeing a dynamic where the weakness in the fourth quarter reflected an increasing - what we interpreted as increasing concern over potential credit losses, which caused them to pull back on some of their project analytics in the fourth quarter where we typically see stronger elements. So to try to get to your - to give you an answer is that, as we look across all of these products, as we proceed through 2021, as things improve, we'll see - we should see gradual improvements but at different rates within each of those businesses. So there is no simple answer because it involves multiple products with differing levels of impact across that. So, hopefully, that gives you some context, but I can't kind of define it more precisely for you.\nHamzah Mazari: Right. No, that's very clear. Thank you so much.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Your Financial Services segment had revenue declines of about 13% organic constant currency in the quarter that reflected some contract transitions as you noted, as well as some COVID impacting lower project spend. Is it possible to perhaps break out the two impact to determine how much of the decline is structural in nature and how much of the decline you expect to recover as COVID becomes more in the rearview mirror?\nLee Shavel: Yeah. George, thanks for the question. It's Lee. So, it's a great question. And when we look at that in the fourth quarter and recognizing that it is fourth quarter, I would say that there was more of an impact on that on the transactional - on the contract transitions. And some of that involved kind of restructuring our contracts to better reflect the annuity nature of our business and we also had some contract transitions that were a result of some strategic exits from a portion of our businesses. But that probably had a more significant impact in the fourth quarter relative to some of the environmental impacts and - which were, as I described in the recent - another question recently, was that, we saw some weakness in the banks pulling back on some of their project - the project analytics, which had a - had an overall impact - negative impact. So, that gives you kind of a rough proportion, probably a little bit more on that contract transition. But there was also a meaningful impact from what we were seeing in the project analytics front.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Ms. Brodbar.\nStacey Brodbar: Okay. Well, thanks everybody for joining us. Appreciate your interest as always. And as always, we will be following up with you on some of these more specific points. And so, we'll be in touch with many of you in the near future. Until then, thanks.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. Thank you, everyone for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Lee Shavel",
            "content": "Thanks, Scott. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. Moving to the financial results for the fourth quarter, on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 5.4% to $713 million, net income increased 33% to $176 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share grew 33.8% to $1.07, reflecting a $28 million acquisition-related earn-out expense in the prior year that did not reoccur. Moving to our organic constant currency results, adjusted for non-operating items, as defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of our press release, we are very pleased with our operating results considering the impact from COVID-19. In the fourth quarter, organic constant currency revenue grew 3.5% led by continued strength in our Insurance segment. Our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, as we defined at the start of the pandemic, grew approximately 6.5% on an organic constant currency basis. This sustained growth in our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, representing approximately 85% of our total revenues, reflects the durability and resilience of our primarily subscription-based business model. We did continue to experience, as we have since the onset of the pandemic, a negative impact from COVID-19 on certain of our products and services, largely transactional in nature, which represent the balance or approximately 15% of our consolidated revenues. These COVID-sensitive revenues declined approximately 12.5% on an OCC basis during the fourth quarter, though, the performance across our three segments deferred. In our Insurance segment, we continue to experience sequential improvement in these revenues as the underlying causal factors continue to abate, though, the pace of recovery varies across the different solutions. On the Energy side, our consulting business remained under pressure from lower CapEx budgets at our customers, but trends appear to have stabilized. And finally, within Financial Services, our COVID-sensitive revenues took a further step down as our bank customers reduced their spending levels in response to weakness across their lending portfolios. Despite the impact on revenue in the fourth quarter, we are pleased to report that we delivered solid EBITDA growth and expanded margins as the result of effective expense management. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 4.9% in the fourth quarter. Total adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter, which includes both organic and inorganic revenue and adjusted EBITDA was 48.2% in the quarter, representing leverage across the business. This margin level includes roughly 220 basis points of benefit from lower travel expenses, but also reflects a return to more normal pace of headcount growth and an increase in the pace of investment in our technological transformation, including our cloud transition costs. On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. In the fourth quarter, Insurance segment revenues increased 7.4%, reflecting healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, catastrophe modeling solutions, repair cost estimating solutions, and insurance software solutions. Similar to the third quarter, we experienced a modest benefit from storm related revenues as a result of a more normal storm season in 2020 as compared to the very slow season in 2019. This was offset in part by a decline in certain transactional revenues that were negatively impacted by COVID-19. Adjusted EBITDA grew 12.2% in the fourth quarter demonstrating strong margin expansion despite certain revenue declines, investment in our breakout areas and our cloud transition. Energy and Specialized Markets revenue decreased 3.9% in the fourth quarter due to declines in consulting and implementation projects and some modest headwinds related to consolidation in the end market. We were very pleased to see continued growth in our subscription-based core research and data analytic platforms and environmental health and safety service solutions, resulting in outperformance relative to the end market. We believe our strong performance is a function of the criticality of our solutions, the diversification of our revenue streams into breakout areas like the energy transition and the strength of our relationships in the industry. Adjusted EBITDA declined 19.5% in the fourth quarter, reflecting a catch-up of certain compensation expenses associated with furloughed employees that are one-time in nature. As a key partner to our energy customers, we continue to closely monitor the operating environment with a focus on consolidation in the upstream space and the potential impact of a broader, more climate-focused political agenda in the United States. We have a track record of managing through volatile times effectively and believe we are well positioned with our energy transition practice to capitalize on the global growth in spending across zero-carbon technologies like solar, wind and energy storage. Financial Services revenue declined 13% in the quarter, reflecting the impact of certain contract transitions, as well as lower levels of project spending from our bank customers stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and fewer bankruptcies versus 2019 as a result of government support and forbearance programs. Adjusted EBITDA declined 28.1%, reflecting the negative impact of lower sales, while margins were impacted by certain portfolio transactions we took earlier in the year. We continue on the journey to transition VFS to a more sustainable subscription-based business and have taken actions that we believe benefit the business in the long run, but are likely to negatively impact our growth over the next few quarters. Our reported effective tax rate was 18.4% for the quarter, compared to the 23.2% in the prior year quarter. The quarterly rate came in lower than our expectations, owing to increased levels of stock option exercise, which depend on personal employee decisions and the Verisk stock price. Looking forward to 2021, we expect that our full-year tax rate will be between 20% and 22%, though, there will likely be some quarterly variability related to the pace of employee stock option exercise. Adjusted net income was $209 million and adjusted diluted - I'm sorry, and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.27 for the fourth quarter 2020, up 10.8% and 12.4% from the prior year, respectively. These increases reflect solid top line growth, cost discipline in the business, a reduction in travel expenses as a result of COVID-19 and a lower average share count. Net cash provided by operating activities was $249 million for the quarter, up 41% from the prior year period, primarily due to increased customer collections, a reduction in income tax payments, owing to higher levels of stock option exercise, the deferral of certain employer payroll taxes resulting from the CARES Act, and a reduction in travel payments as a result of COVID-19. Capital expenditures were $72 million for the quarter and $247 million for 2020, including some one-time expenses associated with our office consolidations in Boston and London. CapEx came in at the lower end of our initial range as certain expenditures were delayed owing to the pandemic. For the full-year 2020, CapEx represented 8.9% of total revenues. As we look to 2021, we expect CapEx to be in the range of $250 million to $280 million, reflecting our continued investment in our innovation agenda, our technological transformation and our people, as well as the carry-over certain expenditures that were delayed in 2020 as a result of the pandemic. Related to CapEx, we expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization to be within the range of $200 million to $215 million and intangible amortization to be approximately $165 million in 2020. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to FX variability, the timing of purchases and the completion of projects, and future M&A activity. During the fourth quarter, we returned $94 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. As Scott mentioned, I'm pleased to report that our Board of Directors has approved a 7% increase in our cash dividend to $0.29 per share this quarter and has authorized an additional $300 million for share repurchases, bringing our total available authorization to more than $500 million. For the full year 2020, we generated $1.1 billion in cash flow from operating activities, an increase of 11.7% over 2019, a strong result considering the challenging operating environment. We invested this cash flow back into our business through $247 million in capital expenditures and funded $285 million in acquisitions. We also returned $176 million in capital to shareholders in dividends and an additional $349 million through share repurchases. As we look to 2021, our strategy to deliver long-term sustainable growth remains unchanged and we believe the stability and predictability of our subscription revenues will persist. However, we do expect certain COVID-19-related pressures on top line growth to continue, though, we expect the impact to be less than it was in 2020. We remain confident these impacts do not represent a structural change in our fundamental growth drivers and believe that as the underlying causal factors abate, we will show strong resilience in recovery. We also have confidence in our ability to manage the cost structure effectively to protect profitability, so we would remind you that cost comparisons will be more challenging as we begin to anniversary the onset of the pandemic in the second quarter. Taking this all together, we believe that as the COVID impacts abate, we can return to our long-term growth model of 7% organic constant currency revenue growth with core operating leverage allowing EBITDA to grow faster than revenue, although it's difficult to predict that timing. We hope this provides some useful context for you, and we look forward to addressing your questions. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of the analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions. Yeah. Thank you, Andrew. And it's certainly something that we're watching very carefully and expect to manage very actively in 2021. I think you characterized it accurately. In terms of the - we are expecting that as and if the pandemic impacts continue to abate over time, the revenue impact relative to our targeted growth rate should be more modest. So, we're certainly hoping for improvement in that regard. However, as you saw in our expense management in 2020 and not just including the T&E expense, which as we mentioned represented about a 220 basis point benefit to our margin, but also our management of headcount levels, incentive compensation levels in the fourth quarter and over the course of 2020 reflected an ability to manage that expense impact. Now, naturally as we move into what is hopefully a more constructive environment, we will want to normalize the earnings level \u2014 normalize the headcount level for the business to pursue the very attractive opportunities that we have with our clients. We have control both over the level of certainly headcount that we are taking on and T&E and our objective will be to manage that in a way where we hold on to as much of the benefit that we experienced in 2020 as we can. But we are expecting that on year-over-year, particularly as we anniversary the onset of the pandemic that we will see an uptick. But we - overall, we'll try to manage that in a way where we preserve our operating leverage and that becomes a clear, as we talk about it, through the course of the year. Thank you. Well, thank you very much. I would say, we'll get - at this stage, it's very early. I do know and respect those teams and what they have accomplished. I'm looking forward to working with them more closely. Our overall objective as it has been - at a corporate level has been focusing on how we can invest in those businesses, generate good returns and support the strong position that they operate in and really extend the growth that they represent. So, at this stage, no clear determinations. I'm really just looking forward to spending more time with them on the operating side and determining how we can make them more effective, enhance the growth story and continue to find good opportunities to invest. The only thing I would add is that, as with all of the businesses within Financial Services, we are leveraging an exceptional dataset in that core business that allows us to triangulate in on issues like fraud in ways that other players in the industry can't. So, we're looking for angles where we can utilize that insight to create a differentiated product. Yeah. Thank you, Jeff. This is Lee. So, I would break it down into a couple of influences.

So, it is a - and while you were referring to, it's kind of in aggregate as a transactional business, we're really talking about probably a dozen to 20 individual products that have various transactional elements, everything from the consulting business at Wood Mackenzie, some of the consulting and the analytics projects in Financial Services, the claims business with auto claims that are driven by it. So, you have a lot of different, different factors. And so, if you can think about it over time and if I describe it in 2020, we had some businesses that demonstrated as the year progressed pick up in driving activity.

            "name": "Scott Stephenson",
            "content": "Thanks, Stacey. Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our Q4 2020 earnings conference call. While 2020 was the year like no other for everyone, at Verisk, it was a year that demonstrated the resilience and stability of our business model, the relevance and mission-critical nature of our solutions and our relentless focus on our customers. And this was all powered by the strength and creativity of our over 9,000 Verisk teammates around the globe, who I want to thank for their dedication and commitment to deliver on our core mission to serve, add value, and innovate during these challenging times. The net results in 2020 was another strong year in financial performance marked by organic constant currency revenue growth of 4.1% and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth of 11.6% after normalizing for the impact of the injunction related to roof measurement solutions. More importantly, in 2020, we delivered 6.9% organic constant currency revenue growth in the 85% of our revenues that we identified as non-COVID-sensitive, essentially in line with our long-term growth target. Conversely, our COVID-sensitive revenues declined 11% on an OCC basis, yet, those revenue streams continue to show resilience as the underlying causal factors improved and we have confidence in this relationship. Throughout the year, we've been very deliberate in our cost actions and have protected profitability by matching headcount growth with the trend in our revenue growth. As such, the pace of our hiring and our overall headcount growth has increased sequentially following the moves that we took at the onset of the pandemic in early spring 2020. As a result, Verisk delivered strong organic adjusted EBITDA growth and solid margin expansion throughout the year. Lee will provide more details on our performance in his financial review. 2020 also exhibited the importance of our strong cash flow, the disciplined capital allocation mindset and our emphasis on creating long-term durable shareholder value. Despite the challenges of the operating environment during 2020, we were deliberate about our continued investment in our innovation agenda by inventing new solutions and enhancing existing ones. We also partnered with our customers to bring them solutions to help them be more automated and digitally connected during the pandemic. We funded the continued transformation of our technical infrastructure through cloud migration, tokenization of key data assets, and the development of cutting-edge data fabric to underlie our analytics solutions. This is a journey we embarked on in earnest two years ago and we have made significant progress within our datasets and solutions for the cloud. Yet, we still returned over $500 million in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved a 7% increase in our cash dividend and a $300 million increase in our share repurchase authorization to support ongoing capital return. On the innovation front, our Insurance business continued to advance our existing solutions and introduced new innovations. In our commercial property business, we substantially enhanced and updated our database of commercial properties by building an advanced analytic model for over 8 million commercial properties that give insurers information for five key building attributes, including building use, construction class, building age, number of storeys and area. This brings the database to a total of 12.2 million commercial properties and this data can be delivered to our insurance customers' workflows in an automated and easy-to-use format. Additionally, during the quarter, we continue to advance our analytics and offerings in the fast-growing area of cyber risk, with the addition of Nationwide to the Verisk Cyber Data Exchange. The Cyber Data Exchange has a contributory database of aggregated and anonymized insurance data from participating cyber insurers globally. The insights and analytics that Verisk derives from this data help our insurance customers make intelligent strategic decisions about their portfolios and select risk and benchmark their performance against peers. The cyber exchange is an important part of Verisk's cyber solutions fleet, which is an end-to-end ecosystem that helps insurers and reinsurers more quickly deliver new cyber programs or enhance existing ones. I'd like to take a minute to observe on recent developments related to our ongoing patent dispute with EagleView Technologies. We continue to disagree with the current outcome of the case and are aggressively pursuing all [indiscernible] and operational options. In September 2019, we recorded $125 million legal reserve related to this matter. We filed our appeal of the original ruling at the end of the fourth quarter 2020. On February 16, the trial court granted EVT's motion for trouble damages, as well as some interest and fees. We intend to appeal this ruling as well. As discussed in more detail on our 10-K because our appeal is pending, we're unable to predict the ultimate outcome of this matter. Still, we remain committed to providing our customers with superior aerial imagery solutions and remain very excited about our partnership with Vexcel, which has not been impacted by this ruling. At Wood Mackenzie, we continued to expand our Lens energy analytic platform. In the fourth quarter, we released Lens subsurface discovery on-time and on-budget, rounding out our five upstream solutions within the Lens platform. This module enables faster, more accurate decision-making for exploration and resource development teams as they have access to a comprehensive global dataset and can run custom analyzes and perform benchmarking studies right into the workflows. Despite the softness in the energy end market driving industry consolidation, we continue to see demand for Lens across our different customer segments, which is reflected in increased adoption, constructive pricing and longer contract terms. Looking ahead, we are on track to launch a suite of modules related to the energy transition into the Lens platform, namely Lens Power, which will include global discovery and valuation, as well as carbon-emissions benchmarking solutions. In Financial Services, we've launched small business attributes, a new solution in partnership with Enigma Technologies that provides greater insights into the financial health of small businesses, which have been the hardest hit part of the economy during the pandemic. This solution offers our bank customers near real-time information about sales trends that can be used by a bank's risk underwriting and marketing teams, so they can better serve small business customers. This partnership is a great example of how VFS is leveraging our unique data assets to send and serve new segments of the Financial Services end market. On the acquisition front, in the fourth quarter, Verisk closed on the acquisition of Jornaya, a leading provider of consumer behavioral data and intelligence. The acquisition will add Jornaya's proprietary view of consumer buying journeys to Verisk's growing set of marketing solutions for the insurance and financial service markets, delivering better experiences and improving customer acquisition and retention for our customers. In addition, we've made great strides throughout 2020 with recently acquired companies. We have now own FAST and Genscape for a full year. And I'm happy to share that we are having great success expanding and accelerating the adoption of their solutions across our customer set, as well as improving profitability through cost synergies. We're very pleased with these results, as they're tracking ahead of our plans at the time of acquisition, and are great example of management's focus on delivering strong returns on the capital invested in acquisition. 2020 also marked another high-point for our company's culture and our commitment to investing in our people and their skills. Despite the remote work environment, the Verisk team increased productivity, boosted connection and collaboration through internal communication tools and engaged in training and development courses through our many different platforms and across all levels in the organization. This year alone we trained more than 700 teammates in our leadership and management development programs. And in our Lean Six Sigma programs, Verisk teammates earned 900 yellow belt certifications and 70 greenbelt certifications. Lean Six Sigma is an embedded mindset across Verisk and we continue to leverage this established methodology and set of tools to serve our customers better every day. Some examples of important accomplishments this year include, first, model developers work to reduce the time spent collecting data and creating models, improving time to market from new models. Second, field representatives develop new timesaving procedures for completing and updating property surveys, increasing their productivity. Third, sales and support teams develop new processes to execute new contracts or amend current ones quicker with our customers. The benefits are reflected in increased productivity, high customer satisfaction and improved employee engagement. In fact, this year, our employee engagement score increased 8 points to 78%, and for the fifth consecutive year, Verisk received US certification from the Great Place to Work Institute for outstanding workplace culture. We also received first-time certification in the United Kingdom, India, and Spain. Finally, I'd like to share my enthusiasm and my views on the recently announced leadership changes and expanded responsibilities for our executive management team. These changes reflect the thoughtful and strategic approach to our long-term growth in planning for the global organization and are a testament to the deep bench of talented leaders we have at Verisk. I'm pleased to share that both Mark Anquillare, Lee Shavel are taking on new leadership responsibilities within Verisk and both have been elevated to the position of Group President. Mark Anquillare, who currently serves as Verisk's Chief Operating Officer is adding oversight of the Company's enterprise risk management function to his current responsibilities of leading the Company's Insurance business and government-facing businesses. Our risk management operations will continue to be led by our very talented and seasoned team that work diligently every day to make sure that our technical infrastructure remain secure and then we are always using the most advanced data protection techniques. This move also more closely tied to our enterprise risk assessment and management with core - the core operations of our business. Lee Shavel, who currently serves as Verisk's Chief Financial Officer will add oversight responsibility for the operations of our Energy and Specialized Markets segment and our Financial Services segment, bringing in an even more direct link between our capital allocation discipline and our business unit operations. Lee will continue to be supported by our Eaton [ph] tenured finance organization, including our Chief Accounting Officer and Controller, David Grover and our Treasurer, Brian Aird. Finally, I'm pleased to publicly welcome Kathy Card Beckles to Verisk, that's our new General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. Kathy joins us from Chase Consumer Bank, where she most recently served as General Counsel. Kathy brings with her extensive experience in intellectual property and technology and significant expertise partnering with an advisory boards of directors and management teams. I look forward to having Kathy formally join the team on April 5 and working with her to advance our long-term strategy. Kathy will replace Ken Thompson, who announced his retirement late last year. To ensure a smooth transition, Ken will continue with the Company as Executive Counsel. Over the last 14 years, Ken has been an integral part of Verisk' success and a valued partner and a friend to many across the organization. On behalf of the entire organization, I want to personally thank Ken for his dedication to Verisk and his counsel through this transition. We wish him much health and happiness in his retirement. And now, I will turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results. Yeah. So, we spend a lot of time thinking about the way that we're deploying capital around the company and that thought process really occurs in a couple of levels. So, we do think about the shape of our business overall and it's very evident to everybody that we have a very strong insurance franchise. We believe that we know what are the elements of a trade data analytic business and our primary focus has been trying to bring those qualities bear across everything that we do. And we have definitely given a lot of attention in Energy to trying to make those investments and make them productive across all parts of the portfolio. And so, we're constantly reviewing what we're doing kind of at the segment level and at the individual solution level and we won't stop doing that and if - and those who are familiar with the history of the company know that if we ever get to the point where we conclude that something that we are doing is unlikely to be productive into the future, then we are not reluctant to respond to that kind of a conclusion. So, this is an ongoing thought process. It's consistently a part of what we think about at the company. Mark, could you take that, please? Yeah. So two topics about which we're very excited. Mark, those are both in your column. Do you want to speak to those? Yeah. We feel good about the range of solutions that we're able to issue \u2014 we're able to offer to a credit card issuer. In fact, that has been explicitly a part of the way that we have built the portfolio of solutions that we offer. And to the point you just made, David, that we do believe that working on issues of risk and fraud are really important issues and we feel that we have some unique intellectual property to help our customers work on that. So - and there are a variety of other things that any one customer can also look to us for. In fact, we have a fairly broad portfolio of solutions. And so, we feel as if we are positioned well in terms of being able to be a partner that a customer could look to for help and support across a variety of dimensions. We're not - even though it would be very easy for folks to kind of look at us and say, okay, well, that phenomenal dataset, which is transactional in nature and so kind of building around that, what we have built around that, but we've extended around that as well. Lee, I don't know if there's anything you want to add to that? Thanks, David."

            "name": "Mark Anquillare",
            "content": "Sure. Thanks for the question. So, first of all, let me kind of describe what we've done and what we think is rather unique. We have moved primarily to the OEM side of the equation. So think of GM, Honda, Hyundai and Ford, and we have aggregated information from those vehicles. And remember, access to those vehicles, those data is being harvested off of newer cars, right, because the history doesn't go back to allow harvesting. So every day we have more cars, more miles and we are now tapped in two of the largest insurers, many of the largest personal auto writers. Cuate [ph] they are either using that [indiscernible] to do their own modeling. It's an opt-in service by the way. Or more likely, they're using our score to assess the driving behavior to offer discounts, market or actually price insurance. So, if you think about kind of the future of insurance, which I think is where you're going, historic rating algorithm is driven by sets, driving behavior from the standpoint of moving violations and accidents, age, those type of things. Clearly, understanding the driving behavior from what's happening behind the wheel is probably more accurate and more relevant. So we think we're very well positioned. We think it will nicely integrate and does integrate with all the underwriting work we do when we talk about moving the data forward in underwriting an insurance policy, picking, selecting a risk and pricing it. To kind of answer your question generally, it is still a small part of our business, especially around the personal auto line of business, but we do believe it will grow, it will become the approach for rating going forward. Now, I think your second question was a little bit about competitive advantage. We have some very unique and exclusive rule [ph] arrangements with, a, the OEMs. But more importantly, we feel that our data being at the center of those OEMs and all the insurers that we know so well and we are integrated with creates a unique relationship where they come to us once as opposed to integrate many times. We are trying to extend then out - that information out beyond what I'll refer to as just the car manufacturers. But I think that hopefully, describes to you a little bit about what we do and how we do it really more focused on insurance than some of these other telematic solutions that are extending beyond insurance and trying to provide to - marketing and other verticals. Yeah. You can't see me, but I have a smile on my face, only here a little bit about that. First of all, what we're doing in Life is led by that acquisition of FAST, which is this, I'll call it, low-code, no-code solution for life insurers. What we've added is a bit of relationship and some analytics to the underwriting approach, so things like understanding from your voice, whether you're a smoker, those are the type of things that we've added and the Life business in whole has done exceptionally well. We probably are not talking about it quite as much is because we typically focus a little bit on organic revenue growth. So, I look forward to having some conversations probably in first quarter of next year when we become a little bit become an organic part of our math. Separately, distinctly, when we talk about the resurgence and the great growth at [indiscernible] ISO our underwriting business, we've had a very stable and strong business as it relates to our historic loss culturals [ph] and forms. But the growth that you're seeing in most part is driven by just LightSpeed conscious. It is taking a lot of data, not just our own proprietary data, but that in combination with other third-parties scoring it so that we have a confidence level, so that as opposed to doing first a quote, providing that rate to potential policyholder, they like it and they need to - and they're underwriting to understand if there is any other accidents, moving violations, traffic. Typically 33% of the time that rate changes. That's very, very much. And inventory attracted to the policyholder not the digital engagement looking for. So a bindable quote is really the heart of what has driven a lot of our underwriting and rating growth over the last year and we are doing more and we are extending kind of, I'll call it, from an investment perspective doubling down as we speak."

This call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After today's prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.\nStacey Jill Brodbar - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our third quarter 2020 financial results. Today's call will be led by Scott Stephenson, Verisk's Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, who will provide an overview of our business. Lee Shavel, Chief Financial Officer, will follow with the financial review. Mark Anquillare, Verisk's Chief Operating Officer, will join the team for THE Q&A session. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investor section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance, including but not limited to the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. And now I'll turn the call over to Scott.\nScott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thanks, Stacey, and good day, everyone. I'm glad to be with you today and certainly hope you and your families continue to stay safe and are well in this moment. At Verisk, we continue to focus on our key priorities to build long-term shareholder value, delivering for our customers through innovation and service while also protecting the health and well-being of our teammates around the globe. To that end, the majority of our offices continue to operate in a Phase 1 format and are available for those employees who have volunteered to work from the office. Our Global Protection Services team closely monitors directives from local governments and public health officials around the world and makes real-time decisions to maintain the safety of our people. Over the duration of the pandemic, our teams have proven they can transition efficiently into different work modes with minimal interruption in service to our customers. So while there remains much uncertainty around the pandemic, I have complete confidence that our 9,000-plus teammates at Verisk will navigate through these times effectively and deliver the highest value to our customers as we have in 2020. During the third quarter, our business performed solidly, posting sequential growth from the second quarter in both our subscription and transactional revenues. In addition, we saw improvement in the year over growth rates of both our non-COVID-sensitive and COVID-sensitive revenues. During the quarter, we kept a keen eye on cost by pacing head count growth, while also benefiting from the responsiveness of our compensation structure and lower travel expenses. That said, we continued to fully fund investment in our business, including our innovation agenda and the modernization of our computing infrastructure through cloud migration, tokenization of key data assets and the development of cutting-edge data fabric to underlie our analytics solutions. The net result was strong organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth and margin expansion. Lee will provide more details on our performance in his financial review. During the third quarter, we advanced our innovation agenda with the release of new solutions across our verticals. In Insurance, we expanded the Verisk Data Exchange with the addition of Ford Motor Company. Owners of Ford and Lincoln vehicles will soon be able to easily access usage-based insurance programs for many of the US auto insurers that connect to the exchange. The Verisk Data Exchange employs advanced proprietary analytics to refine driving telemetry from connected vehicles into normalized, easy-to-use, insurance-ready information, including our rating and scoring solutions. We're excited to have Ford as part of the exchange and believe their addition will help our insurance customers expand their usage-based insurance programs. At FAST, we are very pleased with the success we are having, extending and accelerating the adoption of FAST's solutions across our broad customer base. Since we acquired FAST in December, we have seen leading life insurers including Amica, Kansas City Life, Lincoln Heritage and Financial and Pacific Life license FAST's SaaS-based software to enable their digital transformation and become more automated and efficient. Finally, in our repair cost estimating solutions, we have launched XactAnalysis Insights, a new add-on feature to our core XactAnalysis platform. This tool uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to create interactive and customizable dashboards that enable our customers with a more holistic view of their claims data. We believe XactAnalysis Insights should help our customers to work more efficiently and effectively as they can more quickly identify trends in their data. In Energy and Specialized Markets, we continue to make advances with our differentiated analytic platform called Lens and recently released the upstream portfolio optimization module. We are on track and on budget for further releases by year-end, namely in the areas of power and renewables and upstream carbon emissions. Despite the softness in the energy end market, we continue to see increased demand from our customers for our Lens platform, where our investment has delivered value for our clients and is reflected in increasing contract values and deeper integration into our customers' workflows. In Financial Services, we launched Merchant Tracker, a unique solution that allows businesses to better understand where consumers are spending and how their sales compare to other merchants. This solution enables business leaders to benchmark themselves on a weekly basis across metrics including sales and market share versus other named merchants down to the zip code level. The data can also differentiate between physical and online sales. Merchant Tracker built upon the COVID-19 consumer spending dashboard that we developed in March to help our customers navigate through the early stages of the pandemic. Merchant Tracker is an example of how we are creating new commercial opportunities from the disruption of the pandemic while also delivering for our customers. On the sales front, our teams have fully embraced digital engagement, and outreach to our customers continues to be robust. We are experiencing increases in call volume in the 60%-plus range, and continue to benefit from the availability of customers who are still working from home. We recently hosted Verisk Velocity, our signature conference for underwriting and rating, as a fully virtual event this year. The digital format allowed us to expand the concept to feature more industry speakers and to create on-demand access so customers could watch sessions they were interested in at their convenience. The event focused on accelerating the future of insurance and included sessions on the latest emerging issues, including the digitization of insurance, lessons learned from COVID-19, cyber insurance and ransomware, millennials and insurance, social inflation and what it means for insurance, and combating racism with ethical artificial intelligence. We had over 1,900 people register for the conference, which was more than four times larger than our in-person event last year, and those numbers continue to grow as customers are still accessing the on-demand content. Additionally, we experienced improved representation from our global clients as well as deeper penetration into our customers as we saw more people per account in attendance. Overall, this event was a great success and really reinforces Verisk's position as a thought leader in the industry and a partner for our customers. Taken together, all this activity has created increased numbers of sales leads and growing sales pipelines as we partner with our customers to help them become more digitally engaged and connected. We continue to experience the modestly longer sales cycle relative to historic norms that we discussed last quarter, and are managing this carefully. Putting the customer first is one of the guiding principles at Verisk, and improving our customer experience is a key focus for everyone across the organization. I'm very pleased to share with you that we recently achieved our highest Net Promoter Score in the company's history, a score of 50. This is an improvement of six points from last year, which was our then peak score, and reflects an increase in our investment in what we call our Customer-First Program, a solution set of customer experience data, analytic tools and cultural drivers. Our nearly 40 frontline teams across the organization listened to the voice of our customers, helping us to observe what is important and creating action plans to drive customer value and improve customer loyalty. The meaningful insights we glean from these day-to-day customer interactions and from our growing customer experience analytical capabilities helps us improve our solutions, highlight important trends across solutions and businesses and alert us to problems. In the COVID moments, putting the customer first is needed more than ever, and our teams across all verticals have stepped up in unique ways to support them. On the sustainability front, we continue to make progress on our plan. For the third consecutive year, investments in renewable energy certificates and carbon offsets helped balance 100% of Verisk's CDP-reported scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. While we've implemented many important energy-saving initiatives during the recent past, investing in renewable energy certificates is a practical option for a company of our size that leases all of its office space. Taken together with carbon offsets, the investments represent an immediate step forward, balancing Verisk's greenhouse gas emissions for the near-term to a degree that the company could never achieve otherwise. In fact, based on CDP's scope 1 and 2 revenue-based intensity calculation, our 2019 emissions are more than 15% lower now than when we first measured emissions five years ago. Finally, I'd like to publicly welcome General Vincent Brooks to our board of directors. General Brooks joined our board on October 1 and brings with him more than four decades of leadership experience in some of the world's most complex and challenging situations. General Brooks served in the US Army for 42 years from his entry into West Point until his 2019 retirement as a four-star general. Most recently, General Brooks was in command of all US forces in Korea, where he concurrently led the United Nations Command and the Republic of Korea-US Combined Forces Command, which was comprised of more than 650,000 Korean and American soldiers. I'm confident that as a member of our Board of Directors, General Brooks will reinforce Verisk's culture of operational excellence, and his experience and guidance will be instrumental as we work in complex global-scale environments. General Brooks becomes the fourth new director to our board in the past four years. So now let me turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results.\nLee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thank you, Scott. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. Moving to the financial results for the third quarter, on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 7.6% to $703 million. While net income and earnings per share increases reflected a $125 million litigation reserve and $29 million acquisition-related earn-out expense in the prior period that did not reoccur. Moving to our organic constant currency results, adjusted for non-operating items, as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, we are very pleased with our operating results, considering the impact from COVID-19. Normalized for the $8 million revenue impact of the injunction on roof measurement solutions, organic constant currency grew 4.9%. The third quarter 2020 was the final quarter of any material organic impact from the injunction. In the third quarter, our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, as we defined last quarter, grew approximately 7.8% on an organic constant currency basis and normalized for the injunction, which was an improvement from the 6.5% growth in the second quarter. This sustained growth in our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, representing approximately 85% of our total revenues, reflects the durability and resilience of our primarily subscription-based business model. We did continue to experience, as we did in the prior quarter, a negative impact from COVID-19 on certain of our products and services, largely transactional in nature, which represent the balance or approximately 15% of our consolidated revenues. These COVID-sensitive revenues declined approximately 10% on an organic constant currency basis during the third quarter, which was an improvement from the 20% decline in the second quarter and reflects improvements in all three of our segments, as the underlying causal impacts began to diminish and some of the pressure on our revenues abated, though the pace of the recovery varies across the solutions. For example, we have seen a rebound in our commercial underwriting surveys as our field staff is now allowed to enter buildings. And we have also seen improvements in trends across personal auto. On the energy side, we have seen a more modest improvement as CapEx budgets at our customers continue to be under pressure, affecting our consulting business. Despite the impact on revenue in the third quarter, we are pleased to report that we delivered strong EBITDA growth and expanded margins as the result of effective expense and head count management. Organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth, normalized for the injunction, was 17.7% in the third quarter. Total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic revenue and adjusted EBITDA, was 52.1% in the quarter, representing strong leverage across the business. This margin level includes roughly 140 basis points of benefit from lower travel expenses, but also reflects substantial investment in our business and infrastructure, including our cloud transition costs. On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis and normalized for the injunction. Insurance segment revenues increased 7%, reflecting healthy growth in our industry-standard insurance programs, catastrophe modeling solutions and repair cost estimating solutions. We experienced a modest benefit from storm-related revenues as a result of a more normal hurricane season in 2020 as compared to the very slow season in 2019. This was offset in part by a decline in certain transactional revenues that were negatively impacted by COVID-19. Adjusted EBITDA grew 19.8% in the third quarter, demonstrating strong margin expansion despite certain revenue declines and investment in our breakout areas. Energy and Specialized Markets revenue decreased 1% in the third quarter due to declines in consulting and implementation projects. We were very pleased to see continued growth in our subscription-based core research and data analytic platforms, environmental health and safety service solutions and weather analytics solutions, resulting in outperformance relative to the end market. We believe our strong performance is a function of the criticality of our solutions, the diversification of our revenue streams into breakout areas like the energy transition practice, and the strength of our relationships in the industry. Despite the revenue declines, adjusted EBITDA grew 10.7% in the third quarter, driven by strong operational controls and modest actions taken during the second quarter to reduce head count to be more balanced with the current level of consulting work. We continue to closely monitor and partner with our energy customers as they navigate through this tough operating environment with a particular focus on consolidation in the upstream space. We have a track record of managing through these times effectively. Additionally, we now have the tools to capitalize on the commercial opportunity that consolidation brings through our cost intelligence solutions, which utilize our proprietary data assets to help identify cost-saving opportunities and reduce spending for these companies. Financial Services revenue increased 1.6% in the quarter driven by growth in subscription revenues. This was offset in part by declines in our spend informed analytics solutions stemming from COVID-19, and reduced levels of advertising. We continue to focus on building a more stable and a recurring revenue base for this business. Adjusted EBITDA increased 3.7% for the quarter, reflecting cost discipline. Total adjusted EBITDA margins declined in the quarter as a result of portfolio actions we closed earlier in the year. Our reported effective tax rate was 22.6% for the quarter compared to 15.5% in the prior year quarter. The quarterly rate came in lower than our expectations, owing to increased levels of stock option exercise, which depend on personal employee decisions and the Verisk stock price. Looking forward, we now expect that our full year tax rate for 2020 will be between 20% and 22%. Adjusted net income was $218 million and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.32 for the third quarter of 2020, up 17.2% and 17.9% from the prior year, respectively. These increases reflect solid top line growth, cost discipline in the business, a reduction in travel expenses as a result of COVID-19, and a lower average share count. Net cash provided by operating activities was $207 million for the quarter, down 3% from the prior year period primarily due to a deferral of federal income tax payment under the CARES Act from the second quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2020, partially offset by the deferral of certain employer payroll taxes as well as higher customer collections and a reduction in travel payments as a result of COVID-19. Capital expenditures were $65 million for the quarter, up 6.8% from the prior year period. CapEx represented 9.2% of total revenues in the quarter, reflecting some leasehold improvement expenditures associated with our office consolidations in Boston and London. We continue to expect capital expenditures to decline as a percentage of revenues. For 2020, we expect CapEx to be in the previously provided range of $215 million to $270 million, as investing in our business and our people continues to be our highest priority. Related to CapEx, we continue to expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization to be within the range of $185 million to $195 million and intangible amortization to be approximately $165 million in 2020. During the third quarter, we returned $94 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. And I'm pleased to report that our Board of Directors has approved a $0.27 per share dividend for the fourth quarter to be paid in December. I also want to note progress with the integration and sales momentum of our recent acquisitions, including FAST, BuildFax and Genscape. On the revenue side, while still early, we are seeing success selling these solutions into our broad customer base and are innovating new products and enhancing existing ones by incorporating the data sets into our solutions. On the cost side, we are experiencing synergies consistent with our expectations at the time of the deals as integrations are moving smoothly. We're monitoring these acquisitions carefully and supporting the management teams to ensure that we are generating a solid return on invested capital. As we detailed last quarter, we continue to believe that the collective causal factors from COVID-19 represent pressure on achieving our 7% long-term growth objective in 2020. However, we remain confident they do not represent a structural change in our fundamental growth drivers and believe that as the underlying causal factors abate, we will show strong resilience in recovery. Each of these causal factors has its own recovery curve, making it difficult to predict the duration of the impacts to our revenue growth. We continue to have confidence in our ability to manage the cost structure effectively, and deliver operating leverage while also continuing to invest in our innovation agenda. While we restrict head count growth at the outset of the pandemic, with improving revenue dynamics, more recently, we have begun to partially release deferred hiring restrictions. That said, we are watching the environment carefully and will calibrate head count growth accordingly to protect profitability. Taking this all together, we continue to believe that the stability of our subscription revenues, along with our core operating leverage, driven by the responsiveness of our compensation structure and cost discipline, will continue to support revenue and EBITDA growth in 2020. We hope this provides some useful context for you and we look forward to addressing your questions. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nToni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. Your insurance margins have been exceptionally strong this year, and I know you've talked about T&E savings and comp, et cetera. Should we be thinking of 2019 as the normal baseline year and you'll expand from there? Or has there been a permanent step-up this year if you take out some of the temporary COVID impacts? Maybe you could go through some of what you saw this quarter to just help us think about what a normal baseline looks like.\nLee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you, Toni. Appreciate the question. And, as always, when we talk about margins across the enterprise as a whole and even just within the Insurance segment, there were a lot of factors that are going into this. I think if we can think about it on one level in the third quarter, the exceptional margin expansion was a function of, in part, the COVID-19 environment, meaning that we did see a larger reduction in expenses owing to travel and entertainment and some compensation costs relative to the revenue growth chain. So that was certainly an element that contributed. Our view is that there may be some permanent benefits from that as we look at the way we orient our, or size our travel and entertainment activities. There may be some permanent benefits in terms of longer term real estate expense savings. And so I think that there is some permanent element of that that we achieved. So that's kind of the COVID dimension. There is another dimension in the margins in Insurance which reflect the contribution of our aerial imagery business, the Geomni business to Vexcel. And so there was a substantial reduction in expenses and, if you will, EBITDA margin benefit from that transaction. That did represent a permanent improvement across Insurance as a whole, and so that is certainly a, what we would expect is a permanent benefit. I think those are the larger pieces. We also had in the quarter, particularly some particular strength in our AIR catastrophe modeling business that was helpful with some stronger transactional revenue, and some other business related things. The storm revenue in the claims business probably also boosted margin a little bit higher. But I think your thesis is correct. There are some permanent elements to that. We're going to try to manage the recovery of expenses, particularly T&E and head count through the recovery here in a way to continue to allow that operating leverage to be reflected to it. But there are going to be some permanent benefits. Hopefully that captures it. I do think I want to end by saying that I think looking at 2019 is a legitimate reference point. We do think that the levels that we will achieve in 2020 reflect some exceptional benefits, but we will be looking at our margins I think in 2021 relative to 2019 as a more normalized base.\nToni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Very helpful. And then for my follow-up, wanted to ask about Energy. The organic growth improved versus second quarter despite the really difficult comp. Obviously COVID has probably moderated a little bit, but the CapEx spending in the energy industry is still tough, as you've mentioned. Just help us out with how you're thinking about whether you could see growth in that segment in 2021 just given that 2020 was so challenging. Just talk about how you see Energy playing out.\nLee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Sure. So, Toni, the way that I would approach it is first with regard to the Wood Mackenzie component of that, we are experiencing two dimensions. One of course, the consulting element, where, from a COVID-sensitive perspective, and the challenges that the industry is facing, that's where we're feeling the pressure as reflected in the COVID-sensitive revenues. And so it's difficult to predict how that Energy sector will continue to experience that and reflect it. So I think we're expecting some level of that to persist into 2021. On the subscription side, I think as we said, we've continued to see growth in that portion of the business. That has been bolstered by the investment that we've made in Lens and the perceived quality of that product platform and our ability to continue to grow subscription levels. There are some impacts from consolidation within the industry that will have a negative impact going into 2021. But we still expect, from an organic standpoint, to see contributions to growth from that. The other element is going to be in our PowerAdvocate business. 2020 reflected a transition from a great 2019 where we have a lot of new projects and implementation revenue that came out as we moved to more subscription revenue for some of those pieces. We do think the contribution in 2020 from that business will be stronger in 2021 as they have rebuilt the pipeline and that should continue to grow as well. So I will end by saying, we continue over the long term to believe that the entire Energy and Specialized Markets component of the business has the potential to deliver growth, consistent with our organic constant currency growth targets of 7%. That will vary from year-to-year. We're obviously experiencing pressures within this environment. But we do believe that the business as a whole can deliver on that.\nScott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: And, Lee, I just want to make a general point around that specific point, and Toni, good to hear from you. So, we can always observe the relative impact of the macro environment at any given moment, which I think is the basis of your question, and there is some impact, as Lee was talking. But another thing which is true about our business and I wanted to make this point, and it actually relates to everything we do, is that we consistently grow faster than the underlying markets that we serve. And the reason is a combination of what it is we do, which is fundamentally helping them become more data analytic, which is the direction of travel anyway, and actually in the COVID moment, many companies really, really have discovered their need to accelerate their rates of digitization and deepen their data analytics. So that's the first point. The second point is the rate at which we grow is really going to be strongly a function of how much value and increased value we're able to bring to our customers. So there is definitely a relationship to the macro environment, no question about it. But what I wanted to emphasize was, we always feel that we have the opportunity to increase the value that we bring to our customers. And that does get reflected in how much of their increased value they share with us, even in a relatively difficult market. That's kind of the underlying story of Verisk, actually.\nToni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's great. Thanks very much.\nStacey Jill Brodbar - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAndrew C. Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, Lee. I wanted to jump more into the third quarter margins, both a question on T&E and incentive compensation. Are you able to call out the temporary margin benefit for cash incentive compensation during COVID \u2013 this is for the third quarter \u2013 like you did for the second quarter? I think there was a 100-basis-point figure back in the second quarter. And then the second part of my question is when thinking about the 140 basis points of benefit that you've called out to the third quarter from T&E, is there a sense with the company that sales productivity has been strong enough that you could quantify how much of that 140 basis points of benefit in the third quarter will remain an ongoing benefit, meaning not as much travel will rebound even post COVID?\nLee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thanks, Andrew. So, first to answer the first part of your question, we estimate that the impact of incentive compensation change was about 40 basis points relative to the 140 basis points of T&E benefit. And that's just looking at the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. So that would be I think the number that you were looking for on the compensation front. With regard to your second question, I would say it's still too early for us to associate the productivity on the sales side, which Scott described and I think we're all very pleased with, to how we calibrate our T&E expectations looking ahead. I think there are two levels. One, from a financial perspective, we obviously want to manage that in a way that we continue to see the operating leverage within the business. But the other dimension, and clearly the more important dimension, is what do we want to see from our customers, and to what degree is it important to them that we're engaged with them face to face. This is a business where we think that we benefit from that. We're obviously doing well within this environment and that productivity is up, but at the end of the day, we need to make certain that we are interacting with our clients in the way that is most effective for them and for us. So, we'll follow their lead. I do think that that's going to be a gradual process and we'll have the ability to calibrate that, but that would be the way I would say we are thinking about it, and it's too early for us to quantify or define what we think the permanent, potential permanent benefit from the T&E perspective is.\nAndrew C. Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Right. But you do think when you quantify it, it will be material. You're just not ready to quantify it yet, Lee.\nLee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. Well, I mean, I think there's a certain unknowable quality to it. I think we'll know it when we see it kind of experienced over time. As Toni indicated, kind of looking at over a period of time, perhaps as we look at travel and entertainment as a percentage of our revenues, maybe in one way for us to gauge it. But I think it's undeniable that, having been through this experience, that we have the scope to think about the degree to which we're spending on that relative to revenues and/or have other ways and more efficient means to interact with our customers. But it will be something that we're tracking and hence, by tracking, be able to manage more effectively.\nScott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: And maybe a word of context around that, which is we are actually, right now, in the early stages of envisioning what will our physical plant look like over longer periods of time. And I'm certain that all of our customers are doing the same thing. And so in the future state, that person, she or he, that one of our people needs to encounter in a deep way, where will they be? I mean in the same way that we are considering exactly how dense our physical space \u2013 we will definitely have physical space, but how dense will it be? Where will it be? We're asking those questions right now. Our customers are as well. So I think Lee's answer is exactly correct because we can't presume on the decisions that our customers are going to make. And yet we will want to encounter them deeply. They will want to encounter us deeply. And so we're just going to figure it out with them, basically. But that will emerge over time.\nLee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thank you, Andrew.\nAndrew C. Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS. Your line is open.\nAlex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: Yeah, hey. Good morning, everyone. You mentioned in your prepared remarks some comment \u2013 you made some comments on digitization. I think you just brought it up again to Toni's question. Can you go a little bit deeper in terms of what you're hearing from your clients, specifically how COVID has maybe changed their appetite to revisit their processes? And what areas there may be the most new demand for products or digitizing total processes and, obviously, how you can help as this post-COVID world plays out? I know that's a loaded question.\nScott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. No, thanks, Alex. Mark, you want to make some observations from the insurance world?\nMark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah, absolutely. Thanks for the question. I think what we're all saying is that our customers need to make sure they operate as effectively in this post-COVID world as they did in the past. And that digital engagement with their policyholders is hugely important, whether that's on the underwriting side or on the claims side. So the things that we've seen become kind of very important to insurers is some of the things we've talked about in the past. So to the extent you're thinking about adjudicating a claim, we have a tool that we gave away free during the pandemic, at least the early stages. And what it does is it allows that adjuster to sit at his desk and do a desktop adjustment, meaning actually adjudicate a claim by interacting with the policyholder, taking pictures, taking videos, taking that measurement from inside those pictures and developing repair cost estimates so that the contractor can get out and fix the property at the same time the policyholder gets the payment from or the contractor gets the payment from the (00:37:43). On the underwriting side, very similarly, we have tools that have helped them digitally engage. If you're going to go underwrite a commercial building or a very high-value home, you want to go out and see it. Now that's difficult. And what I think key is all of these insurers attempting to do that from their desktop, interact with the policyholders and have them walk around the home or walk around the property. And finally, it takes a form of automation, right? People are looking to automate that co-process. So anything we can do, we refer to it as LightSpeed, to bring all that data forward so that they're able to quickly and efficiently provide a quote using public information, using proprietary information. That is the digital engagement that we're experiencing. And I think what we'd like to say is a lot of our insurance companies are trying to become a better digital form of themselves. So this time has kind of spurred some investment in IT so that they can be there in the advent (00:38:36).\nAlex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Very good. Thanks. And then just a quick one, just following up on the energy question earlier, I think you answered more about 2021. But can you give us a little bit more near-term outlook here? I think you said, obviously, there's consolidation. There are also \u2013 I think bankruptcies are just starting to happen. Is there a likelihood that things get worse before they get better? Or how do you see the near term from there?\nScott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Well, the point I think to really bear in mind here is the nature of our business in the energy space. Just even a few years ago, something on the order of 70% of our revenue was related to the upstream part of the hydrocarbon wing of the energy ecosystem. Now it's less than 50%. And most of what we do there is with the integrated globals or with the national oil companies in the hydrocarbon space as well as the financial services sector that finances and does deals with those kinds of folks. Our exposure to Lower 48 unconventionals, which is the part of the market that has really been affected, and when you referenced bankruptcies, for example, is actually quite low. It's never been a large part of our mix. And so, actually, we're fairly insulated from those kinds of effects. So you're right, Alex, those things \u2013 some of those trends are going on right now, but I would encourage you to lay over that the actual structure of our business, which tends to be more immune to some of those effects. And there are also compensating effects in other parts of the supply chain. So, as you know, we have a very nice footprint in the petrochemicals world. At the moment, petrochemicals players are benefiting from the fact that feedstocks are cheap.\nAlex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: Fair enough there. Thank you.\nScott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: There are puts and takes.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. Your line is open.\nAndrew Nicholas - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. good morning. I was hoping you could provide an update on the cloud transition work you're doing right now. Or are there any milestones you can point to that can give us a sense for some of the incremental progress there of late? And maybe comment on where you are in terms of realizing the cost benefits from that work.\nScott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: So we're plowing ahead. And there are multiple work streams inside. So part of it is actually sort of grooving the pathways and hardening the pathways and ensuring security as we rotate things into the cloud. But another part of it is the migration of our footprint away from premise computing, and especially the mainframe. So we're at work. We're in the middle of it right now. The work will proceed faster than the visible cost benefit associated with what we're doing. It's just the nature of the thing. The cloud spending, for example, is a linear function. And premise spending is more of a sort of \u2013 you sort of take shelfs of spending down, but you have to reach points where that has occurred. And I would say that we are well along. And we've talked before about the fact that mainframe migration, for example, is a couple of years. And so I have kind of like a two-year horizon on when we can say we are fundamentally done or close to done with mainframe migration. So that's where we are. The rate at which we will get the cost benefit of that will emerge kind of as a trailing function. And this is what we've said about it all along. Actually, I hope that those of you that have been with us for a while have noted, we've been making these investments for quite some time. They're all baked into our P&L. It's not like we have to declare some special project. We're just \u2013 this is what we do, and this is what we were doing. So, anyway, so a couple of years is sort of the window for technical migration, and the rate at which the cost benefits sort of layer in will sort of be a trailing function. They will express themselves in the intermediate period but even more after we have achieved the technical migration.\nLee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: And Andrew, one thing I just want to add to Scott's comments, kind of two things. One, just to kind of address the broad question, I'd say there's no material cost benefit that we've realized at this point in the process because we are still in the \u2013 bringing the cloud costs in. And we are in the process, as Scott has described, of stepping down that on-premises cost over time. We believe that \u2013 and that's more a function of the phasing of this. And we're dealing with hundreds of data sets that have to be re-migrated, power has to be migrated, applications that have to be re-coded. But we will achieve those savings over time. So there's nothing, I think, material in the margin. The second point that I want to make is there's also a revenue benefit. And I will tell you that the thing that we're probably most excited is getting these data sets into the cloud, substantiating the data fabric that we are building across the enterprise. And our ability to innovate, associate data sets and create new platforms and analytics of commercial value is indisputably enhanced by that. So I think we are seeing some of the benefits of that on the new product development side that we're excited about commercializing.\nAndrew Nicholas - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. That's really helpful. And then switching gears a little bit, in Financial Services, obviously, transaction revenues are a bit challenged near-term, but it looks like subscription revenue has ticked higher each quarter throughout this year. So I was hoping you could speak to where you're seeing the most momentum in that business. Thank you.\nScott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah, it's really broadly based. I think we've described to you in the past that we have multiple categories of solutions. Lee called out that, at the moment, spend-informed analytics, which does relate to folks that are trying to promote their products, and therefore, ultimately things like advertising. That has been feeling the effects of the COVID moment so we called that one out. But all the other things that we do are a part of the overall results that we shared with you.\nLee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. I think that's true. There isn't anything that I would call out specifically. I think it has been fairly broad-based on the subscription side.\nAndrew Nicholas - William Blair & Co. LLC: Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDavid Chu - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, thanks. This is David Chu for Gary. So you highlighted lower T&E costs with short-term comp as part of that T&E benefit. So just wondering if you can speak to the level of overall underlying margin expansion improvement ex these potential short-term benefits, and also wondering if there was any benefit from equity grant timing in the quarter.\nLee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thanks. So the short answer is, even when we exclude the T&E benefit, we are still seeing operating margin expansion. So when we look at our overall improvement in margin, the T&E and the incentive compensation benefit in the third quarter was some but not all of that. So we are very pleased to see that that operating leverage in this environment, even absent those savings, is still expressing itself. And that's before we take into account the non-organic or the M&A related impact. So within the core business, we're seeing that. But also in our breakouts, we're seeing a contribution from improved operating leverage within those businesses. But I think your question went to the key element, is the T&E and the incentive comp impact greater than the overall level? No, it's just \u2013 it's a component, and we're actually having operating leverage beneath that.\nDavid Chu - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. And then just in terms of the improvement in transactional revenue being down 10% versus 20% last quarter, can you just dive into that a bit more? Just what are the biggest drivers of improvement? I think you spoke to it a bit, but just where are things lagging still?\nLee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: I would say that where we are seeing recovery, and you will \u2013 if you go back in the script, you'll see some comments around our survey \u2013 our commercial lines survey business where we have seen improvement. Part of that is access to the buildings. We've also seen an improvement on the personal lines, or the personal auto segment because with greater driving activity, we're seeing a benefit to that in some of our transactional businesses. Those are probably the largest components. We continue to see the pressure probably unchanged in more of the consulting businesses that we've seen. And also, of course, travel remains extremely restricted, and so we're not seeing any material benefit on that front. So that hopefully gives you some compositional color on those changes.\nDavid Chu - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is open.\nManav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, guys. I wanted to focus more on the InsureTech, I guess, update from your perspective. We've obviously had a few of them go public this year already. And I was just curious, from your perspective, how things are going there. I know in the past you gave us some win rates and stats. I don't know if you have any updates there as well.\nScott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. Manav, it was really hard to hear you. I think you were asking about InsureTech and maybe you gave us kind of an environmental question about sort of what's going there or perhaps also its intersection with us. Mark, do you \u2013 assuming that that was your question, I (00:49:28).\nManav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah, that's correct, yes.\nScott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Okay. All right. Mark, do you want to maybe kick off on that?\nMark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Sure. So obviously, it's a very robust market for anyone with a (00:49:37) IPO from the InsureTech world looking to underwrite risk. And I think like many people, there are InsureTechs that are aggressively looking to explore that IPO opportunity. The good news about that is the way these InsureTechs seem to be attractive to the market is because of the tech play, the automation, the way they go about things in the non-traditional sense. And I think what we have been fortunate to be a part of is, as these new InsureTechs come to market, whether initially as a managing general agent, where they don't actually underwrite the risk but they select it, or a full-blown underwriting insurer, they have looked to us for data analytics information as a part of that trail. So we have benefited from the InsureTech world as it relates to those insurance companies. And some of the biggest ones that are in market or those that are coming to market behind the scenes are quite effectively using a full suite of Verisk solutions. So I feel like we're great partners to those InsureTechs. I think the other part of the question that you have, and I don't want to be overly exhaustive, but there's also InsureTechs that are providing services. And those InsureTechs that are providing services in part compete against us. And those businesses clearly have (00:51:10) enhance and increase the views, the awareness of insurers of alternate sources of doing business. And I think the combination of a little bit of competition, which always makes us better, but also the fact that now insurers are hearing that message, they're probably a little more open and interested to talk about our solutions and opportunities there. So I hope, Manav without really hearing your question, that was hopefully, what you were looking for.\nLee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: And Manav, I want to add one thing, building off of Mark's comments on the competition dynamic. And he was describing it with regard to other InsureTechs that provide services to us. You know, on the former point in terms of the new entrants, the secondary benefit, and frankly, in some ways, potentially even the more significant benefit, is that that competitive pressure of new approaches to the insurance industry, it puts more pressure on some of the traditional players that are looking to address and respond to that. And so for instance, in our LightSpeed product, I think the LightSpeed product where we've had great success is in many ways a competitive response to other new markets that are out there. So it's serving to, I think, lift the industry as a whole apart from kind of that purely incremental amount of revenue that we get from those new entrants.\nManav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah, that's helpful. Thank you. That's what I was going at. And for my second question, hopefully you can hear me. But the breakout areas, some of them that you've talked about in the past might have already broken out. But just what are some of the key ones we should be keeping an eye on in terms of where the investments are going in to-date?\nScott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Well, I would just highlight, sort of at a kind of high-thematic level. The businesses that we have, which are very much sort of SaaS-powered business models, are doing very well. And those show up in multiple parts of our business. And in general, the more that we lean into, as we are, what we refer to as platform analytic environments, the better basically. And there are development cycles associated with those, but when you get to the place where you are the environment, where your customer finds it productive to do their work, that's a really, really powerful place to be. And that's a theme which spans much of our company today and all the verticals.\nManav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of George Tong for Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nUnknown Speaker: Hi. Thanks. You have Ryan (00:54:01) on for George today. So, you had mentioned earlier that you're able to outgrow your end markets due to the increased value you bring to customers. I was just wondering if you've seen any impact to pricing in the current environment. And if so, which segments are pulling back the most? And then also, could you remind me what lift to organic growth that pricing tends to provide in a given year?\nScott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. So let's see, in reverse order, you should think of pricing as sort of a GNP-ish kind of a number sort of, inside of what it is that we do. I don't really think that there have been differential effects, in different parts of \u2013 I think your question was at the level of verticals. I don't really think there have been differential effects. I would go back to what Lee cited before, which is services is the place where, when the economy softens, there tends to be a softening, and so, kind of that as a category. But in terms of licensed solutions, I wouldn't make sharp distinctions across the verticals. Lee, I don't know if you would see it any differently. But doesn't feel that way.\nLee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: No. I agree.\nScott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: To me. And then the way that we think about pricing our solutions, and we've tried to be very deliberate about separating COVID-sensitive and non-COVID-sensitive revenues. You've heard our report in terms of the non-COVID-sensitive, which tend to essentially be licensable, subscription-based kinds of solutions. And we talked about slightly, modestly longer sales cycles. But in terms of the terms that we're striking with our customers, I have not picked up any signals that there's any real change there.\nLee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: I think maybe the question that you were asking and making reference, as we get in the text, COVID was focused on the Energy and Specialized Markets performance relative to the end market. And the one area that I would point out, it was with reference to the Lens platform. And there, I think it is a microcosm of where we are adding substantial value to the customer in this environment. And that's enabling us to secure larger contract values, because of the value that we're delivering into that end market. And I think that, in a way, is what's powering us to outperform the end market as a function of the value that we're creating there. And I think there are other instances of that. That's a, I think, the investment and the return dynamic which is I think a separate answer than the point of view that Scott expressed, which I agree with in terms of differential on the segments.\nUnknown Speaker: Great. Thanks. And then for my follow-up, I know the \u2013 I was hoping to get an update on the Geomni situation. I understand that the injunction was supposed to lap for their revenue impact in 3Q essentially. But you'd previously discussed some other options to continue pursuing Aerial Imagery, such as commercial licensing even with EagleView. And I was just wondering if there was any other options that, or things that are looking more realistic to you at this point.\nMark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thanks for the question. This is Mark. So, first of all, we continue to explore our legal options with regard to roof measurements. As well, you probably referenced earlier, what we did was we kind of moved a lot of our image capture to Vexcel. What that allows, and to just emphasize the importance of that is, what's expensive and what's very important is coverage, right? And coverage not only in what geographies you have, but how frequently you refresh that. So with a combined source of image capture, we are now able to, better than anyone else, cover the United States and cover the United States frequently and go international. With that inventory, we have put together some solutions for underwriting purposes, which represent things about the outside of the building, physical structures, pool, things like that as well as ways to go about looking at claims and triaging claims after an event, a catastrophe as an example or extreme weather. And we've taken some of that inventory and we've moved it over into the energy space and ways we go about helping energy companies do things around their assets and their physical network. So what hopefully you hear is we've tried to leverage and gain scale on image capture, while still doing the analytics. And that analytic approach is not just insurance. It's more broadly even into real estate, construction and other verticals here. So that has been our focus. But at this time, we are not able to provide roof measurements, which is the very important act or approach inside the claims space.\nUnknown Speaker: Great. Thanks for that.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is open.\nJeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. So sorry to beat the dead horse you've already tried to address four times. But \u2013 so I hear you that there's an extraordinary kind of margin benefit this year. So it sounds like a year-over-year step back in 2021, that makes sense. You referenced in one of your answers, Lee, that 2019 as a reference year to build off of. So it sounds like higher than 2019. Just want to make sure that I'm considering the appropriate building blocks. So, I guess, you referenced the Vexcel benefit, I guess, two years of some form of normalized margin expansion in the business and then only a partial return of T&E or some of the temporary cuts. So do I have the categories right? Anything that I'm missing? And can you quantify the Vexcel benefit for us? Thank you.\nLee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. So \u2013 and, Jeff, it was a little bit hard to hear the last one. The short answer is I think that you have the components correctly in the business. The variable is going to be the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business and the inherent unpredictability of that. We're certainly hopeful that we'll continue to see a return to a more normal environment. And in getting there, I think our hope is that we will be able to hang on to some of these elements of margin improvement that we saw, probably not all of them. We will need to travel and visit with clients. If we are performing better relative to our targets, then we should see our compensation structure adjust to that. But I think you have the components correctly. And I think all we want to do is highlight on some of those temporary impacts and then to begin to anticipate the return to a normal environment that we're going to try to manage. So I think that hopefully addresses the first part of your question. The second part of your question I just would ask you to repeat because it wasn't entirely clear to me, not that you weren't expressing it clearly, but I had a hard time hearing it.\nJeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: It was just if you could quantify the Vexcel benefit to margin.\nLee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: I can't. It's part \u2013 I can't because I think we view it as, this margin is reflective of the core underlying margin of the Insurance business. Vexcel \u2013 I'm sorry, the Geomni business, as we have discussed in the past, was a business that we were making a substantial investment in, that it was not contributing a positive margin as we were investing in it. Now without, you can kind of see the core element of the business. But we don't quantify that.\nJeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then on Lens, what percentage of the client base that it would be a good fit for have transitioned over to Lens at this point? I guess, roughly, what is the immediate price lift? And then maybe more importantly, how does it change the long-term interaction with the customer and revenue opportunity? Thanks.\nScott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: So, Jeff, if you were to understand Lens as \u2013 in sort of the Lens market space opportunity picture, basically, it's the product of all the different content families times all the accounts. And when you think of it that way, we're in a very early stage of our journey.\nJeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you.\nScott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nEmily McLaughlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hi. This is Emily McLaughlin on for Seth this morning. My first question, just building on an earlier one, can you talk about the monthly trends or the exit rates in the 15% of the business that's COVID-sensitive relative to the down 10% for the full quarter?\nLee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. So it's obviously just one month, I would say, that so far, based upon what we've seen, we're seeing similar year-over-year growth rates in the COVID-sensitive revenues and in the non-COVID-sensitive revenues. So I think that we \u2013 while certainly the third quarter demonstrated a sequential improvement relative to the second quarter, so far, and again, it's just into the start of this, we are perhaps seeing the impact of going into the winter season and some impacts of increased restrictions on a global basis that may create less opportunity for sequential improvement relative to the third quarter. That's kind of speculation. Nobody knows for certain. But at least looking at October, we're seeing kind of stable levels of year-over-year change in the non-COVID and the COVID-sensitive revenues.\nEmily McLaughlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Great. That's really helpful. And my second question, just a housekeeping one. Are you able to quantify how much the storm-related revenue contributed to the Insurance segment growth?\nLee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: No. It's not a significant enough number. On the margin, it was beneficial, but we aren't quantifying that.\nEmily McLaughlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Thanks very much for the time.\nLee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the lines of Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nHamzah Mazari - Jefferies LLC: Hey, good morning. Thank you so much. My first question is just on the international Insurance business. And my question really is, a number of years ago, I think at an Analyst Day, maybe it was 2017 or 2018, that business I think was $130 million. And we had talked about potentially doubling that business organically over the next five years. And so I know Rulebook and Sequel were powerful acquisitions to further penetrate international. I also know that AIR is pretty well penetrated, but maybe not certain other solution sets. So just any update on where that international business is today, how it's performed, where you think there's further opportunity.\nMark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: So thank you for the question. I do like talking about this topic. I think if you were to think about that presentation, and I appreciate you bringing it back to us. The UK was, in particular, a point of particular focus. And if you recall, we did a series of acquisitions. It brought a series of new products there. And I think that thesis has proven out wonderfully well. I think we are growing probably in excess of that plan. And we have definitely added to our growth rates in Insurance as a result of that international dimension. A couple things just to highlight, where I think we've been particularly effective. Sequel, Rulebook was and continues to be a wonderful acquisition, not just because of the solution set, but its ability from a technology perspective to integrate and weave together a lot of the various insurance solutions. So we have a more holistic and more interconnected set of solutions as a result of that acquisition. We also have some acquisitions that are in kind of the ISO world that really represent some of the things that we've done here, but it's sending it out. And that's about writing risk and pricing risk and understanding where risks are. So that, again, has been positive. I think the place that I continue to aspire is I would love to, and I think we would as a team, love to recreate some of the success we've had in the UK in other geographies. And finding the right mix of solutions and acquisitions although into European nations, that has been a little bit more of a challenge, but we continue to pursue that.\nHamzah Mazari - Jefferies LLC: That's very helpful. And just my follow-up question is just on Financial Services. And really the question really is, it seems like you've done a lot of work there from a few years ago where the transaction, or where the subscription piece was a lot smaller. It seemed like the customer base was much more concentrated to banks. Could you maybe contrast this business to where does it sit today? Is it pretty similar to the Energy and Insurance business? And how does it differ from the healthcare business that you've divested? Which, I guess that business became not very global in nature, and I guess the customer base became very concentrated towards the government. And so just big picture, is that business kind of fixed, for lack of a better word, in terms of where it should be?\nScott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: We're very happy with the progress that we've made. For me, the primary point of distinction with \u2013 you chose the healthcare vertical, and all the factors that you cited are accurate. But to me, the primary difference was and remains that we have a remarkable and proprietary data set inside what we do in the Financial Services vertical. We had the hypothesis when we began the journey in the healthcare vertical that we could establish a data advantage. And because of developments in the market environment, that proved not to be the case. And so caring about returns that we drive for our shareholders, we'd said, okay, probably the best thing to do is to invest in other directions. So this situation is very different from that situation. And the number one factor that I would cite is a remarkably proprietary data set.\nHamzah Mazari - Jefferies LLC: Got it. Makes sense. Thanks so much.\nScott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no question at this time. Presenters, you may proceed.\nScott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Okay. Well, thank you, everybody, for your continuing interest in Verisk, and appreciate all your questions. We will, as always, be following up with you and look forward to that. So thanks. Have a great day, rest of the day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

            "name": "Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.",
            "content": "Yeah, absolutely. Thanks for the question. I think what we're all saying is that our customers need to make sure they operate as effectively in this post-COVID world as they did in the past. And that digital engagement with their policyholders is hugely important, whether that's on the underwriting side or on the claims side. So the things that we've seen become kind of very important to insurers is some of the things we've talked about in the past. So to the extent you're thinking about adjudicating a claim, we have a tool that we gave away free during the pandemic, at least the early stages. And what it does is it allows that adjuster to sit at his desk and do a desktop adjustment, meaning actually adjudicate a claim by interacting with the policyholder, taking pictures, taking videos, taking that measurement from inside those pictures and developing repair cost estimates so that the contractor can get out and fix the property at the same time the policyholder gets the payment from or the contractor gets the payment from the (00:37:43). On the underwriting side, very similarly, we have tools that have helped them digitally engage. If you're going to go underwrite a commercial building or a very high-value home, you want to go out and see it. Now that's difficult. And what I think key is all of these insurers attempting to do that from their desktop, interact with the policyholders and have them walk around the home or walk around the property. And finally, it takes a form of automation, right? People are looking to automate that co-process. So anything we can do, we refer to it as LightSpeed, to bring all that data forward so that they're able to quickly and efficiently provide a quote using public information, using proprietary information. That is the digital engagement that we're experiencing. And I think what we'd like to say is a lot of our insurance companies are trying to become a better digital form of themselves. So this time has kind of spurred some investment in IT so that they can be there in the advent (00:38:36). Sure. So obviously, it's a very robust market for anyone with a (00:49:37) IPO from the InsureTech world looking to underwrite risk. And I think like many people, there are InsureTechs that are aggressively looking to explore that IPO opportunity. The good news about that is the way these InsureTechs seem to be attractive to the market is because of the tech play, the automation, the way they go about things in the non-traditional sense. And I think what we have been fortunate to be a part of is, as these new InsureTechs come to market, whether initially as a managing general agent, where they don't actually underwrite the risk but they select it, or a full-blown underwriting insurer, they have looked to us for data analytics information as a part of that trail. So we have benefited from the InsureTech world as it relates to those insurance companies. And some of the biggest ones that are in market or those that are coming to market behind the scenes are quite effectively using a full suite of Verisk solutions. So I feel like we're great partners to those InsureTechs. I think the other part of the question that you have, and I don't want to be overly exhaustive, but there's also InsureTechs that are providing services. And those InsureTechs that are providing services in part compete against us. And those businesses clearly have (00:51:10) enhance and increase the views, the awareness of insurers of alternate sources of doing business. And I think the combination of a little bit of competition, which always makes us better, but also the fact that now insurers are hearing that message, they're probably a little more open and interested to talk about our solutions and opportunities there. So I hope, Manav without really hearing your question, that was hopefully, what you were looking for. Thanks for the question. This is Mark. So, first of all, we continue to explore our legal options with regard to roof measurements. As well, you probably referenced earlier, what we did was we kind of moved a lot of our image capture to Vexcel. What that allows, and to just emphasize the importance of that is, what's expensive and what's very important is coverage, right? And coverage not only in what geographies you have, but how frequently you refresh that. So with a combined source of image capture, we are now able to, better than anyone else, cover the United States and cover the United States frequently and go international. With that inventory, we have put together some solutions for underwriting purposes, which represent things about the outside of the building, physical structures, pool, things like that as well as ways to go about looking at claims and triaging claims after an event, a catastrophe as an example or extreme weather. And we've taken some of that inventory and we've moved it over into the energy space and ways we go about helping energy companies do things around their assets and their physical network. So what hopefully you hear is we've tried to leverage and gain scale on image capture, while still doing the analytics. And that analytic approach is not just insurance. It's more broadly even into real estate, construction and other verticals here. So that has been our focus. But at this time, we are not able to provide roof measurements, which is the very important act or approach inside the claims space. So thank you for the question. I do like talking about this topic. I think if you were to think about that presentation, and I appreciate you bringing it back to us. The UK was, in particular, a point of particular focus. And if you recall, we did a series of acquisitions. It brought a series of new products there. And I think that thesis has proven out wonderfully well. I think we are growing probably in excess of that plan. And we have definitely added to our growth rates in Insurance as a result of that international dimension. A couple things just to highlight, where I think we've been particularly effective. Sequel, Rulebook was and continues to be a wonderful acquisition, not just because of the solution set, but its ability from a technology perspective to integrate and weave together a lot of the various insurance solutions.

            "name": "Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.",
            "content": "Thanks, Stacey, and good day, everyone. I'm glad to be with you today and certainly hope you and your families continue to stay safe and are well in this moment. At Verisk, we continue to focus on our key priorities to build long-term shareholder value, delivering for our customers through innovation and service while also protecting the health and well-being of our teammates around the globe. To that end, the majority of our offices continue to operate in a Phase 1 format and are available for those employees who have volunteered to work from the office. Our Global Protection Services team closely monitors directives from local governments and public health officials around the world and makes real-time decisions to maintain the safety of our people. Over the duration of the pandemic, our teams have proven they can transition efficiently into different work modes with minimal interruption in service to our customers. So while there remains much uncertainty around the pandemic, I have complete confidence that our 9,000-plus teammates at Verisk will navigate through these times effectively and deliver the highest value to our customers as we have in 2020. During the third quarter, our business performed solidly, posting sequential growth from the second quarter in both our subscription and transactional revenues. In addition, we saw improvement in the year over growth rates of both our non-COVID-sensitive and COVID-sensitive revenues. During the quarter, we kept a keen eye on cost by pacing head count growth, while also benefiting from the responsiveness of our compensation structure and lower travel expenses. That said, we continued to fully fund investment in our business, including our innovation agenda and the modernization of our computing infrastructure through cloud migration, tokenization of key data assets and the development of cutting-edge data fabric to underlie our analytics solutions. The net result was strong organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth and margin expansion. Lee will provide more details on our performance in his financial review. During the third quarter, we advanced our innovation agenda with the release of new solutions across our verticals. In Insurance, we expanded the Verisk Data Exchange with the addition of Ford Motor Company. Owners of Ford and Lincoln vehicles will soon be able to easily access usage-based insurance programs for many of the US auto insurers that connect to the exchange. The Verisk Data Exchange employs advanced proprietary analytics to refine driving telemetry from connected vehicles into normalized, easy-to-use, insurance-ready information, including our rating and scoring solutions. We're excited to have Ford as part of the exchange and believe their addition will help our insurance customers expand their usage-based insurance programs. At FAST, we are very pleased with the success we are having, extending and accelerating the adoption of FAST's solutions across our broad customer base. Since we acquired FAST in December, we have seen leading life insurers including Amica, Kansas City Life, Lincoln Heritage and Financial and Pacific Life license FAST's SaaS-based software to enable their digital transformation and become more automated and efficient. Finally, in our repair cost estimating solutions, we have launched XactAnalysis Insights, a new add-on feature to our core XactAnalysis platform. This tool uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to create interactive and customizable dashboards that enable our customers with a more holistic view of their claims data. We believe XactAnalysis Insights should help our customers to work more efficiently and effectively as they can more quickly identify trends in their data. In Energy and Specialized Markets, we continue to make advances with our differentiated analytic platform called Lens and recently released the upstream portfolio optimization module. We are on track and on budget for further releases by year-end, namely in the areas of power and renewables and upstream carbon emissions. Despite the softness in the energy end market, we continue to see increased demand from our customers for our Lens platform, where our investment has delivered value for our clients and is reflected in increasing contract values and deeper integration into our customers' workflows. In Financial Services, we launched Merchant Tracker, a unique solution that allows businesses to better understand where consumers are spending and how their sales compare to other merchants. This solution enables business leaders to benchmark themselves on a weekly basis across metrics including sales and market share versus other named merchants down to the zip code level. The data can also differentiate between physical and online sales. Merchant Tracker built upon the COVID-19 consumer spending dashboard that we developed in March to help our customers navigate through the early stages of the pandemic. Merchant Tracker is an example of how we are creating new commercial opportunities from the disruption of the pandemic while also delivering for our customers. On the sales front, our teams have fully embraced digital engagement, and outreach to our customers continues to be robust. We are experiencing increases in call volume in the 60%-plus range, and continue to benefit from the availability of customers who are still working from home. We recently hosted Verisk Velocity, our signature conference for underwriting and rating, as a fully virtual event this year. The digital format allowed us to expand the concept to feature more industry speakers and to create on-demand access so customers could watch sessions they were interested in at their convenience. The event focused on accelerating the future of insurance and included sessions on the latest emerging issues, including the digitization of insurance, lessons learned from COVID-19, cyber insurance and ransomware, millennials and insurance, social inflation and what it means for insurance, and combating racism with ethical artificial intelligence. We had over 1,900 people register for the conference, which was more than four times larger than our in-person event last year, and those numbers continue to grow as customers are still accessing the on-demand content. Additionally, we experienced improved representation from our global clients as well as deeper penetration into our customers as we saw more people per account in attendance. Overall, this event was a great success and really reinforces Verisk's position as a thought leader in the industry and a partner for our customers. Taken together, all this activity has created increased numbers of sales leads and growing sales pipelines as we partner with our customers to help them become more digitally engaged and connected. We continue to experience the modestly longer sales cycle relative to historic norms that we discussed last quarter, and are managing this carefully. Putting the customer first is one of the guiding principles at Verisk, and improving our customer experience is a key focus for everyone across the organization. I'm very pleased to share with you that we recently achieved our highest Net Promoter Score in the company's history, a score of 50. This is an improvement of six points from last year, which was our then peak score, and reflects an increase in our investment in what we call our Customer-First Program, a solution set of customer experience data, analytic tools and cultural drivers. Our nearly 40 frontline teams across the organization listened to the voice of our customers, helping us to observe what is important and creating action plans to drive customer value and improve customer loyalty. The meaningful insights we glean from these day-to-day customer interactions and from our growing customer experience analytical capabilities helps us improve our solutions, highlight important trends across solutions and businesses and alert us to problems. In the COVID moments, putting the customer first is needed more than ever, and our teams across all verticals have stepped up in unique ways to support them. On the sustainability front, we continue to make progress on our plan. For the third consecutive year, investments in renewable energy certificates and carbon offsets helped balance 100% of Verisk's CDP-reported scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. While we've implemented many important energy-saving initiatives during the recent past, investing in renewable energy certificates is a practical option for a company of our size that leases all of its office space. Taken together with carbon offsets, the investments represent an immediate step forward, balancing Verisk's greenhouse gas emissions for the near-term to a degree that the company could never achieve otherwise. In fact, based on CDP's scope 1 and 2 revenue-based intensity calculation, our 2019 emissions are more than 15% lower now than when we first measured emissions five years ago. Finally, I'd like to publicly welcome General Vincent Brooks to our board of directors. General Brooks joined our board on October 1 and brings with him more than four decades of leadership experience in some of the world's most complex and challenging situations. General Brooks served in the US Army for 42 years from his entry into West Point until his 2019 retirement as a four-star general. Most recently, General Brooks was in command of all US forces in Korea, where he concurrently led the United Nations Command and the Republic of Korea-US Combined Forces Command, which was comprised of more than 650,000 Korean and American soldiers. I'm confident that as a member of our Board of Directors, General Brooks will reinforce Verisk's culture of operational excellence, and his experience and guidance will be instrumental as we work in complex global-scale environments. General Brooks becomes the fourth new director to our board in the past four years. So now let me turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results. And, Lee, I just want to make a general point around that specific point, and Toni, good to hear from you. So, we can always observe the relative impact of the macro environment at any given moment, which I think is the basis of your question, and there is some impact, as Lee was talking. But another thing which is true about our business and I wanted to make this point, and it actually relates to everything we do, is that we consistently grow faster than the underlying markets that we serve. And the reason is a combination of what it is we do, which is fundamentally helping them become more data analytic, which is the direction of travel anyway, and actually in the COVID moment, many companies really, really have discovered their need to accelerate their rates of digitization and deepen their data analytics. So that's the first point. The second point is the rate at which we grow is really going to be strongly a function of how much value and increased value we're able to bring to our customers. So there is definitely a relationship to the macro environment, no question about it. But what I wanted to emphasize was, we always feel that we have the opportunity to increase the value that we bring to our customers. And that does get reflected in how much of their increased value they share with us, even in a relatively difficult market. That's kind of the underlying story of Verisk, actually. And maybe a word of context around that, which is we are actually, right now, in the early stages of envisioning what will our physical plant look like over longer periods of time. And I'm certain that all of our customers are doing the same thing. And so in the future state, that person, she or he, that one of our people needs to encounter in a deep way, where will they be? I mean in the same way that we are considering exactly how dense our physical space \u2013 we will definitely have physical space, but how dense will it be? Where will it be? We're asking those questions right now. Our customers are as well. So I think Lee's answer is exactly correct because we can't presume on the decisions that our customers are going to make. And yet we will want to encounter them deeply. They will want to encounter us deeply. And so we're just going to figure it out with them, basically. But that will emerge over time. Yeah. No, thanks, Alex. Mark, you want to make some observations from the insurance world? Well, the point I think to really bear in mind here is the nature of our business in the energy space. Just even a few years ago, something on the order of 70% of our revenue was related to the upstream part of the hydrocarbon wing of the energy ecosystem. Now it's less than 50%. And most of what we do there is with the integrated globals or with the national oil companies in the hydrocarbon space as well as the financial services sector that finances and does deals with those kinds of folks. Our exposure to Lower 48 unconventionals, which is the part of the market that has really been affected, and when you referenced bankruptcies, for example, is actually quite low. It's never been a large part of our mix. And so, actually, we're fairly insulated from those kinds of effects. So you're right, Alex, those things \u2013 some of those trends are going on right now, but I would encourage you to lay over that the actual structure of our business, which tends to be more immune to some of those effects. And there are also compensating effects in other parts of the supply chain. So, as you know, we have a very nice footprint in the petrochemicals world. At the moment, petrochemicals players are benefiting from the fact that feedstocks are cheap. There are puts and takes. So we're plowing ahead. And there are multiple work streams inside. So part of it is actually sort of grooving the pathways and hardening the pathways and ensuring security as we rotate things into the cloud. But another part of it is the migration of our footprint away from premise computing, and especially the mainframe. So we're at work. We're in the middle of it right now. The work will proceed faster than the visible cost benefit associated with what we're doing. It's just the nature of the thing. The cloud spending, for example, is a linear function. And premise spending is more of a sort of \u2013 you sort of take shelfs of spending down, but you have to reach points where that has occurred. And I would say that we are well along. And we've talked before about the fact that mainframe migration, for example, is a couple of years. And so I have kind of like a two-year horizon on when we can say we are fundamentally done or close to done with mainframe migration. So that's where we are. The rate at which we will get the cost benefit of that will emerge kind of as a trailing function. And this is what we've said about it all along. Actually, I hope that those of you that have been with us for a while have noted, we've been making these investments for quite some time. They're all baked into our P&L. It's not like we have to declare some special project. We're just \u2013 this is what we do, and this is what we were doing. So, anyway, so a couple of years is sort of the window for technical migration, and the rate at which the cost benefits sort of layer in will sort of be a trailing function. They will express themselves in the intermediate period but even more after we have achieved the technical migration. Yeah, it's really broadly based. I think we've described to you in the past that we have multiple categories of solutions. Lee called out that, at the moment, spend-informed analytics, which does relate to folks that are trying to promote their products, and therefore, ultimately things like advertising. That has been feeling the effects of the COVID moment so we called that one out. But all the other things that we do are a part of the overall results that we shared with you. Yeah. Manav, it was really hard to hear you. I think you were asking about InsureTech and maybe you gave us kind of an environmental question about sort of what's going there or perhaps also its intersection with us. Mark, do you \u2013 assuming that that was your question, I (00:49:28). Okay. All right. Mark, do you want to maybe kick off on that? Well, I would just highlight, sort of at a kind of high-thematic level. The businesses that we have, which are very much sort of SaaS-powered business models, are doing very well. And those show up in multiple parts of our business. And in general, the more that we lean into, as we are, what we refer to as platform analytic environments, the better basically. And there are development cycles associated with those, but when you get to the place where you are the environment, where your customer finds it productive to do their work, that's a really, really powerful place to be. And that's a theme which spans much of our company today and all the verticals. Yeah. So let's see, in reverse order, you should think of pricing as sort of a GNP-ish kind of a number sort of, inside of what it is that we do. I don't really think that there have been differential effects, in different parts of \u2013 I think your question was at the level of verticals. I don't really think there have been differential effects. I would go back to what Lee cited before, which is services is the place where, when the economy softens, there tends to be a softening, and so, kind of that as a category. But in terms of licensed solutions, I wouldn't make sharp distinctions across the verticals. Lee, I don't know if you would see it any differently. But doesn't feel that way. To me. And then the way that we think about pricing our solutions, and we've tried to be very deliberate about separating COVID-sensitive and non-COVID-sensitive revenues. You've heard our report in terms of the non-COVID-sensitive, which tend to essentially be licensable, subscription-based kinds of solutions. And we talked about slightly, modestly longer sales cycles. But in terms of the terms that we're striking with our customers, I have not picked up any signals that there's any real change there. So, Jeff, if you were to understand Lens as \u2013 in sort of the Lens market space opportunity picture, basically, it's the product of all the different content families times all the accounts. And when you think of it that way, we're in a very early stage of our journey. You bet. We're very happy with the progress that we've made. For me, the primary point of distinction with \u2013 you chose the healthcare vertical, and all the factors that you cited are accurate. But to me, the primary difference was and remains that we have a remarkable and proprietary data set inside what we do in the Financial Services vertical. We had the hypothesis when we began the journey in the healthcare vertical that we could establish a data advantage. And because of developments in the market environment, that proved not to be the case. And so caring about returns that we drive for our shareholders, we'd said, okay, probably the best thing to do is to invest in other directions. So this situation is very different from that situation. And the number one factor that I would cite is a remarkably proprietary data set. You bet. Okay. Well, thank you, everybody, for your continuing interest in Verisk, and appreciate all your questions. We will, as always, be following up with you and look forward to that. So thanks. Have a great day, rest of the day."

            "name": "Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. Moving to the financial results for the third quarter, on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 7.6% to $703 million. While net income and earnings per share increases reflected a $125 million litigation reserve and $29 million acquisition-related earn-out expense in the prior period that did not reoccur. Moving to our organic constant currency results, adjusted for non-operating items, as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, we are very pleased with our operating results, considering the impact from COVID-19. Normalized for the $8 million revenue impact of the injunction on roof measurement solutions, organic constant currency grew 4.9%. The third quarter 2020 was the final quarter of any material organic impact from the injunction. In the third quarter, our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, as we defined last quarter, grew approximately 7.8% on an organic constant currency basis and normalized for the injunction, which was an improvement from the 6.5% growth in the second quarter. This sustained growth in our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, representing approximately 85% of our total revenues, reflects the durability and resilience of our primarily subscription-based business model. We did continue to experience, as we did in the prior quarter, a negative impact from COVID-19 on certain of our products and services, largely transactional in nature, which represent the balance or approximately 15% of our consolidated revenues. These COVID-sensitive revenues declined approximately 10% on an organic constant currency basis during the third quarter, which was an improvement from the 20% decline in the second quarter and reflects improvements in all three of our segments, as the underlying causal impacts began to diminish and some of the pressure on our revenues abated, though the pace of the recovery varies across the solutions. For example, we have seen a rebound in our commercial underwriting surveys as our field staff is now allowed to enter buildings. And we have also seen improvements in trends across personal auto. On the energy side, we have seen a more modest improvement as CapEx budgets at our customers continue to be under pressure, affecting our consulting business. Despite the impact on revenue in the third quarter, we are pleased to report that we delivered strong EBITDA growth and expanded margins as the result of effective expense and head count management. Organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth, normalized for the injunction, was 17.7% in the third quarter. Total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic revenue and adjusted EBITDA, was 52.1% in the quarter, representing strong leverage across the business. This margin level includes roughly 140 basis points of benefit from lower travel expenses, but also reflects substantial investment in our business and infrastructure, including our cloud transition costs. On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis and normalized for the injunction. Insurance segment revenues increased 7%, reflecting healthy growth in our industry-standard insurance programs, catastrophe modeling solutions and repair cost estimating solutions. We experienced a modest benefit from storm-related revenues as a result of a more normal hurricane season in 2020 as compared to the very slow season in 2019. This was offset in part by a decline in certain transactional revenues that were negatively impacted by COVID-19. Adjusted EBITDA grew 19.8% in the third quarter, demonstrating strong margin expansion despite certain revenue declines and investment in our breakout areas. Energy and Specialized Markets revenue decreased 1% in the third quarter due to declines in consulting and implementation projects. We were very pleased to see continued growth in our subscription-based core research and data analytic platforms, environmental health and safety service solutions and weather analytics solutions, resulting in outperformance relative to the end market. We believe our strong performance is a function of the criticality of our solutions, the diversification of our revenue streams into breakout areas like the energy transition practice, and the strength of our relationships in the industry. Despite the revenue declines, adjusted EBITDA grew 10.7% in the third quarter, driven by strong operational controls and modest actions taken during the second quarter to reduce head count to be more balanced with the current level of consulting work. We continue to closely monitor and partner with our energy customers as they navigate through this tough operating environment with a particular focus on consolidation in the upstream space. We have a track record of managing through these times effectively. Additionally, we now have the tools to capitalize on the commercial opportunity that consolidation brings through our cost intelligence solutions, which utilize our proprietary data assets to help identify cost-saving opportunities and reduce spending for these companies. Financial Services revenue increased 1.6% in the quarter driven by growth in subscription revenues. This was offset in part by declines in our spend informed analytics solutions stemming from COVID-19, and reduced levels of advertising. We continue to focus on building a more stable and a recurring revenue base for this business. Adjusted EBITDA increased 3.7% for the quarter, reflecting cost discipline. Total adjusted EBITDA margins declined in the quarter as a result of portfolio actions we closed earlier in the year. Our reported effective tax rate was 22.6% for the quarter compared to 15.5% in the prior year quarter. The quarterly rate came in lower than our expectations, owing to increased levels of stock option exercise, which depend on personal employee decisions and the Verisk stock price. Looking forward, we now expect that our full year tax rate for 2020 will be between 20% and 22%. Adjusted net income was $218 million and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.32 for the third quarter of 2020, up 17.2% and 17.9% from the prior year, respectively. These increases reflect solid top line growth, cost discipline in the business, a reduction in travel expenses as a result of COVID-19, and a lower average share count. Net cash provided by operating activities was $207 million for the quarter, down 3% from the prior year period primarily due to a deferral of federal income tax payment under the CARES Act from the second quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2020, partially offset by the deferral of certain employer payroll taxes as well as higher customer collections and a reduction in travel payments as a result of COVID-19. Capital expenditures were $65 million for the quarter, up 6.8% from the prior year period. CapEx represented 9.2% of total revenues in the quarter, reflecting some leasehold improvement expenditures associated with our office consolidations in Boston and London. We continue to expect capital expenditures to decline as a percentage of revenues. For 2020, we expect CapEx to be in the previously provided range of $215 million to $270 million, as investing in our business and our people continues to be our highest priority. Related to CapEx, we continue to expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization to be within the range of $185 million to $195 million and intangible amortization to be approximately $165 million in 2020. During the third quarter, we returned $94 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. And I'm pleased to report that our Board of Directors has approved a $0.27 per share dividend for the fourth quarter to be paid in December. I also want to note progress with the integration and sales momentum of our recent acquisitions, including FAST, BuildFax and Genscape. On the revenue side, while still early, we are seeing success selling these solutions into our broad customer base and are innovating new products and enhancing existing ones by incorporating the data sets into our solutions. On the cost side, we are experiencing synergies consistent with our expectations at the time of the deals as integrations are moving smoothly. We're monitoring these acquisitions carefully and supporting the management teams to ensure that we are generating a solid return on invested capital. As we detailed last quarter, we continue to believe that the collective causal factors from COVID-19 represent pressure on achieving our 7% long-term growth objective in 2020. However, we remain confident they do not represent a structural change in our fundamental growth drivers and believe that as the underlying causal factors abate, we will show strong resilience in recovery. Each of these causal factors has its own recovery curve, making it difficult to predict the duration of the impacts to our revenue growth. We continue to have confidence in our ability to manage the cost structure effectively, and deliver operating leverage while also continuing to invest in our innovation agenda. While we restrict head count growth at the outset of the pandemic, with improving revenue dynamics, more recently, we have begun to partially release deferred hiring restrictions. That said, we are watching the environment carefully and will calibrate head count growth accordingly to protect profitability. Taking this all together, we continue to believe that the stability of our subscription revenues, along with our core operating leverage, driven by the responsiveness of our compensation structure and cost discipline, will continue to support revenue and EBITDA growth in 2020. We hope this provides some useful context for you and we look forward to addressing your questions. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions. Yeah. Thank you, Toni. Appreciate the question. And, as always, when we talk about margins across the enterprise as a whole and even just within the Insurance segment, there were a lot of factors that are going into this. I think if we can think about it on one level in the third quarter, the exceptional margin expansion was a function of, in part, the COVID-19 environment, meaning that we did see a larger reduction in expenses owing to travel and entertainment and some compensation costs relative to the revenue growth chain. So that was certainly an element that contributed. Our view is that there may be some permanent benefits from that as we look at the way we orient our, or size our travel and entertainment activities. There may be some permanent benefits in terms of longer term real estate expense savings. And so I think that there is some permanent element of that that we achieved. So that's kind of the COVID dimension. There is another dimension in the margins in Insurance which reflect the contribution of our aerial imagery business, the Geomni business to Vexcel. And so there was a substantial reduction in expenses and, if you will, EBITDA margin benefit from that transaction. That did represent a permanent improvement across Insurance as a whole, and so that is certainly a, what we would expect is a permanent benefit. I think those are the larger pieces. We also had in the quarter, particularly some particular strength in our AIR catastrophe modeling business that was helpful with some stronger transactional revenue, and some other business related things. The storm revenue in the claims business probably also boosted margin a little bit higher. But I think your thesis is correct. There are some permanent elements to that. We're going to try to manage the recovery of expenses, particularly T&E and head count through the recovery here in a way to continue to allow that operating leverage to be reflected to it. But there are going to be some permanent benefits. Hopefully that captures it. I do think I want to end by saying that I think looking at 2019 is a legitimate reference point. We do think that the levels that we will achieve in 2020 reflect some exceptional benefits, but we will be looking at our margins I think in 2021 relative to 2019 as a more normalized base. Sure. So, Toni, the way that I would approach it is first with regard to the Wood Mackenzie component of that, we are experiencing two dimensions. One of course, the consulting element, where, from a COVID-sensitive perspective, and the challenges that the industry is facing, that's where we're feeling the pressure as reflected in the COVID-sensitive revenues. And so it's difficult to predict how that Energy sector will continue to experience that and reflect it. So I think we're expecting some level of that to persist into 2021. On the subscription side, I think as we said, we've continued to see growth in that portion of the business. That has been bolstered by the investment that we've made in Lens and the perceived quality of that product platform and our ability to continue to grow subscription levels. There are some impacts from consolidation within the industry that will have a negative impact going into 2021. But we still expect, from an organic standpoint, to see contributions to growth from that. The other element is going to be in our PowerAdvocate business. 2020 reflected a transition from a great 2019 where we have a lot of new projects and implementation revenue that came out as we moved to more subscription revenue for some of those pieces. We do think the contribution in 2020 from that business will be stronger in 2021 as they have rebuilt the pipeline and that should continue to grow as well. So I will end by saying, we continue over the long term to believe that the entire Energy and Specialized Markets component of the business has the potential to deliver growth, consistent with our organic constant currency growth targets of 7%. That will vary from year-to-year. We're obviously experiencing pressures within this environment. But we do believe that the business as a whole can deliver on that. Thanks, Andrew. So, first to answer the first part of your question, we estimate that the impact of incentive compensation change was about 40 basis points relative to the 140 basis points of T&E benefit. And that's just looking at the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. So that would be I think the number that you were looking for on the compensation front. With regard to your second question, I would say it's still too early for us to associate the productivity on the sales side, which Scott described and I think we're all very pleased with, to how we calibrate our T&E expectations looking ahead. I think there are two levels. One, from a financial perspective, we obviously want to manage that in a way that we continue to see the operating leverage within the business. But the other dimension, and clearly the more important dimension, is what do we want to see from our customers, and to what degree is it important to them that we're engaged with them face to face. This is a business where we think that we benefit from that. We're obviously doing well within this environment and that productivity is up, but at the end of the day, we need to make certain that we are interacting with our clients in the way that is most effective for them and for us. So, we'll follow their lead. I do think that that's going to be a gradual process and we'll have the ability to calibrate that, but that would be the way I would say we are thinking about it, and it's too early for us to quantify or define what we think the permanent, potential permanent benefit from the T&E perspective is. Yeah. Well, I mean, I think there's a certain unknowable quality to it. I think we'll know it when we see it kind of experienced over time. As Toni indicated, kind of looking at over a period of time, perhaps as we look at travel and entertainment as a percentage of our revenues, maybe in one way for us to gauge it. But I think it's undeniable that, having been through this experience, that we have the scope to think about the degree to which we're spending on that relative to revenues and/or have other ways and more efficient means to interact with our customers. But it will be something that we're tracking and hence, by tracking, be able to manage more effectively. Thank you, Andrew. And Andrew, one thing I just want to add to Scott's comments, kind of two things. One, just to kind of address the broad question, I'd say there's no material cost benefit that we've realized at this point in the process because we are still in the \u2013 bringing the cloud costs in. And we are in the process, as Scott has described, of stepping down that on-premises cost over time. We believe that \u2013 and that's more a function of the phasing of this. And we're dealing with hundreds of data sets that have to be re-migrated, power has to be migrated, applications that have to be re-coded. But we will achieve those savings over time. So there's nothing, I think, material in the margin. The second point that I want to make is there's also a revenue benefit. And I will tell you that the thing that we're probably most excited is getting these data sets into the cloud, substantiating the data fabric that we are building across the enterprise. And our ability to innovate, associate data sets and create new platforms and analytics of commercial value is indisputably enhanced by that. So I think we are seeing some of the benefits of that on the new product development side that we're excited about commercializing. Yeah. I think that's true. There isn't anything that I would call out specifically. I think it has been fairly broad-based on the subscription side. Thanks. So the short answer is, even when we exclude the T&E benefit, we are still seeing operating margin expansion. So when we look at our overall improvement in margin, the T&E and the incentive compensation benefit in the third quarter was some but not all of that. So we are very pleased to see that that operating leverage in this environment, even absent those savings, is still expressing itself. And that's before we take into account the non-organic or the M&A related impact. So within the core business, we're seeing that. But also in our breakouts, we're seeing a contribution from improved operating leverage within those businesses. But I think your question went to the key element, is the T&E and the incentive comp impact greater than the overall level? No, it's just \u2013 it's a component, and we're actually having operating leverage beneath that. I would say that where we are seeing recovery, and you will \u2013 if you go back in the script, you'll see some comments around our survey \u2013 our commercial lines survey business where we have seen improvement. Part of that is access to the buildings. We've also seen an improvement on the personal lines, or the personal auto segment because with greater driving activity, we're seeing a benefit to that in some of our transactional businesses. Those are probably the largest components. We continue to see the pressure probably unchanged in more of the consulting businesses that we've seen. And also, of course, travel remains extremely restricted, and so we're not seeing any material benefit on that front. So that hopefully gives you some compositional color on those changes. And Manav, I want to add one thing, building off of Mark's comments on the competition dynamic. And he was describing it with regard to other InsureTechs that provide services to us. You know, on the former point in terms of the new entrants, the secondary benefit, and frankly, in some ways, potentially even the more significant benefit, is that that competitive pressure of new approaches to the insurance industry, it puts more pressure on some of the traditional players that are looking to address and respond to that. And so for instance, in our LightSpeed product, I think the LightSpeed product where we've had great success is in many ways a competitive response to other new markets that are out there. So it's serving to, I think, lift the industry as a whole apart from kind of that purely incremental amount of revenue that we get from those new entrants. No. I agree. I think maybe the question that you were asking and making reference, as we get in the text, COVID was focused on the Energy and Specialized Markets performance relative to the end market. And the one area that I would point out, it was with reference to the Lens platform. And there, I think it is a microcosm of where we are adding substantial value to the customer in this environment. And that's enabling us to secure larger contract values, because of the value that we're delivering into that end market. And I think that, in a way, is what's powering us to outperform the end market as a function of the value that we're creating there. And I think there are other instances of that. That's a, I think, the investment and the return dynamic which is I think a separate answer than the point of view that Scott expressed, which I agree with in terms of differential on the segments. Yeah. So \u2013 and, Jeff, it was a little bit hard to hear the last one. The short answer is I think that you have the components correctly in the business. The variable is going to be the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business and the inherent unpredictability of that. We're certainly hopeful that we'll continue to see a return to a more normal environment. And in getting there, I think our hope is that we will be able to hang on to some of these elements of margin improvement that we saw, probably not all of them. We will need to travel and visit with clients. If we are performing better relative to our targets, then we should see our compensation structure adjust to that. But I think you have the components correctly. And I think all we want to do is highlight on some of those temporary impacts and then to begin to anticipate the return to a normal environment that we're going to try to manage. So I think that hopefully addresses the first part of your question. The second part of your question I just would ask you to repeat because it wasn't entirely clear to me, not that you weren't expressing it clearly, but I had a hard time hearing it. I can't. It's part \u2013 I can't because I think we view it as, this margin is reflective of the core underlying margin of the Insurance business. Vexcel \u2013 I'm sorry, the Geomni business, as we have discussed in the past, was a business that we were making a substantial investment in, that it was not contributing a positive margin as we were investing in it. Now without, you can kind of see the core element of the business. But we don't quantify that. Yeah. So it's obviously just one month, I would say, that so far, based upon what we've seen, we're seeing similar year-over-year growth rates in the COVID-sensitive revenues and in the non-COVID-sensitive revenues. So I think that we \u2013 while certainly the third quarter demonstrated a sequential improvement relative to the second quarter, so far, and again, it's just into the start of this, we are perhaps seeing the impact of going into the winter season and some impacts of increased restrictions on a global basis that may create less opportunity for sequential improvement relative to the third quarter. That's kind of speculation. Nobody knows for certain. But at least looking at October, we're seeing kind of stable levels of year-over-year change in the non-COVID and the COVID-sensitive revenues. No. It's not a significant enough number. On the margin, it was beneficial, but we aren't quantifying that. Thank you."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After today's prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.\nStacey Brodbar: Thank you, JP, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our second quarter 2020 financial results. Today's call will be led by Scott Stephenson, Verisk's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, who will provide an overview of our business; Lee Shavel, Chief Financial Officer will follow with the financial review; Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer; Nick Daffan, Chief Information Officer; Neal Anderson, President, Wood Mackenzie; and Lisa Bonalle Hannan, President, Verisk Financial will join the team for the Q&A session. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance, including, but not limited to the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Now, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\nScott Stephenson: Thanks, Stacey. Good day, everyone, and I'm glad to be with you today. The second quarter was unique as we dealt with the macro effects of the COVID-19 event, and I hope you and your families continue to stay well in this moment. At Verisk, our priorities are unchanged as we remain committed to delivering for our customers, protecting the health and well-being of our 9,000 plus teammates and continuing to drive our innovation agenda. I'm pleased, but not surprised that our second quarter results reflect the strength and stability of our business model, the mission-critical nature of our solutions and the hard work and resilience of our teammates, who quickly adapted to the work-from-home environment and have remained focused on customer needs and innovation. I'm proud of our team and want to thank each teammate for their dedication and focus during a fluid moment. Before we discuss the quarter, I want to make two related points about where Verisk stands. First, we believe that the net effect of the COVID-19 moment should benefit Verisk in the long run, given that our customers will persevere and make it through to the other side with even more focus on becoming the better digital versions of themselves. This should make our customers more capable and desirous of using our many solutions. And second, the consistent performance you see from us now and into the future is a function of our structure and position and not only cyclical or momentary effects. Our results are a function of the steady and ongoing accumulation of innovation and success with customers. Our business performed as we had expected in the second quarter. We previously communicated to you our analysis that approximately 85% of our revenues are subscription-based and subject to long-term contracts, and therefore, we did not see any material impact on these revenues from the COVID-19 environment. In the second quarter, those revenues grew approximately 6.5% on an organic constant currency basis when normalized for the one-time impact of the injunction related to roof measurement solutions. Of the remaining 15% of revenues that are more transactional in nature and are subject to COVID-19 impacts, those revenues declined approximately 20% on an organic constant currency basis in the second quarter in line with our expectations. We experienced sequential improvement throughout the quarter and into July, as the underlying causal factors began to diminish and we expect to see continued progress on that front. During March, as the expense of the pandemic became clear, we quickly moved to action and deliberately protected profitability without, and this is important, cutting investment in our business. We did this by moderating headcount growth, but without resorting to large scale furloughs or layoffs by focusing on operational discipline and by benefiting from the natural responsiveness of our compensation structure. Together, these actions delivered strong organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth. Even while delivering strong profitability, we continue to fund investments in our innovation agenda and continued monetizing our technical infrastructure through cloud migration, tokenization of key data sets and leading-edge data fabric supporting great analytics as we have done for the last several years. We will provide more details on our performance in its financial review. During the second quarter, Verisk operated predominantly in a work-from-home environment and our teams across the organization have remained highly effective. Operationally, our computing and network capacity has consistently and comfortably exceeded our daily requirements even as demand for our solutions and platforms have increased meaningfully in this remote environment. For example, in our Insurance segment, usage of our digital claims settlement tool increased over 55% in the second quarter. And we are successfully converting free trials into paid subscriptions as customers realize the benefit of this new innovative platform to help them on their journey to becoming more digitally engaged. And in the energy vertical, we saw visits to our portal grow by over 40%, as customers value our content, particularly in moments of uncertainty. We moved our innovation agenda forward evidenced by our continued investment across the enterprise. And the use of digital collaboration tools has helped our team stay connected to develop new and updated solutions for our customers. A few examples. In Insurance, we launched a new micro-business insurance program with advisory forms, rules and loss costs, specifically for the small businesses. This program is designed to help insurers cover the unique risks of micro-businesses that are often part of the gig economy, often operated out of home or shared spaces and having fewer than four employees. We also released an updated cyber risk modeling platform and launched Life Risk Navigator, our cloud-based stochastic risk modeling platform that offers in-depth portfolio analytics, which can enhance risk selection, quantify changes in mortality rates, improve hedging strategies and drive better financial decision-making for our life insurance customers. In our catastrophe modeling business, we have released Version 8 of our Touchstone platform, which includes timely updates for many of our models in the U.S., Australia and the Caribbean, and continues to fulfill our innovation promise. In Energy and Specialized Markets, we continue to push forward with our differentiated analytic platform called Lens, and are on track for further releases in the back half of the year related to upstream portfolio optimization, renewables and carbon emissions. Despite the softness in the Energy market, we continue to see demand from our customers for Lens, which is reflected in both adoption and constructive pricing. Also within our Energy segment, we launched a solution in April, which analyzes pandemic-related supply chain risk and allows our Energy customers to anticipate potential disruptions in their business operations. We are currently enhancing the existing solution by adding data sets from across Verisk that address additional elements of supply chain risks such as vulnerability of suppliers to extreme events, the environmental, social and governance risk factors that suppliers may pose and movements and commodity markets impacting supplier costs. And in Financial Services, our loan loss forecasting model called LookAhead is gaining momentum with customers as it helps them understand the changes to their anticipated loan loss curves related to government stimulus programs, trends in unemployment and COVID-19 generally. This solution is unique to the marketplace given that it is founded on the total customer wallet view data set, which is proprietary to Verisk Financial Services. On the sales front, our teams have adjusted nicely to a fully digital sales model. To help our salesforce adjust to the virtual environment, we developed a series of trainings for best practices. We use virtual tools, including Skype, Zoom, Teams and Prezi. These sessions were very effective in making our sales teams comfortable with the new format. Outreach to our customers is robust, and with customers in their home offices, we have found they are often more reachable than ever. As a result, calls with customers increased over 50% in the second quarter versus the prior year. In addition, we successfully converted most of our scheduled in-person customer events to virtual events. Virtual events have enabled us to increase reach and attendance, including at our Signature London-based InsurTech Event in June called Verisk Vision, which saw a 63% increase in attendance this year versus the prior year's in-person gathering. Additionally, we hosted 48 webinars across our Insurance segment in quarter two, and had over 8,000 customers in attendance, which is more than a doubling versus last year. In Energy, we hosted a number of virtual events throughout the second quarter, delivering thought leadership and content to more than 3,000 clients and prospects. We continue to invest in the virtual space and make enhancements to our platform. We've decided that all events for the remainder of the year will be virtual and we're making plans accordingly. Virtual engagement with customers extends to the executive level. It is clear from these discussions that the pandemic has heightened the recognition among our customers that they need to become more digital and more automated and to do so at pace. At the CEO level, I have also been pleased to maintain a steady and high degree of contact with our customers' CEOs in the virtual moments. Like me, our customers' CEOs are highly focused on the well-being and productivity of their teams and consider the further digitization of their companies to be a highest priority. I continue to receive feedback along two lines, one, Verisk is a unique and differentiated partner; and two, our customers look to us for a steady stream of innovation to help them on the journey to becoming more digital and more automated. Even with a video screen between us, the depth of alignment and degree of mutual respect is as high as ever. The net result of all this activity across all levels is that sales opportunities and our pipelines continue to grow, as we capitalize on this structural growth trend. We are experiencing a modest lengthening of our sales cycles across our businesses as compared to historic norms. We are managing this closely and view this more as a timing issue and a function of the complexity of bringing stakeholders together and closing deals in a remote environment. While we have been successfully executing in a work-from-home format, I'm pleased to share that we've begun to open some of our global offices for a safe and phased return to office for those employees who would like to work from the office. In fact, we have opened more than 50 of our global locations in a Phase 1 format over the past few weeks, including our headquarters in Jersey City. I'm hosting this call from our offices, and it feels great to be back in the office. Additionally, as the stay-at-home restrictions have been lifted across the US, we have seen our field force return to a five-day week schedule, so that they can begin to work on the backlog that built up when entering commercial buildings was restricted. I also want to note how pleased we are with the integration and sales momentum of our recent acquisitions, including FAST, BuildFax and Genscape. While still early, we are realizing both revenue and cost synergies consistent with our expectations at the time of those deals. We're monitoring these acquisitions carefully and supporting the management teams to ensure that we are generating a solid return on invested capital. With that, let me turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results.\nLee Shavel: Thank you, Scott. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. Moving to the financial results for the quarter, on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 4% to $679 million, while net income increased 19% to $179 million. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 20% to $1.08 for the second quarter 2020. The year-over-year increase in GAAP net income and EPS is primarily the result of organic growth in the business, cost discipline, the impact of the timing shift of a $10 million expense related to annual long-term equity incentive grants and a decrease in acquisition-related costs. Moving to our organic constant currency results adjusted for non-operating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release. We are pleased with our operating results, particularly in light of the impact from COVID-19. On an organic constant currency basis, Verisk delivered revenue growth of 1.1% for the second quarter of 2020. This growth was driven by positive results in our Insurance segment, offset in part by modest declines in Energy and Specialized Markets and Financial Services. Normalizing for the $8 million revenue impact of the injunction on roof measurement solutions, revenue grew 2.4%. As we detailed last quarter and Scott mentioned in his prepared remarks, we completed a careful review of our solutions and services to evaluate the potential exposure to COVID-19 impacts. Through that exercise, we noted that we did not expect to see any material impact from COVID-19 on approximately 85% of our consolidated revenues because they were generally subscriptions or subject to long-term contracts. As such, in the second quarter, those revenues grew approximately 6.5% on an organic constant currency basis when normalized for the injunction. This speaks to the stability of our subscription business model. Moreover, as we expected, we did experience a negative impact from COVID-19 on certain of our products and services, largely transactional in nature, which represent the balance or 15% of our consolidated revenues. These revenues declined approximately 20% on an organic constant currency basis during the second quarter, owing to weakness in the underlying causal factors, including lower auto and travel insurance activity, the inability to enter commercial buildings to perform engineering analysis, decreased capital expenditures in the Energy sector and reduced levels of advertising spending and project-based work from the banks. While we did experience revenue declines in this group of products and services in each month of the quarter, as the underlying causal impacts began to diminish, we did see some of the pressure on our revenues abate. For example, we have seen trends improve sequentially in our auto insurance lines as driving mileage has recovered and are also experiencing improvement in our commercial surveys, as our field staff is now allowed to enter buildings. On the Energy side, the macro backdrop continues to pressure consulting, but trends seem to have stabilized, and we are starting to have early discussions with the strongest operators about future engagements. The net result is that we have experienced continued progress in sequential revenue improvement throughout the second quarter and into July. Despite the impact on revenue in the second quarter, we are pleased to report that we maintained strong EBITDA growth and expanded margins as the result of effective expense and headcount management. Organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth was 12.4% in the second quarter, and normalizing for the impact of the injunction and the LTI timing shift, organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA increased 11.6%. Total adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter, which includes both organic and inorganic revenue and adjusted EBITDA was 51.3% in the quarter. This margin included a one-time benefit of approximately 150 basis points from the previously communicated timing shift of annual LTI grants. Despite the expense control driving EBITDA growth and margin improvement, we continue to invest substantially in our business and infrastructure, including our cloud transition, and those costs are reflected in this margin as well. On that note, let's return - let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. As you see in the press release, Insurance reported 2.5% growth, while our adjusted EBITDA increased 13.8% for the quarter. We saw healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, catastrophe modeling solutions and repair cost estimating solutions, offset by the impact of the injunction on roof measurement solutions and a decline in certain transactional revenue that was negatively impacted by COVID-19. Normalizing for the impact of the injunction and LTI timing, Insurance would have achieved 4.3% organic constant currency revenue growth and 13.8% organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth, demonstrating strong margin expansion despite certain revenue declines and investment in our breakout areas. Energy and Specialized Markets revenue decreased 2.8% in the second quarter due to declines in consulting and implementation projects and lower events revenues across the Energy segment. We were very pleased to see continued growth in our subscription-based core research and data analytic platforms, environmental health and safety service solutions and weather analytic solutions, resulting in outperformance relative to the end market. We believe our strong performance is a function of the must-have nature of our solutions, the diversification of our revenue streams into breakout areas like the Energy transition practice and the strength of our relationships in the industry. Despite the revenue declines and normalized for the LTI timing, adjusted EBITDA grew 2.4% in the second quarter, driven by strong operational controls and modest actions taken to reduce headcount to be more balanced with the current level of consulting work. Financial Services revenue declined 2.7%, owing to weakness in project-based retained analytics and spend-informed analytics, as our bank customers reduced spending due to the pandemic. Despite decreased spending across the banking industry, we experienced growth in our subscription businesses, an area that has been a strategic focus for us over the last six quarters. Normalizing for the LTI timing, organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA remained flat for the quarter, while margins declined owing to portfolio actions we closed earlier in the year. Our reported effective tax rate was 20.4% for the quarter compared to 19.7% in the prior year quarter. Looking forward, we now believe that our full-year tax rate for 2020 will be between 21% and 23%, up from the 19% to 21% range we had previously provided. This is primarily the result of UK legislation that was enacted in July, but retroactive back to April 1st of 2020, that increases the UK corporate tax rate from 17% to 19%. As a result, we will take a one-time catch-up charge in the third quarter of this year related to the valuation of a deferred tax liability, which will likely drive the quarterly rate above the full-year range provided, but we do not anticipate a material long-term impact from this increase. Adjusted net income was $213 million, and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.29 for the second quarter, up 15.8% and 17.3% from the prior year respectively. These increase reflect the cost discipline in the business, lower travel and entertainment expenses, contributions from acquisitions, the above-mentioned timing shift in expense related to annual long-term equity incentive grants and lower average share count. Net cash provided by operating activities was $250 million for the quarter, up 24.6% from the prior year period. Capital expenditures were $57 million for the quarter, up 20.9% from the prior year period, and CapEx represented 8.4% of total revenues in the quarter. We now believe that CapEx in 2020 will likely be toward the higher end of our previously provided range of $250 million to $270 million, as investing in our business and our people continues to be among our highest priorities. Related to CapEx, we now expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization to be within the range of $185 million to $195 million higher than the prior provided range of $170 million to $180 million. This increase is related to the timing of implementation of certain internally developed software projects as we continue to push forward on introducing innovation to the marketplace. We continue to expect intangible amortization to be approximately $165 million in 2020. Free cash flow was $193 million for the quarter, an increase of 25.7% from the prior year, primarily due to an increase in customer collections and operating profit, a reduction in travel and entertainment expense as a result of COVID-19, as well as the deferral of federal income taxes and certain employer payroll taxes resulting from the CARES Act, partially offset by earn-out payments of $65 million. During the second quarter, we returned $119 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. And I'm pleased to report that our Board of Directors has approved a $0.27 per share dividend for the third quarter to be paid in September. As we detailed last quarter, we continue to believe that the collective causal factors from COVID-19 represent pressure on achieving our 7% long-term growth objective in 2020. However, we do not think they represent a structural change in our fundamental growth drivers and believe that as the underlying causal factors abate, we will show strong resilience in recovery. Each of these causal factors has its own recovery curve, making it difficult to predict the duration of the impacts to our revenue growth. We continue to have confidence in our ability to manage the cost structure effectively and deliver operating leverage, while also continuing to invest in our innovation agenda. While we have restricted headcount growth in the shorter-term, we will pace new hiring as we see a return to a more normalized operating environment. Taking this altogether, we continue to believe that the stability of our subscription revenues along with our core operating leverage, driven by the responsiveness of our compensation structure and cost discipline will continue to support revenue and EBITDA growth in 2020. We hope this provides some useful context for you, and we look forward to addressing your questions. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. We ask for the Q&A session that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. And with that, I will ask the operator to open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik of Barclays. Your line is now open.\nManav Patnaik: I just wanted to focus firstly just on the Energy and Specialized Markets segment. Last quarter you gave us some anecdotal commentary on the different mix between upstream and renewables so on and so forth. I was just wondering, if you could just give us some color on how each of those are doing within that business?\nScott Stephenson: Neal, would you like to speak to that?\nNeal Anderson: Yes, sure, certainly, Scott. First thing is we're very, very pleased in terms of our subscription business, how robust that business has been. And as Scott and Lee mentioned, it grew through the second quarter. Whilst we had, as we predicted on the transactional, both the consulting and the event side, that was more of a challenge. When we look at the Wood Mackenzie in the Energy Specialized business, it's a fundamentally different business than it was four years or five years ago at the time of the acquisition. At that time, the majority of our revenue was more exposed to the upstream side. Today, that, that part of the business is less than 50% of our business. Just as Scott mentioned, we're much more focused on the Energy transition and all the key growth areas, which will drive the business in the longer-term.\nManav Patnaik: And Scott, just the other question I had is, you've been talking a lot about software being an increased focus for you guys at Verisk. And I was just wondering, is there a way to quantify like how much as a percentage of your business software is today, and if that's just an Insurance phenomena or is it across Energy and Financial as well? Thank you.\nScott Stephenson: It's definitely a committed part of our strategy, Manav, in all parts of our business and it is a growing part of the mix. What we talk about all the time at Verisk is the best expression of what we can do for our customers is to provide them platform to analytic environments and great, what we call analytic objects. And the mix of both of those things inside of all of what we do is increasing and it is - and it is a strong focal point. You get kind of an interesting thing if you're trying to parse your revenue streams, taking energy as an example. So Lens is our platform. Moving through that platform is content that customers - some of what moves through that platform is content that customers have made use of through time. And so if we talk about sort of where the - where the revenue stream is headed and growing, it's a little bit artificial to parse how much of that you're attributing to the software that you generated versus the sort of the total platform and the value that the customers find in it. But definitely, software is a growing part of our mix and it's meaningful in all of the verticals.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nToni Kaplan: Wanted to start out with the margins, really strong quarter there expanding - EBITDA margins expanding 470 basis points. I know you attributed about 150 basis points to the LTI shift. But wanted to ask if it's fair to say that the remainder is coming from lower variable comp and T&E, and should that come back once this period is over or is there some level of permanent savings that we should be expecting to remain?\nScott Stephenson: Lee, would you start with that question, please?\nLee Shavel: Sure, absolutely. Thank you, Toni. So, I think your observation, I agree with Toni, I would say once you eliminate the LTI impact, as we've indicated about 150 basis points and then look at, as I typically described at the businesses on a pre-investment basis, we are still seeing strong margin improvement across the three businesses. And to give you some kind of some sense of the overall contribution in the margin, the reduction in T&E was approximately 150 basis points and the short-term kind of the compensation impact was about 100 basis points. So naturally, that's a function of the growth impact that it relates to the overall improvement. So we are having kind of the, what you might describe as the COVID-19 impact on our cost structure that is benefiting us in that period. But there are efficiencies that we are - have identified that I think will enhance our operating leverage ahead. Some of that it relates to the nature of our sales function and the sales productivity. We don't expect to be in this completely remote format for an extended period of time, but we have found potential efficiencies that may improve the margin on a longer-term basis. So I think there are some structural elements that we've identified that will persist, but clearly a significant part of this margin improvement is a function of the responsiveness of our cost structure and the actions that we've taken to manage headcount. So it's as always, a blend of a lot of different factors that are influencing margin.\nScott Stephenson: I would just add, Toni, one item that you didn't have in the ones that you - the factors which you highlighted is the increasing efficiency of our technical infrastructure. So we have been over the last couple of years as many know working to rotate to the cloud, as well as upgrading the data fabric inside of our analytics, and that continues. And as we move forward, the unit cost economics is associated with our technical infrastructure do improve and that's happening now and will continue to happen.\nToni Kaplan: And wanted to ask about the 15% of the business that's non-subscription that you said dropped 20% in the quarter. It sounds like your business overall is improving. Just wanted to find out if where that 20% would be sort of in the July timeframe, what that looks like, and which segments saw the greatest declines in the non-sub side? Thank you.\nScott Stephenson: So we - at our call in May, we actually parsed for you the relative impact. We allocated the 20% across the three reporting verticals. I mean, generally, I would say that the sort of the recovery is being felt relatively evenly across the three verticals. We have noted in July even some positives in each of the three verticals. The one that I - personally I'm going to watch the closest is the recovery in sort of ad spending and how that relates to our revenues on the spend-informed analytics side in Verisk Financial, but as I say, all three verticals are showing that same upward movement.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari of Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nHamzah Mazari: My first question is just on the Insurance segment. As it relates to COVID-19, I know it's a fluid situation, but if P&C insurance companies are on the hook for COVID claims, maybe you could walk us through what you're hearing there, how it impacts your business? A couple of years ago, customer consolidation was a headwind. Claims tend to be good for you. And so I'm just trying to parse out how you think about that, just the puts and takes there?\nScott Stephenson: Yes. You actually had several points in there. Let me begin and then Mark, if you'd like to add anything. Specific to the idea of claims as they relate to the business interruption line of insurance, our view is - and we come from a very informed place because we actually author the contract language that goes into the policy is that it's really pretty clear that unless otherwise explicitly stated, and generally it's not explicitly stated, that business interruption insurance does not cover losses related to pandemics. And that's not to say that there won't be some court cases, maybe businesses which have taken out business interruption insurance naturally would like to be covered. But in reality, if you read the language carefully, our reading is that it's pretty clear. So we don't think that there is some substantial discontinuous event that's going to happen for our customers as a function of COVID-19 and claims related to business interruption. It is true that, that activity inside the insurance industry is a positive for us. The insurance companies remained quite active in the second quarter will remain quite active. Our customer demography actually doesn't change very much with the exception that as the InsurTechs come into being, we actually do very well with them. But the existing insurance companies, they really has - the pace of consolidation really is not all that great. And we don't see anything in the - in this moment that would stimulate that to higher rates. Mark, anything you want to add to that?\nMark Anquillare: Yes, I think I would just highlight or echo a couple of things you said. I think the language that we use in our programs have pretty clear - clearly states that the effort around pandemic or the situation around pandemic will not affect the property, and the property is really what's the key to coverage. There are other programs out there, especially on the reinsurance side, where some of this business interruption and the effects of pandemic will be invoked. So I think some programs, some insurers will have some payments to make and it's could be quite sizable. I think the other thing that kind of factors into the insurance economics is the commercial lines premium. I think what we're going to see probably in 2020 is a combination of exposures and premiums down 5% to 6%. We do believe from a forecast perspective that those rates, the actual premium rate itself, as well as the exposures will rebound in 2021, so that may affect some insurers. I think overall, we don't see that as something that is systematically problematic. I think during these times, insurers look to focus on underwriting discipline and a lot of the actuarial and underwriting solutions we provide them, what I'll refer to is that grounding. So hopefully, that provides color.\nHamzah Mazari: Thank you. My follow-up question is just around your commercial sales organization. We've talked about investing in software. We've been in an elevated investment spend cycle as it relates to CapEx on new products, et cetera. Financial Services, there have been some changes in restructuring. Have you changed sort of the commercial sales organization structure at all as it relates to either compensation or how it's structured from a vertical standpoint or has it been just pretty consistent over the last several years?\nScott Stephenson: The go-to-market teams are specific to the three verticals, and even within that, we have a multi-tier approach where we have account representation, as well as product specialists. The way that we take our products to market has not changed. What we sell is complex. Our products need to be explained. They need to be demonstrated. Very frequently, there have to be proofs-of-concept, followed by trials before we get to enterprise-wide agreements. So it's a process that takes time. We're good at it. We've done it for a long time, and we continue to do it the way that we have done it in the past. We're always open to and actually even interested to add teammates, who as the solution set expands, can take them to market and help customers find the value but in terms of the sort of the general approach, no. We've done it successfully for a long time and we're not going to fiddle with our successful model.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm of UBS. Your line is now open.\nAlex Kramm: First one is a follow-up to Toni's question when she asked about kind of what you saw during the quarter. And can you be a little bit more specific maybe on that 20%, how it trended in April, May, June and maybe even into July, so we can just see the trajectory? And if there's any incremental color you can give what areas you think will improve over the course of the year? I guess, trying to get to the trajectory a little bit, any help you can give us would be helpful?\nScott Stephenson: Lee, anything you want to add to your comments in the upfront part of the meeting?\nLee Shavel: Sure. Yes, thanks, Alex. So we're not going to get into kind of monthly results, but what I will reinforce is that within the segments, we saw the underlying causal impacts improve. And so, perhaps this is helpful, for instance, in Insurance, as we saw that driving activity begin to kick in that, that clearly had a positive impact. And so across the quarter for the COVID-sensitive revenues, that 15%, we saw sequential improvement across the quarter and that improvement continued into July. Obviously, we're continuing to deal with a lot of uncertainty in terms of the impact across the country and how that impacts overall driving activity, but at least through July, we saw a continued trend of improvement on that front. Within Energy and Specialized Markets, we also saw a - an improvement through the quarter and we are beginning to see some signs of re-engagement around the consulting side of the equation. I do think that with that component, there is going to be a longer-term or I should say a longer period in which that recovers, as the timing of the response from our Energy clients is going to follow the CapEx trend a little bit more closely in comparison to the driving activity, where we're seeing that rebound more quickly. So I think if you think about the timing of that recover - recovery, we are expecting that, that will take a little bit longer, but into July, we were beginning to see improvements. And then finally in our Financial Services business, a lot of this relates to, it's kind of a blend of two dimensions. One is the advertising component, which is down, but is showing recovery, and so that's more like the auto activity. But we also have the project analytics and the retained analytics from the banks that probably have a somewhat slower recovery result as a - in response to the COVID-19. So those are some of the factors, but within each of those categories, there are multiple products with different degrees of severity, but across them all, we did see improvement through the second quarter and have seen a continuation of that into July. And that's probably as much textures I can give you, Alex.\nAlex Kramm: No, that's good texture. Thank you. A similar question maybe on the subscription side. You mentioned the sales cycles are lengthening, not surprising. Any kind of dimensions you can put around that? And maybe related to that, how is the pipeline looking today versus maybe a quarter ago?\nLee Shavel: Yes.\nScott Stephenson: Pipeline is good. Go ahead, Lee. Go ahead.\nLee Shavel: Sure. Sorry. Yes, so, Alex, it - you have - I would just describe it generally as a lengthening and so that can vary depending upon the project, again factoring in that we have a lot of different projects with different lead times, it's probably not useful to generalize across that. But we are seeing - what has been described by the salesforce as getting all of the stakeholders together with the disruptions is taking a little longer to get that done. So that's what I would call kind of the back-end of the pipeline closest to contract. However, at the front-end of the pipeline, as indicated by the increase in the sales calls, our engagement with clients, we're actually seeing a fairly healthy level of engagement on that front, I think because of the accessibility and the demand for our products. So we feel very good about what we've been able to generate from a pipeline perspective despite the disruptions. And I think that feeds into a longer-term perspective, meaning, as Scott indicated, we believe that in many ways, the pressures - the operating pressures that COVID-19 has put on our client sets within all of the verticals recommends and encourages more utilization of our product sets and analytic platforms to support what they do. There is more pressure on them to digitize more aspects of their operations, and we think that's very constructive for the long-term opportunity within Verisk and why we feel confident our growth drivers remain certainly not diminished, but probably enhanced as a result of what people - of what our clients have to react to.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee of Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nDavid Chu: This is David Chu for Gary. Just wondering, is there a lag effect to the 85% that is subscription. So just wondering, if net new sales is trending below the 6.5% organic that you mentioned?\nScott Stephenson: Well, the nature of the subscription business that we have, first of all, a lot of that is multi-year, and multi-year agreements feature price escalators year-over-year. A good fraction of it also is perpetually renewing, particularly as it relates to sort of the traditional rules, forms and loss costs that we provide in the Insurance vertical. So there is actually - there is a great deal of not just stability, but actually momentum associated with the 85% because of the way that we contract with our customers. And so when we talk about sales cycles, we're really talking about the cross-selling of a solution which hasn't been used by a customer in the past or a brand-new solution into the marketplace. And I think, Lee, was really taking pains to try to describe that our - we're going to move with our customers and - at the rate that, that they want to move. And I think he put his finger on exactly the right issue, which is just - it's a big decision when customers decide to subscribe to one or more of our solutions. These are high-ticket items. And it's not as if - it's not as if the consideration has fundamentally changed from - we're thinking about it in the year 2020 to like, don't even talk to me about it until the year 2021. It's much more just them having found their feet underneath them in the COVID moment. And now as they try to organize to make what is a material decision to buy one of our solutions, they just have to pull themselves together basically. But it's not as if the fundamental decision matrix for them has changed. The value - the value proposition is the same. And this relates to the emergence or the cross-sell than it does to the thing which is already established. And again, there is momentum inside of an exist - most existing subscription contracts because they are multi-year and they do have price escalators.\nDavid Chu: And just has implementation of new products have been an issue in this work-from-home environment?\nScott Stephenson: Not at all.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler of Baird. Your line is now open.\nJeff Meuler: Scott, when you - in your prepared remarks, when you talked about the long-term benefits to Verisk of the digital transformation of your customers, you've talked not only about there - them being more desirous to use your solutions, but also their capabilities to consume what you provide. I guess just that on a capability point, how much of a barrier is that today? And maybe if you could illustrate the point with how it - how it's different to your business with one of the InsurTechs that you do well with or with a traditional carrier that's further along with their digital transformation?\nScott Stephenson: Yes. So actually, I like the way you framed the question, Jeff, because I'm going to generalize a point here and that is that as I observed some of the InsurTechs which are kind of borne from whole cloth and essentially platforms into more - a more modern infrastructure. They are borne with a more modern infrastructure. I find their rate of adoption to be really high. And so it actually is a demonstration of what we're talking about here. Those who are more naturally able to connect to, to integrate, to consume from inside of an API to render content from the outside into their own environment quickly or even more importantly, to actually plant a platforms analytic environment right in the middle of their workflows, a company which is in that condition is able to consume the next thing from us just that much more easily. And as - really, I think there really is - there really is an observation there about the relative ease with which some of the InsurTechs are able to begin to work with what we provide them. And what it comes down to fundamentally is that, they have their own backlog of technology-oriented projects that they have - that they have to work through. And sometimes, one of those technology-oriented projects might be them doing whatever it is that they need to do in their environment in order to adopt one of our solutions. We've seen this many, many times over in much of what we do actually. And to the extent that they are actually able - they're more - they're more naturally digital, they'll be able to work through these kinds of implementations that much faster. And so I don't think it - I don't think that it - the - when they do their own ROI calculation on making use of one of our solutions, their cost of implementation in most cases is - there is something there, but it really isn't going to make the difference in terms of whether or not to make use of our solutions. Maybe with some of our thickest platforms that might be there a little bit more. So my point here is that the fundamental interest in making more use of what it is that we do, the ease of implementation is a part of it, but also as they become more analytic in the way that they make their own decision-making, the value of the content that we bring just stands up that much taller. And so there is also something about their own analytic environment and the quality of their analytic environment. And so at the intersection of I can get you implemented faster and I can make more use of this unique perspective that you've got Verisk. The value proposition just stands up even higher.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas of William Blair. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Nicholas: It looks like at a geographic level, growth in the US was a bit stronger than international in the quarter. I'm assuming that's primarily a function of business mix and secondarily, exposure to transactional revenue. But I was wondering, if there is anything else to call out in terms of regional growth differences in the period?\nScott Stephenson: No, I mean, I think you really caught it inside of your question. As many folks know, we're excited about the growth of our international business. And we have - we have a variety of ways that we try to grow our international business. And in the early stages of developing a market, one of the things that's kind of a natural feature of our businesses that some of it may be more transactional in the early going. Customers when they are getting used to a new solution often want to start out in the transactional mode and/or it's just that much faster in terms of getting established with the customer. With time what we've generally found is customers would prefer to move towards a subscription model, where they have certainty about what they're going to be paying for what they get, but that's not always the case when they get started. So international being a newer part of our mix overall, it's not surprising that in this unique moment, there might have been a little bit of a difference there. Don't expect that to relate to the long-term growth picture.\nAndrew Nicholas: And then I was hoping you could provide an update on your relationship with Vexcel, how that partnership has performed this year relative to your expectations? And as it stands today, if you could just evaluate or speak to your evaluation of how those capabilities and that functionality is replacing Geomni?\nScott Stephenson: Sure. Mark is one of our two Board members at Vexcel. So, Mark, would you take that on, please?\nMark Anquillare: Yes, absolutely. So what we attempted to do and I think pretty successfully is separate what is image capture, where we thought there was about opportunity to scale and provide what I'll refer to as greater coverage by combining the two companies. So if I was to think about that as job one, the combination of what I'll refer to as the Geomni image capture and Vexcel image capture has quite considerably increased the coverage in the United States. That is a combination of all of North America, U.S. and Canada, but it also has two different types of coverage, kind of that high up across the landscape and then that more higher resolution five - North-South-East-West views of things. What we're also being able to do is start to extend geographically. So now we have access to imagery across Europe and in certain parts of Asia-Pacific. So there we have opportunities to leverage that analytic, and I think we've been quite successful. On the Geomni front, where we're continuing to be focused on advanced analytics, a, we have more data to work with, so our algorithms, our machine is better and improved, and, of course, because we have more coverage, we can provide more analytic across various places. So let me give you an example. We now have the ability to take some of the weather analytics we have, put it on top of all this imagery and provide kind of a triage tool for analytic purposes and that's not just in the United States, but we can go throughout the world where we have that coverage. So I hope that provides you a little bit of color, the combination of leverage in getting access to all those images, we still have that from a Geomni perspective, and I think at Vexcel because they're doing it once instead of twice, there's a lot of scale and leverage there, so they're doing it cheaper.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Steinerman: Lee, I was wondering if you'd be willing to comment if Verisk expects company EBITDA margins to be up year-over-year just directionally, up year-over-year directionally in the second half of the year, and what puts and takes you might want to be willing to call out in terms of things that would affect the EBITDA margins in the second half of this year?\nLee Shavel: Andrew, thanks for the question. As you know, we don't provide forward-looking statements on the results. We're constantly looking to make certain that the operating leverage that we have in the business is expressed, and we certainly think that this quarter demonstrates the underlying operating leverage and our ability to manage that. So certainly, in this case, it's I think a very important differentiation period for us as we are dealing with some of the revenue impacts, but it shows one kind of the responsiveness of the cost structure, our ability to manage headcount growth in order to control growth in expenses, as well as achieve operating leverage through each of the businesses. So our focus is on managing the operations and expense business to deliver that operating leverage, and we're constantly working to achieve improvement of that over on a year-over-year basis.\nAndrew Steinerman: And some of the expenses that were held back in the second quarter, will they naturally come back in the second half of the year like, could you just highlight what you expect in terms of what types of expenses to come back?\nLee Shavel: So, I mean, I talked about this earlier, Andrew. So we have - there are two primary elements that I think are influencing the margin, excluding the LTI impact, but T&E is down materially as a result of COVID-19. So as the impact of that abates as we begin to engage in a more normalized environment, you're going to expect that some of that will come back. I referred earlier to the fact that we will probably try to hold on to some of the efficiencies in part, but there is no substitute to being in front of the clients in person, but we're going to follow the clients in that regard. And then the second element is compensation, and two pieces of that, one, which is our incentive compensation which is tied to growth, and so that is going to be impacted by our revenue growth and our earnings growth impacts. But the second element is our headcount growth, and there we are managing that to be appropriate and consistent with the revenue growth impacts, so that we can maintain that operating leverage. Those are the primary expense elements that I think are in flux in the second quarter. And you can certainly expect we will continue to be influenced by COVID-19 and our active management of that cost structure in the second half of the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nBill Warmington: Good morning, everyone. So CoreLogic going to [Marshall Swift/Boeckh], which competes with exactly in the residential property space MSPs towards the more weighted in the underwriting and exactly what we claimed. A couple of weeks ago, CoreLogic announced a lot of fanfare the competitive takeaway of Swift/Boeckh. How big a threat is CoreLogic's new property insurance solution in a way, is it a change in the competitive landscape?\nScott Stephenson: Mark, do you want to start with that one?\nMark Anquillare: Sure. So let me just remind you, Marshall effect is a tool used to understand the replacement cost value to understand the cost you have on your home. So what's the replacement value, what CoreLogic also has, it's a tool called stability which they acquired a couple of years ago. These tools have been in the market for decades. I don't see or we haven't seen any material investment too clearly because Symbility is now part of CoreLogic they've talked about the two combined. I would tell you that we continue to closely monitor all of our wins and losses. We are on it every single month. We understand where the incumbent and there's a break-off. We understand where there is an incumbent. We do this beyond CoreLogic's only not be overly specific here. But what I will tell you as we continue to win much more frequently than we lose and that's the story that we have been kind of on. We\u2019re probably five years now, I think we've been trying to share that at various Investor Days and I think the message and the direction remains very similar. So I think we're pleased with our competitive advantages, I think we're very pleased with where we are in the market. And I don't want to address the specific customer, but I'm not aware of that particular situation now.\nBill Warmington: And then a follow-up on LightSpeed I wanted to ask whether COVID-19 has impacted the usage and the adoption of the product?\nScott Stephenson: I'm sorry, LightSpeed was your question Bill?\nBill Warmington: LightSpeed, the POS system.\nMark Anquillare: So Scott, you want me to continue?\nScott Stephenson: Yes, please continue.\nMark Anquillare: So, let me remind you LightSpeed is our tool by which we're taking a lot of information and data and moving it forward in the underwriting process. Hopefully over time eliminating the separation between what is the quote and then separately binding later on. We want to make that one process upfront, season quote in buying with confidence. And we're bringing in both our data, third-party data and scoring in such a way that you have confidence in that information. And that has been quite a bit - we\u2019re seeing quite a bit of success, both on the personal lines and now moving into the commercial line side of things. So the one point I'll make is back to Lee\u2019s comments earlier during the middle of the COVID there was less driving. At the same time, I think many personal auto policyholders were kind of waiting for maybe their refunds from insurers. So there was less shopping, there was less people going online and seeing if they can get better quote. So we did see some decreased volumes, but as Lee described, we've seen that slowly return as driving has increased. So hopefully that's responsive to your question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nGeorge Tong: After normalizing for the LTIs shift, your EBITDA margins expanded much more materially in your Insurance segment than your Energy and Financial Services segment. Can you elaborate on what drove that relative outperformance if it was related to be amount of investment spending in the other segments or other one-time cost actions impacting the insurance segment more?\nScott Stephenson: Lee would you take that please?\nLee Shavel: Yes, George one element that I think is a significant contributor to the insurance margin specifically that is probably - the largest factor is that as a result of the Vexcel transaction. We have been able as we've talked about in the past of reducing the expenses associated with that activity. And so that is - part of that margin improvement or a large part of that margin improvement not solely related to it is a function of that expense reduction specific to insurance. That being said, we still saw a very solid margin expansion even absent that effect within the business, but that probably is the significant element of the differentiation.\nScott Stephenson: George, are you still there?\nGeorge Tong: Yes, thank you. Turning to the Financial Services segment when you divested the Argus Data Warehousing business, the underlying growth rate for the segment improved pretty meaningfully to the 5% to 7% range before COVID. I guess I'm surprised to see organic constant currency growth down as much it is - as it is. Can you help unpack why Financial Services revenue declined as much as it did, especially given how you indicated that of the 20% of non-sub revenues impacted by COVID only 3% and some financial services?\nScott Stephenson: Yes so, George let me - so keeping in mind put that 3% in the context of financial services as a percentage of our total overall revenue. And so on a proportional basis it's a - that transactional element is a larger element relative to the other businesses. And so, if you take that and you recognize that we've had consulting impacts with regard to the retained analytics and the project analytics that had impacted that's kind of a similar effect of what we've seen in energy on the consulting business, that's one dimension. And then we also have the pullback in advertising and so when our spent informed analytics business, the lower level of advertising is having a primary causal impact from COVID-19. So both of those are influencing the revenue growth and there is a higher concentration of that COVID-19 sensitivity to overall revenues that is resulting in a bigger revenue impact in comparison to the others.\nOperator: No further questions from the phone line. Presenters you may continue.\nScott Stephenson: Okay, well thank you everybody for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your interest, your questions, we'll be following up with many of you. And so, I appreciate your time today. Have a great rest of the day. Bye for now.\nMark Anquillare: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Lee Shavel",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. Moving to the financial results for the quarter, on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 4% to $679 million, while net income increased 19% to $179 million. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 20% to $1.08 for the second quarter 2020. The year-over-year increase in GAAP net income and EPS is primarily the result of organic growth in the business, cost discipline, the impact of the timing shift of a $10 million expense related to annual long-term equity incentive grants and a decrease in acquisition-related costs. Moving to our organic constant currency results adjusted for non-operating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release. We are pleased with our operating results, particularly in light of the impact from COVID-19. On an organic constant currency basis, Verisk delivered revenue growth of 1.1% for the second quarter of 2020. This growth was driven by positive results in our Insurance segment, offset in part by modest declines in Energy and Specialized Markets and Financial Services. Normalizing for the $8 million revenue impact of the injunction on roof measurement solutions, revenue grew 2.4%. As we detailed last quarter and Scott mentioned in his prepared remarks, we completed a careful review of our solutions and services to evaluate the potential exposure to COVID-19 impacts. Through that exercise, we noted that we did not expect to see any material impact from COVID-19 on approximately 85% of our consolidated revenues because they were generally subscriptions or subject to long-term contracts. As such, in the second quarter, those revenues grew approximately 6.5% on an organic constant currency basis when normalized for the injunction. This speaks to the stability of our subscription business model. Moreover, as we expected, we did experience a negative impact from COVID-19 on certain of our products and services, largely transactional in nature, which represent the balance or 15% of our consolidated revenues. These revenues declined approximately 20% on an organic constant currency basis during the second quarter, owing to weakness in the underlying causal factors, including lower auto and travel insurance activity, the inability to enter commercial buildings to perform engineering analysis, decreased capital expenditures in the Energy sector and reduced levels of advertising spending and project-based work from the banks. While we did experience revenue declines in this group of products and services in each month of the quarter, as the underlying causal impacts began to diminish, we did see some of the pressure on our revenues abate. For example, we have seen trends improve sequentially in our auto insurance lines as driving mileage has recovered and are also experiencing improvement in our commercial surveys, as our field staff is now allowed to enter buildings. On the Energy side, the macro backdrop continues to pressure consulting, but trends seem to have stabilized, and we are starting to have early discussions with the strongest operators about future engagements. The net result is that we have experienced continued progress in sequential revenue improvement throughout the second quarter and into July. Despite the impact on revenue in the second quarter, we are pleased to report that we maintained strong EBITDA growth and expanded margins as the result of effective expense and headcount management. Organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth was 12.4% in the second quarter, and normalizing for the impact of the injunction and the LTI timing shift, organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA increased 11.6%. Total adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter, which includes both organic and inorganic revenue and adjusted EBITDA was 51.3% in the quarter. This margin included a one-time benefit of approximately 150 basis points from the previously communicated timing shift of annual LTI grants. Despite the expense control driving EBITDA growth and margin improvement, we continue to invest substantially in our business and infrastructure, including our cloud transition, and those costs are reflected in this margin as well. On that note, let's return - let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. As you see in the press release, Insurance reported 2.5% growth, while our adjusted EBITDA increased 13.8% for the quarter. We saw healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, catastrophe modeling solutions and repair cost estimating solutions, offset by the impact of the injunction on roof measurement solutions and a decline in certain transactional revenue that was negatively impacted by COVID-19. Normalizing for the impact of the injunction and LTI timing, Insurance would have achieved 4.3% organic constant currency revenue growth and 13.8% organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth, demonstrating strong margin expansion despite certain revenue declines and investment in our breakout areas. Energy and Specialized Markets revenue decreased 2.8% in the second quarter due to declines in consulting and implementation projects and lower events revenues across the Energy segment. We were very pleased to see continued growth in our subscription-based core research and data analytic platforms, environmental health and safety service solutions and weather analytic solutions, resulting in outperformance relative to the end market. We believe our strong performance is a function of the must-have nature of our solutions, the diversification of our revenue streams into breakout areas like the Energy transition practice and the strength of our relationships in the industry. Despite the revenue declines and normalized for the LTI timing, adjusted EBITDA grew 2.4% in the second quarter, driven by strong operational controls and modest actions taken to reduce headcount to be more balanced with the current level of consulting work. Financial Services revenue declined 2.7%, owing to weakness in project-based retained analytics and spend-informed analytics, as our bank customers reduced spending due to the pandemic. Despite decreased spending across the banking industry, we experienced growth in our subscription businesses, an area that has been a strategic focus for us over the last six quarters. Normalizing for the LTI timing, organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA remained flat for the quarter, while margins declined owing to portfolio actions we closed earlier in the year. Our reported effective tax rate was 20.4% for the quarter compared to 19.7% in the prior year quarter. Looking forward, we now believe that our full-year tax rate for 2020 will be between 21% and 23%, up from the 19% to 21% range we had previously provided. This is primarily the result of UK legislation that was enacted in July, but retroactive back to April 1st of 2020, that increases the UK corporate tax rate from 17% to 19%. As a result, we will take a one-time catch-up charge in the third quarter of this year related to the valuation of a deferred tax liability, which will likely drive the quarterly rate above the full-year range provided, but we do not anticipate a material long-term impact from this increase. Adjusted net income was $213 million, and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.29 for the second quarter, up 15.8% and 17.3% from the prior year respectively. These increase reflect the cost discipline in the business, lower travel and entertainment expenses, contributions from acquisitions, the above-mentioned timing shift in expense related to annual long-term equity incentive grants and lower average share count. Net cash provided by operating activities was $250 million for the quarter, up 24.6% from the prior year period. Capital expenditures were $57 million for the quarter, up 20.9% from the prior year period, and CapEx represented 8.4% of total revenues in the quarter. We now believe that CapEx in 2020 will likely be toward the higher end of our previously provided range of $250 million to $270 million, as investing in our business and our people continues to be among our highest priorities. Related to CapEx, we now expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization to be within the range of $185 million to $195 million higher than the prior provided range of $170 million to $180 million. This increase is related to the timing of implementation of certain internally developed software projects as we continue to push forward on introducing innovation to the marketplace. We continue to expect intangible amortization to be approximately $165 million in 2020. Free cash flow was $193 million for the quarter, an increase of 25.7% from the prior year, primarily due to an increase in customer collections and operating profit, a reduction in travel and entertainment expense as a result of COVID-19, as well as the deferral of federal income taxes and certain employer payroll taxes resulting from the CARES Act, partially offset by earn-out payments of $65 million. During the second quarter, we returned $119 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. And I'm pleased to report that our Board of Directors has approved a $0.27 per share dividend for the third quarter to be paid in September. As we detailed last quarter, we continue to believe that the collective causal factors from COVID-19 represent pressure on achieving our 7% long-term growth objective in 2020. However, we do not think they represent a structural change in our fundamental growth drivers and believe that as the underlying causal factors abate, we will show strong resilience in recovery. Each of these causal factors has its own recovery curve, making it difficult to predict the duration of the impacts to our revenue growth. We continue to have confidence in our ability to manage the cost structure effectively and deliver operating leverage, while also continuing to invest in our innovation agenda. While we have restricted headcount growth in the shorter-term, we will pace new hiring as we see a return to a more normalized operating environment. Taking this altogether, we continue to believe that the stability of our subscription revenues along with our core operating leverage, driven by the responsiveness of our compensation structure and cost discipline will continue to support revenue and EBITDA growth in 2020. We hope this provides some useful context for you, and we look forward to addressing your questions. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. We ask for the Q&A session that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. And with that, I will ask the operator to open the line for questions. Sure, absolutely. Thank you, Toni. So, I think your observation, I agree with Toni, I would say once you eliminate the LTI impact, as we've indicated about 150 basis points and then look at, as I typically described at the businesses on a pre-investment basis, we are still seeing strong margin improvement across the three businesses. And to give you some kind of some sense of the overall contribution in the margin, the reduction in T&E was approximately 150 basis points and the short-term kind of the compensation impact was about 100 basis points. So naturally, that's a function of the growth impact that it relates to the overall improvement. So we are having kind of the, what you might describe as the COVID-19 impact on our cost structure that is benefiting us in that period. But there are efficiencies that we are - have identified that I think will enhance our operating leverage ahead. Some of that it relates to the nature of our sales function and the sales productivity. We don't expect to be in this completely remote format for an extended period of time, but we have found potential efficiencies that may improve the margin on a longer-term basis. So I think there are some structural elements that we've identified that will persist, but clearly a significant part of this margin improvement is a function of the responsiveness of our cost structure and the actions that we've taken to manage headcount. So it's as always, a blend of a lot of different factors that are influencing margin. Sure. Yes, thanks, Alex. So we're not going to get into kind of monthly results, but what I will reinforce is that within the segments, we saw the underlying causal impacts improve. And so, perhaps this is helpful, for instance, in Insurance, as we saw that driving activity begin to kick in that, that clearly had a positive impact. And so across the quarter for the COVID-sensitive revenues, that 15%, we saw sequential improvement across the quarter and that improvement continued into July. Obviously, we're continuing to deal with a lot of uncertainty in terms of the impact across the country and how that impacts overall driving activity, but at least through July, we saw a continued trend of improvement on that front. Within Energy and Specialized Markets, we also saw a - an improvement through the quarter and we are beginning to see some signs of re-engagement around the consulting side of the equation. I do think that with that component, there is going to be a longer-term or I should say a longer period in which that recovers, as the timing of the response from our Energy clients is going to follow the CapEx trend a little bit more closely in comparison to the driving activity, where we're seeing that rebound more quickly. So I think if you think about the timing of that recover - recovery, we are expecting that, that will take a little bit longer, but into July, we were beginning to see improvements. And then finally in our Financial Services business, a lot of this relates to, it's kind of a blend of two dimensions. One is the advertising component, which is down, but is showing recovery, and so that's more like the auto activity. But we also have the project analytics and the retained analytics from the banks that probably have a somewhat slower recovery result as a - in response to the COVID-19. So those are some of the factors, but within each of those categories, there are multiple products with different degrees of severity, but across them all, we did see improvement through the second quarter and have seen a continuation of that into July. And that's probably as much textures I can give you, Alex. Yes. Sure. Sorry. Yes, so, Alex, it - you have - I would just describe it generally as a lengthening and so that can vary depending upon the project, again factoring in that we have a lot of different projects with different lead times, it's probably not useful to generalize across that. But we are seeing - what has been described by the salesforce as getting all of the stakeholders together with the disruptions is taking a little longer to get that done. So that's what I would call kind of the back-end of the pipeline closest to contract. However, at the front-end of the pipeline, as indicated by the increase in the sales calls, our engagement with clients, we're actually seeing a fairly healthy level of engagement on that front, I think because of the accessibility and the demand for our products. So we feel very good about what we've been able to generate from a pipeline perspective despite the disruptions. And I think that feeds into a longer-term perspective, meaning, as Scott indicated, we believe that in many ways, the pressures - the operating pressures that COVID-19 has put on our client sets within all of the verticals recommends and encourages more utilization of our product sets and analytic platforms to support what they do. There is more pressure on them to digitize more aspects of their operations, and we think that's very constructive for the long-term opportunity within Verisk and why we feel confident our growth drivers remain certainly not diminished, but probably enhanced as a result of what people - of what our clients have to react to. Andrew, thanks for the question. As you know, we don't provide forward-looking statements on the results. We're constantly looking to make certain that the operating leverage that we have in the business is expressed, and we certainly think that this quarter demonstrates the underlying operating leverage and our ability to manage that. So certainly, in this case, it's I think a very important differentiation period for us as we are dealing with some of the revenue impacts, but it shows one kind of the responsiveness of the cost structure, our ability to manage headcount growth in order to control growth in expenses, as well as achieve operating leverage through each of the businesses. So our focus is on managing the operations and expense business to deliver that operating leverage, and we're constantly working to achieve improvement of that over on a year-over-year basis. So, I mean, I talked about this earlier, Andrew. So we have - there are two primary elements that I think are influencing the margin, excluding the LTI impact, but T&E is down materially as a result of COVID-19. So as the impact of that abates as we begin to engage in a more normalized environment, you're going to expect that some of that will come back. I referred earlier to the fact that we will probably try to hold on to some of the efficiencies in part, but there is no substitute to being in front of the clients in person, but we're going to follow the clients in that regard. And then the second element is compensation, and two pieces of that, one, which is our incentive compensation which is tied to growth, and so that is going to be impacted by our revenue growth and our earnings growth impacts. But the second element is our headcount growth, and there we are managing that to be appropriate and consistent with the revenue growth impacts, so that we can maintain that operating leverage. Those are the primary expense elements that I think are in flux in the second quarter. And you can certainly expect we will continue to be influenced by COVID-19 and our active management of that cost structure in the second half of the year. Yes, George one element that I think is a significant contributor to the insurance margin specifically that is probably - the largest factor is that as a result of the Vexcel transaction. We have been able as we've talked about in the past of reducing the expenses associated with that activity. And so that is - part of that margin improvement or a large part of that margin improvement not solely related to it is a function of that expense reduction specific to insurance. That being said, we still saw a very solid margin expansion even absent that effect within the business, but that probably is the significant element of the differentiation."

            "content": "Yes, sure, certainly, Scott. First thing is we're very, very pleased in terms of our subscription business, how robust that business has been. And as Scott and Lee mentioned, it grew through the second quarter. Whilst we had, as we predicted on the transactional, both the consulting and the event side, that was more of a challenge. When we look at the Wood Mackenzie in the Energy Specialized business, it's a fundamentally different business than it was four years or five years ago at the time of the acquisition. At that time, the majority of our revenue was more exposed to the upstream side. Today, that, that part of the business is less than 50% of our business. Just as Scott mentioned, we're much more focused on the Energy transition and all the key growth areas, which will drive the business in the longer-term."
        },

            "name": "Scott Stephenson",
            "content": "Thanks, Stacey. Good day, everyone, and I'm glad to be with you today. The second quarter was unique as we dealt with the macro effects of the COVID-19 event, and I hope you and your families continue to stay well in this moment. At Verisk, our priorities are unchanged as we remain committed to delivering for our customers, protecting the health and well-being of our 9,000 plus teammates and continuing to drive our innovation agenda. I'm pleased, but not surprised that our second quarter results reflect the strength and stability of our business model, the mission-critical nature of our solutions and the hard work and resilience of our teammates, who quickly adapted to the work-from-home environment and have remained focused on customer needs and innovation. I'm proud of our team and want to thank each teammate for their dedication and focus during a fluid moment. Before we discuss the quarter, I want to make two related points about where Verisk stands. First, we believe that the net effect of the COVID-19 moment should benefit Verisk in the long run, given that our customers will persevere and make it through to the other side with even more focus on becoming the better digital versions of themselves. This should make our customers more capable and desirous of using our many solutions. And second, the consistent performance you see from us now and into the future is a function of our structure and position and not only cyclical or momentary effects. Our results are a function of the steady and ongoing accumulation of innovation and success with customers. Our business performed as we had expected in the second quarter. We previously communicated to you our analysis that approximately 85% of our revenues are subscription-based and subject to long-term contracts, and therefore, we did not see any material impact on these revenues from the COVID-19 environment. In the second quarter, those revenues grew approximately 6.5% on an organic constant currency basis when normalized for the one-time impact of the injunction related to roof measurement solutions. Of the remaining 15% of revenues that are more transactional in nature and are subject to COVID-19 impacts, those revenues declined approximately 20% on an organic constant currency basis in the second quarter in line with our expectations. We experienced sequential improvement throughout the quarter and into July, as the underlying causal factors began to diminish and we expect to see continued progress on that front. During March, as the expense of the pandemic became clear, we quickly moved to action and deliberately protected profitability without, and this is important, cutting investment in our business. We did this by moderating headcount growth, but without resorting to large scale furloughs or layoffs by focusing on operational discipline and by benefiting from the natural responsiveness of our compensation structure. Together, these actions delivered strong organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth. Even while delivering strong profitability, we continue to fund investments in our innovation agenda and continued monetizing our technical infrastructure through cloud migration, tokenization of key data sets and leading-edge data fabric supporting great analytics as we have done for the last several years. We will provide more details on our performance in its financial review. During the second quarter, Verisk operated predominantly in a work-from-home environment and our teams across the organization have remained highly effective. Operationally, our computing and network capacity has consistently and comfortably exceeded our daily requirements even as demand for our solutions and platforms have increased meaningfully in this remote environment. For example, in our Insurance segment, usage of our digital claims settlement tool increased over 55% in the second quarter. And we are successfully converting free trials into paid subscriptions as customers realize the benefit of this new innovative platform to help them on their journey to becoming more digitally engaged. And in the energy vertical, we saw visits to our portal grow by over 40%, as customers value our content, particularly in moments of uncertainty. We moved our innovation agenda forward evidenced by our continued investment across the enterprise. And the use of digital collaboration tools has helped our team stay connected to develop new and updated solutions for our customers. A few examples. In Insurance, we launched a new micro-business insurance program with advisory forms, rules and loss costs, specifically for the small businesses. This program is designed to help insurers cover the unique risks of micro-businesses that are often part of the gig economy, often operated out of home or shared spaces and having fewer than four employees. We also released an updated cyber risk modeling platform and launched Life Risk Navigator, our cloud-based stochastic risk modeling platform that offers in-depth portfolio analytics, which can enhance risk selection, quantify changes in mortality rates, improve hedging strategies and drive better financial decision-making for our life insurance customers. In our catastrophe modeling business, we have released Version 8 of our Touchstone platform, which includes timely updates for many of our models in the U.S., Australia and the Caribbean, and continues to fulfill our innovation promise. In Energy and Specialized Markets, we continue to push forward with our differentiated analytic platform called Lens, and are on track for further releases in the back half of the year related to upstream portfolio optimization, renewables and carbon emissions. Despite the softness in the Energy market, we continue to see demand from our customers for Lens, which is reflected in both adoption and constructive pricing. Also within our Energy segment, we launched a solution in April, which analyzes pandemic-related supply chain risk and allows our Energy customers to anticipate potential disruptions in their business operations. We are currently enhancing the existing solution by adding data sets from across Verisk that address additional elements of supply chain risks such as vulnerability of suppliers to extreme events, the environmental, social and governance risk factors that suppliers may pose and movements and commodity markets impacting supplier costs. And in Financial Services, our loan loss forecasting model called LookAhead is gaining momentum with customers as it helps them understand the changes to their anticipated loan loss curves related to government stimulus programs, trends in unemployment and COVID-19 generally. This solution is unique to the marketplace given that it is founded on the total customer wallet view data set, which is proprietary to Verisk Financial Services. On the sales front, our teams have adjusted nicely to a fully digital sales model. To help our salesforce adjust to the virtual environment, we developed a series of trainings for best practices. We use virtual tools, including Skype, Zoom, Teams and Prezi. These sessions were very effective in making our sales teams comfortable with the new format. Outreach to our customers is robust, and with customers in their home offices, we have found they are often more reachable than ever. As a result, calls with customers increased over 50% in the second quarter versus the prior year. In addition, we successfully converted most of our scheduled in-person customer events to virtual events. Virtual events have enabled us to increase reach and attendance, including at our Signature London-based InsurTech Event in June called Verisk Vision, which saw a 63% increase in attendance this year versus the prior year's in-person gathering. Additionally, we hosted 48 webinars across our Insurance segment in quarter two, and had over 8,000 customers in attendance, which is more than a doubling versus last year. In Energy, we hosted a number of virtual events throughout the second quarter, delivering thought leadership and content to more than 3,000 clients and prospects. We continue to invest in the virtual space and make enhancements to our platform. We've decided that all events for the remainder of the year will be virtual and we're making plans accordingly. Virtual engagement with customers extends to the executive level. It is clear from these discussions that the pandemic has heightened the recognition among our customers that they need to become more digital and more automated and to do so at pace. At the CEO level, I have also been pleased to maintain a steady and high degree of contact with our customers' CEOs in the virtual moments. Like me, our customers' CEOs are highly focused on the well-being and productivity of their teams and consider the further digitization of their companies to be a highest priority. I continue to receive feedback along two lines, one, Verisk is a unique and differentiated partner; and two, our customers look to us for a steady stream of innovation to help them on the journey to becoming more digital and more automated. Even with a video screen between us, the depth of alignment and degree of mutual respect is as high as ever. The net result of all this activity across all levels is that sales opportunities and our pipelines continue to grow, as we capitalize on this structural growth trend. We are experiencing a modest lengthening of our sales cycles across our businesses as compared to historic norms. We are managing this closely and view this more as a timing issue and a function of the complexity of bringing stakeholders together and closing deals in a remote environment. While we have been successfully executing in a work-from-home format, I'm pleased to share that we've begun to open some of our global offices for a safe and phased return to office for those employees who would like to work from the office. In fact, we have opened more than 50 of our global locations in a Phase 1 format over the past few weeks, including our headquarters in Jersey City. I'm hosting this call from our offices, and it feels great to be back in the office. Additionally, as the stay-at-home restrictions have been lifted across the US, we have seen our field force return to a five-day week schedule, so that they can begin to work on the backlog that built up when entering commercial buildings was restricted. I also want to note how pleased we are with the integration and sales momentum of our recent acquisitions, including FAST, BuildFax and Genscape. While still early, we are realizing both revenue and cost synergies consistent with our expectations at the time of those deals. We're monitoring these acquisitions carefully and supporting the management teams to ensure that we are generating a solid return on invested capital. With that, let me turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results. Neal, would you like to speak to that? It's definitely a committed part of our strategy, Manav, in all parts of our business and it is a growing part of the mix. What we talk about all the time at Verisk is the best expression of what we can do for our customers is to provide them platform to analytic environments and great, what we call analytic objects. And the mix of both of those things inside of all of what we do is increasing and it is - and it is a strong focal point. You get kind of an interesting thing if you're trying to parse your revenue streams, taking energy as an example. So Lens is our platform. Moving through that platform is content that customers - some of what moves through that platform is content that customers have made use of through time. And so if we talk about sort of where the - where the revenue stream is headed and growing, it's a little bit artificial to parse how much of that you're attributing to the software that you generated versus the sort of the total platform and the value that the customers find in it. But definitely, software is a growing part of our mix and it's meaningful in all of the verticals. Lee, would you start with that question, please? I would just add, Toni, one item that you didn't have in the ones that you - the factors which you highlighted is the increasing efficiency of our technical infrastructure. So we have been over the last couple of years as many know working to rotate to the cloud, as well as upgrading the data fabric inside of our analytics, and that continues. And as we move forward, the unit cost economics is associated with our technical infrastructure do improve and that's happening now and will continue to happen. So we - at our call in May, we actually parsed for you the relative impact. We allocated the 20% across the three reporting verticals. I mean, generally, I would say that the sort of the recovery is being felt relatively evenly across the three verticals. We have noted in July even some positives in each of the three verticals. The one that I - personally I'm going to watch the closest is the recovery in sort of ad spending and how that relates to our revenues on the spend-informed analytics side in Verisk Financial, but as I say, all three verticals are showing that same upward movement. Yes. You actually had several points in there. Let me begin and then Mark, if you'd like to add anything. Specific to the idea of claims as they relate to the business interruption line of insurance, our view is - and we come from a very informed place because we actually author the contract language that goes into the policy is that it's really pretty clear that unless otherwise explicitly stated, and generally it's not explicitly stated, that business interruption insurance does not cover losses related to pandemics. And that's not to say that there won't be some court cases, maybe businesses which have taken out business interruption insurance naturally would like to be covered. But in reality, if you read the language carefully, our reading is that it's pretty clear. So we don't think that there is some substantial discontinuous event that's going to happen for our customers as a function of COVID-19 and claims related to business interruption. It is true that, that activity inside the insurance industry is a positive for us. The insurance companies remained quite active in the second quarter will remain quite active. Our customer demography actually doesn't change very much with the exception that as the InsurTechs come into being, we actually do very well with them. But the existing insurance companies, they really has - the pace of consolidation really is not all that great. And we don't see anything in the - in this moment that would stimulate that to higher rates. Mark, anything you want to add to that? The go-to-market teams are specific to the three verticals, and even within that, we have a multi-tier approach where we have account representation, as well as product specialists. The way that we take our products to market has not changed. What we sell is complex. Our products need to be explained. They need to be demonstrated. Very frequently, there have to be proofs-of-concept, followed by trials before we get to enterprise-wide agreements. So it's a process that takes time. We're good at it. We've done it for a long time, and we continue to do it the way that we have done it in the past. We're always open to and actually even interested to add teammates, who as the solution set expands, can take them to market and help customers find the value but in terms of the sort of the general approach, no. We've done it successfully for a long time and we're not going to fiddle with our successful model. Lee, anything you want to add to your comments in the upfront part of the meeting? Pipeline is good. Go ahead, Lee. Go ahead. Well, the nature of the subscription business that we have, first of all, a lot of that is multi-year, and multi-year agreements feature price escalators year-over-year. A good fraction of it also is perpetually renewing, particularly as it relates to sort of the traditional rules, forms and loss costs that we provide in the Insurance vertical. So there is actually - there is a great deal of not just stability, but actually momentum associated with the 85% because of the way that we contract with our customers. And so when we talk about sales cycles, we're really talking about the cross-selling of a solution which hasn't been used by a customer in the past or a brand-new solution into the marketplace. And I think, Lee, was really taking pains to try to describe that our - we're going to move with our customers and - at the rate that, that they want to move. And I think he put his finger on exactly the right issue, which is just - it's a big decision when customers decide to subscribe to one or more of our solutions. These are high-ticket items. And it's not as if - it's not as if the consideration has fundamentally changed from - we're thinking about it in the year 2020 to like, don't even talk to me about it until the year 2021. It's much more just them having found their feet underneath them in the COVID moment. And now as they try to organize to make what is a material decision to buy one of our solutions, they just have to pull themselves together basically. But it's not as if the fundamental decision matrix for them has changed. The value - the value proposition is the same. And this relates to the emergence or the cross-sell than it does to the thing which is already established. And again, there is momentum inside of an exist - most existing subscription contracts because they are multi-year and they do have price escalators. Not at all. Yes. So actually, I like the way you framed the question, Jeff, because I'm going to generalize a point here and that is that as I observed some of the InsurTechs which are kind of borne from whole cloth and essentially platforms into more - a more modern infrastructure. They are borne with a more modern infrastructure. I find their rate of adoption to be really high. And so it actually is a demonstration of what we're talking about here. Those who are more naturally able to connect to, to integrate, to consume from inside of an API to render content from the outside into their own environment quickly or even more importantly, to actually plant a platforms analytic environment right in the middle of their workflows, a company which is in that condition is able to consume the next thing from us just that much more easily. And as - really, I think there really is - there really is an observation there about the relative ease with which some of the InsurTechs are able to begin to work with what we provide them. And what it comes down to fundamentally is that, they have their own backlog of technology-oriented projects that they have - that they have to work through. And sometimes, one of those technology-oriented projects might be them doing whatever it is that they need to do in their environment in order to adopt one of our solutions. We've seen this many, many times over in much of what we do actually. And to the extent that they are actually able - they're more - they're more naturally digital, they'll be able to work through these kinds of implementations that much faster. And so I don't think it - I don't think that it - the - when they do their own ROI calculation on making use of one of our solutions, their cost of implementation in most cases is - there is something there, but it really isn't going to make the difference in terms of whether or not to make use of our solutions. Maybe with some of our thickest platforms that might be there a little bit more. So my point here is that the fundamental interest in making more use of what it is that we do, the ease of implementation is a part of it, but also as they become more analytic in the way that they make their own decision-making, the value of the content that we bring just stands up that much taller. And so there is also something about their own analytic environment and the quality of their analytic environment. And so at the intersection of I can get you implemented faster and I can make more use of this unique perspective that you've got Verisk. The value proposition just stands up even higher. No, I mean, I think you really caught it inside of your question. As many folks know, we're excited about the growth of our international business. And we have - we have a variety of ways that we try to grow our international business. And in the early stages of developing a market, one of the things that's kind of a natural feature of our businesses that some of it may be more transactional in the early going. Customers when they are getting used to a new solution often want to start out in the transactional mode and/or it's just that much faster in terms of getting established with the customer. With time what we've generally found is customers would prefer to move towards a subscription model, where they have certainty about what they're going to be paying for what they get, but that's not always the case when they get started. So international being a newer part of our mix overall, it's not surprising that in this unique moment, there might have been a little bit of a difference there. Don't expect that to relate to the long-term growth picture. Sure. Mark is one of our two Board members at Vexcel. So, Mark, would you take that on, please? Mark, do you want to start with that one? I'm sorry, LightSpeed was your question Bill? Yes, please continue. Lee would you take that please? George, are you still there? Yes so, George let me - so keeping in mind put that 3% in the context of financial services as a percentage of our total overall revenue. And so on a proportional basis it's a - that transactional element is a larger element relative to the other businesses. And so, if you take that and you recognize that we've had consulting impacts with regard to the retained analytics and the project analytics that had impacted that's kind of a similar effect of what we've seen in energy on the consulting business, that's one dimension. And then we also have the pullback in advertising and so when our spent informed analytics business, the lower level of advertising is having a primary causal impact from COVID-19. So both of those are influencing the revenue growth and there is a higher concentration of that COVID-19 sensitivity to overall revenues that is resulting in a bigger revenue impact in comparison to the others. Okay, well thank you everybody for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your interest, your questions, we'll be following up with many of you. And so, I appreciate your time today. Have a great rest of the day. Bye for now."

            "name": "Mark Anquillare",
            "content": "Yes, I think I would just highlight or echo a couple of things you said. I think the language that we use in our programs have pretty clear - clearly states that the effort around pandemic or the situation around pandemic will not affect the property, and the property is really what's the key to coverage. There are other programs out there, especially on the reinsurance side, where some of this business interruption and the effects of pandemic will be invoked. So I think some programs, some insurers will have some payments to make and it's could be quite sizable. I think the other thing that kind of factors into the insurance economics is the commercial lines premium. I think what we're going to see probably in 2020 is a combination of exposures and premiums down 5% to 6%. We do believe from a forecast perspective that those rates, the actual premium rate itself, as well as the exposures will rebound in 2021, so that may affect some insurers. I think overall, we don't see that as something that is systematically problematic. I think during these times, insurers look to focus on underwriting discipline and a lot of the actuarial and underwriting solutions we provide them, what I'll refer to is that grounding. So hopefully, that provides color. Yes, absolutely. So what we attempted to do and I think pretty successfully is separate what is image capture, where we thought there was about opportunity to scale and provide what I'll refer to as greater coverage by combining the two companies. So if I was to think about that as job one, the combination of what I'll refer to as the Geomni image capture and Vexcel image capture has quite considerably increased the coverage in the United States. That is a combination of all of North America, U.S. and Canada, but it also has two different types of coverage, kind of that high up across the landscape and then that more higher resolution five - North-South-East-West views of things. What we're also being able to do is start to extend geographically. So now we have access to imagery across Europe and in certain parts of Asia-Pacific. So there we have opportunities to leverage that analytic, and I think we've been quite successful. On the Geomni front, where we're continuing to be focused on advanced analytics, a, we have more data to work with, so our algorithms, our machine is better and improved, and, of course, because we have more coverage, we can provide more analytic across various places. So let me give you an example. We now have the ability to take some of the weather analytics we have, put it on top of all this imagery and provide kind of a triage tool for analytic purposes and that's not just in the United States, but we can go throughout the world where we have that coverage. So I hope that provides you a little bit of color, the combination of leverage in getting access to all those images, we still have that from a Geomni perspective, and I think at Vexcel because they're doing it once instead of twice, there's a lot of scale and leverage there, so they're doing it cheaper. Sure. So let me just remind you, Marshall effect is a tool used to understand the replacement cost value to understand the cost you have on your home. So what's the replacement value, what CoreLogic also has, it's a tool called stability which they acquired a couple of years ago. These tools have been in the market for decades. I don't see or we haven't seen any material investment too clearly because Symbility is now part of CoreLogic they've talked about the two combined. I would tell you that we continue to closely monitor all of our wins and losses. We are on it every single month. We understand where the incumbent and there's a break-off. We understand where there is an incumbent. We do this beyond CoreLogic's only not be overly specific here. But what I will tell you as we continue to win much more frequently than we lose and that's the story that we have been kind of on. We're probably five years now, I think we've been trying to share that at various Investor Days and I think the message and the direction remains very similar. So I think we're pleased with our competitive advantages, I think we're very pleased with where we are in the market. And I don't want to address the specific customer, but I'm not aware of that particular situation now. So Scott, you want me to continue? So, let me remind you LightSpeed is our tool by which we're taking a lot of information and data and moving it forward in the underwriting process. Hopefully over time eliminating the separation between what is the quote and then separately binding later on. We want to make that one process upfront, season quote in buying with confidence. And we're bringing in both our data, third-party data and scoring in such a way that you have confidence in that information. And that has been quite a bit - we're seeing quite a bit of success, both on the personal lines and now moving into the commercial line side of things. So the one point I'll make is back to Lee's comments earlier during the middle of the COVID there was less driving. At the same time, I think many personal auto policyholders were kind of waiting for maybe their refunds from insurers. So there was less shopping, there was less people going online and seeing if they can get better quote. So we did see some decreased volumes, but as Lee described, we've seen that slowly return as driving has increased. So hopefully that's responsive to your question. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar. Please go ahead.\nStacey Brodbar: Thank you, operator. And good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our first quarter 2020 financial results. Today's call will be led by Scott Stephenson, Verisk's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer who will provide a brief overview of our business. Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer, will then provide an update on our Insurance segment. Lastly, Lee Shavel, Chief Financial Officer, will highlight some key points about our financial performance. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days. On our website and by dial in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance, including but not limited to the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Now, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\nScott Stephenson: Thanks, Stacey. And good morning, everyone. I'm very glad to be together. Today we are in the midst of a challenge that is impacting each one of us. The outbreak of the Coronavirus is above all, a health crisis. And we hope that you and your families are doing what is necessary to stay safe. Our thoughts and prayers go out to those who have been directly affected by the virus and to the healthcare community and essential personnel working heroically to help us all overcome it. Today, I'm pleased to discuss how Verisk has responded to the COVID-19 event and give you a view of our plans and priorities for the company. I have really been looking forward to this meeting. Along with Mark and Lee we will describe for you three things. First, our actions in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, with a focus on protecting our employees and serving our customers. Second, an update on our current operations and the role we are playing to help our customers and communities navigate COVID-19. And third, our long-term priorities and plans for Verisk. Given our presence in Beijing, Shanghai and Singapore, the COVID-19 event began for us in January. Our global crisis management team immediately began pandemic planning under our business continuity policy under the strong leadership of our Asia Pacific team we followed government guidance and moved into a remote work mode with zero interruption in delivery for our customers. When local guidance modified, we move to a hybrid mode with teams making use of our facilities. On an every other day basis in order to keep density down, again movement into this work mode with seamless. When a second wave of infection appeared in Singapore, we successfully returned to the remote mode. All of this experience was invaluable as January turned to February to March, and it became clear that the Coronavirus was not a regional but a global event. Combining our experience in Asia Pacific, with our longstanding plans for ensuring business continuity we engaged in large scale, pressure testing of our remote work capabilities in North America, Europe and India and we did this weeks in advance of any government restrictions on movement. I was pleased, but not surprised at the result. We moved our roughly 9,000 colleagues into a full remote mode with no interruption of operations or service to our customers. We remain in that mode today. Our primary goal was and continues to be the safety of our colleagues. Because of the essentially digital nature of what we do and our strong movement towards enabling technologies such as cloud computing, we knew that we could protect the well-being of our team without sacrificing service to our customers. An interesting fact about Verisk is that only about 100 people or roughly 1% of the team have a specific and regular need to enter our facilities. Despite the increased need to communicate digitally with one another and customers, our computing and network capacity have consistently and comfortably exceeded what we require. To highlight the relative ease of the transition, one of the more custom responses to the COVID event has involved our software developers and data scientists. In the office, they are accustomed to having two, sometimes three large monitors running simultaneously at their workstations. Lacking these at home, we arranged to have the equipment sent to their residences to help these valuable colleagues remain productive. While we look forward to all being together again in our offices, our business continuity planning and the nature of our operations enable us to continue to serve our customers and drive our innovation agenda forward in a work-from-home mode, while also flexibly following the lead of government officials about when it is safe to return. We have also significantly increased communication with daily updates to our global workforce, which we call The Daily Dose. We have held frequent worldwide town halls [ph] and have provided the team access to our COVID-19 Resource Center, which updates teammates with our leading research on the pandemic, as well as helpful personal advice on staying healthy and productive. Finally, we began by holding daily meetings of our global executive team and have modified that rhythm as the stability of our operations has been clear. We are now holding regular update calls with our executive team as well as with our Board of Directors. That's the journey we've been on up to this moment, so where do we stand? First, our teams remain highly active and productive. Sales calls are up versus prior years. Email traffic is greater than it was prior to remote work. The use of collaborative digital platforms has increased substantially. And from a pulse survey of just a week ago, employee engagement is actually up at this moment relative to our customary high levels. And our customers continue to engage with our Analytics and Insights as visits to our portals across our three segments have increased as well. Second, we've been active in bringing new value to our customers in the COVID-19 moment. In the insurance space, we have provided an innovative platform to claims departments, allowing them to settle claims and direct collaboration with the insured without requiring physical presence. We made this platform free of charge as a form of support and look forward it to become another subscription offering with high acceptance across the industry over time. Our pandemic model, a part of the AIR suite, has drawn intense interest and slices of the output from the model have been made available to customers again at no cost. In financial services, we have created a COVID-19 dashboard for our banking customers to help them see precisely the real-time changes in spending across industry categories, thereby helping them anticipate movement in the credit worthiness of their commercial customers. And in the energy vertical, through a hurry up six-week effort, our customers can now examine the vulnerability of their supply chains in light of a geographic analysis of where the virus has had its greatest impacts. I'm very proud of the work of all my teammates. Third, we've analyzed all our solutions and services to assess the impact of COVID-19 on our revenue streams. We have not identified any material impact of COVID-19 on approximately 85% of our revenues at this point, as much of these revenues are subscription in nature and subject to long-term contracts. We have also identified that COVID-19 is impacting about 5% of our people who have seen their work curtailed to some degree in the following categories. Our survey teams, which diligence the engineering features of commercial buildings for the purpose of supporting commercial property underwriting, have not been able to enter most commercial buildings during the lockdown. And even with repurposing their time, remain at the moment less than fully utilized. Our consulting teams across the company, and especially in the Energy vertical, has seen some reductions to their current and projected billable activities for the immediate term. And our team focused on supporting auto claims adjusters in the UK has seen claims volumes drop as fewer miles are driven in the lockdown period. Across these few places in the company where the macro environment has reduced the workloads, we are working to reallocate these resources to other growing areas of the business. When necessary, we are using a combination of four-day work weeks, moderate trimming of team size and a small amount of furloughing to keep the work and team in balance. And finally, we continue to make good sales progress as we have adjusted quickly to engaging digitally with our customers. The rate of sales closure has slowed modestly, though pipelines remain strong, implying that we could experience some timing effects measured in weeks to months for new sales. Despite the distractions of COVID-19, I want to note our ongoing focus and progress with the integration of several recent acquisitions. Including; Genscape, FAST, BuildFax and the 3E acquisitions; SAP's Content as a Service business. We are very pleased with the integration - We are pleased with the integration momentum, synergy realization and early business results we've achieved with these entities. Consistent with our expectations and supporting solid returns on the capital we've invested. For the balance of today's call, we will focus on our long-term priorities and plans for Verisk. Mark and Lee will take you through our view in detail, but let me paint the general picture for you. Our priorities for investing in our business and our people are unchanged, evidenced by our reiteration of our CapEx budget for the year. We are continuing to drive our innovation agenda and invest in our business, while also advancing on our move to the cloud. With respect to performance, we expect to realize the benefit of four key features of our resilient business model. First, continued growth in data sets and demand for analytics from our clients that remains unchanged in the long-term and continues to drive our performance. Second, a high proportion and broad diversification of subscription revenues that provide exceptional stability to our revenue. Third, operations that provides significant flexibility in managing our expenses. And fourth, strong free cash flow generation and access to capital, which enable us to continue to invest in our business and return capital to our shareholders. On that topic, I'm pleased to report that our Board of Directors has approved a $0.27 per share dividend for the second quarter to be paid in June. Our business model has proven its resiliency in the past, delivering stable performance through the financial crisis and the last oil price shocks. We realize that no two events are the same, but we have confidence that we can deliver growth again through COVID-19. And while there may be some short-term headwinds to growth, we believe our performance will reflect our long-term goal of growing EBITDA faster than revenue. Finally, on a personal note, I sympathize with the small businesses that are unable to operate during these challenging times, and every one of our customers in this situation can expect the full support of our company. I also feel extremely fortunate to be a part of Verisk's business model. Now, I will turn the call over to Mark to walk you through developments in our Insurance vertical.\nMark Anquillare: Thank you, Scott. I'm pleased to share with you that we had another strong quarter in Insurance with all businesses contributing to growth. Despite some reduced volumes in March due to the pandemic, organic constant currency revenue growth was 5.9%. After normalizing for the continued impact of the injunction on our roof measurement solutions organic constant currency growth was 6.9% yield by market [indiscernible] innovation enhanced customer engagement. Across our insurance businesses, our retention rates remain very high and we have seen increased customer engagement during these unique times. Our customers have effectively transitioned to working from home and are more available and open to calls and product demos. Since March, 15th, we've seen customer call reports grow significantly from 2019 levels and realized a surge in participants at our virtual industry events, focused on business interruption coverage, broad during the pandemic, virtual claims handling and virtual property underwriting. The effectiveness of our team is essential in maintaining great service to our customers. Our knowledge-based solutions allow us to service customers remotely and with continuity. Our cloud-first approach has fostered a technical infrastructure that is available, scalable and resilient, allowing for uninterrupted service to customers as well as employees. As an example of our preparedness, we had a major customer perform a review of Verisk infrastructure to ensure that our ongoing technical support for their operations during these unique times. This feedback was extremely positive, with the customer sharing that Verisk was well prepared ahead of their own internal infrastructure, and filed several best practices that they plan to replicate. Let me share an industry perspective and its impact on our business. Insurance coverage remains essential through this pandemic. Insurance renewals continue. I would doubt any participants joining this call had thought about canceling their homeowners are on mobile insurance policies. However, driving is down significantly, our telematics data exchange indicates the driving mileage is down almost 50% year-over-year in the US since the pandemic breakout, leading to reduced auto claims. But we've seen a rebound in mileage in recent weeks, leading us to believe the bottom occurred in late March and early April. Some insurers have committed to premium refunds, which have contributed to a reduction in shopping for lower premiums by policyholders. Other areas of weakness in the industry include a significant drop in travel insurance and more modest declines in commercial insurance. Over the immediate term, total exposure values in commercial insurance may be reduced. Our Insurance business benefits from subscriptions and long-term contracts with a small portion of the revenue transactional. Although modest, we expect to see some adverse impact from the pandemic in certain of our transaction revenues. As I highlighted in my opening, customer engagement has been very strong. Let me share a few examples. We continue to see great success in market share gains in extreme event modeling as customers are moving towards an AIR suite of solutions. To support our customers, we have made our pandemic forecasting tool available for free to the insurance industry, as well as the general public to assist in planning and resiliency. As Scott mentioned in his opening, we made our virtual claims adjudication and virtual inspection platforms available for free to customers to stay in business and to facilitate the timely payment of insurance claims. Over 30,000 adjuster's inspectors now have access to the platform. Since rolling out the program in mid-March, more than 1,100 customers with many more users have enrolled. We have received very positive feedback from insurers, thanking us for our contribution to the industry. And last but certainly not least, we have received strong interest in our life insurance Analytic solutions. The FAST technology and strong leadership team, in combination with Verisk Advanced Analytics and reputation in the insurance industry, historically has created significant opportunities. We have signed noteworthy contracts with Amica, Lincoln Heritage, Pacific Life, M Financial and partnered with SCOR on our Life Analytics platform. I'm pleased with the strong early results, as evidence the synergies and strategic benefits. In a period of heightened security [ph] analytics are more important than ever. And further, with substantially increased remote operations, the connectivity we provide our client is critically valuable to our industry, supporting in turn the value of Verisk's business. With that, let me turn it over to Lee to cover our financial results.\nLee Shavel: Thank you, Mark. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we've posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. Moving to the financial results for the quarter on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 10% to $690 million on net income increased 28% to $172 million. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 28% to $1.4 for the first quarter 2020. The year-over-year increase in GAAP net income and EPS is primarily the result of organic growth in the business, gains from dispositions and a decrease in acquisition related costs. These increases were offset in part by the previously communicated timing shift of a $10 million expense related to annual long-term equity incentive grants that was recognized in the first quarter of 2020 as compared to the second quarter in the prior year. Moving to our organic constant currency results adjusted for non-operating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, we believe our operating performance remains solid. On an organic constant currency basis, Verisk delivered revenue growth of 5% for the first quarter of 2020. All three segments delivered growth with insurance posting the strongest growth rates. We did experience a decline in certain of our transactional revenues during the last two weeks of March related to COVID-19, though the impact on the first quarter results overall was modest. Organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth was 7.4% reflecting operating leverage, despite a headwind from the timing shift of annual LTI grants. Normalizing for the $4 million revenue impact of the injunction, revenue grew 5.8% and adjusted EBITDA increased 9% on an organic constant currency basis. Total adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 46.1%, down 59 basis points from the prior year. Normalizing for the impact of the timing shift of annual LTI grants, however, total adjusted EBITDA margin would have expanded to 47.5%, demonstrating solid adjusted EBITDA margin expansion inclusive of continued investment in our breakout opportunities. This total adjusted EBITDA margin includes both organic and inorganic revenues and adjusted EBITDA. On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. As you see in the press release, Insurance reported 5.9% revenue growth while adjusted EBITDA increased 8% for the quarter. We saw healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, catastrophe modeling solutions, claims analytics and repair cost estimating solutions, offset by the impact of the injunction on roof measurement solutions. Normalizing for the impact of the injunction, Insurance would have achieved 6.9% organic constant currency revenue growth and 9.9% organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth, demonstrating margin expansion while also investing for future growth. Energy and specialized markets delivered revenue growth of 2.6% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 1.8% for the quarter, driven by increases in core research and the breakout areas like the energy transition practice and chemicals. We also saw increases in our environmental health and safety service revenues and weather analytics revenues. These increases were partially offset by declines in core consulting related to lower capital expenditures across the energy sector, as well as the completion of implementation projects in market and cost intelligence solutions, resulting from an exceptionally strong 2019 that reduced related transactional revenue. Financial services grew 3% and adjusted EBITDA increased 15.9% in the quarter, driven by growth in management information and regulatory reporting as well as fraud and credit risk, and offset in part by declines in portfolio management and spend-informed analytics revenues. Our reported effective tax rate was 20.8% for the quarter compared to 21% in the prior year quarter. We continue to believe that our tax rate for 2020 will be between 19% and 21%, though likely at the higher end of the range. There will likely be some quarterly variability related to the impact of employee stock option exercises, which depends in part on the Verisk stock price and employee personal decisions. In addition, we are closely monitoring potential tax legislation in the UK, which could impact our future tax rates. Adjusted net income was $194 million and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.17 for the first quarter 2020, up 13.6% from the prior year. This increase reflects organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions and lower average share count. Net cash provided by operating activities was $363 million for the quarter, down 1% from the prior period. Capital expenditures were $53 million for the quarter, up 17% from the prior-year period. CapEx represented 7.7% of total revenues in the quarter. We continue to believe that CapEx will be in the range of $250 million to $270 million for 2020 as investing in our business and our people continues to be our highest priority. That said, certain expenditures related to real estate projects could be further delayed because of COVID-19 stay-at-home restrictions, but it is too early to quantify the impact if any. Free cash flow was $310 million for the quarter, a decrease of 3.5% from the prior-year period, primarily due to an increase in interest payments and the timing of certain customer collections and operating expense payments. In light of the current environment, we are monitoring our cash flow closely. And in that regard, year-to-date through the end of April, we have seen year-over-year growth in both cash receipts and cash flow after operational expenditures including CapEx. During the quarter, we returned $218 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and the Verisk Board of Directors has approved a cash dividend of $0.27 per share payable on June 30th, 2020. Moving from the results of the quarter to our broader exposure to COVID-19, I wanted to address a few key elements related to our financial performance. With regard to revenues, as Scott described, we have completed a careful review of our solutions and services to evaluate their potential exposure to COVID-19 impacts. Through that exercise, we have identified specific products and services, largely transactional in nature that are being impacted by COVID-19. Collectively, these solutions represent approximately 15% of our consolidated revenues. And at the segment level, the 15% consists of approximately 8% in Insurance, 4% in Energy and specialized markets and 3% in Financial services. On the 15%, we have identified specific solutions and services that are being impacted to various degrees by primary causal factors. Including, lower auto and travel insurance activity, the inability to enter commercial buildings to perform engineering analysis, decreased capital expenditures in the energy sector and reduced levels of advertising by financial institutions and marketers. A portion of the revenue attributable to these solutions could be negatively impacted by COVID-19. The impact on many of these solutions is expected to be modest with the deepest impact felt in the categories of travel insurance analytics, auto underwriting and claims analytics, consulting services to the energy industry and spend-informed analytic solutions in financial services. Although, we experienced a decline in revenue attributable to these specific solutions in the last two weeks of March 2020, the impact on the first quarter was modest. We do not anticipate lasting impacts of a material nature to our long-term growth profile. And as the global outbreak of COVID-19 is still rapidly evolving, we will continue to monitor its impact on our business. It's important to understand that the aggregate 15% is not what we expect the impact on our revenues to be, but rather it is the portion of revenue that we believe could be affected by the causal factors generated by COVID-19. Two observations; this should not be surprising as it is primarily a subset of our total transactional revenues, which represent about 20% of our total revenues. Of the transactional revenues included in the identified 15%, it should be noted that they are diverse in the nature of their exposure and generally are expected to show strong resilience and recovery. In addition, it reinforces the stability of our subscription revenues that make up the bulk of the 85% of revenues for which we were unable to identify an exposure at this time. Of course, depending upon the duration of COVID-19, we may see new contract signing or renewal delays, but we view these as primarily timing issues. With regard to Energy and specialized markets, while it's natural to draw comparisons to Wood Mackenzie's experience during the significant oil price declines in 2016, it is important to understand both that one; Wood Mackenzie has reduced its exposure to the more oil price sensitive upstream oil companies through the growth of its energy transition practice, chemicals and other sub-segments, and has limited revenue contribution from the lower 48 US operators. Secondly, Wood MacKenzie represents a smaller percentage of our energy and Specialized Markets segment primarily as the result of our acquisition of PowerAdvocate, which primarily serves the utility sub-segment and our environmental health and safety business, which has limited commodity exposure. The collective causal factors from COVID-19 represent pressure on achieving our 7% long-term growth objectives in 2020, but we don't believe they represent any structural changes in our fundamental growth drivers or operating leverage that would limit our ability to return to delivering on the long-term growth expectations for the business. Moving to expenses; I want to emphasize our ability to manage the cost structure. First, our short-term incentive compensation is directly tied to revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth and will automatically reduce our expenses at lower growth rates. Second, we have already slowed our rate of headcount growth and we'll continue to manage headcount growth carefully through the COVID-19 event. With compensation representing approximately 70% of our cost base and headcount growth representing a meaningful component of expense growth, this discipline provides significant flexibility. Finally, we are reducing non-compensation expenses, including travel and entertainment event and other non-essential expenses. What we are not cutting is investment in the business. We will continue our target of $250 million to $270 million for capital expenditure in 2020 and we will continue to invest in our breakout solutions as they are fundamental to our growth and value creation opportunity. We also remain pleased, as Scott has described, with our integration progress on recent acquisitions, where our focus on realizing synergies and generating attractive returns remains undiminished. Factoring all of the above, on revenues and expenses, we recognize the challenges this environment presents. But we believe the stability of our subscription revenues, our core operating leverage and expense actions we are taking will continue to support our revenue and EBITDA growth in 2020. While the impact of COVID-19 on first quarter results was modest, the second quarter will bear a larger impact from the causal factors reflecting the more significant duration and effective COVID-19 for the period. As and when the causal factors diminish, we expect the impact to abate. From a capital and liquidity perspective, we continue to anticipate solid operating cash flow and capital generation from our business, we maintain access to our committed revolving credit line, with approximately $595 million in currently available capacity as well as access to the investment grade debt markets, and we have staggered maturities with no debt maturing until May, 2021. We expect to continue to manage our leverage within our typical 2 to 3 times range. We hope this provides some useful context for you and we look forward to addressing your questions. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, please ask your question.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks very much. Glad you guys are safe and well. I wanted to ask about the Energy business. I know in the past, I guess when the price of oil gets below a certain level and now it's in the 20s, I guess how much of an impact should we be expecting on the business? I know you mentioned you have less exposure to upstream now versus in 2015, '16, I think it was about 80% then. If you could give us the updated percent upstream now. But just I guess how can - like where can you see the impacts from this lower oil price? Can customers change their contracts during the subscription term or need to wait for renewal? Just any sort of color on the energy business would be helpful. Thank you.\nScott Stephenson: Yes, Toni. Thanks for the question and thanks for your well-wishes. And the same to you and to everybody who is with us on this call today. I hope everybody is safe and well. So, first of all, to your factual question. The percentage of WoodMac business that was upstream was roughly in the neighborhood of the number you just cited and now it's below 50%. The other thing that I would say is that, as Lee mentioned, we have really diversified the revenues associated with the Energy vertical. We do much more now with utilities, which are proving to be relatively stable and definitely relatively more stable than oil and gas companies are at the moment. The whole wing of our business, which is aimed at helping with the transition to the renewables is in very good shape. One part of the world that benefits from a low petroleum price is the petrochemicals business and that is also a material part of what we do so. So as you started, our business is actually different than it was the last time we went through an oil price shock.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS. Your line is open, please ask your question.\nAlex Kramm: Yes. Hey, good morning, everyone. You mentioned the very modest impact in the last two weeks of March. Can you be a little bit more specific what you've seen so far in April? I think Mark mentioned something about the lower auto claims, which is pretty obvious, but I think that may have bottomed as you said. But any other things you can highlight, but maybe a little bit more specifically, how big the impact was in April so far. Thank you.\nScott Stephenson: Let me characterize generally and then Lee, let me come to you. So everything that we've said in our call today is a product of having examined very carefully what happened in April. So all of the statements that we've made here about our view of 2020 and what it is that we've done by way of preparation. April is fully in mind when we've made every one of those statements. Lee anything you want to add to that?\nLee Shavel: Yes. Alex, thanks for the question. It certainly is something that we're watching carefully and I think a couple of comments. One, I think it's important to understand that in the 15% of the of the impacted products, there is a lot of diversity in that, and so you have different products that are having different effects across that and that provides some stability within that. The second is that while we're looking at April, we also have to take into account kind of the temporal dynamic of the duration of COVID-19 and its impact over time. And so, we want to be - certainly, our expectation is that that impact is going to - is going to moderate over some period of time. So with all that being said, on the 15% that we identified we did see the expected decline - a partial decline in those revenues on a year-over-year basis in April and with fairly good degree of predictability. But in the non-COVID-19 revenues, we saw are more typical growth rates. And overall, as we indicated, we still saw growth in revenues across the business as a whole factoring those two elements in. So beyond that, we're not in a position to predict given the complexity, given the impact of the duration, but I think within April with that full impact, we saw that partial decline. But overall, we still maintain the growth in the revenues so far.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies. Your line is open, please ask your question.\nHamzah Mazari: Good morning. Hope you guys are safe and healthy as well. My question is on the international side of the Insurance segment. It feels like you've been doing some M&A there and essentially been utilizing software platforms to target customers. Could you maybe talk a little bit more about that strategy and how much of your business today is [indiscernible] software and any margin implications with regard to that?\nScott Stephenson: Mark, would you take that question please?\nMark Anquillare: Yes, thank you very much. So what we've been able to do in the United States is, over time, aggregate a huge amount of data to build out some unique and proprietary analytic objects, analytic solution. Inside of our international strategy, obviously we have this ambition as we always do to aggregate some unique data. But to do that we had to look towards solutions that can help us aggregate the data. So in some cases, we have some - I'll call it natural catastrophe or hazard type information that we can use and pull across that we've done and kind of replicated from what we've been successful at in the United States. At the same time, we found the best way to aggregate some information is really from a software angle. So with a goal towards - driving towards an analytic outcome and providing solutions that are analytic at the foundation, we have done two things. We started to aggregate data where we can and we've also taken a software approach to things that help us, for the most part, aggregate that same data. I think what we have found, to be honest, is inside the UK, there is more of a thirst for a solution set that is ecosystem - interconnected across a lot of solutions. I think that drives automation, that drives digital engagement. So our focus has been to try to take some software componentry, penetrate [ph] this ecosystem to help customers, and along the way, aggregate some data and with that data, build out an analytic outcome. It's kind of where you start and that's how we've gotten into the markets. And I think we've been very happy with the success and progress we've made, particularly in the UK. As you referenced, we have a little bit more of a beachhead there. We have certainly some more assets, and those assets have been working very closely together to integrate things that are related to data, underwriting workflow and cat modeling or what I'll call the both reinsurers and insurers. So, thanks for the question and I think your observation was accurate. Hopefully that gave a little color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JP Morgan. Your line is open, please ask your question.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi, Scott. In your prepared remarks, you indicated Verisk is confident that we'll continue to deliver revenue growth during this COVID period. And then your next sentence highlighted that the company is targeting EBITDA growth faster than revenue. And I wondered - my question is; I wondered if we're supposed to link those two comments together or specifically, is the company targeting EBITDA growth faster than revenue growth during this COVID period, and if that dynamic is on a reported basis or just an organic EBITDA basis?\nScott Stephenson: Yes. So thank you, Andrew, good to hear your voice. So first of all, you are correct that those two statements are intended to stand together. They are part of a full-thought in terms of our bottom-line performance. And we have been addressing ourselves in this call to COVID-19 effects, which more or less also correlates with statements about 2020. But the ambition in terms of the long-term also remains the same. And that is that we would have very healthy rates of organic revenue growth and we would have rates of organic EBITDA growth that exceed rates of organic revenue growth. So, we're stating once again what our long-term plan is. So, my comments were specific to 2020; the general point remains for our business over the long-term. And then lastly, to your question, we are talking about both organic and reported.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. Your line is open, please ask your question.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi, good morning. In hearing from some of the insurtech players over the past couple of months, it certainly seems like they've seen increased demand in the new environment. I'm just wondering if your conversations with those partners have evolved at all of late and whether your view of the Group's long-term trajectory has changed as a consequence of recent activity. Thanks.\nScott Stephenson: Mark, would you please take that question?\nMark Anquillare: Absolutely. So once again, I think we differentiate two types of insurtechs. There is an insurtech in that definition really relates to those that want to be insurers or managing general agents, [ph] so it's about distribution. And I think what we've seen there is those continue to prosper. At the same time, many of those early start-ups who have decided to actually be underwriters are actually carrier risk. Sometimes those, I'll call it loss ratios, have been a little higher. The combined ratio it has not been as profitable. So, we think they will continue, but we have seen some pressure because all of a sudden it becomes a focus on liquidity and maybe a turning to profitability a little bit sooner. So, we are watching our insurtech customers and we are trying to help them out with everything we can. And I think it's a little bit of a mixed answer dependent upon where they are on their own life cycle as they evolve to a more profitable entity. The other type of insurtech is really the service provider. In some cases, those service providers are partners with us, sometimes say compete in part with us. And again, I think it really relates to are what they are doing. There is a definite need in the industry to help bridge the gap between the insurer and the policyholder because I can't be necessarily face-to-face, I can't be at the home, I can't be at the property. So like we referenced in some of the work that we're doing with our virtual property adjudication process and our underwriting platforms, those have been in widespread use and need. So, I think those players have reacted and certainly done well during this pandemic. In other cases, I think probably there is a little bit of hesitancy around what can I actually implement during these times. What do I want to buy? And then like any insurtech, the smaller ones; it becomes a little bit of a liquidity issue as to how much cash I have and what state I am along the evolution towards profitability. So kind of a mixed message there. And obviously, we've grown nicely through a lot of those insurtech insurers or MGAs and we're trying to support them during these difficult times.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is open, please ask your question.\nJeff Meuler: Yes, thank you. Good morning. I just underpinning - trying to better understand what underpins the response to Andrew's question about the expected organic margin expansion this year, and trying to understand the trend that you go into COVID with the margin expansion in Q1, looked quite good, especially in the Insurance segment, but really across the business. Can you just give us a bit more detail on what drove that and so we can understand the baseline you're going to COVID with? Thanks.\nScott Stephenson: Sure. So let me start and Lee, perhaps you'd like to add some detail. But fundamentally, Jeff - and Jeff, good to hear your voice and hope you're doing well.\nJeff Meuler: Likewise.\nScott Stephenson: Thank you. So a very substantial fraction of our cost structure is the cost of our people, our team. It runs at about 70% of our total. As Lee mentioned, one dimension of our compensation stack is our incentive compensation. And those of you who have observed what we have in the proxy, we have set the - sort of the baseline expectation for performance in that at the level of our long-term targets for organic revenue and EBITDA growth. In other words, I would say that we have set the bar at a pretty high level. And to the extent that this moment, for the reasons that we talked about, put some pressure, I would say - particularly on the topline at this moment. One of the natural adjustments which occurs inside of our compensation is that the amount of annual incentive that will get paid out logically would come down somewhat. And that's automatic. That's just in the design of what we do. The other thing that matters greatly here is our total headcount and there is two ideas that are paired one with the other. So one is, as Lee mentioned, our rate of investment in innovation for the future is unabated. Our expectations are that we will spend as much writing and capitalizing software in 2020 as we originally intended, and Lee spoke to that. But the other part of it is what is happening with respect to the rate of headcount growth. And let me put that alongside of the comment that I made earlier; there are very - it is an extremely small fraction of our team where, in this moment, their ability to get their work done is limited. I mentioned roughly 5%. And even in those cases, we - I would describe what we've done as a very modest amount of sort of trimming and realigning. So these are relatively small effects. The larger effect is that - as you've seen our company do over time, entering into 2020 we were also planning on pretty substantial increase in headcount in order to provide even more acceleration of our developments into the future. And as we got the sense that the COVID-19 effect was going to be global not just regional, we basically moved very aggressively to - not to let people go but simply to slow down in this moment, the rate of hiring. And it actually has a material effect on the rate at which our expenses move. And so essentially, we have already done what I think of as the most substantially important thing that we need to do in order to be in position to see our rate of EBITDA growth exceed our rate of revenue growth. Lee, anything you'd like to add to that.\nLee Shavel: Very little, Scott, because I think you describe the mechanics in terms of the steps that we're taking in this environment and how that's affecting our ability to manage EBITDA. And maybe just to kind of give some context as I have in the past around the components and their impact. So in this quarter, Jeff, as I think you identified and I presume in your analysis you're eliminating that impact of the LTI shift, but within that we're seeing before the impact of M&A and even before the impact of the Geomni Vexcel transaction, solid EBITDA margin expansion within each of the three verticals individually. And so that's generating a strong base of margin expansion. The Geomni impact, the reduction of expenses from that transaction, is very helpful. And then we have the impact of LTI, that LTI shift in M&A, but within the business we do have that ongoing core operating leverage. And everything that Scott is describing, is describing our ability to continue to manage and deliver on that core operating leverage, which serves to achieve and support both that organic and all in margin objective that Andrew asked about originally.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is open, please ask your question.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you, good morning. Scott, maybe just a follow-up on your comments you just made on plans to accelerate in 2020. I was just wondering if - maybe it's early, but in terms of conversations with your clients, this pieces that maybe everyone realizes they need to be - accelerate their digital plans and so forth. So in the context of opportunity once the dust settles, how do you think about whether that's Lens, or insurance and telematics [ph] or whatever, like where could things really pick up after this because of what's happened?\nScott Stephenson: Yes. Thank you, Manav. Nice to hear your voice and I hope you're doing well. Yes, you've really put your finger on one of the most fundamental things about the context in which Verisk does its business. And that is fundamentally as our customers become, what I refer to as the better digital version of themselves, that's good for us. That means that they are more able to consume the data and the analytics that we put out there, and they are able to actually realize and acknowledge the value that they get. Not that there is any lack of acknowledgment today, but as their own processes become more data aware and data sensitive and FAST; the precision that our analytics bring and the speed with which we do what we do just becomes that much more active inside of their own environment. And I believe that one of the most fundamental consequences of the COVID-19 moment is that it is going to accelerate companies becoming the better digital version of themselves. Now, there is still a long distance to go. I mean, for all the discussion that is out there in terms of digital business, digital migration, et cetera, I would say that many companies are still at relatively early stages. But I do believe that there is going to be an acceleration effect based upon what's going on here. What does that mean specifically? I think what that means specifically is that customers will, across a variety of different attachment points, find even more interest in what it is we do. So analytic objects that we put out will be more consumable. And therefore, when our customers write their own business cases for making use of the next thing from Verisk that they haven't made use of yet, one of the factors that will be at work there is when they think about their own returns they will be able to generate returns faster because they will actually get to implementation of what we do more quickly. Same relates to if they want to attach to an API that we've put out there in order to access some of our content. The more that they do business that way, the more they will be able to go from the concept to the actual use of our solutions more quickly. And I would not localize these effects to any one part of our business. All three of the verticals, virtually everything that we do will respond to this trend.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Your line is open, please ask your question.\nBill Warmington: Good morning, everyone. So a question for you on WoodMac. Maybe you could talk a little bit about whether there is seasonality of renewals for GEM and maybe you can give us some sense for what you're seeing and on renewals, an early read. Thanks.\nScott Stephenson: Bill, good to hear your voice. Hope you're doing well. There is a degree of seasonality and most of the - or in many cases, the heaviest season for renewals is Q4 and Q1. So obviously, we just had our Q1. And the team is in the marketplace. I mean, one of the wonderful things about what we do, not only there but actually across the whole company, is the degree of intimacy we have with our customers. So a sales call is not only a sales call. A sales call is a relationship moment. And particularly at this time, the exchange with our customers is obviously at a very fundamental level. We're very interested in how they're doing. We're very interested in what can we do to be a support to them, and I believe that our customers really get out about Verisk right now. They really get that. And I believe that that, in addition to the acceleration of business becoming more digital, I believe both of those will be resonant for long periods of time into the future. That customers will remember this moment and they will remember what Verisk did. We were cited several things where, not only did we develop things in a very hurry-up fashion in order to respond to their interests, but we also, in some cases, made things available to them for free. And I believe that all of that is going to is going to be remembered. And we'll be - hopefully be yet more foundation inside of the relationships we have with our customers. That's true and that's true at WoodMac also. One of the things about WoodMac being out in the marketplace at this moment seeking renewals is that we are equipped in a way that we weren't in the past. Certainly, it's very different than when the oil price shock of '15 and '16 occurred because we now have the Lens platform, which is a very nice platform to analytic environment that customers - the value of it is obvious to customers. And so it's an amplification of the value that they've always gotten out of our content. And so there is a - we're able to lean into the discussion, even while we're listening very carefully to where the customers are, we're able to lean into the discussion with respect to affirming the value of what we bring and affirming the increase in the value of what we bring relative to say the past renewal, if it was three years ago or two years ago or whenever it happened to be. And so there is a - I would describe it as a kind of a quiet confidence when our team goes out into the market. Now, they know that they've got the goods and they're determined to represent that value even at the same time that we're trying to be very sensitive to where the customers are.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital. Your line is open, please ask your question.\nJeffSilber: Thanks so much. I wanted to go back to your Insurance vertical. I know it's about 85% subscription, I think that's what you said, and you've got long-term contracts. But I'm just curious if you think you might be seeing any pressure on any of those clients, whether it's lower returns from their own investment portfolios, higher business interruption insurance claims. And then, also, can you talk about the percentage of contracts that come up for renewal each year and roughly what the seasonality there is as well? Thanks.\nScott Stephenson: Yes. So I'll start with that and, Mark, and then I'll turn it over to you. Just a couple of your points. I mean, insurers are not un affected by what is happening at the moment, for sure. And Mark described some of the dynamics, particularly the fact that - probably the single most observable in the moment Effects are related to reduced use of automobiles, and therefore, reduced damage to automobiles lower claims. And Mark pointed out earlier that a good number of our customers have chosen to reflect this in premium rebates to some of their customers. That doesn't mean that they're necessarily - that our customers, the insurers, are going to make less money on the line. I mean, their claims experiences, half of the combined ratio has just gone down quite a bit in the moment. So I think they are being very realistic in reflecting that and how they deal with their own customers. But that aside, there will definitely a be discussion about what does business interruption insurance cover and not cover, and specifically, our pandemic effects excluded. Our reading of the policy language is that it's relatively clear that pandemic effects are excluded. That doesn't mean that there will be less than maybe a spirited dialog in front of judges and juries, with folks wanting to claim well, yes, but, no, the policy really should cover that. And of course, we also have to sort of wait and see where public policy making comes out on all of this. But the industry will certainly make its case in terms of the - what is included and what is excluded in the policy language. Mark also talked about some of the smaller companies. And I would just add to what Mark said earlier that one of the things that we - there is a hallmark actually of how we work with our customers; is we try to be very flexible to meet them where they are. And so we're open, for example, if they're feeling extreme - and this is not most cases. In fact, this is in very few cases. But if they are under a relatively greater level of pressure at the moment, we might offer sort of a little relief in the moment for an extended contract with better terms in the out years. We don't find ourselves needing to do that very much, but we were trying to be flexible in those few cases where that makes sense. A lot of our business is on multi-year subscription. Some of it is one-year, but actually automatically renewing. And so Lee mentioned multiple times, the extreme stability of our subscription-based revenues and that's where it is basically found. It's either multi-year or it is automatically renewing, and all of it is so basic to what our customers are doing that it really - it really does fall into the category of must-have. So Mark, anything you want to add to that?\nMark Anquillare: I think you've covered it well, Scott. The contracts we have are typically like three years in nature. So there is no necessarily a concentration, maybe there's a little bit more fourth quarter when those are signed, but that's over three years. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, please ask your question.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. Just a question on M&A. You've done several tuck-in acquisitions and some divestitures over the last few years. Given your solid balance sheet, how do you think about taking advantage of some of the market dislocation and doing more of these tuck-ins going forward. Any color on that front. Thanks.\nScott Stephenson: Yes. So as I mentioned way back at the start of the call, we are talking within our leadership team on an extremely frequent basis. We always do, but even more so in this moment. There are two messages that I have for our leaders above all, and I'm almost a broken record on these points as we speak with one another with one another, counsel with one another. One is that we need to be extraordinarily alert to cyber risk in this moment. This is a great moment for bad guys because companies potentially could be distracted as they're dealing with the effects of this moment. We always look very strongly to our defenses at Verisk and - but I am just asking for extraordinarily - extraordinary alertness to that particular dimension of doing work. And by the way, all the monitoring that we do of our network definitely, definitely shows us that we remain secure, but we have to - we just have to lean into it. That's one of my messages for our leadership team. And the other one is you work for a company that is very strong, very stable, has a very substantial and solid balance sheet, and that is not true of all companies in the world today. So please keep your radars on maximum frequency and reach in terms of observing companies that are around us that maybe are logical relative to something that we're doing inside of Verisk and that perhaps are, or even some more specifically, were making a difference for our customers. Because it is possible that some of them may find themselves in a situation where they need to think about a different way of proceeding into the future. And therefore, if both there is strategic logic and there are terms, which might be available we should really be leaning into it at this moment. The message again as you - to our leadership, this is me to our leaders, you work for a company that is unlike a lot of other companies and this can be your moment. So all of that said, if the company happens to be, let's say in private equity hands - private equity has in quite a few cases become the reference bidder [ph] inside of our world. So I'm not - it remains to be seen just how much valuation expectations may modify downward. We'll see.\nStacey Brodbar: Operator, next question.\nScott Stephenson: Stacey. Maybe we'll give it one more moment to see if the operator comes back online.\nStacey Brodbar: Operator, next question. Did we lose our operator?\nScott Stephenson: I think we may have. Well, why don't we tie-off there then. So thank you all very much for joining us today. And my apologies if there are any of you that we're looking to ask a question, but you didn't get a chance to get the question in due to this technical glitch. We don't have the ability to open and close the lines, that's only the operator. So apologies if you had a question and you didn't get a chance to ask us. But in any event as always, we will be following up with many, many of you and I hope that you will take your additional questions and review them with Lee and Stacey. So otherwise, thank you very much for having been with us today. I want to wish you great health and strength in this moment to you and your loved ones and your firms. And we really, really appreciate your interest in Verisk and we have really been looking forward to having this conversation with you. So thanks very much for being with us today. Talk to you soon. Goodbye.",

            "name": "Lee Shavel",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we've posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. Moving to the financial results for the quarter on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 10% to $690 million on net income increased 28% to $172 million. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 28% to $1.4 for the first quarter 2020. The year-over-year increase in GAAP net income and EPS is primarily the result of organic growth in the business, gains from dispositions and a decrease in acquisition related costs. These increases were offset in part by the previously communicated timing shift of a $10 million expense related to annual long-term equity incentive grants that was recognized in the first quarter of 2020 as compared to the second quarter in the prior year. Moving to our organic constant currency results adjusted for non-operating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, we believe our operating performance remains solid. On an organic constant currency basis, Verisk delivered revenue growth of 5% for the first quarter of 2020. All three segments delivered growth with insurance posting the strongest growth rates. We did experience a decline in certain of our transactional revenues during the last two weeks of March related to COVID-19, though the impact on the first quarter results overall was modest. Organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth was 7.4% reflecting operating leverage, despite a headwind from the timing shift of annual LTI grants. Normalizing for the $4 million revenue impact of the injunction, revenue grew 5.8% and adjusted EBITDA increased 9% on an organic constant currency basis. Total adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 46.1%, down 59 basis points from the prior year. Normalizing for the impact of the timing shift of annual LTI grants, however, total adjusted EBITDA margin would have expanded to 47.5%, demonstrating solid adjusted EBITDA margin expansion inclusive of continued investment in our breakout opportunities. This total adjusted EBITDA margin includes both organic and inorganic revenues and adjusted EBITDA. On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. As you see in the press release, Insurance reported 5.9% revenue growth while adjusted EBITDA increased 8% for the quarter. We saw healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, catastrophe modeling solutions, claims analytics and repair cost estimating solutions, offset by the impact of the injunction on roof measurement solutions. Normalizing for the impact of the injunction, Insurance would have achieved 6.9% organic constant currency revenue growth and 9.9% organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth, demonstrating margin expansion while also investing for future growth. Energy and specialized markets delivered revenue growth of 2.6% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 1.8% for the quarter, driven by increases in core research and the breakout areas like the energy transition practice and chemicals. We also saw increases in our environmental health and safety service revenues and weather analytics revenues. These increases were partially offset by declines in core consulting related to lower capital expenditures across the energy sector, as well as the completion of implementation projects in market and cost intelligence solutions, resulting from an exceptionally strong 2019 that reduced related transactional revenue. Financial services grew 3% and adjusted EBITDA increased 15.9% in the quarter, driven by growth in management information and regulatory reporting as well as fraud and credit risk, and offset in part by declines in portfolio management and spend-informed analytics revenues. Our reported effective tax rate was 20.8% for the quarter compared to 21% in the prior year quarter. We continue to believe that our tax rate for 2020 will be between 19% and 21%, though likely at the higher end of the range. There will likely be some quarterly variability related to the impact of employee stock option exercises, which depends in part on the Verisk stock price and employee personal decisions. In addition, we are closely monitoring potential tax legislation in the UK, which could impact our future tax rates. Adjusted net income was $194 million and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.17 for the first quarter 2020, up 13.6% from the prior year. This increase reflects organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions and lower average share count. Net cash provided by operating activities was $363 million for the quarter, down 1% from the prior period. Capital expenditures were $53 million for the quarter, up 17% from the prior-year period. CapEx represented 7.7% of total revenues in the quarter. We continue to believe that CapEx will be in the range of $250 million to $270 million for 2020 as investing in our business and our people continues to be our highest priority. That said, certain expenditures related to real estate projects could be further delayed because of COVID-19 stay-at-home restrictions, but it is too early to quantify the impact if any. Free cash flow was $310 million for the quarter, a decrease of 3.5% from the prior-year period, primarily due to an increase in interest payments and the timing of certain customer collections and operating expense payments. In light of the current environment, we are monitoring our cash flow closely. And in that regard, year-to-date through the end of April, we have seen year-over-year growth in both cash receipts and cash flow after operational expenditures including CapEx. During the quarter, we returned $218 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and the Verisk Board of Directors has approved a cash dividend of $0.27 per share payable on June 30th, 2020. Moving from the results of the quarter to our broader exposure to COVID-19, I wanted to address a few key elements related to our financial performance. With regard to revenues, as Scott described, we have completed a careful review of our solutions and services to evaluate their potential exposure to COVID-19 impacts. Through that exercise, we have identified specific products and services, largely transactional in nature that are being impacted by COVID-19. Collectively, these solutions represent approximately 15% of our consolidated revenues. And at the segment level, the 15% consists of approximately 8% in Insurance, 4% in Energy and specialized markets and 3% in Financial services. On the 15%, we have identified specific solutions and services that are being impacted to various degrees by primary causal factors. Including, lower auto and travel insurance activity, the inability to enter commercial buildings to perform engineering analysis, decreased capital expenditures in the energy sector and reduced levels of advertising by financial institutions and marketers. A portion of the revenue attributable to these solutions could be negatively impacted by COVID-19. The impact on many of these solutions is expected to be modest with the deepest impact felt in the categories of travel insurance analytics, auto underwriting and claims analytics, consulting services to the energy industry and spend-informed analytic solutions in financial services. Although, we experienced a decline in revenue attributable to these specific solutions in the last two weeks of March 2020, the impact on the first quarter was modest. We do not anticipate lasting impacts of a material nature to our long-term growth profile. And as the global outbreak of COVID-19 is still rapidly evolving, we will continue to monitor its impact on our business. It's important to understand that the aggregate 15% is not what we expect the impact on our revenues to be, but rather it is the portion of revenue that we believe could be affected by the causal factors generated by COVID-19. Two observations; this should not be surprising as it is primarily a subset of our total transactional revenues, which represent about 20% of our total revenues. Of the transactional revenues included in the identified 15%, it should be noted that they are diverse in the nature of their exposure and generally are expected to show strong resilience and recovery. In addition, it reinforces the stability of our subscription revenues that make up the bulk of the 85% of revenues for which we were unable to identify an exposure at this time. Of course, depending upon the duration of COVID-19, we may see new contract signing or renewal delays, but we view these as primarily timing issues. With regard to Energy and specialized markets, while it's natural to draw comparisons to Wood Mackenzie's experience during the significant oil price declines in 2016, it is important to understand both that one; Wood Mackenzie has reduced its exposure to the more oil price sensitive upstream oil companies through the growth of its energy transition practice, chemicals and other sub-segments, and has limited revenue contribution from the lower 48 US operators. Secondly, Wood MacKenzie represents a smaller percentage of our energy and Specialized Markets segment primarily as the result of our acquisition of PowerAdvocate, which primarily serves the utility sub-segment and our environmental health and safety business, which has limited commodity exposure. The collective causal factors from COVID-19 represent pressure on achieving our 7% long-term growth objectives in 2020, but we don't believe they represent any structural changes in our fundamental growth drivers or operating leverage that would limit our ability to return to delivering on the long-term growth expectations for the business. Moving to expenses; I want to emphasize our ability to manage the cost structure. First, our short-term incentive compensation is directly tied to revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth and will automatically reduce our expenses at lower growth rates. Second, we have already slowed our rate of headcount growth and we'll continue to manage headcount growth carefully through the COVID-19 event. With compensation representing approximately 70% of our cost base and headcount growth representing a meaningful component of expense growth, this discipline provides significant flexibility. Finally, we are reducing non-compensation expenses, including travel and entertainment event and other non-essential expenses. What we are not cutting is investment in the business. We will continue our target of $250 million to $270 million for capital expenditure in 2020 and we will continue to invest in our breakout solutions as they are fundamental to our growth and value creation opportunity. We also remain pleased, as Scott has described, with our integration progress on recent acquisitions, where our focus on realizing synergies and generating attractive returns remains undiminished. Factoring all of the above, on revenues and expenses, we recognize the challenges this environment presents. But we believe the stability of our subscription revenues, our core operating leverage and expense actions we are taking will continue to support our revenue and EBITDA growth in 2020. While the impact of COVID-19 on first quarter results was modest, the second quarter will bear a larger impact from the causal factors reflecting the more significant duration and effective COVID-19 for the period. As and when the causal factors diminish, we expect the impact to abate. From a capital and liquidity perspective, we continue to anticipate solid operating cash flow and capital generation from our business, we maintain access to our committed revolving credit line, with approximately $595 million in currently available capacity as well as access to the investment grade debt markets, and we have staggered maturities with no debt maturing until May, 2021. We expect to continue to manage our leverage within our typical 2 to 3 times range. We hope this provides some useful context for you and we look forward to addressing your questions. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions. Yes. Alex, thanks for the question. It certainly is something that we're watching carefully and I think a couple of comments. One, I think it's important to understand that in the 15% of the of the impacted products, there is a lot of diversity in that, and so you have different products that are having different effects across that and that provides some stability within that. The second is that while we're looking at April, we also have to take into account kind of the temporal dynamic of the duration of COVID-19 and its impact over time. And so, we want to be - certainly, our expectation is that that impact is going to - is going to moderate over some period of time. So with all that being said, on the 15% that we identified we did see the expected decline - a partial decline in those revenues on a year-over-year basis in April and with fairly good degree of predictability. But in the non-COVID-19 revenues, we saw are more typical growth rates. And overall, as we indicated, we still saw growth in revenues across the business as a whole factoring those two elements in. So beyond that, we're not in a position to predict given the complexity, given the impact of the duration, but I think within April with that full impact, we saw that partial decline. But overall, we still maintain the growth in the revenues so far. Very little, Scott, because I think you describe the mechanics in terms of the steps that we're taking in this environment and how that's affecting our ability to manage EBITDA. And maybe just to kind of give some context as I have in the past around the components and their impact. So in this quarter, Jeff, as I think you identified and I presume in your analysis you're eliminating that impact of the LTI shift, but within that we're seeing before the impact of M&A and even before the impact of the Geomni Vexcel transaction, solid EBITDA margin expansion within each of the three verticals individually. And so that's generating a strong base of margin expansion. The Geomni impact, the reduction of expenses from that transaction, is very helpful. And then we have the impact of LTI, that LTI shift in M&A, but within the business we do have that ongoing core operating leverage. And everything that Scott is describing, is describing our ability to continue to manage and deliver on that core operating leverage, which serves to achieve and support both that organic and all in margin objective that Andrew asked about originally."

            "name": "Scott Stephenson",
            "content": "Thanks, Stacey. And good morning, everyone. I'm very glad to be together. Today we are in the midst of a challenge that is impacting each one of us. The outbreak of the Coronavirus is above all, a health crisis. And we hope that you and your families are doing what is necessary to stay safe. Our thoughts and prayers go out to those who have been directly affected by the virus and to the healthcare community and essential personnel working heroically to help us all overcome it. Today, I'm pleased to discuss how Verisk has responded to the COVID-19 event and give you a view of our plans and priorities for the company. I have really been looking forward to this meeting. Along with Mark and Lee we will describe for you three things. First, our actions in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, with a focus on protecting our employees and serving our customers. Second, an update on our current operations and the role we are playing to help our customers and communities navigate COVID-19. And third, our long-term priorities and plans for Verisk. Given our presence in Beijing, Shanghai and Singapore, the COVID-19 event began for us in January. Our global crisis management team immediately began pandemic planning under our business continuity policy under the strong leadership of our Asia Pacific team we followed government guidance and moved into a remote work mode with zero interruption in delivery for our customers. When local guidance modified, we move to a hybrid mode with teams making use of our facilities. On an every other day basis in order to keep density down, again movement into this work mode with seamless. When a second wave of infection appeared in Singapore, we successfully returned to the remote mode. All of this experience was invaluable as January turned to February to March, and it became clear that the Coronavirus was not a regional but a global event. Combining our experience in Asia Pacific, with our longstanding plans for ensuring business continuity we engaged in large scale, pressure testing of our remote work capabilities in North America, Europe and India and we did this weeks in advance of any government restrictions on movement. I was pleased, but not surprised at the result. We moved our roughly 9,000 colleagues into a full remote mode with no interruption of operations or service to our customers. We remain in that mode today. Our primary goal was and continues to be the safety of our colleagues. Because of the essentially digital nature of what we do and our strong movement towards enabling technologies such as cloud computing, we knew that we could protect the well-being of our team without sacrificing service to our customers. An interesting fact about Verisk is that only about 100 people or roughly 1% of the team have a specific and regular need to enter our facilities. Despite the increased need to communicate digitally with one another and customers, our computing and network capacity have consistently and comfortably exceeded what we require. To highlight the relative ease of the transition, one of the more custom responses to the COVID event has involved our software developers and data scientists. In the office, they are accustomed to having two, sometimes three large monitors running simultaneously at their workstations. Lacking these at home, we arranged to have the equipment sent to their residences to help these valuable colleagues remain productive. While we look forward to all being together again in our offices, our business continuity planning and the nature of our operations enable us to continue to serve our customers and drive our innovation agenda forward in a work-from-home mode, while also flexibly following the lead of government officials about when it is safe to return. We have also significantly increased communication with daily updates to our global workforce, which we call The Daily Dose. We have held frequent worldwide town halls [ph] and have provided the team access to our COVID-19 Resource Center, which updates teammates with our leading research on the pandemic, as well as helpful personal advice on staying healthy and productive. Finally, we began by holding daily meetings of our global executive team and have modified that rhythm as the stability of our operations has been clear. We are now holding regular update calls with our executive team as well as with our Board of Directors. That's the journey we've been on up to this moment, so where do we stand? First, our teams remain highly active and productive. Sales calls are up versus prior years. Email traffic is greater than it was prior to remote work. The use of collaborative digital platforms has increased substantially. And from a pulse survey of just a week ago, employee engagement is actually up at this moment relative to our customary high levels. And our customers continue to engage with our Analytics and Insights as visits to our portals across our three segments have increased as well. Second, we've been active in bringing new value to our customers in the COVID-19 moment. In the insurance space, we have provided an innovative platform to claims departments, allowing them to settle claims and direct collaboration with the insured without requiring physical presence. We made this platform free of charge as a form of support and look forward it to become another subscription offering with high acceptance across the industry over time. Our pandemic model, a part of the AIR suite, has drawn intense interest and slices of the output from the model have been made available to customers again at no cost. In financial services, we have created a COVID-19 dashboard for our banking customers to help them see precisely the real-time changes in spending across industry categories, thereby helping them anticipate movement in the credit worthiness of their commercial customers. And in the energy vertical, through a hurry up six-week effort, our customers can now examine the vulnerability of their supply chains in light of a geographic analysis of where the virus has had its greatest impacts. I'm very proud of the work of all my teammates. Third, we've analyzed all our solutions and services to assess the impact of COVID-19 on our revenue streams. We have not identified any material impact of COVID-19 on approximately 85% of our revenues at this point, as much of these revenues are subscription in nature and subject to long-term contracts. We have also identified that COVID-19 is impacting about 5% of our people who have seen their work curtailed to some degree in the following categories. Our survey teams, which diligence the engineering features of commercial buildings for the purpose of supporting commercial property underwriting, have not been able to enter most commercial buildings during the lockdown. And even with repurposing their time, remain at the moment less than fully utilized. Our consulting teams across the company, and especially in the Energy vertical, has seen some reductions to their current and projected billable activities for the immediate term. And our team focused on supporting auto claims adjusters in the UK has seen claims volumes drop as fewer miles are driven in the lockdown period. Across these few places in the company where the macro environment has reduced the workloads, we are working to reallocate these resources to other growing areas of the business. When necessary, we are using a combination of four-day work weeks, moderate trimming of team size and a small amount of furloughing to keep the work and team in balance. And finally, we continue to make good sales progress as we have adjusted quickly to engaging digitally with our customers. The rate of sales closure has slowed modestly, though pipelines remain strong, implying that we could experience some timing effects measured in weeks to months for new sales. Despite the distractions of COVID-19, I want to note our ongoing focus and progress with the integration of several recent acquisitions. Including; Genscape, FAST, BuildFax and the 3E acquisitions; SAP's Content as a Service business. We are very pleased with the integration - We are pleased with the integration momentum, synergy realization and early business results we've achieved with these entities. Consistent with our expectations and supporting solid returns on the capital we've invested. For the balance of today's call, we will focus on our long-term priorities and plans for Verisk. Mark and Lee will take you through our view in detail, but let me paint the general picture for you. Our priorities for investing in our business and our people are unchanged, evidenced by our reiteration of our CapEx budget for the year. We are continuing to drive our innovation agenda and invest in our business, while also advancing on our move to the cloud. With respect to performance, we expect to realize the benefit of four key features of our resilient business model. First, continued growth in data sets and demand for analytics from our clients that remains unchanged in the long-term and continues to drive our performance. Second, a high proportion and broad diversification of subscription revenues that provide exceptional stability to our revenue. Third, operations that provides significant flexibility in managing our expenses. And fourth, strong free cash flow generation and access to capital, which enable us to continue to invest in our business and return capital to our shareholders. On that topic, I'm pleased to report that our Board of Directors has approved a $0.27 per share dividend for the second quarter to be paid in June. Our business model has proven its resiliency in the past, delivering stable performance through the financial crisis and the last oil price shocks. We realize that no two events are the same, but we have confidence that we can deliver growth again through COVID-19. And while there may be some short-term headwinds to growth, we believe our performance will reflect our long-term goal of growing EBITDA faster than revenue. Finally, on a personal note, I sympathize with the small businesses that are unable to operate during these challenging times, and every one of our customers in this situation can expect the full support of our company. I also feel extremely fortunate to be a part of Verisk's business model. Now, I will turn the call over to Mark to walk you through developments in our Insurance vertical. Yes, Toni. Thanks for the question and thanks for your well-wishes. And the same to you and to everybody who is with us on this call today. I hope everybody is safe and well. So, first of all, to your factual question. The percentage of WoodMac business that was upstream was roughly in the neighborhood of the number you just cited and now it's below 50%. The other thing that I would say is that, as Lee mentioned, we have really diversified the revenues associated with the Energy vertical. We do much more now with utilities, which are proving to be relatively stable and definitely relatively more stable than oil and gas companies are at the moment. The whole wing of our business, which is aimed at helping with the transition to the renewables is in very good shape. One part of the world that benefits from a low petroleum price is the petrochemicals business and that is also a material part of what we do so. So as you started, our business is actually different than it was the last time we went through an oil price shock. Let me characterize generally and then Lee, let me come to you. So everything that we've said in our call today is a product of having examined very carefully what happened in April. So all of the statements that we've made here about our view of 2020 and what it is that we've done by way of preparation. April is fully in mind when we've made every one of those statements. Lee anything you want to add to that? Mark, would you take that question please? Yes. So thank you, Andrew, good to hear your voice. So first of all, you are correct that those two statements are intended to stand together. They are part of a full-thought in terms of our bottom-line performance. And we have been addressing ourselves in this call to COVID-19 effects, which more or less also correlates with statements about 2020. But the ambition in terms of the long-term also remains the same. And that is that we would have very healthy rates of organic revenue growth and we would have rates of organic EBITDA growth that exceed rates of organic revenue growth. So, we're stating once again what our long-term plan is. So, my comments were specific to 2020; the general point remains for our business over the long-term. And then lastly, to your question, we are talking about both organic and reported. Mark, would you please take that question? Sure. So let me start and Lee, perhaps you'd like to add some detail. But fundamentally, Jeff - and Jeff, good to hear your voice and hope you're doing well. Thank you. So a very substantial fraction of our cost structure is the cost of our people, our team. It runs at about 70% of our total. As Lee mentioned, one dimension of our compensation stack is our incentive compensation. And those of you who have observed what we have in the proxy, we have set the - sort of the baseline expectation for performance in that at the level of our long-term targets for organic revenue and EBITDA growth. In other words, I would say that we have set the bar at a pretty high level. And to the extent that this moment, for the reasons that we talked about, put some pressure, I would say - particularly on the topline at this moment. One of the natural adjustments which occurs inside of our compensation is that the amount of annual incentive that will get paid out logically would come down somewhat. And that's automatic. That's just in the design of what we do. The other thing that matters greatly here is our total headcount and there is two ideas that are paired one with the other. So one is, as Lee mentioned, our rate of investment in innovation for the future is unabated. Our expectations are that we will spend as much writing and capitalizing software in 2020 as we originally intended, and Lee spoke to that. But the other part of it is what is happening with respect to the rate of headcount growth. And let me put that alongside of the comment that I made earlier; there are very - it is an extremely small fraction of our team where, in this moment, their ability to get their work done is limited. I mentioned roughly 5%. And even in those cases, we - I would describe what we've done as a very modest amount of sort of trimming and realigning. So these are relatively small effects. The larger effect is that - as you've seen our company do over time, entering into 2020 we were also planning on pretty substantial increase in headcount in order to provide even more acceleration of our developments into the future. And as we got the sense that the COVID-19 effect was going to be global not just regional, we basically moved very aggressively to - not to let people go but simply to slow down in this moment, the rate of hiring. And it actually has a material effect on the rate at which our expenses move. And so essentially, we have already done what I think of as the most substantially important thing that we need to do in order to be in position to see our rate of EBITDA growth exceed our rate of revenue growth. Lee, anything you'd like to add to that. Yes. Thank you, Manav. Nice to hear your voice and I hope you're doing well. Yes, you've really put your finger on one of the most fundamental things about the context in which Verisk does its business. And that is fundamentally as our customers become, what I refer to as the better digital version of themselves, that's good for us. That means that they are more able to consume the data and the analytics that we put out there, and they are able to actually realize and acknowledge the value that they get. Not that there is any lack of acknowledgment today, but as their own processes become more data aware and data sensitive and FAST; the precision that our analytics bring and the speed with which we do what we do just becomes that much more active inside of their own environment. And I believe that one of the most fundamental consequences of the COVID-19 moment is that it is going to accelerate companies becoming the better digital version of themselves. Now, there is still a long distance to go. I mean, for all the discussion that is out there in terms of digital business, digital migration, et cetera, I would say that many companies are still at relatively early stages. But I do believe that there is going to be an acceleration effect based upon what's going on here. What does that mean specifically? I think what that means specifically is that customers will, across a variety of different attachment points, find even more interest in what it is we do. So analytic objects that we put out will be more consumable. And therefore, when our customers write their own business cases for making use of the next thing from Verisk that they haven't made use of yet, one of the factors that will be at work there is when they think about their own returns they will be able to generate returns faster because they will actually get to implementation of what we do more quickly. Same relates to if they want to attach to an API that we've put out there in order to access some of our content. The more that they do business that way, the more they will be able to go from the concept to the actual use of our solutions more quickly. And I would not localize these effects to any one part of our business. All three of the verticals, virtually everything that we do will respond to this trend. Bill, good to hear your voice. Hope you're doing well. There is a degree of seasonality and most of the - or in many cases, the heaviest season for renewals is Q4 and Q1. So obviously, we just had our Q1. And the team is in the marketplace. I mean, one of the wonderful things about what we do, not only there but actually across the whole company, is the degree of intimacy we have with our customers. So a sales call is not only a sales call. A sales call is a relationship moment. And particularly at this time, the exchange with our customers is obviously at a very fundamental level. We're very interested in how they're doing. We're very interested in what can we do to be a support to them, and I believe that our customers really get out about Verisk right now. They really get that. And I believe that that, in addition to the acceleration of business becoming more digital, I believe both of those will be resonant for long periods of time into the future. That customers will remember this moment and they will remember what Verisk did. We were cited several things where, not only did we develop things in a very hurry-up fashion in order to respond to their interests, but we also, in some cases, made things available to them for free. And I believe that all of that is going to is going to be remembered. And we'll be - hopefully be yet more foundation inside of the relationships we have with our customers. That's true and that's true at WoodMac also. One of the things about WoodMac being out in the marketplace at this moment seeking renewals is that we are equipped in a way that we weren't in the past. Certainly, it's very different than when the oil price shock of '15 and '16 occurred because we now have the Lens platform, which is a very nice platform to analytic environment that customers - the value of it is obvious to customers. And so it's an amplification of the value that they've always gotten out of our content. And so there is a - we're able to lean into the discussion, even while we're listening very carefully to where the customers are, we're able to lean into the discussion with respect to affirming the value of what we bring and affirming the increase in the value of what we bring relative to say the past renewal, if it was three years ago or two years ago or whenever it happened to be. And so there is a - I would describe it as a kind of a quiet confidence when our team goes out into the market. Now, they know that they've got the goods and they're determined to represent that value even at the same time that we're trying to be very sensitive to where the customers are. Yes. So I'll start with that and, Mark, and then I'll turn it over to you. Just a couple of your points. I mean, insurers are not un affected by what is happening at the moment, for sure. And Mark described some of the dynamics, particularly the fact that - probably the single most observable in the moment Effects are related to reduced use of automobiles, and therefore, reduced damage to automobiles lower claims. And Mark pointed out earlier that a good number of our customers have chosen to reflect this in premium rebates to some of their customers. That doesn't mean that they're necessarily - that our customers, the insurers, are going to make less money on the line. I mean, their claims experiences, half of the combined ratio has just gone down quite a bit in the moment. So I think they are being very realistic in reflecting that and how they deal with their own customers. But that aside, there will definitely a be discussion about what does business interruption insurance cover and not cover, and specifically, our pandemic effects excluded. Our reading of the policy language is that it's relatively clear that pandemic effects are excluded. That doesn't mean that there will be less than maybe a spirited dialog in front of judges and juries, with folks wanting to claim well, yes, but, no, the policy really should cover that. And of course, we also have to sort of wait and see where public policy making comes out on all of this. But the industry will certainly make its case in terms of the - what is included and what is excluded in the policy language. Mark also talked about some of the smaller companies. And I would just add to what Mark said earlier that one of the things that we - there is a hallmark actually of how we work with our customers; is we try to be very flexible to meet them where they are. And so we're open, for example, if they're feeling extreme - and this is not most cases. In fact, this is in very few cases. But if they are under a relatively greater level of pressure at the moment, we might offer sort of a little relief in the moment for an extended contract with better terms in the out years. We don't find ourselves needing to do that very much, but we were trying to be flexible in those few cases where that makes sense. A lot of our business is on multi-year subscription. Some of it is one-year, but actually automatically renewing. And so Lee mentioned multiple times, the extreme stability of our subscription-based revenues and that's where it is basically found. It's either multi-year or it is automatically renewing, and all of it is so basic to what our customers are doing that it really - it really does fall into the category of must-have. So Mark, anything you want to add to that? Yes. So as I mentioned way back at the start of the call, we are talking within our leadership team on an extremely frequent basis. We always do, but even more so in this moment. There are two messages that I have for our leaders above all, and I'm almost a broken record on these points as we speak with one another with one another, counsel with one another. One is that we need to be extraordinarily alert to cyber risk in this moment. This is a great moment for bad guys because companies potentially could be distracted as they're dealing with the effects of this moment. We always look very strongly to our defenses at Verisk and - but I am just asking for extraordinarily - extraordinary alertness to that particular dimension of doing work. And by the way, all the monitoring that we do of our network definitely, definitely shows us that we remain secure, but we have to - we just have to lean into it. That's one of my messages for our leadership team. And the other one is you work for a company that is very strong, very stable, has a very substantial and solid balance sheet, and that is not true of all companies in the world today. So please keep your radars on maximum frequency and reach in terms of observing companies that are around us that maybe are logical relative to something that we're doing inside of Verisk and that perhaps are, or even some more specifically, were making a difference for our customers. Because it is possible that some of them may find themselves in a situation where they need to think about a different way of proceeding into the future. And therefore, if both there is strategic logic and there are terms, which might be available we should really be leaning into it at this moment. The message again as you - to our leadership, this is me to our leaders, you work for a company that is unlike a lot of other companies and this can be your moment. So all of that said, if the company happens to be, let's say in private equity hands - private equity has in quite a few cases become the reference bidder [ph] inside of our world. So I'm not - it remains to be seen just how much valuation expectations may modify downward. We'll see. Stacey. Maybe we'll give it one more moment to see if the operator comes back online. I think we may have. Well, why don't we tie-off there then. So thank you all very much for joining us today. And my apologies if there are any of you that we're looking to ask a question, but you didn't get a chance to get the question in due to this technical glitch. We don't have the ability to open and close the lines, that's only the operator. So apologies if you had a question and you didn't get a chance to ask us. But in any event as always, we will be following up with many, many of you and I hope that you will take your additional questions and review them with Lee and Stacey. So otherwise, thank you very much for having been with us today. I want to wish you great health and strength in this moment to you and your loved ones and your firms. And we really, really appreciate your interest in Verisk and we have really been looking forward to having this conversation with you. So thanks very much for being with us today. Talk to you soon. Goodbye."

            "name": "Mark Anquillare",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott. I'm pleased to share with you that we had another strong quarter in Insurance with all businesses contributing to growth. Despite some reduced volumes in March due to the pandemic, organic constant currency revenue growth was 5.9%. After normalizing for the continued impact of the injunction on our roof measurement solutions organic constant currency growth was 6.9% yield by market [indiscernible] innovation enhanced customer engagement. Across our insurance businesses, our retention rates remain very high and we have seen increased customer engagement during these unique times. Our customers have effectively transitioned to working from home and are more available and open to calls and product demos. Since March, 15th, we've seen customer call reports grow significantly from 2019 levels and realized a surge in participants at our virtual industry events, focused on business interruption coverage, broad during the pandemic, virtual claims handling and virtual property underwriting. The effectiveness of our team is essential in maintaining great service to our customers. Our knowledge-based solutions allow us to service customers remotely and with continuity. Our cloud-first approach has fostered a technical infrastructure that is available, scalable and resilient, allowing for uninterrupted service to customers as well as employees. As an example of our preparedness, we had a major customer perform a review of Verisk infrastructure to ensure that our ongoing technical support for their operations during these unique times. This feedback was extremely positive, with the customer sharing that Verisk was well prepared ahead of their own internal infrastructure, and filed several best practices that they plan to replicate. Let me share an industry perspective and its impact on our business. Insurance coverage remains essential through this pandemic. Insurance renewals continue. I would doubt any participants joining this call had thought about canceling their homeowners are on mobile insurance policies. However, driving is down significantly, our telematics data exchange indicates the driving mileage is down almost 50% year-over-year in the US since the pandemic breakout, leading to reduced auto claims. But we've seen a rebound in mileage in recent weeks, leading us to believe the bottom occurred in late March and early April. Some insurers have committed to premium refunds, which have contributed to a reduction in shopping for lower premiums by policyholders. Other areas of weakness in the industry include a significant drop in travel insurance and more modest declines in commercial insurance. Over the immediate term, total exposure values in commercial insurance may be reduced. Our Insurance business benefits from subscriptions and long-term contracts with a small portion of the revenue transactional. Although modest, we expect to see some adverse impact from the pandemic in certain of our transaction revenues. As I highlighted in my opening, customer engagement has been very strong. Let me share a few examples. We continue to see great success in market share gains in extreme event modeling as customers are moving towards an AIR suite of solutions. To support our customers, we have made our pandemic forecasting tool available for free to the insurance industry, as well as the general public to assist in planning and resiliency. As Scott mentioned in his opening, we made our virtual claims adjudication and virtual inspection platforms available for free to customers to stay in business and to facilitate the timely payment of insurance claims. Over 30,000 adjuster's inspectors now have access to the platform. Since rolling out the program in mid-March, more than 1,100 customers with many more users have enrolled. We have received very positive feedback from insurers, thanking us for our contribution to the industry. And last but certainly not least, we have received strong interest in our life insurance Analytic solutions. The FAST technology and strong leadership team, in combination with Verisk Advanced Analytics and reputation in the insurance industry, historically has created significant opportunities. We have signed noteworthy contracts with Amica, Lincoln Heritage, Pacific Life, M Financial and partnered with SCOR on our Life Analytics platform. I'm pleased with the strong early results, as evidence the synergies and strategic benefits. In a period of heightened security [ph] analytics are more important than ever. And further, with substantially increased remote operations, the connectivity we provide our client is critically valuable to our industry, supporting in turn the value of Verisk's business. With that, let me turn it over to Lee to cover our financial results. Yes, thank you very much. So what we've been able to do in the United States is, over time, aggregate a huge amount of data to build out some unique and proprietary analytic objects, analytic solution. Inside of our international strategy, obviously we have this ambition as we always do to aggregate some unique data. But to do that we had to look towards solutions that can help us aggregate the data. So in some cases, we have some - I'll call it natural catastrophe or hazard type information that we can use and pull across that we've done and kind of replicated from what we've been successful at in the United States. At the same time, we found the best way to aggregate some information is really from a software angle. So with a goal towards - driving towards an analytic outcome and providing solutions that are analytic at the foundation, we have done two things. We started to aggregate data where we can and we've also taken a software approach to things that help us, for the most part, aggregate that same data. I think what we have found, to be honest, is inside the UK, there is more of a thirst for a solution set that is ecosystem - interconnected across a lot of solutions. I think that drives automation, that drives digital engagement. So our focus has been to try to take some software componentry, penetrate [ph] this ecosystem to help customers, and along the way, aggregate some data and with that data, build out an analytic outcome. It's kind of where you start and that's how we've gotten into the markets. And I think we've been very happy with the success and progress we've made, particularly in the UK. As you referenced, we have a little bit more of a beachhead there. We have certainly some more assets, and those assets have been working very closely together to integrate things that are related to data, underwriting workflow and cat modeling or what I'll call the both reinsurers and insurers. So, thanks for the question and I think your observation was accurate. Hopefully that gave a little color. Absolutely. So once again, I think we differentiate two types of insurtechs. There is an insurtech in that definition really relates to those that want to be insurers or managing general agents, [ph] so it's about distribution. And I think what we've seen there is those continue to prosper. At the same time, many of those early start-ups who have decided to actually be underwriters are actually carrier risk. Sometimes those, I'll call it loss ratios, have been a little higher. The combined ratio it has not been as profitable. So, we think they will continue, but we have seen some pressure because all of a sudden it becomes a focus on liquidity and maybe a turning to profitability a little bit sooner. So, we are watching our insurtech customers and we are trying to help them out with everything we can. And I think it's a little bit of a mixed answer dependent upon where they are on their own life cycle as they evolve to a more profitable entity. The other type of insurtech is really the service provider. In some cases, those service providers are partners with us, sometimes say compete in part with us. And again, I think it really relates to are what they are doing. There is a definite need in the industry to help bridge the gap between the insurer and the policyholder because I can't be necessarily face-to-face, I can't be at the home, I can't be at the property. So like we referenced in some of the work that we're doing with our virtual property adjudication process and our underwriting platforms, those have been in widespread use and need. So, I think those players have reacted and certainly done well during this pandemic. In other cases, I think probably there is a little bit of hesitancy around what can I actually implement during these times. What do I want to buy? And then like any insurtech, the smaller ones; it becomes a little bit of a liquidity issue as to how much cash I have and what state I am along the evolution towards profitability. So kind of a mixed message there. And obviously, we've grown nicely through a lot of those insurtech insurers or MGAs and we're trying to support them during these difficult times. I think you've covered it well, Scott. The contracts we have are typically like three years in nature. So there is no necessarily a concentration, maybe there's a little bit more fourth quarter when those are signed, but that's over three years. Thanks."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After today\u2019s prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.\nStacey Brodbar: Thank you, Ram, and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results. Today's call will be led by Scott Stephenson, Verisk's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Lee Shavel, Chief Financial Officer and Group President; and Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer and Group President. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-K can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days and on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about our future performance, including but not limited to, the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Scott.\nScott Stephenson: Thanks, Stacey. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Before we discuss the company's performance, I want to first reflect on the recently announced leadership succession plan. After 21 years at Verisk, I will be retiring as CEO following our Annual Meeting of Shareholders, and I'm pleased that Lee Shavel will succeed me as CEO; and Mark Anquillare as President. It has been an honor and privilege to lead Verisk through critical and transformative periods for our company and the industries we serve. With a dynamic executive team, deep bench of talent, strong balance sheet, collaborative culture, a modernized technical environment and leading-edge analytic and software platforms in place, this is the right time to begin the transition to Verisk's next CEO. I have every confidence that under Lee and Mark's steady leadership, the team will continue to empower a better, more resilient and sustainable tomorrow for customers and the world. I'd like to personally thank all 9,000-plus Verisk teammates for their passion and dedication to always being innovative, for their underlying commitment to our customers and for conducting business each and every day with the utmost integrity. I know the Verisk I will be leaving is more data rich, more modern and more integrated with our customers and the future is very bright. Most of you know Lee quite well. Since joining Verisk in 2017, he has served as our Chief Financial Officer and has been a trusted partner who has sharpened our focus on the effective allocation of capital. In 2021, Lee became Group President of our Energy and Financial Services segments and successfully integrated the business for improved strategic and operating coordination and accelerated investment in the company's Energy data analytics platform. In addition, he's been actively engaged in the company's ongoing business and portfolio review, which I'll speak to in just a bit. Partnering with Lee will be Mark Anquillare, who has been elemental to Verisk's growth, operational excellence and customer-centric culture for 30 years. Mark has been instrumental in growing the company's insurance vertical and aligning the company's enterprise risk assessment and management with its core operations. With Lee as CEO and Mark as President, I have great confidence that we have the right team in place as we execute on our plans to enhance shareholder value. And I look forward to working together towards a smooth transition of leadership. I also want to comment briefly on the recent governance actions that were announced last week. These actions were the culmination of a broad shareholder engagement and outreach program that the management team and independent members of our Board of Directors have undertaken since last year's annual meeting. As part of our proactive approach, we focused on environmental, social and governance matters as well as long-term strategic positioning and operational excellence. We appreciated the broad set of perspectives we heard over the course of conversations with investors who represented a wide variety of geographies and investment styles and we greatly value the input we received. Reflecting this feedback from shareholders, we've taken a series of actions, including: first, a proposal in the company's 2022 proxy statement to declassify the Board of Director election terms; second, the separation of the Chairman and CEO roles effective at the 2022 Annual Meeting; third, the implementation of return on invested capital-based incentives for named executive officers and other leaders; fourth, direct oversight from the Board on the risks and opportunities that sustainability issues create; and fifth, continued ongoing Board refreshment. We believe these actions will bring improved transparency, increased accountability and further align our corporate governance with best-in-class practices. Turning now to the financial results, I'm pleased to share that Verisk delivered a strong fourth quarter, demonstrating the consistency and stability of our subscription-based business model, the relevancy and mission-critical nature of our solutions and our relentless focus on our customers. The net result for the fourth quarter was organic constant currency revenue growth of 5.2% and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth of 7.6%, reflecting solid growth in our Insurance segment and sequential improvement in Energy and Financial Services. For the full year, Verisk reported consolidated revenue growth of 7.7% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 6.8%, reflecting the positive impact of the acquisitions, including Jornaya, Data Driven Safety, Roskill and Whitespace. On an organic constant currency basis, Verisk grew revenue 5% and adjusted EBITDA 4.7%. The last year was also one of major technological transformation, international expansion and continued investment in innovation, all of which occurred alongside our comprehensive portfolio review. Starting with our Insurance business. 2021 was a strong year as we reported 6.9% organic constant currency revenue growth and 6.5% organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth. We experienced exceptional new sales growth across the broad range of Insurance solutions, including underwriting, claims, extreme events and international software solutions and strong uptake for new insurtech solutions like our LightSpeed platform. We continue to see strong demand for our ESG-related solutions for corporate customers, including our country, climate and human rights data and analytics solutions. Overall, our Insurance franchise remains competitively positioned and we are advancing our lead by continually building our data advantage and maximizing the strategic synergies across our insurance data assets and solutions. This year, we added 47 new data contributors to our statistical agent database to support ratemaking across our core insurance loans and provide our insurance customers with valuable analytics that can help them innovate and expand in the rapidly changing marketplace. This includes contributions from global, national, super-regional and regional companies and built upon the 37 contributors we added in 2020. Additionally, we expanded our contributory image library with real-time images of damaged property in autos for claims settlement, with the contribution of images from a top five insurer. We also expanded our data use rights for automated underwriting, analytics and subrogation. We continue to experience exponential growth in our small business database, which should fuel future opportunities across the small business lines of Insurance. This continued growth in our contributory data is a testament to our partnership with our customers, who entrust us with their data assets, a responsibility that we do not take for granted. These ever-growing data sets not only enable and empower us to innovate further to solve our customers' problems but they also fortify our competitive position and strengthen our growth potential into the future. Importantly, our strategic decision to expand our gating analytics to additional areas within the broader Insurance segment is delivering results for our customers and for Verisk. For example, Verisk's life insurance solutions combine our data analytics and software platforms within the life and annuity segment, helping carriers, distributors and acquirers transform their product rollout, customer buying experience, underwriting, policy management and claims. In addition, we are saving our customers significant CapEx and OpEx and expediting their speed to market for new products. During 2021, Verisk Life Insurance Solutions delivered strong double-digit growth, with faster growth in our licensed revenues. Moreover, our late 2020 acquisition of Jornaya and the subsequent acquisition of Contact State in the UK is enabling us to extend our data analytic capabilities into the marketing suite of our insurance customers and is driving strong growth for Verisk. Our marketing and analytics solutions help insurance carriers and financial services companies improve the timing, relevancy and compliance of consumer engagements using end-market behaviors and consent-based data solutions. Marketers are increasingly focused on first-party data enrichment as their foundational strategy, all while managing risk and protecting consumer privacy in an increasingly complex and evolving privacy landscape. Jornaya partners with the biggest insurers and powers data-driven personalized marketing programs for their customers' acquisition and retention. We are also excited about the added capabilities we will be bringing to our marketing solutions through the addition of Infutor, a strategic acquisition that we closed earlier this month. The investment rationale for this transaction is clear. Infutor offers real-time identity resolution and consumer intelligence to marketers to help understand the consumer behind each marketing interaction. Combining this with Jornaya's unique insight into in-market behaviors positions Verisk marketing solutions as a key data partner to our insurance customers. It also further strengthens our insurance offering as we continue our portfolio-reshaping efforts and increase our focus on the Insurance segment. Turning to our Energy and Specialized Markets segment. For the full year 2021, we delivered organic constant currency revenue growth of 2.4% and organic constant currency EBITDA growth of 6.4%, reflecting sequential improvement as we move through the year. This was driven in large part by an enthusiastic reception to our Lens platform which helped our Energy businesses deliver solid annualized contract value growth, resulting from three consecutive quarters of mid-single-digit ACV growth. As we continue to integrate the business for improved strategic and operating coordination and accelerate technology investments, we have an active pipeline of new features and functionalities scheduled to be released during 2022 within our Lens platform, including ongoing development of discovery and valuation capabilities in our power, upstream and subsurface packages. In addition, we will continue to bolster our existing data to include emerging technologies such as hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. These combined efforts should continue to drive increased adoption and uptake by our customers. With just over 10% of our ACV related to Lens, we feel confident in our penetration runway and expect us to support continued sequential growth in 2022. Now let's turn and discuss our portfolio review process. As we've mentioned on previous earnings calls, we've been engaged in an ongoing and comprehensive bottoms-up review of our noninsurance businesses and overall portfolio composition. With the assistance of outside advisers, our Board and management team have extensively studied each of our non-Insurance business units, analyzing them across a broad spectrum of financial and operating metrics, including long-term sustainable growth, operating leverage and capital return potential. We also carefully explored competitive positioning, business scale, cross-vertical data and technology synergies and the shape and long-term development of the end markets. Here, our decision making is driving synergies across our businesses and improving sustainable returns on invested capital. It is with this in mind that we determined to sell two of our business units that, after careful review, did not meet certain operating metrics or did not prove to generate the needed synergies. First, we've recently announced the sale of our Environmental Health and Safety business, 3E, to New Mountain Capital for a total potential aggregate consideration of up to $950 million. Verisk intends to return the immediate after-tax proceeds of roughly $460 million to shareholders through share repurchases once the transaction closes late in the first quarter of 2022. Second, as we announced yesterday, we have signed a definitive agreement to sell Verisk Financial Services to TransUnion for a total cash consideration of $55 million. VFS has a unique and proprietary data set that positions them at the nexus of payments, commerce and banking as the only provider of a full customer wallet view of consumer banking and spending behavior. This transaction will best position Verisk Financial to capitalize on the changing market dynamics and continued digitization of banking and retail while providing increased focus for Verisk going forward. The closing of this transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. Like with 3E, we intend to return the after-tax proceeds to shareholders through share repurchases. Moving on to our Energy business. We continue to actively evaluate alternatives for this business with relevant work streams underway. This includes preparing for the potential creation of a stand-alone public entity that would benefit from enhanced independence, agility and unique brand value. We are also exploring how to structure such a transaction in a way that enhances tax efficiency to the benefit of our shareholders. We believe the 2021 ACV momentum, the penetration runway we have for Lens and the long-term growth prospects of the Energy transition represent an immediate growth and return opportunity. We are also undertaking a more intensive review of where we can leverage data sets across our Insurance and Energy businesses to create value for our clients and shareholders. These actions, combined with an improving energy industry end market and newly changed leadership team within the business unit, give us confidence in the continued momentum of this business and gives us the necessary flexibility, regardless of which long-term strategic path we pursue. In connection with our comprehensive portfolio review, we are also undertaking a proactive study of our cost structure to make sure that we better align our costs with the scale and requirements of our ongoing Verisk businesses. Under Mark's leadership, we will continue to work to reduce our overall expense base by more than just those costs associated with the two business units we have agreed to divest. This work includes productivity initiatives from our Lean Six Sigma teams, use of our global talent optimization hubs, the continued modernization of our technology infrastructure and careful management headcount. Certain of these actions are already underway and we plan to further update you on our progress on our next earnings call. We have confidence that through our active management of costs and ongoing transformation of our portfolio, cost structure and technology infrastructure, we can return to growth in line with our long-term objectives and deliver OCC adjusted EBITDA growth ahead of revenue growth in 2022 and beyond. On our technology transformation, we continue to make progress on our move to the cloud and 2022 marks a pivotal year. I'm pleased to share that Verisk no longer owns a mainframe and we've outsourced our small remaining mainframe footprint. Additionally, as we approach over 3/4 of our compute environment residing in the cloud, we will reach the point late this year where we will begin closing the first of our U.S. data centers, with the second to follow in 2023 and officially retire the mainframe of that time. This is an exciting milestone for Verisk and we look forward to achieving these goals and delivering all the benefits of cloud to our customers. Before turning it to Lee, let me touch on our strong free cash flow generation which enables us to fund the highest return on invested capital opportunities, while also directly returning capital to our shareholders. In 2021, we returned over $660 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. I'm pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved a 7% increase in our annualized cash dividend to $1.24 a share and an incremental $1 billion in our share repurchase authorization to support ongoing capital return. And now with that, let me turn the call over to Lee for the financial review.\nLee Shavel: Thank you, Scott. And on behalf of the entire team, let me thank you for your leadership and dedication to Verisk. You have driven the success of Verisk, broadened our horizons and provided a rare balance of leadership and humanity. It has been a privilege to work with you and learn from you over the past five years and I'm fortunate to know that I will have your support and counsel through this transition. I'm humbled to be named Verisk's next CEO and excited about our opportunities to build upon our track record of success and further strengthen the company ahead. I would like to thank the many shareholders, who have personally expressed their confidence in my leadership ahead. And it has been a pleasure to get to know so many of you over the past five years, understand your perspectives and take your input. I look forward to building on this dialogue going forward. Before we discuss the financial results, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted our traditional quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. For the fourth quarter of 2021, on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 7.4% to $766 million. Net income attributable to Verisk decreased 19.5% to $142 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share attributable to Verisk decreased 18.7% to $0.87 per share. Our GAAP results include a release of a $50 million litigation reserve previously taken for a patent suit with EagleView Technologies that has now been settled and a $134 million noncash impairment charge related to our Financial Services segment. Moving to our organic constant currency results, adjusted for nonoperating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release. We are very pleased with our operating results, led by continued and consistent growth in our subscription revenues. In the fourth quarter, organic constant currency revenue grew 5.2%, driven by continued strength in our Insurance segment and sequential improvement within our Energy and Financial Services segments. Our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, as we defined at the beginning of the pandemic, increased 6.2% in the fourth quarter of 2021, our strongest quarter of growth for the year. This stable growth in our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, representing 85% of our total revenues, reflects the durability and resilience of our primarily subscription model and the mission-critical nature of our solutions. Our COVID-sensitive revenues which represent 15% of our consolidated revenues, declined 1.1% as compared to declines of 12.5% in the fourth quarter last year. While certain of our businesses are back to pre-pandemic levels, we experienced a modest step back relative to the third quarter in certain transactional businesses, including workers' compensation claims solutions, repair cost estimating solutions, auto solutions and energy consulting services. Additionally, we saw continued COVID-related weakness in the part of our Financial Services segment related to bankruptcy volumes. To be specific, our COVID-sensitive revenues decreased 2% in both our Insurance and Energy segments but increased 4% within Financial Services. As we move into 2022, we will no longer report this breakdown of our revenue growth as it's becoming less relevant as we are two years into the pandemic and compares have normalized. Consolidated OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 7.6% in the fourth quarter, reflecting core operating leverage on solid revenue growth and cost efficiencies. Total adjusted EBITDA margin which includes both organic and inorganic revenue and adjusted EBITDA, was 49% in the quarter, up 80 basis points on a year-over-year basis and still well above our pre-pandemic margin level of 47.1% recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019. While we are experiencing some inflation in certain of our salaries and benefits and the return of certain COVID-related costs back into the business, we were able to offset that with core operating leverage and efficiencies. This level of margin also includes approximately 70 basis points of headwind from our ongoing technological transformation, including our cloud transition costs which we absorbed into our cost structure. That said, we are already generating real economic value from our cloud transition as our cash flow benefits, primarily from lower capital expenditures on third-party hardware and software, exceed our P&L expense. On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. In the fourth quarter, Insurance segment revenues increased 6.4%. We saw healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, claims analytics solutions, extreme event solutions, life insurance solutions and international insurance software solutions. We did experience a 2% decline in our transactional revenues because of a slower storm season versus last year and a modest step back in certain COVID-related revenues, including workers' compensation claim solutions. Adjusted EBITDA grew 6.3% in the fourth quarter, while margins declined 50 basis points to 54.1%, reflecting a return to a more normalized rate of headcount growth compared to the prior year, higher year-over-year short-term incentive compensation expense and the return of certain travel expenses. Nevertheless, this quarter's margin is still 160 basis points above our pre-pandemic levels recorded in 2019 and continues to reflect accelerated investment in our high-growth areas like Life Insurance and Marketing Solutions, the impact of acquisitions as well as our technology modernization, including our cloud transition. Energy and Specialized Markets revenue increased 2.8% in the fourth quarter, a modest sequential improvement from the third quarter, was building momentum as we enter 2022. In the quarter, we delivered double-digit growth in energy transition and chemicals research, coupled with modest growth in our core research subscriptions. As Scott mentioned, we continue to benefit from strong adoption of our Lens platform as customers are seeing the value of our integrated cloud-based data analytic environment and had a successful renewal cycle in the fourth quarter of 2021, our largest renewal quarter of the year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 15.3% in the fourth quarter and margins expanded 360 basis points to 36.2%. A portion of the margin expansion reflects favorable comparisons versus last year's fourth quarter which included a timing difference for certain compensation expenses that were onetime in nature. For the full year, margins in the Energy segment expanded 90 basis points, reflecting core operating leverage and inclusive of continued investment in our Lens platform and our cloud transition. As we look forward to 2022 for modeling purposes, 3E contributed a high teens percentage of segment-level revenue and adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2021. Given that the transaction is likely to close in the first quarter of 2022, financial results for this business will be included in our GAAP results but will be excluded from all organic constant currency growth figures. Financial Services revenue was essentially flat in the quarter, reflecting double-digit growth in combined spend-informed analytics and portfolio management, offset by continued weakness primarily in the bankruptcy business. Adjusted EBITDA increased 4.6% in the quarter, while total adjusted EBITDA margins were 28.9%, up 230 basis points year-over-year because of expense discipline. Like 3E, results from VFS will be included in our GAAP results but will be excluded from all organic constant currency growth figures. Our reported effective tax rate was 13.7% compared to 18.4% in the prior year quarter. This quarterly tax rate benefited from higher levels of stock option activity and certain onetime discrete items in the quarter. Looking ahead to 2022, we expect our full year tax rate to be between 20% and 22%, though there will likely be some quarterly variability related to the pace of employee stock option exercise. Adjusted net income increased 14.8% to $240 million and adjusted -- diluted adjusted EPS increased 15.7% to $1.47 for the fourth quarter 2021. These increases reflect organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions, a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count. Net cash provided by operating activities was $188.6 million for the quarter, down 24% from the prior year period, reflecting the impact of the onetime payment related to the settlement of the EVT litigation. For the full year, net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion, reflecting growth of 8.2% versus the prior year period. Capital expenditures were $85.3 million for the quarter, up 17.8% versus last year, reflecting increases in capitalized software development, offset in part by savings on third-party software and hardware as we move to the cloud. CapEx for the full year 2021 was $268.4 million as we continue to invest in innovation and future growth opportunities. Capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue was 9% for 2021. As we have discussed previously, our business is becoming increasingly software-intensive, both organically and through our recent acquisitions. Our customers are recognizing the value and capabilities that our proprietary software can deliver, as evidenced by increased subscription pricing and deeper integration with our customers' workflows. As we look forward to 2022, we expect our capital expenditures to approximate $280 million to $310 million. This range supports our plans to increase our software investment through the acceleration of our pace of development in Lens and extending software development into core underwriting, where we believe there is a similar opportunity for platform enhancement. Additionally, it reflects the reality of inflation for hiring talent in software deployment, data science and cloud architecture and the impact of prior acquisitions. These software investments generate some of the highest internal rates of return as we drive incremental value by distributing these platforms across our broad customer base and become even more deeply embedded in customer workforce. We believe these investments will continue to build upon the trend of improving returns on invested capital we recently delivered. Related to CapEx, we expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization to be within the range of $220 million to $240 million and intangible amortization to be approximately $145 million. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to FX variability, the timing of purchases and the completion of projects and future M&A activity. During the fourth quarter, we returned $122 million in capital to shareholders from share repurchases and dividends as our strong cash flow allows us to invest behind our highest-growth and highest-return initiatives, while also returning capital to shareholders consistently. As we look to 2022, we expect to deploy the after-tax proceeds from the sale of our 3E and Verisk Financial businesses for share repurchases in addition to our normal pace of quarterly repurchases which we generally execute through an accelerated share repurchase program. In summary, we are seeing increased momentum across our businesses as demonstrated by our quarterly business. At the same time, we are making important progress executing on strategic, operational and governance initiatives, several of which we announced since our last quarterly call and some of which remain ongoing today and all of which are consistent with our commitment to enhancing shareholder value. We will continue to move diligently ahead in pursuing the most value-creating path for our shareholders and all of Verisk's stakeholders. And we have confidence that through our active cost management and ongoing transformation of our portfolio, cost structure and technology infrastructure, we can return to growth in line with our long-term objectives and deliver OCC adjusted EBITDA ahead of revenue growth in 2022 and beyond. We hope this provides some useful context for you and we look forward to addressing your questions. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We have our first question from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nToni Kaplan: Great. Thank you. I was hoping, Lee, that you'd talk to us a little bit more about the rationale on why a spin is the right move for the Energy business. We're just not getting the price that you wanted. And maybe, also, I'll sneak another one in. Like, could you just talk about how you're viewing the growth priorities for the remaining Insurance business as well, just international, life or just other new products? Thanks so much. Thanks.\nLee Shavel: Yes. Thanks, Toni. So first, I want to be clear that what we're describing is an alternative. And so as we think about the strategic review that we've undertaken, it's clearly an option to think about a separately capitalized entity that enhances the independence, the agility, leverages -- that leverages the standalone brand value of the entity. So from our standpoint, given the momentum that we see within the businesses, as we talked about with the ACV growth in 2021, we want to make certain that we understand the mechanics, the timetable for that option. But we will continue to evaluate the market conditions and our ability to continue to contribute to the growth of that business overall. So to us, it's a natural and understandable alternative for us to consider in terms of overall value creation for the shareholders. I want to make it clear that all options are still on the table. We haven't ruled anything out. And we're, as we've described before, in the process of evaluating those but taking clear steps to be prepared for whichever alternative we think is the best from a value standpoint. On your second question with regard to overall growth priorities, yes, I would say that, firstly, the breadth of what we can address within the insurance industry, given the number of data sets, given the demands, is very broad. And I think we've demonstrated by identifying areas of growth under Mark and his team's leadership. In life, internationally, we've been able to tap into a wide range of new ways to acquire data sets. A part of what, I think, I would like to spend more time thinking about is really elevating the broader utility and industry-oriented mission of our Insurance business. We've done a great job focusing on the needs of our clients. And I think there are opportunities to think about what we can do on a broader industry basis, where we have additional leverage across our existing insurance clients and the functions that the insurance industry provides.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next one we have the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nCharles Peters: Hi, good morning. I guess, congratulations on your retirement, Scott.\nScott Stephenson: Thanks, Greg.\nCharles Peters: And for my question, I guess, I'm going to focus on the CapEx guidance and your comments around CapEx, just looking for more color. So you said, I think, 9% of revenue in '21. If I look at your guidance and I just did some quick back-of-the-envelope math, it looks like CapEx for '22 could be growing faster if at the top end of the range than certainly organic revenue and if with the divestitures as a percentage of revenue is going to increase. So I guess, you've provided some comments, but if you could give us some more granular detail about what's going on there, that would be helpful.\nScott Stephenson: Go ahead.\nLee Shavel: Thanks, Greg. This is Lee. So I think your observations are accurate and I think they reflect a couple of elements that are contributing to that. One is that as a function of a number of initiatives, most significantly Lens, but also some additional CapEx investment that we have made in the Insurance business that we anticipate making in 2022 as well as some CapEx related to the ongoing cloud transition. We have been able to take a lot of hardware and software out, but there are elements of investment that we made in that migration that will continue as we migrate more data sets onto the cloud. Along with the impact of a higher level of capital is capital intensity for our acquisitions. Those are still providing upward pressure on our CapEx as a percentage of revenue, as you've identified. However, one thing that we think is important to balance is that, at the core, those investments, particularly in the software-oriented aspect of capital investment, those are supporting substantial growth and return opportunities within the business. As I mentioned in the comments, our ability to invest in those platforms and broadly distribute them to our client base generates growth. We have seen that specifically with our Lens platform investment, which required a meaningful investment of capital which we were happy to do. And we've been able to observe, as a function of the value that, that has created for our client base, high single digits, even low double-digit pricing increases because of the value of that platform, as well as returns already on that investment at an early stage that are in excess of our cost of capital. So part of, I think, the tension that you've observed is that we do see opportunities to invest capital to support growth and higher returns. And as I said previously, when we're in that situation, we are going to prioritize growth and returns relative to overall capital intensity. And it is our expectation that there will be opportunities to bring that CapEx intensity down over time. But in the near-term, we still see very good growth and returns coming out of that. So hopefully, that gives you some context, in addition to the comments that we made earlier on what's driving that in 2021 and in 2022 with the guidance we provided.\nCharles Peters: It does. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question, we have the line of Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Your lines are open.\nHamzah Mazari: Hey, good morning. Thank you. Congrats on the new role and also congrats on the retirement. My question is just on -- just your go-to-market strategy. There'll be a lot of changes. You talked about Board level, corporate governance, portfolio changes. Could you also talk about whether you've looked at your go-to-market strategy and sales force incentives and maybe how that structure can also change or maybe it doesn't change? And if not, why? Maybe just talk about that. Thank you.\nMark Anquillare: Sure. This is Mark. Let me focus a little bit on the insurance answer there. I think it really starts with our ability to interact most effectively with customers. And over the course of these last few years, I think we've been very pleased with both the level and the number of meetings we've had with executives. So people are very open to getting on a team's call, a virtual call. And we have seen that increase our NPS scores which are internal indications, certainly one of the many. We've seen higher and excellent retention rates. And probably, most importantly, we've seen the best of -- year of new sales that we've ever experienced, all of that driven by what I refer to as higher goals, higher expectations on our sales teams. But what we do is keep our targeted comp generally unchanged. So meaning, the rates or the commercial rates are generally and gradually going down as we achieve more. So I think we're pleased with our go-to-market. We're always looking to refine it. We are always looking to become more effective. And I think the focus right now has been the combination of let's put a team focused on our biggest clients. And we've done a wonderful job with all the insurtechs and newer players, where we've had a lot of new opportunities. So that is how we've, I'd say, adjusted over the last couple of years. Commercial versus commercial -- personal versus commercial focus, attention at the highest level and then attention on those new insurtechs. So always looking to improve but I think we've been quite effective. That's a good summary.\nLee Shavel: And also, I would add on the Energy side. One of the opportunities that we've been very directly engaged in is with the integration of our PowerAdvocate and Wood Mackenzie teams. It's given us an opportunity to think about how we take that core PowerAdvocate product and distribute that more effectively on a joint marketing and sales effort across it. And it's given us opportunity to think more broadly about what our go-to-market strategy is and how we approach that. So that's just on the Energy side, a specific example of our thinking around that topic.\nHamzah Mazari: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next one, we have the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead.\nAlexander Kramm: Yes, hi, good morning, everyone. I want to come back to the earlier question from Toni, I guess, Lee, your new focus areas as you take over the company. I'm asking in particular in what this means for maybe the outlook in the medium term. And I'm asking because you see a lot of companies in the space recently capitalized on new growth initiatives and actually thought positioned themselves for a faster medium-term growth. So wondering, as you refocus the company on the insurance, as you have some maybe new growth opportunities, should we be thinking about maybe accelerated growth rates? Or is 7% still the right number to think about as you take, Lee, the lead here? Thanks.\nLee Shavel: Thank you, Alex. So keep in mind, with the announcement of less than a week ago and the focus on the two transactions that we announced recently, only started to define my objectives and how we think about growth. And they will continue to develop as I spend more time with the business and, most importantly, our clients. I'll start by saying that, at the quarter, as I think all of you can proceed to a phenomenally powerful engine, two, in fact, that I see powering the Verisk plane. One is that rapidly growing number of data sets that have relevance to our clients and industries. And the second is the growing demand and capacity of our clients to ingest and utilize the data. And the fuselage with Verisk in the 9,000 colleagues that we have here who passionately harness those two engines by allowing us to invest in that data and the analytics on behalf of the industries that we serve more efficiently than they could individually and allow us to create value for them, value for our shareholders. So that's really what supports our fundamental growth expectations for the business. The opportunity that I'm immediately focused on is how do we improve our operating leverage internally and externally to expand the lift of those engines: internally, by increasing the operational focus that is a natural extension of the discipline that we've deployed; and externally, by thinking more expansively about how we serve our industries to create value for them and leverage the industry's scale. I'm a big believer in simple wisdom. And I think Archimedes once said a couple of millennia ago that if you give me a big enough lever and a fulcrum to place it on, I can move the world. And we have a lot of compounding levers within Verisk and I'll be focused on bringing them to bear on our business and financial performance. And for the time being, we think that the long-term growth objectives that we have are reasonable growth objectives. Obviously, our objective is to try to improve against those. And I'm looking forward to your input and providing regular updates as we move forward.\nAlexander Kramm: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next one, we have Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.\nJeffrey Silber: Thank you so much. I wanted to talk about margins. I think on your prior call, you talked about adding some expenses over the course of 2022, though you still expected margins to be above the pre-pandemic levels. I was wondering if you can give some color and if, possibly, you can quantify what the order of magnitude will be this year on those additional expenses. Thanks.\nLee Shavel: Sure. So that is something that we are anticipating. I think there are a couple pandemic-related expense items that we are managing. One is the T&E impact and the kind of the normalization of that. And that is a timing aspect of when do we begin to see travel return. The other that I think all companies are experiencing right now are the heightened level of inflation and impact on compensation expectations over time. So each of those are having an impact. We think that the T&E aspect will be gradual. It has had a -- in the fourth quarter, we began to see a little bit more of an impact. It was approximately a negative 50 basis point impact in the fourth quarter on the business -- I'm sorry, on the overall margin for it. We have only seen in 2021 a bit of an STI normalization impact but we'll probably experience a little bit more pressure on that ahead. I think as we think about the overall margin, you hopefully heard it in our comments with regard to the impact of the divestitures and the specific actions that we're taking to eliminate stranded costs, our expectation for 2022 is that we will be able to deliver increased EBITDA growth relative to revenue growth, implying an expectation that through the mix of those elements, the divestitures, the actions that we're taking and also taking into account some normalization of the T&E impact and increased compensation pressures, that we expect to deliver improvement in the margin in 2022.\nJeffrey Silber: Okay, very helpful. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we have Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi, Lee, you could imagine I wanted to jump in a little bit more on that margin comment you just made about '22. Is that going to be margin expansion, let's just say, in the current portfolio? Or is that '22 margin expansion only on an organic basis when you exclude acquisitions that you recently made? And then the other question is, within the medium-term financial targets for the company is double-digit reported EPS growth and I wanted to know if that's also appropriate here for '22.\nLee Shavel: Yes. So Andrew, with regard to 2022, the margin expansion that I described which is a special case because of the structural changes that we are describing, I will say. And you can kind of appreciate that this is not our typical guidance, right, given kind of the structural dimension of it that we believe, based upon factoring all of those elements in the portfolio changes, the actions that we are taking, the impact of acquisitions as we know about at this point, that we do believe that we will be -- we are in a position to deliver margin improvement over that period. We also believe -- and I think this goes to your organic question. We believe that we will be able to more than offset the impact of stranded costs related to the two businesses that we are divesting. So that's our sense of where we are. There are a lot of variables that affect that but that's our expectation at this point. With regard to your question on EPS, we are not -- we still believe that the double-digit EPS objective is something that is achievable as part of our longer-term growth. But we also have to recognize that we will have an impact to EPS as a function of the two divestitures in the period. We don't think it's a significant one but it will certainly be a near-term impact on EPS for 2022. But the underlying dynamics of our expected revenue growth, EBITDA growth and then the management of our share base still positions us to be able to deliver on that double-digit EPS growth over time.\nAndrew Steinerman: Okay, perfect. Thanks for taking the time.\nOperator: Thank you. The next one, we have Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your lines are open.\nJeffrey Meuler: Yes, thank you. Just given all the comments on the inflationary environment, wanted to also ask how you're managing from a pricing perspective, just given the high and growing value clients you're getting from your solutions? And given that I think you just took the annual pricing in ISO and some other solutions, so just how are you factoring in the expense base inflation into how you approach pricing?\nMark Anquillare: So maybe I'll try to take that. What we have typically done is we have tried to value price all of our solutions. And to the extent that you think about the value that we provide as a kind of Verisk providing a platform or an analytic. We've typically entered into multiyear contracts. They're typically three years in duration. So as those come due, we're certainly going to try to push on a little bit more on the increase as it relates to kind of reconciling and talking about the people and the cost of labor. On another front, we have some of our deals that are somewhat tied to premiums. So in the world of a hardening insurance market, that could have some wind at our back over the course of the next year or two. So I would say to you, we are thoughtful about it. We're not aggressive about it. We're trying to make sure we maintain the long-term relationship with customers and that's what is in everyone's best interest.\nJeffrey Meuler: Got it. And congrats to the three of you and best wishes, Scott. Thanks.\nScott Stephenson: Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we have Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital.\nAshish Sabadra: Yes. Let me add my congrats as well to all three of you and best wishes to Scott. Just in terms of question, one quick clarification on the tax leakage on the Financial Services. I was just wondering if you provided the cost basis there and how should we think about the net proceeds versus the gross proceeds? And then maybe a quick question on the insurance. You mentioned some headwinds there in the quarter from a transactional side. But how do we think about the claim business going forward? Are these headwinds just one-off in the fourth quarter? And should we think about the claim business getting back to 7% in '22? Thanks.\nLee Shavel: Thanks, Ashish. So I'll take the first one and hand the second one over to Mark. From a proceeds standpoint, we -- for Financial Services, we're expecting essentially a very similar number to the headline number, slightly less for that. So not a lot of tax leakage on that specific transaction.\nMark Anquillare: And I'll try to address the second topic. A couple of things happened in the quarter that we highlighted from a transactional perspective. First of all, our repair estimating business does benefit from what I'll refer to as some severe weather. Obviously, there's more instances where there is estimate needed to repair property. There was quite a bit of severe weather in the fourth quarter of 2020. It was a rather light and quiet 2021. And the second topic around transactional is in this world of COVID, there is fewer -- we are in a business that relates to workers' comp claims. And we help insurers quantify the cost that they will incur before Medicare picks up those costs. It's called Medicare Set-Aside. And there just have been fewer workers' comp claims in that space as people generally work from home and do the work kind of in a more remote or local setting. So we've seen those two instances on the transactional side of things. Thanks.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for the color. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next one, we have George Tong with Goldman Sachs.\nKeen Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I'd also like to add my congrats to Scott and Lee. So Verisk has announced divestitures of Financial Services and 3E as part of it's portfolio review. How motivated are you to divest the remaining Wood Mackenzie business in the Energy segment?\nScott Stephenson: Hi, George, I think we've been pretty clear that we are looking very deeply at all possible ways of maximizing the value of this very strong business that we've got. We talked specifically about a pathway which would be to make it a free-standing company. That's receiving a great deal of attention right now. At the same time, we're accounting for the condition of the business. We're looking at the real-time progression of the performance of the business. We're looking at the state of the markets and we're looking at the macro environment. And at the intersection of all those things, we will make the ultimate and final decision about the very best way to make it the very best outcome for our shareholders. So very active, very deeply considered and ongoing.\nLee Shavel: And I would just add, our motivation is focused on what is the best value outcome for the business and for the shareholders, George.\nKeen Tong: Very helpful. You mentioned that EBITDA growth this year should outpace revenue growth after taking into account P&E, inflation, stranded costs, et cetera. How do you expect margins to perform moving through 2022?\nLee Shavel: So George, I would refer you back to our general guidance is that we expect, over the long term, for EBITDA to exceed our revenue growth given the operating leverage and feel as though we have demonstrated the underlying model that delivers on that. So that continues to be our expectation.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we have Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask about ESG. I think last week, you announced the launch of some sovereign ESG ratings via Maplecroft. And I was just kind of curious about that opportunity, if you could spend some time maybe talking about the size of that business. Any kind of internal targets for growth or size you can share? Bigger picture, just trying to get a sense for really how big this opportunity could be for your ESG assets specifically. Thank you.\nScott Stephenson: Yes, it's -- thanks for the question. It's exciting. At the moment, we treat it really as an interesting extension of things that we already do. A lot of the strength that we have to offer and the insight that we can bring has developed out of the -- our participation in the vertical markets that we're in, beginning with insurance but also energy. There are important observations that come out of both of them. And so we are trying to render that information and additional information in a way that's useful to a broad set of customers, including insurers and energy companies but also corporates in other places. So it is -- in a sense, it's momentum out of what we already do but it's also kind of new business. And so the overall ultimate appetite of the world for ESG-oriented analytics is probably quite large but we are starting where we are and building out from there. We are -- there are established players in providing comprehensive ratings at the corporate level that we would have to think very carefully before we chose to move in that direction. But we can create a lot of indexed information that is really quite insightful and that's the path we're on right now. So it's a very good vector. It's a long march. The world will have a big appetite for ESG analytics and we will do the Verisk thing in serving that world.\nAndrew Nicholas: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we have Manav Patnaik with Barclays.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. Congratulations to Lee, Mark and Scott. I just wanted to focus on the Insurance segment. A lot of good examples of new data set contributors, progress, et cetera, investments that you were referring to earlier. I think you also just rebranded the business as well. So just in the context of all of that going on, I just wanted to try and get a sense of in what time frame should we start seeing some of these investments start generating revenues that could be accretive to overall kind of that 7% growth you guys have talked about before?\nMark Anquillare: So thanks for the question. I think we're pretty excited about the places that we are investing. We tried to highlight a little bit of the work that we're doing with life insurance and marketing. Those are clearly areas of investment. Also, we talked a little bit about just our core business which represents the ways we go to market and provide our customers with the cost of goods sold and the policy language that they're -- the insurance contracts. We're going to spend some time, hopefully, helping our customers better consume and take on our information in a more cost-effective and efficient way. So in my mind, we've been doing this for like five years or even more, probably 10. And we've been seeing those benefits over the last five in the form of a combination of top line growth which has accelerated and also in the form of customers much more appreciating the services and offerings we provide. So we continue to look very deeply at return on invested capital. We're very thoughtful about where and how we invest. We're kind of tied about that, if you ask our teams, as to how we go about this. So we try to prioritize these in a way that we think will both help our customers and, ultimately, help all stakeholders involved. So we'll continue what we're doing and, hopefully, we can even go faster. I'd say the theme is accelerating.\nLee Shavel: And Manav, thanks. We appreciate the question. And obviously, we're sorting through the impact of a number of the transactions that we've announced recently. And our hope is that, as that settles, we look forward to getting together with investors broadly and talking about all of the elements of growth within the business to give a clearer picture of what Verisk looks like ahead. But we're very excited about that future. As Mark described a couple of those opportunities, one of the ones that we've talked about a fair bit with investors is the investment that we've made in our LightSpeed platform, where we've been able to find a new way, new areas to assist our insurance clients. And it's a perfect example of how we've been able to develop an industry solution. And I think there are a broad range of opportunities that we're thinking about in addition to the investments that we're making in our core lines business to really expand and elevate the services that we provide to our customers there.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next one, we have the line of Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. Thanks so much. And let me add my congratulations all around as well. I wonder, I guess, Lee or Scott, if you could give us some thoughts, it seems like the majority of the proceeds is going to go to buyback as opposed to M&A within the kind of framework of the Insurance business overall. Any thoughts as to M&A within the context of that as opposed to buyback and just a decision on the buyback as opposed to maybe increasing some targeted M&A?\nLee Shavel: Sure. Thanks, Kevin. So we generate, I think, as you'll appreciate, a very substantial amount of capital. Well, I've certainly talked at length around the discipline that we have brought to our M&A function. It's been focused on where we can create value. There has been no constraint on the deals that we want to pursue that we think can generate good returns or additive and value-creating. And so given the proceeds that were released as a function of this transaction, we don't see any need to reserve any portion of that amount for M&A. We can fully fund that out of our existing capital generation. And we think this is a demonstration of our capital discipline of when we have excess capital beyond what we can immediately deploy, we return that to shareholders.\nKevin McVeigh: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next one, we have Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hi, thanks for screening in. I really appreciate it. I apologize, I jumped on the call a little late. I don't know, Mark, if you addressed this at all. But I'm wondering about insurtech broadly. And if you could talk a little bit about the nature of those customers versus, say, legacy P&C customers, what the contracts look like? If there's anything unique about those customers other than their apparently faster growth rate that you think gives Verisk an advantage or you think is notable generally as you look at your overall customer roster? I'm just trying to understand what you think the opportunity is there.\nMark Anquillare: Sure. Let me take that on. So when I think of insurtech, there's two types of insurtechs. There's those folks who are kind of technology-savvy digital agent or underwriter and then there's service providers. And I think your question is focused on the former. Let me say this; we've done exceptionally well with insurtech. And I think, in large part, it's because they are not kind of living through what is a lot of legacy technology and a lot of legacy integrations. They have the ability to choose what we think is the best and most accurate solutions and best analytics, depending on need. And they have, in many cases, almost all cases, chose Verisk which we're delighted to see. What we had in the form of these partners is usually because of their ramping kind of business model, we typically start with kind of a lower price kind of a -- hopefully and get them on door type of price. But what they do is they buy not just one or two solutions but they bought the entire suite. So we have, with these insurtechs, usually a broader and more widespread set of solutions and a broader partnership with these insurtechs. And then as they grow, usually a little bit tied to your size and your premiums, we're able to grow with them. So, I think it's been a great nurturing type of relationship. I think they've helped us get better. They're very creative, very innovative. We think we are the same and it's been a wonderful partnership. So our new sales, our growth and our opportunity has really been bolstered by these insurtechs, Andrew.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Helpful, thanks.\nOperator: We don't have any further questions at this time. And with that, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

            "name": "Lee Shavel",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott. And on behalf of the entire team, let me thank you for your leadership and dedication to Verisk. You have driven the success of Verisk, broadened our horizons and provided a rare balance of leadership and humanity. It has been a privilege to work with you and learn from you over the past five years and I'm fortunate to know that I will have your support and counsel through this transition. I'm humbled to be named Verisk's next CEO and excited about our opportunities to build upon our track record of success and further strengthen the company ahead. I would like to thank the many shareholders, who have personally expressed their confidence in my leadership ahead. And it has been a pleasure to get to know so many of you over the past five years, understand your perspectives and take your input. I look forward to building on this dialogue going forward. Before we discuss the financial results, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted our traditional quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. For the fourth quarter of 2021, on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 7.4% to $766 million. Net income attributable to Verisk decreased 19.5% to $142 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share attributable to Verisk decreased 18.7% to $0.87 per share. Our GAAP results include a release of a $50 million litigation reserve previously taken for a patent suit with EagleView Technologies that has now been settled and a $134 million noncash impairment charge related to our Financial Services segment. Moving to our organic constant currency results, adjusted for nonoperating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release. We are very pleased with our operating results, led by continued and consistent growth in our subscription revenues. In the fourth quarter, organic constant currency revenue grew 5.2%, driven by continued strength in our Insurance segment and sequential improvement within our Energy and Financial Services segments. Our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, as we defined at the beginning of the pandemic, increased 6.2% in the fourth quarter of 2021, our strongest quarter of growth for the year. This stable growth in our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, representing 85% of our total revenues, reflects the durability and resilience of our primarily subscription model and the mission-critical nature of our solutions. Our COVID-sensitive revenues which represent 15% of our consolidated revenues, declined 1.1% as compared to declines of 12.5% in the fourth quarter last year. While certain of our businesses are back to pre-pandemic levels, we experienced a modest step back relative to the third quarter in certain transactional businesses, including workers' compensation claims solutions, repair cost estimating solutions, auto solutions and energy consulting services. Additionally, we saw continued COVID-related weakness in the part of our Financial Services segment related to bankruptcy volumes. To be specific, our COVID-sensitive revenues decreased 2% in both our Insurance and Energy segments but increased 4% within Financial Services. As we move into 2022, we will no longer report this breakdown of our revenue growth as it's becoming less relevant as we are two years into the pandemic and compares have normalized. Consolidated OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 7.6% in the fourth quarter, reflecting core operating leverage on solid revenue growth and cost efficiencies. Total adjusted EBITDA margin which includes both organic and inorganic revenue and adjusted EBITDA, was 49% in the quarter, up 80 basis points on a year-over-year basis and still well above our pre-pandemic margin level of 47.1% recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019. While we are experiencing some inflation in certain of our salaries and benefits and the return of certain COVID-related costs back into the business, we were able to offset that with core operating leverage and efficiencies. This level of margin also includes approximately 70 basis points of headwind from our ongoing technological transformation, including our cloud transition costs which we absorbed into our cost structure. That said, we are already generating real economic value from our cloud transition as our cash flow benefits, primarily from lower capital expenditures on third-party hardware and software, exceed our P&L expense. On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. In the fourth quarter, Insurance segment revenues increased 6.4%. We saw healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, claims analytics solutions, extreme event solutions, life insurance solutions and international insurance software solutions. We did experience a 2% decline in our transactional revenues because of a slower storm season versus last year and a modest step back in certain COVID-related revenues, including workers' compensation claim solutions. Adjusted EBITDA grew 6.3% in the fourth quarter, while margins declined 50 basis points to 54.1%, reflecting a return to a more normalized rate of headcount growth compared to the prior year, higher year-over-year short-term incentive compensation expense and the return of certain travel expenses. Nevertheless, this quarter's margin is still 160 basis points above our pre-pandemic levels recorded in 2019 and continues to reflect accelerated investment in our high-growth areas like Life Insurance and Marketing Solutions, the impact of acquisitions as well as our technology modernization, including our cloud transition. Energy and Specialized Markets revenue increased 2.8% in the fourth quarter, a modest sequential improvement from the third quarter, was building momentum as we enter 2022. In the quarter, we delivered double-digit growth in energy transition and chemicals research, coupled with modest growth in our core research subscriptions. As Scott mentioned, we continue to benefit from strong adoption of our Lens platform as customers are seeing the value of our integrated cloud-based data analytic environment and had a successful renewal cycle in the fourth quarter of 2021, our largest renewal quarter of the year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 15.3% in the fourth quarter and margins expanded 360 basis points to 36.2%. A portion of the margin expansion reflects favorable comparisons versus last year's fourth quarter which included a timing difference for certain compensation expenses that were onetime in nature. For the full year, margins in the Energy segment expanded 90 basis points, reflecting core operating leverage and inclusive of continued investment in our Lens platform and our cloud transition. As we look forward to 2022 for modeling purposes, 3E contributed a high teens percentage of segment-level revenue and adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2021. Given that the transaction is likely to close in the first quarter of 2022, financial results for this business will be included in our GAAP results but will be excluded from all organic constant currency growth figures. Financial Services revenue was essentially flat in the quarter, reflecting double-digit growth in combined spend-informed analytics and portfolio management, offset by continued weakness primarily in the bankruptcy business. Adjusted EBITDA increased 4.6% in the quarter, while total adjusted EBITDA margins were 28.9%, up 230 basis points year-over-year because of expense discipline. Like 3E, results from VFS will be included in our GAAP results but will be excluded from all organic constant currency growth figures. Our reported effective tax rate was 13.7% compared to 18.4% in the prior year quarter. This quarterly tax rate benefited from higher levels of stock option activity and certain onetime discrete items in the quarter. Looking ahead to 2022, we expect our full year tax rate to be between 20% and 22%, though there will likely be some quarterly variability related to the pace of employee stock option exercise. Adjusted net income increased 14.8% to $240 million and adjusted -- diluted adjusted EPS increased 15.7% to $1.47 for the fourth quarter 2021. These increases reflect organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions, a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count. Net cash provided by operating activities was $188.6 million for the quarter, down 24% from the prior year period, reflecting the impact of the onetime payment related to the settlement of the EVT litigation. For the full year, net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion, reflecting growth of 8.2% versus the prior year period. Capital expenditures were $85.3 million for the quarter, up 17.8% versus last year, reflecting increases in capitalized software development, offset in part by savings on third-party software and hardware as we move to the cloud. CapEx for the full year 2021 was $268.4 million as we continue to invest in innovation and future growth opportunities. Capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue was 9% for 2021. As we have discussed previously, our business is becoming increasingly software-intensive, both organically and through our recent acquisitions. Our customers are recognizing the value and capabilities that our proprietary software can deliver, as evidenced by increased subscription pricing and deeper integration with our customers' workflows. As we look forward to 2022, we expect our capital expenditures to approximate $280 million to $310 million. This range supports our plans to increase our software investment through the acceleration of our pace of development in Lens and extending software development into core underwriting, where we believe there is a similar opportunity for platform enhancement. Additionally, it reflects the reality of inflation for hiring talent in software deployment, data science and cloud architecture and the impact of prior acquisitions. These software investments generate some of the highest internal rates of return as we drive incremental value by distributing these platforms across our broad customer base and become even more deeply embedded in customer workforce. We believe these investments will continue to build upon the trend of improving returns on invested capital we recently delivered. Related to CapEx, we expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization to be within the range of $220 million to $240 million and intangible amortization to be approximately $145 million. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to FX variability, the timing of purchases and the completion of projects and future M&A activity. During the fourth quarter, we returned $122 million in capital to shareholders from share repurchases and dividends as our strong cash flow allows us to invest behind our highest-growth and highest-return initiatives, while also returning capital to shareholders consistently. As we look to 2022, we expect to deploy the after-tax proceeds from the sale of our 3E and Verisk Financial businesses for share repurchases in addition to our normal pace of quarterly repurchases which we generally execute through an accelerated share repurchase program. In summary, we are seeing increased momentum across our businesses as demonstrated by our quarterly business. At the same time, we are making important progress executing on strategic, operational and governance initiatives, several of which we announced since our last quarterly call and some of which remain ongoing today and all of which are consistent with our commitment to enhancing shareholder value. We will continue to move diligently ahead in pursuing the most value-creating path for our shareholders and all of Verisk's stakeholders. And we have confidence that through our active cost management and ongoing transformation of our portfolio, cost structure and technology infrastructure, we can return to growth in line with our long-term objectives and deliver OCC adjusted EBITDA ahead of revenue growth in 2022 and beyond. We hope this provides some useful context for you and we look forward to addressing your questions. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions. Yes. Thanks, Toni. So first, I want to be clear that what we're describing is an alternative. And so as we think about the strategic review that we've undertaken, it's clearly an option to think about a separately capitalized entity that enhances the independence, the agility, leverages -- that leverages the standalone brand value of the entity. So from our standpoint, given the momentum that we see within the businesses, as we talked about with the ACV growth in 2021, we want to make certain that we understand the mechanics, the timetable for that option. But we will continue to evaluate the market conditions and our ability to continue to contribute to the growth of that business overall. So to us, it's a natural and understandable alternative for us to consider in terms of overall value creation for the shareholders. I want to make it clear that all options are still on the table. We haven't ruled anything out. And we're, as we've described before, in the process of evaluating those but taking clear steps to be prepared for whichever alternative we think is the best from a value standpoint. On your second question with regard to overall growth priorities, yes, I would say that, firstly, the breadth of what we can address within the insurance industry, given the number of data sets, given the demands, is very broad. And I think we've demonstrated by identifying areas of growth under Mark and his team's leadership. In life, internationally, we've been able to tap into a wide range of new ways to acquire data sets. A part of what, I think, I would like to spend more time thinking about is really elevating the broader utility and industry-oriented mission of our Insurance business. We've done a great job focusing on the needs of our clients. And I think there are opportunities to think about what we can do on a broader industry basis, where we have additional leverage across our existing insurance clients and the functions that the insurance industry provides. Thanks, Greg. This is Lee. So I think your observations are accurate and I think they reflect a couple of elements that are contributing to that. One is that as a function of a number of initiatives, most significantly Lens, but also some additional CapEx investment that we have made in the Insurance business that we anticipate making in 2022 as well as some CapEx related to the ongoing cloud transition. We have been able to take a lot of hardware and software out, but there are elements of investment that we made in that migration that will continue as we migrate more data sets onto the cloud. Along with the impact of a higher level of capital is capital intensity for our acquisitions. Those are still providing upward pressure on our CapEx as a percentage of revenue, as you've identified. However, one thing that we think is important to balance is that, at the core, those investments, particularly in the software-oriented aspect of capital investment, those are supporting substantial growth and return opportunities within the business. As I mentioned in the comments, our ability to invest in those platforms and broadly distribute them to our client base generates growth. We have seen that specifically with our Lens platform investment, which required a meaningful investment of capital which we were happy to do. And we've been able to observe, as a function of the value that, that has created for our client base, high single digits, even low double-digit pricing increases because of the value of that platform, as well as returns already on that investment at an early stage that are in excess of our cost of capital. So part of, I think, the tension that you've observed is that we do see opportunities to invest capital to support growth and higher returns. And as I said previously, when we're in that situation, we are going to prioritize growth and returns relative to overall capital intensity. And it is our expectation that there will be opportunities to bring that CapEx intensity down over time. But in the near-term, we still see very good growth and returns coming out of that. So hopefully, that gives you some context, in addition to the comments that we made earlier on what's driving that in 2021 and in 2022 with the guidance we provided. And also, I would add on the Energy side. One of the opportunities that we've been very directly engaged in is with the integration of our PowerAdvocate and Wood Mackenzie teams. It's given us an opportunity to think about how we take that core PowerAdvocate product and distribute that more effectively on a joint marketing and sales effort across it. And it's given us opportunity to think more broadly about what our go-to-market strategy is and how we approach that. So that's just on the Energy side, a specific example of our thinking around that topic. Thank you, Alex. So keep in mind, with the announcement of less than a week ago and the focus on the two transactions that we announced recently, only started to define my objectives and how we think about growth. And they will continue to develop as I spend more time with the business and, most importantly, our clients. I'll start by saying that, at the quarter, as I think all of you can proceed to a phenomenally powerful engine, two, in fact, that I see powering the Verisk plane. One is that rapidly growing number of data sets that have relevance to our clients and industries. And the second is the growing demand and capacity of our clients to ingest and utilize the data. And the fuselage with Verisk in the 9,000 colleagues that we have here who passionately harness those two engines by allowing us to invest in that data and the analytics on behalf of the industries that we serve more efficiently than they could individually and allow us to create value for them, value for our shareholders. So that's really what supports our fundamental growth expectations for the business. The opportunity that I'm immediately focused on is how do we improve our operating leverage internally and externally to expand the lift of those engines: internally, by increasing the operational focus that is a natural extension of the discipline that we've deployed; and externally, by thinking more expansively about how we serve our industries to create value for them and leverage the industry's scale. I'm a big believer in simple wisdom. And I think Archimedes once said a couple of millennia ago that if you give me a big enough lever and a fulcrum to place it on, I can move the world. And we have a lot of compounding levers within Verisk and I'll be focused on bringing them to bear on our business and financial performance. And for the time being, we think that the long-term growth objectives that we have are reasonable growth objectives. Obviously, our objective is to try to improve against those. And I'm looking forward to your input and providing regular updates as we move forward. Sure. So that is something that we are anticipating. I think there are a couple pandemic-related expense items that we are managing. One is the T&E impact and the kind of the normalization of that. And that is a timing aspect of when do we begin to see travel return. The other that I think all companies are experiencing right now are the heightened level of inflation and impact on compensation expectations over time. So each of those are having an impact. We think that the T&E aspect will be gradual. It has had a -- in the fourth quarter, we began to see a little bit more of an impact. It was approximately a negative 50 basis point impact in the fourth quarter on the business -- I'm sorry, on the overall margin for it. We have only seen in 2021 a bit of an STI normalization impact but we'll probably experience a little bit more pressure on that ahead. I think as we think about the overall margin, you hopefully heard it in our comments with regard to the impact of the divestitures and the specific actions that we're taking to eliminate stranded costs, our expectation for 2022 is that we will be able to deliver increased EBITDA growth relative to revenue growth, implying an expectation that through the mix of those elements, the divestitures, the actions that we're taking and also taking into account some normalization of the T&E impact and increased compensation pressures, that we expect to deliver improvement in the margin in 2022. Yes. So Andrew, with regard to 2022, the margin expansion that I described which is a special case because of the structural changes that we are describing, I will say. And you can kind of appreciate that this is not our typical guidance, right, given kind of the structural dimension of it that we believe, based upon factoring all of those elements in the portfolio changes, the actions that we are taking, the impact of acquisitions as we know about at this point, that we do believe that we will be -- we are in a position to deliver margin improvement over that period. We also believe -- and I think this goes to your organic question. We believe that we will be able to more than offset the impact of stranded costs related to the two businesses that we are divesting. So that's our sense of where we are. There are a lot of variables that affect that but that's our expectation at this point. With regard to your question on EPS, we are not -- we still believe that the double-digit EPS objective is something that is achievable as part of our longer-term growth. But we also have to recognize that we will have an impact to EPS as a function of the two divestitures in the period. We don't think it's a significant one but it will certainly be a near-term impact on EPS for 2022. But the underlying dynamics of our expected revenue growth, EBITDA growth and then the management of our share base still positions us to be able to deliver on that double-digit EPS growth over time. Thanks, Ashish. So I'll take the first one and hand the second one over to Mark. From a proceeds standpoint, we -- for Financial Services, we're expecting essentially a very similar number to the headline number, slightly less for that. So not a lot of tax leakage on that specific transaction. And I would just add, our motivation is focused on what is the best value outcome for the business and for the shareholders, George. So George, I would refer you back to our general guidance is that we expect, over the long term, for EBITDA to exceed our revenue growth given the operating leverage and feel as though we have demonstrated the underlying model that delivers on that. So that continues to be our expectation. And Manav, thanks. We appreciate the question. And obviously, we're sorting through the impact of a number of the transactions that we've announced recently. And our hope is that, as that settles, we look forward to getting together with investors broadly and talking about all of the elements of growth within the business to give a clearer picture of what Verisk looks like ahead. But we're very excited about that future. As Mark described a couple of those opportunities, one of the ones that we've talked about a fair bit with investors is the investment that we've made in our LightSpeed platform, where we've been able to find a new way, new areas to assist our insurance clients. And it's a perfect example of how we've been able to develop an industry solution. And I think there are a broad range of opportunities that we're thinking about in addition to the investments that we're making in our core lines business to really expand and elevate the services that we provide to our customers there. Sure. Thanks, Kevin. So we generate, I think, as you'll appreciate, a very substantial amount of capital. Well, I've certainly talked at length around the discipline that we have brought to our M&A function. It's been focused on where we can create value. There has been no constraint on the deals that we want to pursue that we think can generate good returns or additive and value-creating. And so given the proceeds that were released as a function of this transaction, we don't see any need to reserve any portion of that amount for M&A. We can fully fund that out of our existing capital generation. And we think this is a demonstration of our capital discipline of when we have excess capital beyond what we can immediately deploy, we return that to shareholders."

            "name": "Scott Stephenson",
            "content": "Thanks, Stacey. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Before we discuss the company's performance, I want to first reflect on the recently announced leadership succession plan. After 21 years at Verisk, I will be retiring as CEO following our Annual Meeting of Shareholders, and I'm pleased that Lee Shavel will succeed me as CEO; and Mark Anquillare as President. It has been an honor and privilege to lead Verisk through critical and transformative periods for our company and the industries we serve. With a dynamic executive team, deep bench of talent, strong balance sheet, collaborative culture, a modernized technical environment and leading-edge analytic and software platforms in place, this is the right time to begin the transition to Verisk's next CEO. I have every confidence that under Lee and Mark's steady leadership, the team will continue to empower a better, more resilient and sustainable tomorrow for customers and the world. I'd like to personally thank all 9,000-plus Verisk teammates for their passion and dedication to always being innovative, for their underlying commitment to our customers and for conducting business each and every day with the utmost integrity. I know the Verisk I will be leaving is more data rich, more modern and more integrated with our customers and the future is very bright. Most of you know Lee quite well. Since joining Verisk in 2017, he has served as our Chief Financial Officer and has been a trusted partner who has sharpened our focus on the effective allocation of capital. In 2021, Lee became Group President of our Energy and Financial Services segments and successfully integrated the business for improved strategic and operating coordination and accelerated investment in the company's Energy data analytics platform. In addition, he's been actively engaged in the company's ongoing business and portfolio review, which I'll speak to in just a bit. Partnering with Lee will be Mark Anquillare, who has been elemental to Verisk's growth, operational excellence and customer-centric culture for 30 years. Mark has been instrumental in growing the company's insurance vertical and aligning the company's enterprise risk assessment and management with its core operations. With Lee as CEO and Mark as President, I have great confidence that we have the right team in place as we execute on our plans to enhance shareholder value. And I look forward to working together towards a smooth transition of leadership. I also want to comment briefly on the recent governance actions that were announced last week. These actions were the culmination of a broad shareholder engagement and outreach program that the management team and independent members of our Board of Directors have undertaken since last year's annual meeting. As part of our proactive approach, we focused on environmental, social and governance matters as well as long-term strategic positioning and operational excellence. We appreciated the broad set of perspectives we heard over the course of conversations with investors who represented a wide variety of geographies and investment styles and we greatly value the input we received. Reflecting this feedback from shareholders, we've taken a series of actions, including: first, a proposal in the company's 2022 proxy statement to declassify the Board of Director election terms; second, the separation of the Chairman and CEO roles effective at the 2022 Annual Meeting; third, the implementation of return on invested capital-based incentives for named executive officers and other leaders; fourth, direct oversight from the Board on the risks and opportunities that sustainability issues create; and fifth, continued ongoing Board refreshment. We believe these actions will bring improved transparency, increased accountability and further align our corporate governance with best-in-class practices. Turning now to the financial results, I'm pleased to share that Verisk delivered a strong fourth quarter, demonstrating the consistency and stability of our subscription-based business model, the relevancy and mission-critical nature of our solutions and our relentless focus on our customers. The net result for the fourth quarter was organic constant currency revenue growth of 5.2% and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth of 7.6%, reflecting solid growth in our Insurance segment and sequential improvement in Energy and Financial Services. For the full year, Verisk reported consolidated revenue growth of 7.7% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 6.8%, reflecting the positive impact of the acquisitions, including Jornaya, Data Driven Safety, Roskill and Whitespace. On an organic constant currency basis, Verisk grew revenue 5% and adjusted EBITDA 4.7%. The last year was also one of major technological transformation, international expansion and continued investment in innovation, all of which occurred alongside our comprehensive portfolio review. Starting with our Insurance business. 2021 was a strong year as we reported 6.9% organic constant currency revenue growth and 6.5% organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth. We experienced exceptional new sales growth across the broad range of Insurance solutions, including underwriting, claims, extreme events and international software solutions and strong uptake for new insurtech solutions like our LightSpeed platform. We continue to see strong demand for our ESG-related solutions for corporate customers, including our country, climate and human rights data and analytics solutions. Overall, our Insurance franchise remains competitively positioned and we are advancing our lead by continually building our data advantage and maximizing the strategic synergies across our insurance data assets and solutions. This year, we added 47 new data contributors to our statistical agent database to support ratemaking across our core insurance loans and provide our insurance customers with valuable analytics that can help them innovate and expand in the rapidly changing marketplace. This includes contributions from global, national, super-regional and regional companies and built upon the 37 contributors we added in 2020. Additionally, we expanded our contributory image library with real-time images of damaged property in autos for claims settlement, with the contribution of images from a top five insurer. We also expanded our data use rights for automated underwriting, analytics and subrogation. We continue to experience exponential growth in our small business database, which should fuel future opportunities across the small business lines of Insurance. This continued growth in our contributory data is a testament to our partnership with our customers, who entrust us with their data assets, a responsibility that we do not take for granted. These ever-growing data sets not only enable and empower us to innovate further to solve our customers' problems but they also fortify our competitive position and strengthen our growth potential into the future. Importantly, our strategic decision to expand our gating analytics to additional areas within the broader Insurance segment is delivering results for our customers and for Verisk. For example, Verisk's life insurance solutions combine our data analytics and software platforms within the life and annuity segment, helping carriers, distributors and acquirers transform their product rollout, customer buying experience, underwriting, policy management and claims. In addition, we are saving our customers significant CapEx and OpEx and expediting their speed to market for new products. During 2021, Verisk Life Insurance Solutions delivered strong double-digit growth, with faster growth in our licensed revenues. Moreover, our late 2020 acquisition of Jornaya and the subsequent acquisition of Contact State in the UK is enabling us to extend our data analytic capabilities into the marketing suite of our insurance customers and is driving strong growth for Verisk. Our marketing and analytics solutions help insurance carriers and financial services companies improve the timing, relevancy and compliance of consumer engagements using end-market behaviors and consent-based data solutions. Marketers are increasingly focused on first-party data enrichment as their foundational strategy, all while managing risk and protecting consumer privacy in an increasingly complex and evolving privacy landscape. Jornaya partners with the biggest insurers and powers data-driven personalized marketing programs for their customers' acquisition and retention. We are also excited about the added capabilities we will be bringing to our marketing solutions through the addition of Infutor, a strategic acquisition that we closed earlier this month. The investment rationale for this transaction is clear. Infutor offers real-time identity resolution and consumer intelligence to marketers to help understand the consumer behind each marketing interaction. Combining this with Jornaya's unique insight into in-market behaviors positions Verisk marketing solutions as a key data partner to our insurance customers. It also further strengthens our insurance offering as we continue our portfolio-reshaping efforts and increase our focus on the Insurance segment. Turning to our Energy and Specialized Markets segment. For the full year 2021, we delivered organic constant currency revenue growth of 2.4% and organic constant currency EBITDA growth of 6.4%, reflecting sequential improvement as we move through the year. This was driven in large part by an enthusiastic reception to our Lens platform which helped our Energy businesses deliver solid annualized contract value growth, resulting from three consecutive quarters of mid-single-digit ACV growth. As we continue to integrate the business for improved strategic and operating coordination and accelerate technology investments, we have an active pipeline of new features and functionalities scheduled to be released during 2022 within our Lens platform, including ongoing development of discovery and valuation capabilities in our power, upstream and subsurface packages. In addition, we will continue to bolster our existing data to include emerging technologies such as hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. These combined efforts should continue to drive increased adoption and uptake by our customers. With just over 10% of our ACV related to Lens, we feel confident in our penetration runway and expect us to support continued sequential growth in 2022. Now let's turn and discuss our portfolio review process. As we've mentioned on previous earnings calls, we've been engaged in an ongoing and comprehensive bottoms-up review of our noninsurance businesses and overall portfolio composition. With the assistance of outside advisers, our Board and management team have extensively studied each of our non-Insurance business units, analyzing them across a broad spectrum of financial and operating metrics, including long-term sustainable growth, operating leverage and capital return potential. We also carefully explored competitive positioning, business scale, cross-vertical data and technology synergies and the shape and long-term development of the end markets. Here, our decision making is driving synergies across our businesses and improving sustainable returns on invested capital. It is with this in mind that we determined to sell two of our business units that, after careful review, did not meet certain operating metrics or did not prove to generate the needed synergies. First, we've recently announced the sale of our Environmental Health and Safety business, 3E, to New Mountain Capital for a total potential aggregate consideration of up to $950 million. Verisk intends to return the immediate after-tax proceeds of roughly $460 million to shareholders through share repurchases once the transaction closes late in the first quarter of 2022. Second, as we announced yesterday, we have signed a definitive agreement to sell Verisk Financial Services to TransUnion for a total cash consideration of $55 million. VFS has a unique and proprietary data set that positions them at the nexus of payments, commerce and banking as the only provider of a full customer wallet view of consumer banking and spending behavior. This transaction will best position Verisk Financial to capitalize on the changing market dynamics and continued digitization of banking and retail while providing increased focus for Verisk going forward. The closing of this transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. Like with 3E, we intend to return the after-tax proceeds to shareholders through share repurchases. Moving on to our Energy business. We continue to actively evaluate alternatives for this business with relevant work streams underway. This includes preparing for the potential creation of a stand-alone public entity that would benefit from enhanced independence, agility and unique brand value. We are also exploring how to structure such a transaction in a way that enhances tax efficiency to the benefit of our shareholders. We believe the 2021 ACV momentum, the penetration runway we have for Lens and the long-term growth prospects of the Energy transition represent an immediate growth and return opportunity. We are also undertaking a more intensive review of where we can leverage data sets across our Insurance and Energy businesses to create value for our clients and shareholders. These actions, combined with an improving energy industry end market and newly changed leadership team within the business unit, give us confidence in the continued momentum of this business and gives us the necessary flexibility, regardless of which long-term strategic path we pursue. In connection with our comprehensive portfolio review, we are also undertaking a proactive study of our cost structure to make sure that we better align our costs with the scale and requirements of our ongoing Verisk businesses. Under Mark's leadership, we will continue to work to reduce our overall expense base by more than just those costs associated with the two business units we have agreed to divest. This work includes productivity initiatives from our Lean Six Sigma teams, use of our global talent optimization hubs, the continued modernization of our technology infrastructure and careful management headcount. Certain of these actions are already underway and we plan to further update you on our progress on our next earnings call. We have confidence that through our active management of costs and ongoing transformation of our portfolio, cost structure and technology infrastructure, we can return to growth in line with our long-term objectives and deliver OCC adjusted EBITDA growth ahead of revenue growth in 2022 and beyond. On our technology transformation, we continue to make progress on our move to the cloud and 2022 marks a pivotal year. I'm pleased to share that Verisk no longer owns a mainframe and we've outsourced our small remaining mainframe footprint. Additionally, as we approach over 3/4 of our compute environment residing in the cloud, we will reach the point late this year where we will begin closing the first of our U.S. data centers, with the second to follow in 2023 and officially retire the mainframe of that time. This is an exciting milestone for Verisk and we look forward to achieving these goals and delivering all the benefits of cloud to our customers. Before turning it to Lee, let me touch on our strong free cash flow generation which enables us to fund the highest return on invested capital opportunities, while also directly returning capital to our shareholders. In 2021, we returned over $660 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. I'm pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved a 7% increase in our annualized cash dividend to $1.24 a share and an incremental $1 billion in our share repurchase authorization to support ongoing capital return. And now with that, let me turn the call over to Lee for the financial review. Thanks, Greg. Go ahead. Thanks, Jeff. Hi, George, I think we've been pretty clear that we are looking very deeply at all possible ways of maximizing the value of this very strong business that we've got. We talked specifically about a pathway which would be to make it a free-standing company. That's receiving a great deal of attention right now. At the same time, we're accounting for the condition of the business. We're looking at the real-time progression of the performance of the business. We're looking at the state of the markets and we're looking at the macro environment. And at the intersection of all those things, we will make the ultimate and final decision about the very best way to make it the very best outcome for our shareholders. So very active, very deeply considered and ongoing. Yes, it's -- thanks for the question. It's exciting. At the moment, we treat it really as an interesting extension of things that we already do. A lot of the strength that we have to offer and the insight that we can bring has developed out of the -- our participation in the vertical markets that we're in, beginning with insurance but also energy. There are important observations that come out of both of them. And so we are trying to render that information and additional information in a way that's useful to a broad set of customers, including insurers and energy companies but also corporates in other places. So it is -- in a sense, it's momentum out of what we already do but it's also kind of new business. And so the overall ultimate appetite of the world for ESG-oriented analytics is probably quite large but we are starting where we are and building out from there. We are -- there are established players in providing comprehensive ratings at the corporate level that we would have to think very carefully before we chose to move in that direction. But we can create a lot of indexed information that is really quite insightful and that's the path we're on right now. So it's a very good vector. It's a long march. The world will have a big appetite for ESG analytics and we will do the Verisk thing in serving that world."

            "name": "Mark Anquillare",
            "content": "Sure. This is Mark. Let me focus a little bit on the insurance answer there. I think it really starts with our ability to interact most effectively with customers. And over the course of these last few years, I think we've been very pleased with both the level and the number of meetings we've had with executives. So people are very open to getting on a team's call, a virtual call. And we have seen that increase our NPS scores which are internal indications, certainly one of the many. We've seen higher and excellent retention rates. And probably, most importantly, we've seen the best of -- year of new sales that we've ever experienced, all of that driven by what I refer to as higher goals, higher expectations on our sales teams. But what we do is keep our targeted comp generally unchanged. So meaning, the rates or the commercial rates are generally and gradually going down as we achieve more. So I think we're pleased with our go-to-market. We're always looking to refine it. We are always looking to become more effective. And I think the focus right now has been the combination of let's put a team focused on our biggest clients. And we've done a wonderful job with all the insurtechs and newer players, where we've had a lot of new opportunities. So that is how we've, I'd say, adjusted over the last couple of years. Commercial versus commercial -- personal versus commercial focus, attention at the highest level and then attention on those new insurtechs. So always looking to improve but I think we've been quite effective. That's a good summary. So maybe I'll try to take that. What we have typically done is we have tried to value price all of our solutions. And to the extent that you think about the value that we provide as a kind of Verisk providing a platform or an analytic. We've typically entered into multiyear contracts. They're typically three years in duration. So as those come due, we're certainly going to try to push on a little bit more on the increase as it relates to kind of reconciling and talking about the people and the cost of labor. On another front, we have some of our deals that are somewhat tied to premiums. So in the world of a hardening insurance market, that could have some wind at our back over the course of the next year or two. So I would say to you, we are thoughtful about it. We're not aggressive about it. We're trying to make sure we maintain the long-term relationship with customers and that's what is in everyone's best interest. And I'll try to address the second topic. A couple of things happened in the quarter that we highlighted from a transactional perspective. First of all, our repair estimating business does benefit from what I'll refer to as some severe weather. Obviously, there's more instances where there is estimate needed to repair property. There was quite a bit of severe weather in the fourth quarter of 2020. It was a rather light and quiet 2021. And the second topic around transactional is in this world of COVID, there is fewer -- we are in a business that relates to workers' comp claims. And we help insurers quantify the cost that they will incur before Medicare picks up those costs. It's called Medicare Set-Aside. And there just have been fewer workers' comp claims in that space as people generally work from home and do the work kind of in a more remote or local setting. So we've seen those two instances on the transactional side of things. Thanks. So thanks for the question. I think we're pretty excited about the places that we are investing. We tried to highlight a little bit of the work that we're doing with life insurance and marketing. Those are clearly areas of investment. Also, we talked a little bit about just our core business which represents the ways we go to market and provide our customers with the cost of goods sold and the policy language that they're -- the insurance contracts. We're going to spend some time, hopefully, helping our customers better consume and take on our information in a more cost-effective and efficient way. So in my mind, we've been doing this for like five years or even more, probably 10. And we've been seeing those benefits over the last five in the form of a combination of top line growth which has accelerated and also in the form of customers much more appreciating the services and offerings we provide. So we continue to look very deeply at return on invested capital. We're very thoughtful about where and how we invest. We're kind of tied about that, if you ask our teams, as to how we go about this. So we try to prioritize these in a way that we think will both help our customers and, ultimately, help all stakeholders involved. So we'll continue what we're doing and, hopefully, we can even go faster. I'd say the theme is accelerating. Sure. Let me take that on. So when I think of insurtech, there's two types of insurtechs. There's those folks who are kind of technology-savvy digital agent or underwriter and then there's service providers. And I think your question is focused on the former. Let me say this; we've done exceptionally well with insurtech. And I think, in large part, it's because they are not kind of living through what is a lot of legacy technology and a lot of legacy integrations. They have the ability to choose what we think is the best and most accurate solutions and best analytics, depending on need. And they have, in many cases, almost all cases, chose Verisk which we're delighted to see. What we had in the form of these partners is usually because of their ramping kind of business model, we typically start with kind of a lower price kind of a -- hopefully and get them on door type of price. But what they do is they buy not just one or two solutions but they bought the entire suite. So we have, with these insurtechs, usually a broader and more widespread set of solutions and a broader partnership with these insurtechs. And then as they grow, usually a little bit tied to your size and your premiums, we're able to grow with them. So, I think it's been a great nurturing type of relationship. I think they've helped us get better. They're very creative, very innovative. We think we are the same and it's been a wonderful partnership. So our new sales, our growth and our opportunity has really been bolstered by these insurtechs, Andrew."

        "content": "Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Verisk Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call has -- is being recorded. Currently all participants are in a listen-only mode. After today's prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session where we will limit participants to one question and one follow-up. We will have further instructions for you at that time. For our opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk 's Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, you may go ahead.\nStacey Brodbar: Thank you, Julia. And good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our third quarter 2021 financial results. Today's call will be led by Scott Stephenson, Verisk's Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, who will provide an overview of our business. Lee Shavel, Chief Financial Officer and group president, will follow with the financial review. Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer and Group President, will join the team for the Q&A session.  The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about their future performance, including, but not limited to, the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Now, I will turn the call over to Scott.\nScott Stephenson: Thanks, Stacey. Hello, everyone. And thank you for joining us for our Third Quarter 2021 earnings conference call. I'm pleased to share that Verisk delivered a solid third quarter results building on our deep domain expertise, innovative offerings, and strong relationships with our customers. Specifically, Verisk delivered organic constant currency revenue growth of 5.1% and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth of 2.1% for the third quarter.  What I find encouraging is looking at the results on a 2-year basis to adjust for the lumpiness related to the pandemic. And this to Verisk delivered 2-year cumulative organic constant currency revenue growth of 8.7% and organic costs in currency adjusted EBITDA growth of 16.8%, demonstrating strong core operating leverage and a sequential improvement from the second quarter. We will provide more details in his comprehensive financial review. Across insurance, we're seeing strong demand for our products as our customers are striving to become more digital and more automated and are turning to Verisk's solutions to help them.  Engagement with our customers remains at very high levels as we continue our virtual work, and our sales force and customer service teams are doing an excellent job staying connected. In fact, we recently hosted our signature underwriting conference called Verisk Velocity, again, in a virtual format. This year's event was another success with over 600 attendees, participating across 27 different Ematic (ph) sessions. This year's focus was accelerating the digital transformation and developing new ways to increase efficiency and improve underwriting outcomes to better serve their customers.  Strong customer engagement within insurance is translating into strong sales. But growing ACVs, longer contract terms, and very robust sales pipelines. To that end, we have been very successful penetrating the new ensure tech companies as they can take advantage of the full suite of Verisk's Solutions across underwriting and claims. Additionally, with our more traditional P&C customer base, we're also having success leveraging our scale and our comprehensive insurance solution offering. These are two of our competitive advantages. By bundling our solutions together, we're driving increased adoption of these solutions across many different customer segments.  And these bundles are proving to be quite sticky. One area of growth we are particularly excited about is our international expansion within insurance, which is predominantly in the UK today. So we see a long runway as we expand our analytic capabilities within the UK and extend our global footprint into new developed markets. Within our sequel business in the UK, we are building out a truly integrated and digital ecosystem across carriers, syndicates, brokers, and managing general agents, throughout the specialty market. And we are bringing in new customers and expanding our suite of products across existing ones.  Most recently, we made a tuck-in acquisition of Ignite Software Systems, a SaaS platform that includes policy administration, rating engine, and digital engagement for brokers, managing general agents, and insurance. This acquisition expands Sequel capabilities and enables Sequel to add a modular API -driven SaaS platform for the Sequel suite of products. Within our core underwriting, we are using the time-tested playbook that has worked in the U.S. for years, using proprietary data assets to help better price and understand risk, and extending to the UK with our data in Richmond hub.  Data Insight Hub is enabling the digitization of the personal and commercial lines insurance in the UK, deploying a data forward strategy to prefill key data elements and provide predictive analytics that help customers with risk assessment and pricing. Our recent investment in HUG HUB extends these capacities upstream to support the ecosystem at the point-of-sale and distribution. Our international travel business has experienced significant declines due to pandemic related travel restrictions. But we believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of the rebound when across border travel returns.  On the claims front and consistent with our focus on the insurance business and international expansion, we recently announced the acquisition of ActiNeo. A market leader for personal injury claims, digitalization, and medical assessment in Germany. ActiNeo will be integrated into our broader Verisk claims Europe business and should provide a strong platform to grow our footprint across Continental Europe and establish Verisk SB pan-European leader in the personal entry and medical malpractice sectors. We are encouraged by the opportunity to create incremental value by helping deploy ActiNeo technology and services across Europe and leveraging customer relationships. We also plan to introduce other claims solution to these key European markets.  And lastly, we are excited about the growth opportunity within international markets for our extreme event business. In June, we released an on-time update to our Japan Typhoon and earthquake models. These updates reflect the latest science and learnings from recent catastrophes in Japan. Our extreme event business has very strong share in the key Japanese market with both primary insurers and reinsurers as customers. Both of them rely on our models for the quality of the science and the local knowledge that we incorporate through our partnerships with local insurers. Within the energy segment, we're seeing a strong uptake of our new and innovative solutions, including our energy transition and chemicals research, as well as our innovative Lens platform. We are realizing double-digit growth in ACV for contracts that include Lens, as our customers recognize the value of this innovative solution. Importantly, Lens is being adopted by customers across industries, including Upstream oil and gas, financial services, and powered renewable. Moreover, with roughly 10% of our customer base on Lens today, we see a long runway for growth, as we expand its use cases to include additional commodities and geographies over the next few years. You've heard me say before that at Verisk, we are moving ever closer to our customers and that we are on an exciting and successful journeys delivered best-in-class customer experiences. Our collaborations with management leaders, along with a customer first mindset, helped power this journey.  Customer experience is not just the responsibility of our dedicated customer service teams, but it runs throughout the entire organization. In the third quarter, colleagues from every part of Verisk participated in Verisk 's Discover CX Summit. It was a moment in time when we came together to listen, learn, and collaborate on how we can be better partners for our customers. Leaders across every area of the Company assembled to focus on learning CX, Best Practices, and we have emerged with a robust pipeline of ideas that I believe will lead to innovative solutions and outcomes that benefit our customers and Verisk.  On the personnel front, I am pleased to publicly welcome Sunita Holzer, as our new Chief Human Resources Officer and Dianne Greene, as our new Head of Inclusion, Diversity and Belonging. Sunaina brings with her three decades of enterprise level human resources, leadership across several industries, including technology and insurance. Dan brings a business - centric mindset to IDMB from her decade long experience as a business leader and the payroll in HR Solutions Industry. At a time when attracting and retaining diverse talent is top of mind for every business, I'm really excited about partnering with Sunaina and Dan and to develop a comprehensive and differentiated human capital strategy for Verisk and foster our diverse, inclusive, and equitable culture.  Finally, we are committed to enhancing shareholder value, and as part of that commitment, to allocating capital to the highest growth and highest return opportunities. Accordingly, Verisk has been undertaking a bottoms-up review of our businesses and portfolio composition. Our review is ongoing with a focus on the most value created path for sustainable growth and success. And doing what's in the best interest of our shareholders and all of Verisk 's stakeholders. As we've said previously, we believe that portfolio changes are probable in the next 2 to 3 quarters, subject to market conditions. With that, I will turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results.\nLee Shavel: Thanks, Scott. First, I would like to bring everyone's attention that we've posted a quarterly earnings presentation that's available on our website. Moving to the financial results for the quarter. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 8% to $759 million. Net income attributable to Verisk increased 8.6% to $202 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share attributable to Verisk increased 10.7% to $1.24. Moving to our organic constant currency results adjusted for non-operating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, we're very pleased with our operating results led by continued and consistent growth in our subscription revenues. In the third quarter, organic constant currency revenue grew 5.1% driven by continued strength in our insurance segment and modest growth in energy and specialized markets.  This was offset in part by weakness in the financial services segment as we experienced the final quarter of impact from the contract restructurings as well as continued COVID related impacts. Our non-COVID sensitive revenues, as we defined at the beginning of the pandemic increased 5.6% in the third quarter, which was consistent with results reported in the second quarter of 2021, despite tougher year-over-year comparisons. As our non-COVID sensitive revenues included 7.8% in the third quarter of 2020.  The stable growth in our non-COVID sensitive revenues representing approximately 85% of our total revenues, reflects the durability and resilience of our primarily subscription model and the mission-critical nature of our solutions. Our COVID-sensitive revenues, which represent 15% of our consolidated revenues, increased 1.6% as compared to declines of 10% in the third quarter last year. Growth was primarily the result of improvements in consulting in our energy segment and a return to pre -pandemic growth rates in many of our products and services within insurance, particularly within the U.S.  We did experience continued COVID related weakness in our financial services segment as COVID forbearance programs are negatively impacting bankruptcy volumes. To be specific, our COVID-sensitive revenues increased 8% and 12% within the insurance and energy segments respectively, but registered declines of 28% within financial services. It's also important to note that that 28% decline also included the impact of the contract restructuring that we have described previously and which ended in the third quarter. Given that financial services in the segment with the largest percentage of COVID-sensitive transactional revenues, this had a disproportionate impact on the overall result.  Organic cost in currency adjusted EBITDA growth was 2.1% in the third quarter. Organic cost currency adjusted EBITDA growth was impacted by tough comparisons as we took aggressive cost actions in the third quarter of 2020 in response to the pandemic across all our segments. Total adjusted EBITDA margin which includes both organic and inorganic revenue, and adjusted EBITDA was 49.9% in the quarter, down 221 basis points on a year-over-year basis, but still well above our pre -pandemic margin level of 47.4% recorded in the third quarter of 2019. Much of the decline is associated with the normalization of our costs as we anniversary, the COVID benefits from last year including reduced headcount and lower incentive compensation. This level of margin also includes approximately 100 basis points of headwind from our ongoing technological transformation, including our cloud transition costs, which we absorbed into our cost structure.  On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. In the third quarter, insurance segment revenues increased 7.4%, demonstrating strong resilience in recovery. We saw a healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, repair cost estimating Solutions, Claims Analytics Solutions, Catastrophe Modeling, Life Insurance Solutions, and International Insurance Software Solutions. We also experienced solid growth in transactional revenues, including 8% growth in our COVID -impacted revenues as we compared against flattish results last year. We also experienced a modest benefit to growth from storm-related revenue resulting from [Indiscernible] Adjusted EBITDA grew 4.8% in the third quarter while margins declined 200 basis points to 55.9% Reflecting a return to a normalized rate of headcount growth compared to the prior year and higher year-over-year short-term incentive compensation expense.  Nevertheless, this quarter's margin is still 300 basis points above our pre -pandemic levels recorded in 2019, and continues to reflect accelerated investment in our breakout areas like life insurance and telematics, as well as our technology modernization, including our Cloud transition. Energy and specialized markets revenue increased 2.5% in the third quarter due to recovery in our consulting and project-based revenues across energy and power. Strong growth in environmental health and safety solutions and in our breakout solutions, including energy transition in Chemicals. We continue to benefit from strong adoption of our Lens platform as customers are seeing the value of our integrated cloud-based data analytics -- data analytical environment.  And we're very pleased with their contributions to our annualized contract value progression over the course of the last two quarters. Adjusted EBITDA declined 2.6% in the third quarter while margins contracted 300 basis points, reflecting tough comparisons from last year when we enacted headcount reductions, furloughs, and compensation adjustments in reaction to the challenging operating environment in 2020. This was still well above the 33.3% margin we reported in the third quarter of 2019 before the pandemic. We remind you that some of the costs taking in the third quarter were reversed in the fourth quarter of 2020, making for easier comparisons in fourth quarter '21.  Within our Energy segment, we are working to combine the proprietary data assets, skill sets, infrastructure, expertise, and deep capabilities of our Wood Mackenzie, Genscape, and PowerAdvocate businesses. Specifically, we are taking the best-of-breed from each business and combining it with a common data architecture as the backbone. This modern and flexible data architecture will enable more efficient and effective sharing of data, thus, accelerating the innovation process for new solutions in key areas like supply chain, cost management, power and renewables, chemicals, hydrogen, carbon, and metals in mining.  This will also empower stronger cross-sell of solutions across the various customer basis, particularly in the global power in renewable sector, as we help our global customers navigate this broader energy transition. Financial Services, revenue declined 13.5% in the quarter, reflecting the final quarter of impact on the contract transitions that we undertook in 2020, as well as a lower level of Bankruptcy revenue because of government support and forbearance program. Spending Form Analytics demonstrated strong growth as spending in advertising levels continue to improve as the economy emerges from COVID.  Adjusted EBITDA declined 42% in the quarter, reflecting the negative impact of lower sales and a larger impact of corporate expense allocations on the segment's smaller base. Total adjusted EBITDA margins were 19%, still down from the prior year, but an improvement from the first half of 2021 as a result of expense discipline, and lower bad debt expense. Our reported effective tax rate was 20.8% compared to 22.6% in the prior year quarter, in line with our expectations. Looking ahead, we expect our tax rate to approximately 18% to 20% for the fourth quarter of 2021. Adjusted net income increased 7.4% to $234 million and diluted adjusted EPS increased 9% to a $1.44 for the third quarter of 2021.  These increases reflect organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions, a lower tax rate and a lower average share count. Net cash provided by operating activities was $285 million for the quarter up 38% from the prior year period. The prior year periods cash flow was negatively impacted by the timing of certain federal income tax payments and certain employer payroll taxes because of the CARES Act. Year-to-date net cash provided by operating activities was $967 million, reflecting growth of 18% versus the prior-year period.  Capital expenditures were $61.4 million for the quarter down 5% versus last year, reflecting cost savings from third-party, hardware and software as we move to the cloud. We continue to believe that capex for 2021 should be in the range of $250 to $280 million, reflecting our continued investment in our innovation agenda. Our technological transformation, as well as the carryover of certain expenditures that were delayed in 2020 as a result of the pandemic. Related to capex, we expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization should be within the range of $200 to $215 million and intangible amortization to be approximately $175 million.  Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to FX variability, the timing of purchases, and the completion of projects and future M&A activity. During the third quarter, we returned $197 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, as our strong cash flow allows us to invest behind our highest growth and highest return capital initiatives, but also return capital to shareholders consistently. In summary, we are not sitting still at Verisk as demonstrated by our third quarter performance and Scott's earlier comments regarding our portfolio review. Looking ahead, we have confidence in our ability to manage the cost structure, to protect profitability.  We continue to believe that we have tough cost comparisons relative to the COVID impact in quarters last year. We should retain much of the margin expansion we experienced in 2020, delivering margins ahead of our 2019 pre -pandemic level of 47%. Further, we believe that the COVID, impacts continue to abate and global economies further open up, we can return to our long-term growth model of 7% organic constant currency revenue growth with core operating leverage, allowing EBITDA to grow faster than revenue.  We hope this provide some useful context for you and we look forward to addressing your questions. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk, given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I'll ask the Operator to open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] [Operator Instructions]. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik [Barclays].\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning, guys. Just the portfolio review I think this is the first time you've put it in writing in the press release I suppose. So I was just hoping you could give us a little context. Give us a look at all the non-insurance businesses or just any color there would be appreciated.\nScott Stephenson: Our focus is on the high mode -- our focus is on the non P&C parts of our business. That said we're always asking questions about the utility of capital we have invested everywhere. But the depth of our analysis is non-PM. You remember that at the beginning of the year, we ask Lee to take responsibility for those businesses, and his review has been everything from operational, to organizational, to the strategic questions that are in the portfolio review.\nManav Patnaik: Got it, appreciate that. And then just on the international expansion this is something you guys have been trying to go after for a while. Is it still fair to say that the opportunities and more of these in a stuck-in deals that get to build upon, or are there any decent-size assets out there?\nScott Stephenson: Well, we're getting -- where we're always starting from is strategy. So what is it that is logical relative to what we're doing that will be meaningful for our customers? And of course we'll filter that through questions like, the size of assets that we might add. You've seen our record recently. We've been focused on, mostly [Indiscernible] I don't want to constrain with -- kind of artificially constrain. Kind of what size range we might be in, but what were driven by is, the logic of 1 plus 1 becoming 3.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg Peters [Raymond James].\nGreg Peters: Good morning, everyone. I was looking over your exact report. Because the insurance industry is really struggling with inflationary pressures. I guess it's -- there's a frequency issue, but also a severity issue. And I'm curious if you could provide some more color about how your services are helping the industry during this time? I know the auto insurance market is probably in a period of the most distress it's been in in the last 10 or 15 years. And they are having -- they're struggling to get their rate increases approved with regulators, so some color on how your services are helping them would be helpful.\nScott Stephenson: Well, maybe a couple of comments here, and Mark (ph) leads our insurance vertical, so please dive in, Mark (ph). But first of all, I think -- I hope folks are familiar with the range of things that we do on behalf of the insurer. So it's everything from how to select risk to half price risk. And then when loss occurs, how to think about the value of the loss, whether the claims, amount of loss is accurate. So we're really across the entire insurance value chain. And one of the things that helps us to be so relevant for our customers is the speed with which we\nLee Shavel: ingest data signals which tell us what's going on in the market and then translate them into a forward view and provide that to our customers. So one of the things we do is to move as rapidly as the environment is moving. So you reference exact where. So just to pick that 1 in particular. So we have a very dynamic way of assessing the underlying factor costs associated with repairing a structure and the speed with which we update the data helps our customers to stay ahead of where the likely next claim is going to be with respect to cost.  So the depth of the data and the speed of the data both help us to give really reliable signals to our customers. And yes, the insurance Companies are looking to respond to a marketplace that has been moving around a fair amount. But that's really always the case. There are unique conditions associated with the pandemic. But that's just a particular inside of the general case. So it's speed, it's automation, it's depth of data. Those are all the things that allow us to add a lot of value for our customers.\nGreg Peters: Thank you for that answer. I guess my follow-up question again, something I hear a lot of your customers talking about would be just the pressure around recruiting new employees and employee retention. And Lee, I heard your comments about the margin expectations going forward relative to what you did pre -pandemic. But I'm curious if -- I was hoping maybe you could spend a minute and talk to us about what you're doing from an employee retention standpoint, what you're doing from a recruiting standpoint, and how this might -- how rising compensation costs might affect your margins.\nLee Shavel: So we add a lot of people to our organization on a consistent basis. So we have very well-established pathways for recruiting talent into the Company that can be from industry, that can be at the entry level. A lot of our focus is on hiring technical talent, something that we've been doing for years now, actually is to go right to the head end of the data analytics and data science. Educational pipelines and basically to build our own programs where we bring people in.\nScott Stephenson: as it really as their first encounter with industry. And then lead them through a series of development activities and deploy them into the business. We have found doing things like that to actually be more cost constructive than simply going out and hand-to-hand combat with other tech Companies. We do hire people from name-brand technology Companies, but we have found that our own efforts to cultivate our own team have been highly reported. That's not just data science, that is cloud architecture, that is software development, that applies everywhere basically.\nLee Shavel: And we like -- I think most companies have experienced a degree of the needs to be extra alerts to retain talents coming out on the disruptive, or moving through the disruptive moment that we've been in. But actually our experience has been pretty good. On trend relative to where we've been prior to the pandemic, it's not that different for us. So yeah, we're paying attention, yeah, it's important. We have a diverse set of talent sources, and I would mention here that we operate not only in the United States, but also in other economies around the world, including, we have a very large footprint in India, which gives us additional options for staffing our team. One thing I would add to discuss comments, is of course I appreciate you raising that. I think a lot of businesses are struggling on that front from a recruiting retention standpoint. That's one dimension of it. I think we would recognize that there probably are some -- we're anticipating some higher costs as most companies are.  But we're also experiencing some savings as we adapt to this new environment. We have -- are working through our real estate portfolio, finding efficiencies as we are adopting more remote work. I think our belief is that the level of travel expense is going to be the lower than it was previously. And so while we are experiencing some of those pandemic induced -- spend induced inflationary pressures from a recruiting\nScott Stephenson: standpoint but I think all Companies are. We also are generating probably more net benefits from that. And then finally, I would say on the retention standpoint, there are -- one thing that we often have to take into account is, what is the cost of attrition? You have to bring somebody else in, you have to bring them up the curve. Sometimes that creates opportunities. But often we find that you can realize some attractive efficiencies by retaining the talent upfront as opposed to allowing that talent to attrite. All of those are factors as we think about that cost element.\nGreg Peters: Great caller, thanks for your answers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm [UBS].\nAlexander Kramm: Just coming back quickly to the, I guess portfolio review is what you call it. It sounds -- you've been talking about this a little bit more over the last I think 3 quarters now. And now you're putting a timeline out there of 2 to 3 quarters where we should be expecting something when something's probable. But I guess the timeline is a little bit out of context without really knowing what's on the docket. Can you maybe help us a little bit how you think about those 2 to 3 quarters maybe what's on -- what we could expect and how the timelines relate to that. I guess what I'm saying is, are there some little things that you can identify that may be coming very soon or what are the big things that you're considering that maybe take a little bit longer and that's why you're talking about this two to three quarter timeline here? Thank you.\nScott Stephenson: Well, I would just say in the most general sense, Alex, that it's a comprehensive review that we're doing. As I mentioned upfront, our focus is everything which is outside of the P&C segment. I don't think it would be productive to call out specific parts of our portfolio, I just don't think it's constructive inside of the process that we're on here right now. But we are looking deeply and broadly, essentially at everything. And we're certainly aware of where we stand IN the process of consideration, but I just don't think it's constructive to name individual piece parts at this moment.\nAlexander Kramm: I figure that's right. Thank you. And then maybe just shifting gears to the Energy business for a second year. I think in your prepared remark you mentioned, I think, Lens with specific numbers. You also talked about the energy transition as the area of upset again. Maybe -- can you just put some -- more numbers around that in terms of how big that business is today? What the growth rates are you experiencing and where you having the most success, actually selling some of these new products into the marketplace as everybody is clearly thinking about energy transition these days? Thanks.\nScott Stephenson: Yes. Thank you, Alex. Let me try and give you some context. And I think the most important thing -- the most important element that I would draw your attention to, because I think it represents where we are seeing the most significant impact from our investment in Lens. And I want to differentiate it from the fact that, within energy transition and within chemicals, those are businesses that we had invested in 12, 18 months or so ago and have already been generating double-digit growth. They are becoming a more significant component of that.  But what we are experiencing more recently, which isn't reflected in the revenue numbers yet, is the our ability to increase the pricing on for Lens delivered products. The Lens platform has enabled us to demonstrate to clients improved ability to access and interact with the datasets, with the analytics, and as I've described before, we have been able to translate that into double-digit price increases for those products where Lens is now a component of what we do. That is contributing directly to the reference that I made to the increase in our subscription growth of ours are annualized contract values on where we have seen mid-single-digits and more recently, high single-digits increases in the overall level of that.  As -- to those of you that follow other companies with kind of an ACV dynamic that immediately on hits ACV, but it will be realized over time. The other point that I would emphasize that we mentioned is that we currently our only -- approximately 10% penetrated into our customer base. And so as we further penetrate that customer base and add more products onto the Lens platform over time, it has a multiplicative effect on the revenue opportunity.  And so that's where I would specifically draw all your attention in terms of representing the growth opportunity and for me certainly, the return opportunity on the investment that we've made in Lens that encourages further investment and acceleration of many of those products. All of that is supported by the ongoing growth. Certainly anyone I suspect, on this call has seen the level of focus in the energy transition from all of the press around COP 26 is driving nearly incessant demand or our expertise and our perspectives on the energy transition.  And then finally as we pointed out, the consulting element of the business is also experiencing net cyclical uplift of strength in the sector. So, hopefully that gives you some context around what we are experiencing and how we expect that will continue to translate into improved growth performance as we look ahead.\nAlexander Kramm: Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra [Deutsche Bank].\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow up on the margin trend. The margins on this quarter were pretty robust when you look at it on a sequential basis. There was that discussion around compensation cost. But I was just wondering, how should we think about the margins going forward as some of the P&E comes back? And as your unpopular investment. Is that enough that you can bring into cost savings, that can continue to maintain these margin levels? Thanks.\nLee Shavel: Yes. Thanks, Ashish. One of the challenges is that there are a lot of elements that factor into margin and I appreciate you raising the shorter-term on dimension. There we're in the third quarter on some impacts on margin. Part of that which we described on where some accept -- an exceptionally difficult comparison to the third quarter, particularly in energy and specialized markets because of some of the furlough compensation reductions that we took in that period that normalized in this period. And some of that will be -- you will see a corresponding rebound in the fourth quarter when we reverse those based upon the performance of the business. And so that's an element that is more acute in the third quarter.  In addition, we had some higher level of legal expenses in the third quarter across some of our businesses. That again, was an acute short-term effect. There will be -- all of that, again, is to say that in the third quarter, there was probably a higher level of expense than we would normally expect impacting margins, that they were still above where we were pre -pandemic. But going forward, I don't think we expect that same acute impact.  There will be ongoing normalization, potentially on travel, potentially on compensation as things normalize. But I think that we will still be able to hold on to some meaningful portion of that structural benefit that we've had come through in the pandemic. Hopefully, that helps you dissect a little bit of some of the short-term elements that impacted us a little heavily in the third quarter and our expectations ahead.\nAshish Sabadra: That's a great color, Lee. And maybe if I can ask a quick follow-up question. Is -- it would it be possible to quantify the benefit from storm-related revenue? I understand it was very small. And should we see a similar benefit going into the next quarter as well? Thanks.\nLee Shavel: Thank you, Ashish. If it isn't material enough where we feel that it's necessary to call that out. And I think that when it becomes a market impact or a material impact, we do it but we don't think it rises to that level at this point.\nAshish Sabadra: That's very helpful and congrats on good results. Thanks, Lee.\nLee Shavel: Thanks, Ashish.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari [Jefferies].\nMario Cortellacci: Hi, this is Mario Cortellacci, filling in for Hamzah. I know you touched on this in the past and you just mentioned when you get on the call around your ability to help insurers through automating various paths. And whether that be underwriting or in the Claims Process, but maybe you could just talk about how much of an opportunity that may be still, going forward. And, then could you also just touch on your new product growth and your vitality index and how that looks within insurance today?\nMark Anquillare: Thanks for the question. This is Mark. Let me just describe that. I think I've already highlighted that the world of insurance is really focused on 3 things right now; Data analytics, I think we've rode that way for a while. Clearly, the other 2 things are intersecting, but its digital engagement, as well as this push towards automation, which we refer to as this interconnected ecosystem. What insurers are trying to do and you probably experienced if you wanted to go online and get an auto growth. You can get a very quick and efficient auto growth and what [Indiscernible] because of all the information about you is available.  It's all publicly available. You would clearly provide for yes, the privacy. And what we're trying to do is make that experience available to not just personal auto, homeowners, small commercial, and you have the ability to now get a quote very efficiently, very effectively using what I refer to as both data and analytics to make it cheaper, more efficient, and more accurate. And it's all interconnected in a way that the digital experience that small business owner, or you as a homeowner, have the ability to get that quote live.  And that's where the push is. Both on the InsurTech side, as well as the traditional insurers. And I'm proud to say that we were kind of at the forefront of helping people do that. And I think there's a lot of runway there because it's both reducing the cost for insurers as well as creating a better experience for those policy holders. So we'll look forward to that continuing in the coming couple of years. I think the next question was a little bit of the [Indiscernible] [Indiscernible]. I think that we feel like the solutions we have are as robust and as numerous as we've ever had. There's a lot going on at Verisk. I'm excited about it.  That's both on the claim side. I think that's on the underwriting side and I know that we always talk about verticals. I think there's opportunity to take with some of the things that we do today and focus them on insurance, but also see if there's a way to horizontally get into other verticals. And I think that's on a second dimension as well. As an example, a lot of things we do with climate and climate change, corporate needs to know as we think about ESG and resiliency. Those are the types of things that they get us excited, but we're still on the early days. So thanks for the question.\nMario Cortellacci: Absolutely. And then just to -- on a follow-up. Could you talk about how the competitive dynamic within financial services segment has changed, if at all? You had the credit bureaus, you had the fintech and payments all getting more aggressive on M&A and doing more internal investment around datasets. Just wondering if you've seen any real shift there and how is that being considered while you're doing your business review of that segment?\nScott Stephenson: Yes, Mario (ph). Thank you. We do look at that competitive dynamic. And I would start by saying that our financial services business is at the core, a bench-marking service for the large credit card issuing banks. And that's a very unique position where the large banks trust us to provide their data, so that they can understand their performance against others. There is no one that collects as broad or provide s as comprehensive a bench marking service in that context. And so to a degree that is a less competitive space for us.  Where we do see more competition is around some of the consulting aspects of the business, outside of that bench benchmarking. And in some of our businesses, such as in fraud detection, naturally, there are a lot of small companies and businesses that are offering similar detection fraud of Wheaton's types of solutions. And so that becomes a consideration. So yes, overall, we look at the level of competition. We look at some of the other scale players in the industry, what they're doing in the space and evaluate our competitive strengths and merits that factor into our assessment of our ability to both create value and optimize value for those businesses.\nMario Cortellacci: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Kevin McVeigh [Credit Suisse].\nKevin McVeigh: Great, thanks so much and thanks for all information. Could you give us a sense in terms of where you are in the cloud transition? I guess overall across the enterprise and then maybe a little bit of detail in terms of insurance versus financial services versus energy.\nScott Stephenson: Yeah. So there are multiple elements to our migration. So first of all, every new application is being authored in the Cloud at this point. And we author a lot of new applications, So we're 100% with respect to that, which is current and new. With respect to legacy, we're substantially along the way, but implicit in some things that we said earlier. Not completely done. So we are at the point of essentially turning off our operation of the mainframe that we use to make use up. We are close to the moment when we will shut down our power data centers, but not quite there yet.  And a large, by count, the larger fraction of all of our applications have migrated. Our Legacy applications have migrated into the Cloud. So we're still in process. We're making lots of good progress. And as Lee was referencing before, we've already seen the cash flow benefits associated with this transition. And there is more to come, because we will shut down data centers that aren't yet shutdown. And then the corresponding point on all of that is -- because computing in the Cloud is so productive, one of the things that's happening is we're doing more development in the Cloud. So we've got lots of new things that we're doing that will consume cycles in the Cloud in the future, that we just literally didn't used to do. So there's kind of a\nLee Shavel: put and take. Volume grows in this really productive environment. The legacy stuff gets shut off the net effect of it is, it is beneficial to cash flow and does interact with both the capex and OpEx lines.\nKevin McVeigh: Very helpful. And then just wanted to clarify, when you folks talked about the 79% returning to that, Lee, is that as the portfolio is currently constructed or would, I guess, point thing if you were to monetize certain parts of the business, they'd be upside to that number or is that -- show me any type of strategic outcome in that 79%.\nScott Stephenson: I would describe it as our expectations for the business as a whole and doesn't implicitly assume anything in terms of the portfolio restructuring. As we said before, we expect each of our businesses in a normalized environment to be able to achieve 7% organic growth. Obviously, there has been differentiated performance against that but that's the expectation for the business as currently configured.\nKevin McVeigh: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan [Morgan Stanley].\nToni Kaplan: Thanks so much. Wanted to ask another question to clarify the margin expectation for next year. You mentioned that margin should be higher than 47%, but that seems like it doesn't really bake in any of the efficiencies that you talked about. And so maybe I was thinking about it as if you look at this year, you don't have the T&E, and that this year until hopefully that'll normalize next year. So is it fair to think of it as margins in 2022 will essentially be 2021 levels -100 basis points for T&E. And if a 100 basis points isn't right, feel free to correct me on that.\nScott Stephenson: Toni, I appreciate the question. I think it's hard to anticipate what the impact on travel is going to be in 2022, and it will fundamentally be driven by what we think is best from a client interaction of business development dimension for the business. I mean, I think that's inherently unknowable at this stage. If we feel that it's in our best interest, as we have new products and want to be in front of clients to develop those ideas, to be out there then than that will influence our T&E spend. And then obviously the environment, in terms of safety and regulatory aspects, is unknown as well.  So I'm very reluctant to make any forecast of what that is going to be because I think it will depend upon the business circumstances and the environment at the time. I do think that we have been able to realize savings. Some of which are structural and which, we think, we will be able to retain over time in terms of real estate costs. It'd probably be a lower level of travel, but in the short-term of -- looking at year-over-year comparisons, I'm just -- I don't think we're in a position to be able to make an estimate of what T&E, as a percent of total revenue is likely to look -- is going to be.\nToni Kaplan: Yeah. Understood. That is the only real delta though between this year and next year? Is that the main one?\nScott Stephenson: I think the other element, Toni, is our level of headcount growth within this. And here again, you have a tension between the retention element and the retention pressures that we are experiencing our ability to fill those positions. That was clearly an impact in terms of where that influenced our compensation expense in 2021. We would like to be able to certainly recover to where we were and to support the growth of these new initiatives. So that dimension is also difficult to predict.  And is our most significant expense come from -- at about 70% of our overall operating expenses. So that will be just the other area that I think is an uncertain variable. Naturally, we have more control on that but in this regard, we do want to continue to be able to grow headcount to support the development of these businesses, but the environment is making that more challenging from an actual hiring and also from a compensation expense standpoint.\nToni Kaplan: Got it, and then, I Just wanted to ask a follow-up on energy transition. I guess, who are your main competitors that you're facing up against there -- is it IHS market or are you competing in different product areas? And then also separately, is there any cannibalization from energy transition services, from those customers that are buying Upstream, or is it completely additive? Those are just my two questions on that. Thanks.\nLee Shavel: Thank you, Toni. On the first question I think there are a range of other players at one level, I think you have the high-level consultants that are like Mackenzie or Boston Consulting that are doing a lot of work in the energy transition space that is high-end. And we have consulting consultants that also do that work. So there's competition on that -- on that front. There are in kind of thought pieces around what's happening. I think with Bloomberg,\nScott Stephenson: New Energy, they are providing competition. And I think most other large energy data players are certainly looking to take advantage of the demand for analytics and data in the new energy space. We do think that our competitive advantage in that area is one that we have been applying and developing of our specific datasets on the Upstream space, in our PowerAdvocate area in terms of what companies are spending on infrastructure for poor facilities, new-generation capabilities, as well as our familiarity with real-time data that we acquire from our Genscape, which is part of the rationale for why we think that's additive. So we have I think a very valuable dataset, and we have a great brand and reputation in the energy sector. So, there is other competition, but we feel as though we're very competitively differentiated.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Nicolas -- Andrew Nicholas [William Blair], I apologize.\nAndrew Nicholas: Thanks for taking my questions and good morning. The first question I had was for you, Scott. You mentioned in your prepared remarks about some success you've had with the International playbook, at least as it relates to Sequel. And now you've made an acquisition of that Denayo in Germany. So I'm just wondering if you could maybe spend more time on that deal. How it fits into your existing product line up and maybe what the playbook looks like for that asset in particular.\nScott Stephenson: Yes. So ActiNeo participates in the claims process in the Germany market. The claims process is a very central part of what we do on behalf of all insurers. And, one of the things that applies when you are the kind of data analytics companies that we are, is that methodologies can travel across national boundaries, but you still need data at the local level in order to be able to do analysis that is relevant for the local level. And fundamentally that's what ActiNeo provides. So they're in a particular part of the P&C world in Germany where they face auto and then the medical issues that arise from automobile accidents. That's the part of the marketplace they're at. So the growth that it's going to occur relative to ActiNeo will be along a couple of dimensions. One is being potted in Central Europe,\nLee Shavel: we will seek opportunities to push the method out into other national economies. But secondly, we've got a whole set of claims solutions where the methodologies are perfectly applicable to the German market. Now we will have a [Indiscernible] in which to go in behind the relationships with the Germany Companies that come along with ActiNeo. And now present our other solutions basically. And then we'll do what we always do, which is aggregate ideally contributory data which is specific and which is even unique inside these customer relationships. And then just have the cumulative benefit, a deeper connection with customers, more forms of value, because we have more kinds of data. But within general categories like claims, underwriting is another general category.\nAndrew Nicholas: Great. Thank you, that's helpful. And then for my follow-up, I want to switch gears to the bit you talked. I think for some time about the opportunity on the cybersecurity front and the cyber risk front. And it seems at least from our vantage point that there is a growing number of providers targeting that space, that some of which have some positive momentum. So I'm wondering if you could just refresh us on various positioning in that market and maybe where you feel the biggest opportunities are for both organic or even inorganic growth there in terms of helping client underwrite cybersecurity risks, specifically. Thank you.\nScott Stephenson: A couple of comments on Cyber. One is it's an important line, but you have to have that in context as well. It actually is not that big in line when you talk about\nLee Shavel: direct rent written premiums. So you have sort of the emergence of Cyber cover is enabling, is still actually still waiting to happen. But we take a very broad -- our positioning is that we have the broadest set of offerings of all with respect to Cyber stuff, you're asking about us versus other providers because we sort of -- we're sort of soup to nuts in the cyber space. So we model way upfront so that you can have a high-level portfolio view of the amount of cyber risk you might you might be holding as an insurer in your portfolio. We actually can diligence individual companies for the cyber risk that they represent.  And that can be used in the risk selection and underwriting process. And then on the back-end, we've actually got a completely unique activity which is through our PCS unit, where in the same way the ensures tell us after a natural disaster exactly what they're -- progressively with time they tell us what their actual claims experience was denominated. We now have a variety of insurance who are doing that with us in the Cyber now. So, there isn't any other Company that does those 3 things that I just mentioned. So our positioning is tied strongly to Brad, and we're very happy to be in this place and happy with what we're doing against the line that gets a lot of attention but it's not -- there isn't really that much premium in the Cyber line just yet.\nAndrew Nicholas: Thanks, that's helpful.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line Andrew Steinerman [J.P. Morgan]\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi, it's Andrew. 2 questions. First one is as your team probably sells one or more of your industry-specific data and tech businesses, will Verisk likely become an info services provider that\u2019s just more focused in terms of number of end markets, or is it likely that Verisk will expand into a new industry after exiting an end market or end markets. I also have a second question.\nLee Shavel: So it is not inside our pattern of thought, Andrew (ph), to say we need to be an end vertical markets. That -- we don't have that thought at all, actually. And so it simply would not be in our analysis or pattern to say, well, okay. We may have stepped out of this vertical market or that vertical market. Here are some proceeds and less investment in the next -- new vertical market. That is not the way that we think, not at all. So I think that's the primary answer to your question, but I will go back to what Mark said before. One of the really nice opportunities for our Company, is a function of the fact that you get to observe so much of the economy through the mechanism of insurance.  Because almost everything is insured. Maybe it's not as completely insured as it should be, but more or less, every category of asset is insured. So you get to see what's going on economy-wide. And my point here is, that we really like solutions where -- I'll call it the killer app, grows up in the insurance vertical. But then it's extensible to other customer groups. Oh, great. Particularly, it doesn't need to be modified very much in order for it to be relevant to that next customer groups.  So I'm really sending you 2 messages here and I think they are clear and I hope we have them distinct, which is we don't need to platform ourselves in other verticals. We are interested in following from the powerful place of the insurance industry and the killer apps inside of the insurance industry. If they have applicability in other places, that's good business. And we'll pursue that all day but we want it yoked to the power place where we start.\nAndrew Steinerman: That makes a lot of sense. So here's my second question, could you also talk about the typical rebound ahead for Verisk energy organic revenue growth. Just noting that the end market now has some tailwind.\nScott Stephenson: I'm sure Andrew. Thanks for the question. There is certainly a sense of the physiclical trends that we're experiencing on the consulting side that are driving some of the strength in the performance of the revenue growth within that sector. And while that's a positive, it is not as much of a focus for us, as the broader --\nLee Shavel: what I would describe as secular trend to understanding the datasets for the energy transition and our structural ability to tie those datasets together through the Lens platform, which I was describing earlier on in response to Alex 's question. And so that, we believe is the more material secular trend within the business, that as opposed to existing within those discrete upstream, midstream, downstream, chemicals, elements, we're now looking at data across that, and building an architecture that allows us to meet those growing needs. I do think that some of the cyclical short-term uplift is encouraging more adoption of those broader applications that we've described. So there is a bit of a tailwind effect that we're beginning to experience certainly on the subscription side. And then as we realize the revenue from that subscriptions, it should become more apparent in the overall revenue results.\nScott Stephenson: And Lee if I could just add to what you were saying there just very briefly. And maybe this was a little bit implicit in your question, Andrew. Over the course of the last 7 years, there have been 2 remarkable price shocks in the underlying commodity, particularly oil and gas, petroleum. There has been a Brexit and there has been a pandemic. Hopefully, the next pandemic is decades away from now. The UK can only Brexit once. And the first of the 2 price shocks was totally supply led. It was basically Saudi Arabia sort of flexing muscle with Russia.  And I think it's interesting to consider the fact that on a go-forward basis, Saudi Aramco now answers to market forces in a way that it didn't 7 years ago, where it was like the piggy bank for the royal family. So I think the environment is different than it has been over the last 7 years. And we're structurally different in that our exposure to onto that as a result of the development of our data businesses, the growth of other elements has substantially muted the FB impact of that. There would still some impact that we just described, but it is much less acute and it would have been certainly 3 years ago.\nAndrew Steinerman: That's well said. Thank you.\nOperator: At this time, I would like to thank everyone for joining today. This will be our last question. This concludes today's conference.

            "content": "Thanks, Scott. First, I would like to bring everyone's attention that we've posted a quarterly earnings presentation that's available on our website. Moving to the financial results for the quarter. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 8% to $759 million. Net income attributable to Verisk increased 8.6% to $202 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share attributable to Verisk increased 10.7% to $1.24. Moving to our organic constant currency results adjusted for non-operating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, we're very pleased with our operating results led by continued and consistent growth in our subscription revenues. In the third quarter, organic constant currency revenue grew 5.1% driven by continued strength in our insurance segment and modest growth in energy and specialized markets.  This was offset in part by weakness in the financial services segment as we experienced the final quarter of impact from the contract restructurings as well as continued COVID related impacts. Our non-COVID sensitive revenues, as we defined at the beginning of the pandemic increased 5.6% in the third quarter, which was consistent with results reported in the second quarter of 2021, despite tougher year-over-year comparisons. As our non-COVID sensitive revenues included 7.8% in the third quarter of 2020.  The stable growth in our non-COVID sensitive revenues representing approximately 85% of our total revenues, reflects the durability and resilience of our primarily subscription model and the mission-critical nature of our solutions. Our COVID-sensitive revenues, which represent 15% of our consolidated revenues, increased 1.6% as compared to declines of 10% in the third quarter last year. Growth was primarily the result of improvements in consulting in our energy segment and a return to pre -pandemic growth rates in many of our products and services within insurance, particularly within the U.S.  We did experience continued COVID related weakness in our financial services segment as COVID forbearance programs are negatively impacting bankruptcy volumes. To be specific, our COVID-sensitive revenues increased 8% and 12% within the insurance and energy segments respectively, but registered declines of 28% within financial services. It's also important to note that that 28% decline also included the impact of the contract restructuring that we have described previously and which ended in the third quarter. Given that financial services in the segment with the largest percentage of COVID-sensitive transactional revenues, this had a disproportionate impact on the overall result.  Organic cost in currency adjusted EBITDA growth was 2.1% in the third quarter. Organic cost currency adjusted EBITDA growth was impacted by tough comparisons as we took aggressive cost actions in the third quarter of 2020 in response to the pandemic across all our segments. Total adjusted EBITDA margin which includes both organic and inorganic revenue, and adjusted EBITDA was 49.9% in the quarter, down 221 basis points on a year-over-year basis, but still well above our pre -pandemic margin level of 47.4% recorded in the third quarter of 2019. Much of the decline is associated with the normalization of our costs as we anniversary, the COVID benefits from last year including reduced headcount and lower incentive compensation. This level of margin also includes approximately 100 basis points of headwind from our ongoing technological transformation, including our cloud transition costs, which we absorbed into our cost structure.  On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. In the third quarter, insurance segment revenues increased 7.4%, demonstrating strong resilience in recovery. We saw a healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, repair cost estimating Solutions, Claims Analytics Solutions, Catastrophe Modeling, Life Insurance Solutions, and International Insurance Software Solutions. We also experienced solid growth in transactional revenues, including 8% growth in our COVID -impacted revenues as we compared against flattish results last year. We also experienced a modest benefit to growth from storm-related revenue resulting from [Indiscernible] Adjusted EBITDA grew 4.8% in the third quarter while margins declined 200 basis points to 55.9% Reflecting a return to a normalized rate of headcount growth compared to the prior year and higher year-over-year short-term incentive compensation expense.  Nevertheless, this quarter's margin is still 300 basis points above our pre -pandemic levels recorded in 2019, and continues to reflect accelerated investment in our breakout areas like life insurance and telematics, as well as our technology modernization, including our Cloud transition. Energy and specialized markets revenue increased 2.5% in the third quarter due to recovery in our consulting and project-based revenues across energy and power. Strong growth in environmental health and safety solutions and in our breakout solutions, including energy transition in Chemicals. We continue to benefit from strong adoption of our Lens platform as customers are seeing the value of our integrated cloud-based data analytics -- data analytical environment.  And we're very pleased with their contributions to our annualized contract value progression over the course of the last two quarters. Adjusted EBITDA declined 2.6% in the third quarter while margins contracted 300 basis points, reflecting tough comparisons from last year when we enacted headcount reductions, furloughs, and compensation adjustments in reaction to the challenging operating environment in 2020. This was still well above the 33.3% margin we reported in the third quarter of 2019 before the pandemic. We remind you that some of the costs taking in the third quarter were reversed in the fourth quarter of 2020, making for easier comparisons in fourth quarter '21.  Within our Energy segment, we are working to combine the proprietary data assets, skill sets, infrastructure, expertise, and deep capabilities of our Wood Mackenzie, Genscape, and PowerAdvocate businesses. Specifically, we are taking the best-of-breed from each business and combining it with a common data architecture as the backbone. This modern and flexible data architecture will enable more efficient and effective sharing of data, thus, accelerating the innovation process for new solutions in key areas like supply chain, cost management, power and renewables, chemicals, hydrogen, carbon, and metals in mining.  This will also empower stronger cross-sell of solutions across the various customer basis, particularly in the global power in renewable sector, as we help our global customers navigate this broader energy transition. Financial Services, revenue declined 13.5% in the quarter, reflecting the final quarter of impact on the contract transitions that we undertook in 2020, as well as a lower level of Bankruptcy revenue because of government support and forbearance program. Spending Form Analytics demonstrated strong growth as spending in advertising levels continue to improve as the economy emerges from COVID.  Adjusted EBITDA declined 42% in the quarter, reflecting the negative impact of lower sales and a larger impact of corporate expense allocations on the segment's smaller base. Total adjusted EBITDA margins were 19%, still down from the prior year, but an improvement from the first half of 2021 as a result of expense discipline, and lower bad debt expense. Our reported effective tax rate was 20.8% compared to 22.6% in the prior year quarter, in line with our expectations. Looking ahead, we expect our tax rate to approximately 18% to 20% for the fourth quarter of 2021. Adjusted net income increased 7.4% to $234 million and diluted adjusted EPS increased 9% to a $1.44 for the third quarter of 2021.  These increases reflect organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions, a lower tax rate and a lower average share count. Net cash provided by operating activities was $285 million for the quarter up 38% from the prior year period. The prior year periods cash flow was negatively impacted by the timing of certain federal income tax payments and certain employer payroll taxes because of the CARES Act. Year-to-date net cash provided by operating activities was $967 million, reflecting growth of 18% versus the prior-year period.  Capital expenditures were $61.4 million for the quarter down 5% versus last year, reflecting cost savings from third-party, hardware and software as we move to the cloud. We continue to believe that capex for 2021 should be in the range of $250 to $280 million, reflecting our continued investment in our innovation agenda. Our technological transformation, as well as the carryover of certain expenditures that were delayed in 2020 as a result of the pandemic. Related to capex, we expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization should be within the range of $200 to $215 million and intangible amortization to be approximately $175 million.  Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to FX variability, the timing of purchases, and the completion of projects and future M&A activity. During the third quarter, we returned $197 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, as our strong cash flow allows us to invest behind our highest growth and highest return capital initiatives, but also return capital to shareholders consistently. In summary, we are not sitting still at Verisk as demonstrated by our third quarter performance and Scott's earlier comments regarding our portfolio review. Looking ahead, we have confidence in our ability to manage the cost structure, to protect profitability.  We continue to believe that we have tough cost comparisons relative to the COVID impact in quarters last year. We should retain much of the margin expansion we experienced in 2020, delivering margins ahead of our 2019 pre -pandemic level of 47%. Further, we believe that the COVID, impacts continue to abate and global economies further open up, we can return to our long-term growth model of 7% organic constant currency revenue growth with core operating leverage, allowing EBITDA to grow faster than revenue.  We hope this provide some useful context for you and we look forward to addressing your questions. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk, given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I'll ask the Operator to open the line for questions. ingest data signals which tell us what's going on in the market and then translate them into a forward view and provide that to our customers. So one of the things we do is to move as rapidly as the environment is moving. So you reference exact where. So just to pick that 1 in particular. So we have a very dynamic way of assessing the underlying factor costs associated with repairing a structure and the speed with which we update the data helps our customers to stay ahead of where the likely next claim is going to be with respect to cost.  So the depth of the data and the speed of the data both help us to give really reliable signals to our customers. And yes, the insurance Companies are looking to respond to a marketplace that has been moving around a fair amount. But that's really always the case. There are unique conditions associated with the pandemic. But that's just a particular inside of the general case. So it's speed, it's automation, it's depth of data. Those are all the things that allow us to add a lot of value for our customers. So we add a lot of people to our organization on a consistent basis. So we have very well-established pathways for recruiting talent into the Company that can be from industry, that can be at the entry level. A lot of our focus is on hiring technical talent, something that we've been doing for years now, actually is to go right to the head end of the data analytics and data science. Educational pipelines and basically to build our own programs where we bring people in. And we like -- I think most companies have experienced a degree of the needs to be extra alerts to retain talents coming out on the disruptive, or moving through the disruptive moment that we've been in. But actually our experience has been pretty good. On trend relative to where we've been prior to the pandemic, it's not that different for us. So yeah, we're paying attention, yeah, it's important. We have a diverse set of talent sources, and I would mention here that we operate not only in the United States, but also in other economies around the world, including, we have a very large footprint in India, which gives us additional options for staffing our team. One thing I would add to discuss comments, is of course I appreciate you raising that. I think a lot of businesses are struggling on that front from a recruiting retention standpoint. That's one dimension of it. I think we would recognize that there probably are some -- we're anticipating some higher costs as most companies are.  But we're also experiencing some savings as we adapt to this new environment. We have -- are working through our real estate portfolio, finding efficiencies as we are adopting more remote work. I think our belief is that the level of travel expense is going to be the lower than it was previously. And so while we are experiencing some of those pandemic induced -- spend induced inflationary pressures from a recruiting Yes. Thanks, Ashish. One of the challenges is that there are a lot of elements that factor into margin and I appreciate you raising the shorter-term on dimension. There we're in the third quarter on some impacts on margin. Part of that which we described on where some accept -- an exceptionally difficult comparison to the third quarter, particularly in energy and specialized markets because of some of the furlough compensation reductions that we took in that period that normalized in this period. And some of that will be -- you will see a corresponding rebound in the fourth quarter when we reverse those based upon the performance of the business. And so that's an element that is more acute in the third quarter.  In addition, we had some higher level of legal expenses in the third quarter across some of our businesses. That again, was an acute short-term effect. There will be -- all of that, again, is to say that in the third quarter, there was probably a higher level of expense than we would normally expect impacting margins, that they were still above where we were pre -pandemic. But going forward, I don't think we expect that same acute impact.  There will be ongoing normalization, potentially on travel, potentially on compensation as things normalize. But I think that we will still be able to hold on to some meaningful portion of that structural benefit that we've had come through in the pandemic. Hopefully, that helps you dissect a little bit of some of the short-term elements that impacted us a little heavily in the third quarter and our expectations ahead. Thank you, Ashish. If it isn't material enough where we feel that it's necessary to call that out. And I think that when it becomes a market impact or a material impact, we do it but we don't think it rises to that level at this point. Thanks, Ashish. put and take. Volume grows in this really productive environment. The legacy stuff gets shut off the net effect of it is, it is beneficial to cash flow and does interact with both the capex and OpEx lines. Thank you, Toni. On the first question I think there are a range of other players at one level, I think you have the high-level consultants that are like Mackenzie or Boston Consulting that are doing a lot of work in the energy transition space that is high-end. And we have consulting consultants that also do that work. So there's competition on that -- on that front. There are in kind of thought pieces around what's happening. I think with Bloomberg, we will seek opportunities to push the method out into other national economies. But secondly, we've got a whole set of claims solutions where the methodologies are perfectly applicable to the German market. Now we will have a [Indiscernible] in which to go in behind the relationships with the Germany Companies that come along with ActiNeo. And now present our other solutions basically. And then we'll do what we always do, which is aggregate ideally contributory data which is specific and which is even unique inside these customer relationships. And then just have the cumulative benefit, a deeper connection with customers, more forms of value, because we have more kinds of data. But within general categories like claims, underwriting is another general category. direct rent written premiums. So you have sort of the emergence of Cyber cover is enabling, is still actually still waiting to happen. But we take a very broad -- our positioning is that we have the broadest set of offerings of all with respect to Cyber stuff, you're asking about us versus other providers because we sort of -- we're sort of soup to nuts in the cyber space. So we model way upfront so that you can have a high-level portfolio view of the amount of cyber risk you might you might be holding as an insurer in your portfolio. We actually can diligence individual companies for the cyber risk that they represent.  And that can be used in the risk selection and underwriting process. And then on the back-end, we've actually got a completely unique activity which is through our PCS unit, where in the same way the ensures tell us after a natural disaster exactly what they're -- progressively with time they tell us what their actual claims experience was denominated. We now have a variety of insurance who are doing that with us in the Cyber now. So, there isn't any other Company that does those 3 things that I just mentioned. So our positioning is tied strongly to Brad, and we're very happy to be in this place and happy with what we're doing against the line that gets a lot of attention but it's not -- there isn't really that much premium in the Cyber line just yet. So it is not inside our pattern of thought, Andrew (ph), to say we need to be an end vertical markets. That -- we don't have that thought at all, actually. And so it simply would not be in our analysis or pattern to say, well, okay. We may have stepped out of this vertical market or that vertical market. Here are some proceeds and less investment in the next -- new vertical market. That is not the way that we think, not at all. So I think that's the primary answer to your question, but I will go back to what Mark said before. One of the really nice opportunities for our Company, is a function of the fact that you get to observe so much of the economy through the mechanism of insurance.  Because almost everything is insured. Maybe it's not as completely insured as it should be, but more or less, every category of asset is insured. So you get to see what's going on economy-wide. And my point here is, that we really like solutions where -- I'll call it the killer app, grows up in the insurance vertical. But then it's extensible to other customer groups. Oh, great. Particularly, it doesn't need to be modified very much in order for it to be relevant to that next customer groups.  So I'm really sending you 2 messages here and I think they are clear and I hope we have them distinct, which is we don't need to platform ourselves in other verticals. We are interested in following from the powerful place of the insurance industry and the killer apps inside of the insurance industry. If they have applicability in other places, that's good business. And we'll pursue that all day but we want it yoked to the power place where we start. what I would describe as secular trend to understanding the datasets for the energy transition and our structural ability to tie those datasets together through the Lens platform, which I was describing earlier on in response to Alex 's question. And so that, we believe is the more material secular trend within the business, that as opposed to existing within those discrete upstream, midstream, downstream, chemicals, elements, we're now looking at data across that, and building an architecture that allows us to meet those growing needs. I do think that some of the cyclical short-term uplift is encouraging more adoption of those broader applications that we've described. So there is a bit of a tailwind effect that we're beginning to experience certainly on the subscription side. And then as we realize the revenue from that subscriptions, it should become more apparent in the overall revenue results. Thank you."

            "name": "Scott Stephenson",
            "content": "Thanks, Stacey. Hello, everyone. And thank you for joining us for our Third Quarter 2021 earnings conference call. I'm pleased to share that Verisk delivered a solid third quarter results building on our deep domain expertise, innovative offerings, and strong relationships with our customers. Specifically, Verisk delivered organic constant currency revenue growth of 5.1% and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth of 2.1% for the third quarter.  What I find encouraging is looking at the results on a 2-year basis to adjust for the lumpiness related to the pandemic. And this to Verisk delivered 2-year cumulative organic constant currency revenue growth of 8.7% and organic costs in currency adjusted EBITDA growth of 16.8%, demonstrating strong core operating leverage and a sequential improvement from the second quarter. We will provide more details in his comprehensive financial review. Across insurance, we're seeing strong demand for our products as our customers are striving to become more digital and more automated and are turning to Verisk's solutions to help them.  Engagement with our customers remains at very high levels as we continue our virtual work, and our sales force and customer service teams are doing an excellent job staying connected. In fact, we recently hosted our signature underwriting conference called Verisk Velocity, again, in a virtual format. This year's event was another success with over 600 attendees, participating across 27 different Ematic (ph) sessions. This year's focus was accelerating the digital transformation and developing new ways to increase efficiency and improve underwriting outcomes to better serve their customers.  Strong customer engagement within insurance is translating into strong sales. But growing ACVs, longer contract terms, and very robust sales pipelines. To that end, we have been very successful penetrating the new ensure tech companies as they can take advantage of the full suite of Verisk's Solutions across underwriting and claims. Additionally, with our more traditional P&C customer base, we're also having success leveraging our scale and our comprehensive insurance solution offering. These are two of our competitive advantages. By bundling our solutions together, we're driving increased adoption of these solutions across many different customer segments.  And these bundles are proving to be quite sticky. One area of growth we are particularly excited about is our international expansion within insurance, which is predominantly in the UK today. So we see a long runway as we expand our analytic capabilities within the UK and extend our global footprint into new developed markets. Within our sequel business in the UK, we are building out a truly integrated and digital ecosystem across carriers, syndicates, brokers, and managing general agents, throughout the specialty market. And we are bringing in new customers and expanding our suite of products across existing ones.  Most recently, we made a tuck-in acquisition of Ignite Software Systems, a SaaS platform that includes policy administration, rating engine, and digital engagement for brokers, managing general agents, and insurance. This acquisition expands Sequel capabilities and enables Sequel to add a modular API -driven SaaS platform for the Sequel suite of products. Within our core underwriting, we are using the time-tested playbook that has worked in the U.S. for years, using proprietary data assets to help better price and understand risk, and extending to the UK with our data in Richmond hub.  Data Insight Hub is enabling the digitization of the personal and commercial lines insurance in the UK, deploying a data forward strategy to prefill key data elements and provide predictive analytics that help customers with risk assessment and pricing. Our recent investment in HUG HUB extends these capacities upstream to support the ecosystem at the point-of-sale and distribution. Our international travel business has experienced significant declines due to pandemic related travel restrictions. But we believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of the rebound when across border travel returns.  On the claims front and consistent with our focus on the insurance business and international expansion, we recently announced the acquisition of ActiNeo. A market leader for personal injury claims, digitalization, and medical assessment in Germany. ActiNeo will be integrated into our broader Verisk claims Europe business and should provide a strong platform to grow our footprint across Continental Europe and establish Verisk SB pan-European leader in the personal entry and medical malpractice sectors. We are encouraged by the opportunity to create incremental value by helping deploy ActiNeo technology and services across Europe and leveraging customer relationships. We also plan to introduce other claims solution to these key European markets.  And lastly, we are excited about the growth opportunity within international markets for our extreme event business. In June, we released an on-time update to our Japan Typhoon and earthquake models. These updates reflect the latest science and learnings from recent catastrophes in Japan. Our extreme event business has very strong share in the key Japanese market with both primary insurers and reinsurers as customers. Both of them rely on our models for the quality of the science and the local knowledge that we incorporate through our partnerships with local insurers. Within the energy segment, we're seeing a strong uptake of our new and innovative solutions, including our energy transition and chemicals research, as well as our innovative Lens platform. We are realizing double-digit growth in ACV for contracts that include Lens, as our customers recognize the value of this innovative solution. Importantly, Lens is being adopted by customers across industries, including Upstream oil and gas, financial services, and powered renewable. Moreover, with roughly 10% of our customer base on Lens today, we see a long runway for growth, as we expand its use cases to include additional commodities and geographies over the next few years. You've heard me say before that at Verisk, we are moving ever closer to our customers and that we are on an exciting and successful journeys delivered best-in-class customer experiences. Our collaborations with management leaders, along with a customer first mindset, helped power this journey.  Customer experience is not just the responsibility of our dedicated customer service teams, but it runs throughout the entire organization. In the third quarter, colleagues from every part of Verisk participated in Verisk 's Discover CX Summit. It was a moment in time when we came together to listen, learn, and collaborate on how we can be better partners for our customers. Leaders across every area of the Company assembled to focus on learning CX, Best Practices, and we have emerged with a robust pipeline of ideas that I believe will lead to innovative solutions and outcomes that benefit our customers and Verisk.  On the personnel front, I am pleased to publicly welcome Sunita Holzer, as our new Chief Human Resources Officer and Dianne Greene, as our new Head of Inclusion, Diversity and Belonging. Sunaina brings with her three decades of enterprise level human resources, leadership across several industries, including technology and insurance. Dan brings a business - centric mindset to IDMB from her decade long experience as a business leader and the payroll in HR Solutions Industry. At a time when attracting and retaining diverse talent is top of mind for every business, I'm really excited about partnering with Sunaina and Dan and to develop a comprehensive and differentiated human capital strategy for Verisk and foster our diverse, inclusive, and equitable culture.  Finally, we are committed to enhancing shareholder value, and as part of that commitment, to allocating capital to the highest growth and highest return opportunities. Accordingly, Verisk has been undertaking a bottoms-up review of our businesses and portfolio composition. Our review is ongoing with a focus on the most value created path for sustainable growth and success. And doing what's in the best interest of our shareholders and all of Verisk 's stakeholders. As we've said previously, we believe that portfolio changes are probable in the next 2 to 3 quarters, subject to market conditions. With that, I will turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results. Our focus is on the high mode -- our focus is on the non P&C parts of our business. That said we're always asking questions about the utility of capital we have invested everywhere. But the depth of our analysis is non-PM. You remember that at the beginning of the year, we ask Lee to take responsibility for those businesses, and his review has been everything from operational, to organizational, to the strategic questions that are in the portfolio review. Well, we're getting -- where we're always starting from is strategy. So what is it that is logical relative to what we're doing that will be meaningful for our customers? And of course we'll filter that through questions like, the size of assets that we might add. You've seen our record recently. We've been focused on, mostly [Indiscernible] I don't want to constrain with -- kind of artificially constrain. Kind of what size range we might be in, but what were driven by is, the logic of 1 plus 1 becoming 3. Well, maybe a couple of comments here, and Mark (ph) leads our insurance vertical, so please dive in, Mark (ph). But first of all, I think -- I hope folks are familiar with the range of things that we do on behalf of the insurer. So it's everything from how to select risk to half price risk. And then when loss occurs, how to think about the value of the loss, whether the claims, amount of loss is accurate. So we're really across the entire insurance value chain. And one of the things that helps us to be so relevant for our customers is the speed with which we as it really as their first encounter with industry. And then lead them through a series of development activities and deploy them into the business. We have found doing things like that to actually be more cost constructive than simply going out and hand-to-hand combat with other tech Companies. We do hire people from name-brand technology Companies, but we have found that our own efforts to cultivate our own team have been highly reported. That's not just data science, that is cloud architecture, that is software development, that applies everywhere basically. standpoint but I think all Companies are. We also are generating probably more net benefits from that. And then finally, I would say on the retention standpoint, there are -- one thing that we often have to take into account is, what is the cost of attrition? You have to bring somebody else in, you have to bring them up the curve. Sometimes that creates opportunities. But often we find that you can realize some attractive efficiencies by retaining the talent upfront as opposed to allowing that talent to attrite. All of those are factors as we think about that cost element. Well, I would just say in the most general sense, Alex, that it's a comprehensive review that we're doing. As I mentioned upfront, our focus is everything which is outside of the P&C segment. I don't think it would be productive to call out specific parts of our portfolio, I just don't think it's constructive inside of the process that we're on here right now. But we are looking deeply and broadly, essentially at everything. And we're certainly aware of where we stand IN the process of consideration, but I just don't think it's constructive to name individual piece parts at this moment. Yes. Thank you, Alex. Let me try and give you some context. And I think the most important thing -- the most important element that I would draw your attention to, because I think it represents where we are seeing the most significant impact from our investment in Lens. And I want to differentiate it from the fact that, within energy transition and within chemicals, those are businesses that we had invested in 12, 18 months or so ago and have already been generating double-digit growth. They are becoming a more significant component of that.  But what we are experiencing more recently, which isn't reflected in the revenue numbers yet, is the our ability to increase the pricing on for Lens delivered products. The Lens platform has enabled us to demonstrate to clients improved ability to access and interact with the datasets, with the analytics, and as I've described before, we have been able to translate that into double-digit price increases for those products where Lens is now a component of what we do. That is contributing directly to the reference that I made to the increase in our subscription growth of ours are annualized contract values on where we have seen mid-single-digits and more recently, high single-digits increases in the overall level of that.  As -- to those of you that follow other companies with kind of an ACV dynamic that immediately on hits ACV, but it will be realized over time. The other point that I would emphasize that we mentioned is that we currently our only -- approximately 10% penetrated into our customer base. And so as we further penetrate that customer base and add more products onto the Lens platform over time, it has a multiplicative effect on the revenue opportunity.  And so that's where I would specifically draw all your attention in terms of representing the growth opportunity and for me certainly, the return opportunity on the investment that we've made in Lens that encourages further investment and acceleration of many of those products. All of that is supported by the ongoing growth. Certainly anyone I suspect, on this call has seen the level of focus in the energy transition from all of the press around COP 26 is driving nearly incessant demand or our expertise and our perspectives on the energy transition.  And then finally as we pointed out, the consulting element of the business is also experiencing net cyclical uplift of strength in the sector. So, hopefully that gives you some context around what we are experiencing and how we expect that will continue to translate into improved growth performance as we look ahead. Yes, Mario (ph). Thank you. We do look at that competitive dynamic. And I would start by saying that our financial services business is at the core, a bench-marking service for the large credit card issuing banks. And that's a very unique position where the large banks trust us to provide their data, so that they can understand their performance against others. There is no one that collects as broad or provide s as comprehensive a bench marking service in that context. And so to a degree that is a less competitive space for us.  Where we do see more competition is around some of the consulting aspects of the business, outside of that bench benchmarking. And in some of our businesses, such as in fraud detection, naturally, there are a lot of small companies and businesses that are offering similar detection fraud of Wheaton's types of solutions. And so that becomes a consideration. So yes, overall, we look at the level of competition. We look at some of the other scale players in the industry, what they're doing in the space and evaluate our competitive strengths and merits that factor into our assessment of our ability to both create value and optimize value for those businesses. Yeah. So there are multiple elements to our migration. So first of all, every new application is being authored in the Cloud at this point. And we author a lot of new applications, So we're 100% with respect to that, which is current and new. With respect to legacy, we're substantially along the way, but implicit in some things that we said earlier. Not completely done. So we are at the point of essentially turning off our operation of the mainframe that we use to make use up. We are close to the moment when we will shut down our power data centers, but not quite there yet.  And a large, by count, the larger fraction of all of our applications have migrated. Our Legacy applications have migrated into the Cloud. So we're still in process. We're making lots of good progress. And as Lee was referencing before, we've already seen the cash flow benefits associated with this transition. And there is more to come, because we will shut down data centers that aren't yet shutdown. And then the corresponding point on all of that is -- because computing in the Cloud is so productive, one of the things that's happening is we're doing more development in the Cloud. So we've got lots of new things that we're doing that will consume cycles in the Cloud in the future, that we just literally didn't used to do. So there's kind of a I would describe it as our expectations for the business as a whole and doesn't implicitly assume anything in terms of the portfolio restructuring. As we said before, we expect each of our businesses in a normalized environment to be able to achieve 7% organic growth. Obviously, there has been differentiated performance against that but that's the expectation for the business as currently configured. Toni, I appreciate the question. I think it's hard to anticipate what the impact on travel is going to be in 2022, and it will fundamentally be driven by what we think is best from a client interaction of business development dimension for the business. I mean, I think that's inherently unknowable at this stage. If we feel that it's in our best interest, as we have new products and want to be in front of clients to develop those ideas, to be out there then than that will influence our T&E spend. And then obviously the environment, in terms of safety and regulatory aspects, is unknown as well.  So I'm very reluctant to make any forecast of what that is going to be because I think it will depend upon the business circumstances and the environment at the time. I do think that we have been able to realize savings. Some of which are structural and which, we think, we will be able to retain over time in terms of real estate costs. It'd probably be a lower level of travel, but in the short-term of -- looking at year-over-year comparisons, I'm just -- I don't think we're in a position to be able to make an estimate of what T&E, as a percent of total revenue is likely to look -- is going to be. I think the other element, Toni, is our level of headcount growth within this. And here again, you have a tension between the retention element and the retention pressures that we are experiencing our ability to fill those positions. That was clearly an impact in terms of where that influenced our compensation expense in 2021. We would like to be able to certainly recover to where we were and to support the growth of these new initiatives. So that dimension is also difficult to predict.  And is our most significant expense come from -- at about 70% of our overall operating expenses. So that will be just the other area that I think is an uncertain variable. Naturally, we have more control on that but in this regard, we do want to continue to be able to grow headcount to support the development of these businesses, but the environment is making that more challenging from an actual hiring and also from a compensation expense standpoint. New Energy, they are providing competition. And I think most other large energy data players are certainly looking to take advantage of the demand for analytics and data in the new energy space. We do think that our competitive advantage in that area is one that we have been applying and developing of our specific datasets on the Upstream space, in our PowerAdvocate area in terms of what companies are spending on infrastructure for poor facilities, new-generation capabilities, as well as our familiarity with real-time data that we acquire from our Genscape, which is part of the rationale for why we think that's additive. So we have I think a very valuable dataset, and we have a great brand and reputation in the energy sector. So, there is other competition, but we feel as though we're very competitively differentiated. Yes. So ActiNeo participates in the claims process in the Germany market. The claims process is a very central part of what we do on behalf of all insurers. And, one of the things that applies when you are the kind of data analytics companies that we are, is that methodologies can travel across national boundaries, but you still need data at the local level in order to be able to do analysis that is relevant for the local level. And fundamentally that's what ActiNeo provides. So they're in a particular part of the P&C world in Germany where they face auto and then the medical issues that arise from automobile accidents. That's the part of the marketplace they're at. So the growth that it's going to occur relative to ActiNeo will be along a couple of dimensions. One is being potted in Central Europe, A couple of comments on Cyber. One is it's an important line, but you have to have that in context as well. It actually is not that big in line when you talk about I'm sure Andrew. Thanks for the question. There is certainly a sense of the physiclical trends that we're experiencing on the consulting side that are driving some of the strength in the performance of the revenue growth within that sector. And while that's a positive, it is not as much of a focus for us, as the broader -- And Lee if I could just add to what you were saying there just very briefly. And maybe this was a little bit implicit in your question, Andrew. Over the course of the last 7 years, there have been 2 remarkable price shocks in the underlying commodity, particularly oil and gas, petroleum. There has been a Brexit and there has been a pandemic. Hopefully, the next pandemic is decades away from now. The UK can only Brexit once. And the first of the 2 price shocks was totally supply led. It was basically Saudi Arabia sort of flexing muscle with Russia.  And I think it's interesting to consider the fact that on a go-forward basis, Saudi Aramco now answers to market forces in a way that it didn't 7 years ago, where it was like the piggy bank for the royal family. So I think the environment is different than it has been over the last 7 years. And we're structurally different in that our exposure to onto that as a result of the development of our data businesses, the growth of other elements has substantially muted the FB impact of that. There would still some impact that we just described, but it is much less acute and it would have been certainly 3 years ago. Thanks everybody for joining."

            "content": "Thanks for the question. This is Mark. Let me just describe that. I think I've already highlighted that the world of insurance is really focused on 3 things right now; Data analytics, I think we've rode that way for a while. Clearly, the other 2 things are intersecting, but its digital engagement, as well as this push towards automation, which we refer to as this interconnected ecosystem. What insurers are trying to do and you probably experienced if you wanted to go online and get an auto growth. You can get a very quick and efficient auto growth and what [Indiscernible] because of all the information about you is available.  It's all publicly available. You would clearly provide for yes, the privacy. And what we're trying to do is make that experience available to not just personal auto, homeowners, small commercial, and you have the ability to now get a quote very efficiently, very effectively using what I refer to as both data and analytics to make it cheaper, more efficient, and more accurate. And it's all interconnected in a way that the digital experience that small business owner, or you as a homeowner, have the ability to get that quote live.  And that's where the push is. Both on the InsurTech side, as well as the traditional insurers. And I'm proud to say that we were kind of at the forefront of helping people do that. And I think there's a lot of runway there because it's both reducing the cost for insurers as well as creating a better experience for those policy holders. So we'll look forward to that continuing in the coming couple of years. I think the next question was a little bit of the [Indiscernible] [Indiscernible]. I think that we feel like the solutions we have are as robust and as numerous as we've ever had. There's a lot going on at Verisk. I'm excited about it.  That's both on the claim side. I think that's on the underwriting side and I know that we always talk about verticals. I think there's opportunity to take with some of the things that we do today and focus them on insurance, but also see if there's a way to horizontally get into other verticals. And I think that's on a second dimension as well. As an example, a lot of things we do with climate and climate change, corporate needs to know as we think about ESG and resiliency. Those are the types of things that they get us excited, but we're still on the early days. So thanks for the question."

For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investors Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.\nStacey Brodbar: Thank you, Jay, and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our second quarter 2021 financial results. Today's call will be led by Scott Stephenson, Verisk's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, who will provide an overview of our business. Lee Shavel, Chief Financial Officer and Group President, will follow with the financial review. Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer and Group President, will join the team for the Q&A session.  The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. Earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in.  Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about their future performance, including, but not limited to, the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Now I will turn the call over to Scott.\nScott Stephenson: Thanks, Stacey, and good day, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. I'm pleased to share that Verisk delivered a strong second quarter result. The strength of our business model has been on full display since the start of the pandemic and continues in the recovery. We delivered solid top line and profit growth in every quarter last year despite the weak economic environment and operating challenges from lockdowns because of the consistent and durable growth in our subscription-based businesses. As expected, we are now fully participating in the recovery as our transactional businesses are showing strong resilience and rebounding with the rollout of vaccines and global economies opening up. To be more specific in the second quarter, Verisk delivered organic constant currency revenue growth of 6.3%, comprised of growth of 5.5% and are mostly subscription-based non-COVID-sensitive revenues, and growth of 12.1% in our mostly transactional COVID-sensitive revenues. In fact, certain of our transactional businesses have already returned to pre-COVID levels. We have confidence this general trend can continue and believe that as the COVID impacts fully abate, we can return to delivering financial results in line with our long-term model. Lee will provide more details in his financial review. These results were delivered through the hard work, dedication and consistent focus on our customers by our 9,000 employees around the globe. In many parts of the world, we've already begun welcoming our employees back to our offices, with a plan guided by our mission of protecting the health and well-being of our team members and in line with directives from local governments and public health officials. While our Global Protection Services team is keeping a close eye on developments with the delta variant, our teams are energized to work together in person again. In fact, Currently, more than half of our global offices are operating in a Phase 2 or 3 format. Across the U.S., we have plans to return to full use of our offices in September, unless circumstances change considerably. We have implemented a return to office policy of 3 days in the office, 4 with customers and 2 days for hub. This approach, which incorporates the best learnings from the pandemic, balances individual flexibility with the collaboration and creativity that stems from working together in person. We also believe that this flexible working policy will help to retain and attract the very best talent as we continue to grow in what is a very competitive hiring environment. Not only are we returning to office, we are also beginning to have certain in-person meetings with our customers, including on-site training and sales opportunities. Given how effectively we've worked in a fully remote format, we have confidence that this return to office policy is the optimal design. Our computing and network capacity have consistently and comfortably exceeded what we require, and our teams have adjusted to using all the virtual collaboration tools we have implemented enterprise-wide. On the topic of technology. We continue to make great strides on our efforts to modernize and optimize our technology platforms to always be best in class. As of today, we have effectively and seamlessly moved most of our applications off the mainframe. This has been a huge undertaking and is a great example of true collaboration and partnership between our IT teams and business units around the globe. In total, we currently have thousands of solutions running native in the cloud, including those that were moved from prior on-premise environments and those built native to the cloud. We are advancing our cloud-first strategy and currently have more than half of our compute environment running in the cloud. The migration to the cloud is a multifaceted multistage project, and we are pacing this transition in lockstep with our customers to ensure that we are always delivering on their highest expectations. In addition, as we advance on this journey, the process is ever improving, and we are seeing real benefits in terms of pace of innovation, resiliency, security and compliance. Our ability to introduce new products and release updates to existing products in a quick and efficient manner is vastly improved because of our shift to the cloud. We are also able to onboard new customers and enter new geographies faster and with reduced capital intensity. For example, we've successfully deployed our new cloud-based visualized ISO ClaimSearch platform to our P&C insurance customers. This modernized version of our industry-leading ClaimSearch platform provides a more engaging user experience for thousands of claim adjusters and investigators, and allows us to offer new features, functionality and solutions quickly and easily to customers through this platform. In addition, our new insurance digital media contributory database will take advantage of the flexibility and efficiencies of cloud technology to process, store and analyze claim-related digital images from more than 160 insurers. Initially, we expect to receive over 8 million digital media files per week as this new offering ramps up to help insurers better detect potential fraud and increase settlement fee for meritorious claims. The cloud is also advancing our sales process as we can offer customers an easy and cost-beneficial way to pilot or trial new solutions that was previously much more cumbersome in Verisk's prior on-premise format. This allows customers to truly see in action the value of our solutions. Our sales team can then focus on converting those customers to long-term subscriptions. The cloud has also made our solutions more resilient with less downtime as the duration of maintenance windows are greatly reduced. We no longer must take our cloud-native solutions off-line to do things like update or release new features or protect them with the latest security patches and protocols. We have also constructed a cloud security program that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to continuously monitor our entire environment, making us more secure and able to audit our entire process for full accountability. And finally, the cloud makes it easier to keep applications and data that are running in local geographies to adhere to the increasing nuances of regulatory and compliance requirements that are geographically specific. As our business expands globally, this becomes an increasing benefit of cloud. From a capital perspective, our cloud migration has reduced our ongoing need to spend on third-party hardware and software. We are reallocating those savings towards internal innovation and spending more on growth CapEx. We are leaning into our highest growth, highest return on invested capital organic opportunities across insurance and energy.  Within Insurance, we have seen great success with the development of the LightSpeed platform. This organically developed data-forward platform has automated and improved the underwriting process for our customers, and is driving strong top line growth within our ISO business as we have extended it across personal and commercial lines. Specific to Commercial Lines, we've seen continued success in small commercial for business owners and commercial auto. With LightSpeed, we have augmented our AI and machine learning capabilities, introducing image analytics that will help present a holistic view of risk at the point of quote and ensure that small business owners get the coverage they need. We've also expanded our entity resolution and benchmarking data and analytics to help our diverse client base scale and increase their speed to market. We are also accelerating our customers' journey towards 0 application questions, helping drive speed and efficiency. With over 80 traditional and InsurTech customers, leveraging LightSpeed commercial, we are enabling the industry to free up underwriting talent to focus on more complex risks and helping our customers become the carrier or managing general agent of choice in this fast-moving and profitable space. Within energy, our internally developed cloud-based Lens platform is transforming the way customers interact with the Mackenzie data as we are integrating our complex data sets seamlessly into their workflows. We have greatly reduced our research cycle times from days to hours, allowing us to commercialize solutions more quickly and update data in existing solutions more frequently. This empowers our customers with the data necessary to make timely and well-informed decisions about commodity markets around the globe. We are seeing strong value-based price realization and revenue growth, resulting in solid returns on capital for this platform. The capital management discipline is also evidenced in our acquisition strategy. While interest and valuations for data analytic assets are high, we've been very selective and focused our attention only on assets where we can create incremental value by combining data sets for new solutions, leveraging our infrastructure or improving sales and distribution, through our strong customer relationships and industry scale. Our recent acquisition of FAST is a great example of how we are leveraging our relationships across the industry to accelerate the adoption of FAST software, driving strong returns on invested capital. On the engagement front, even in a mostly virtual mode, we continue to get ever closer to our customers. This engagement starts with the C-suite and runs through all levels of the organization. This is evidenced by increasing frequency of meetings, better attendance at our virtual events and increasing interest from customers to work with us as development partners. In fact, we recently announced 2 key development partners for our Lens Power solution, namely Vestas and Quinbrook. It has also translated into building sales pipelines and more sales opportunities. And we're having great success converting these sales opportunities into new contracts as we benefit from our ability to bundle our broad offerings to meet our customers' unique needs. This is particularly evident with our fastest-growing customer segment in InsurTech. On the innovation front, we recently launched the Cyber Risk Navigator, our cyber risk modeling application. This release represented a year-long effort to redevelop the platform from an on-premise solution to cloud-native SaaS solution. Given the scalability of the cloud, clients are now able to run analyses in minutes that used to take hours. It also provides us the ability to bring new features and model updates to the market quickly, rather than being tied to annual software releases, which is essential for a rapidly changing risk such as cyber.  We also made great strides in advancing our offerings in the telematics space with the introduction of the DrivingDNA Score. This enhanced solution is powered by the unique data from Verisk Data Exchange, that includes 260 billion miles and growing of robust driving behavior data from 8 million connected car drivers. The DrivingDNA Score enables our customers to enter and expand to the rapidly growing usage-based insurance market and is another key addition to our whole suite of telematics solutions. Finally, I'm excited to share about the progress Verisk has made on our environmental stewardship commitments. We recently completed our 2020 greenhouse gas emissions inventory. And I'm pleased to report that, for the fourth straight year, we balanced 100% of Verisk's reported Scope 1, 2 and 3, including business air travel emissions, through a combination of purposeful reduction initiatives and investments in renewable energy certificates and carbon offsets. We remain focused on implementing meaningful physical and operational changes that will reduce our greenhouse gas emissions over the long term. Those include the consolidation of multiple Verisk offices in Boston and London into new energy-efficient business centers as well as the continuing strategic realignment of our data management activities, to take advantage of the major efficiencies presented by cloud computing. Building on the progress we've already achieved to date, I'm also pleased to share that Verisk has committed to an absolute 21% reduction in our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2024 compared with the 2019 baseline. In developing the targets, Verisk collaborated with Ecometrica, an accomplished leader in the field of sustainability metrics, software and services. The resulting targets incorporate the latest science-based targets guidance, aligned with the 1.5-degree celsius global future. I look forward to updating you on our progress as we remain committed to addressing the very real impacts of climate change today and for the benefit of future generations. I have great confidence that our focus on innovation and serving our customers will help us deliver on our long-term growth objectives, creating lasting shareholder value. As our business recovers from the short-term impacts of the pandemic, we continue to actively study the signs of resilience across the different parts of our company. Our dynamic capital process is designed to ensure that our capital is deployed into the highest-growth and highest-return opportunities. With that, let me turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results.\nLee Shavel: Thank you, Scott. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. Moving to the financial results for the quarter. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 10.1% to $748 million. Net income attributable to Verisk decreased 14% to $154 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share attributable to Verisk declined 13% to $0.94 per share. These declines are the result of a noncash revaluation charge related to the U.K. tax law change. Adjusting for the impact of the $0.21 per share noncash revaluation charge, diluted adjusted EPS increased 7% to $1.38. Moving to our organic constant currency results. Adjusted for nonoperating items, as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, we were very pleased with our operating results, led by consistent growth in our subscription revenues and recovery in our transactional revenues as our business rebounds from the COVID-related declines from last year. In the second quarter, organic constant currency revenue grew 6.3%, led by continued strength in our Insurance segment and sequential improvement in our Energy and Financial Services segment. Our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, as we defined at the beginning of the pandemic, increased 5.5% in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to the growth of 6.5% in the prior year quarter. This stable growth in our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, representing approximately 85% of our total revenues, reflects the durability and resilience of our primarily subscription model. Our COVID-sensitive revenues, which represent 15% of our consolidated revenues, continued on a sequential improvement trend and returned to growth this quarter, increasing 12.1%. This compares to declines of 20% in the second quarter last year and the prior quarter performance of declines of 5.9%. Growth was primarily the result of improvements in consulting in our Energy segment and a return to pre-pandemic growth rates in many of our products and services within Insurance, particularly within the U.S. We did experience continued COVID-related weakness in our Financial Services segment as government forbearance programs are negatively impacting bankruptcy volumes. Organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth was 4.2% in the second quarter, led by solid growth in Insurance and Energy, offset in part by weakness in Financial Services. Total adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter, which includes both organic and inorganic revenue and adjusted EBITDA, was 49.6% in the quarter, down 172 basis points on a year-over-year basis, but still above our pre-pandemic margin level of 46.6% recorded in the second quarter of 2019. Much of the decline is associated with the normalization of our costs as we anniversary the COVID benefits from last year, including reduced head count growth and lower incentive compensation. This margin also reflects an increase in the pace of investment in our technological transformation, including our cloud transition costs and the impact of acquisitions. On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. In the second quarter, Insurance segment revenues increased 7.8%, demonstrating strong resilience and recovery. We saw healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, catastrophe modeling solutions, repair cost estimating solutions and international insurance software solutions. We also experienced strong growth in transactional revenues, associated with an increased level of securitization revenues in our catastrophe modeling business, a modest benefit from storm-related revenue and double-digit recovery growth in our COVID-impacted revenues as we compare against declines last year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 6.6% in the second quarter while margins declined 148 basis points, reflecting a return to a normalized rate of head count growth compared to the prior year and higher year-over-year short-term incentive compensation expense. We also continue to invest in our breakout areas as well as our technology modernization, including our cloud transition. Energy and Specialized Markets revenue increased 5% in the second quarter due to a recovery in our consulting and project-based revenues across Energy and Power, strong growth in environmental health and safety solutions and our energy transition research. Included in the quarter was revenue associated with the strategic consulting project that added approximately 1 point to segment growth. We continue to benefit from strong adoption of our Lens platform as customers are seeing the value of our integrated cloud-based data analytic environment. We remain a key part of our customers' most strategic conversations as they deal with the ever-changing energy landscape and our broad base of solutions across all commodities are mission-critical to our customers as they navigate through this dynamic environment.  Adjusted EBITDA grew 8.4% in the second quarter, while margins expanded 74 basis points, reflecting continued cost discipline and leverage from sales growth. As we look to the remainder of 2021, we want to remind you that we have a very tough margin comparison in the third quarter, associated with some head count reductions, furloughs and compensation adjustments that we made in reaction to the tough operating environment in 2020. However, some of these costs were reversed in the fourth quarter of 2020. All that said, we have a solid track record of managing through volatile times effectively and believe we are well-positioned with our energy transition solutions as well as our Lens platform to continue to outperform the end market and help our customers navigate this broad energy transition.  Financial Services revenue declined 8.1% in the quarter, reflecting the continued impact of contract transitions that we undertook in 2020 and will continue through the third quarter of 2021 as well as a lower level of bankruptcy revenue because of government support and forbearance program.  Spend informed analytics demonstrated stronger growth than expected as spending and advertising improved, which enabled us to reduce some of the negative impact on revenue growth from the contract transitions that we originally anticipated. Adjusted EBITDA declined 77% in the quarter, reflecting the negative impact of lower sales and a larger impact of corporate expense allocations on the segment's smaller base. We continue to believe that the actions we have taken with E&S over the last few years are setting the business on a stronger foundation from which to grow going forward. Our reported effective tax rate was 35.6% compared to 20.4% in the prior year quarter. This higher tax rate is the result of an earlier-than-anticipated enactment of a U.K. tax law change that caused a noncash revaluation charge. This is simply a timing difference from our original expectations as the impact occurred in the second quarter instead of the third quarter as we had originally forecast. There is no change to full year results. Given the earlier timing of the tax law change and the fact that this charge was onetime in nature, we now expect our tax rate to approximate 20% to 22% for the second half of 2021.  Adjusted net income was $191 million, and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.17 for the second quarter 2021, adjusting for the impact of a $0.21 per share noncash revaluation charge related to the U.K. Tax Law change described earlier, diluted adjusted EPS increased 7% to $1.38. These increases reflect organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions and a lower average share count. Net cash provided by operating activities was $233 million for the quarter, down 6.5% from the prior year period. The prior year period cash flow benefited from a deferral in both federal income tax payments and certain employer payroll taxes as a result of the CARES Act, partly offset by earn-out payments.  Year-to-date, net cash provided by operating activities was $682 million, reflecting growth of 11.4% versus the prior year period. Capital expenditures were $62.5 million for the quarter, up 10.2%. We continue to believe that CapEx will be in the range of $250 million to $280 million, reflecting our continued investment in our innovation agenda, our technological transformation as well as the carryover of certain expenditures that were delayed in 2020 as a result of the pandemic. Related to CapEx, we expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization will be within the range of $200 million to $215 million and intangible amortization to be approximately $180 million, reflecting the impact of recent acquisitions and changes in foreign currency rates. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to FX variability, the timing of purchases and the completion of projects and future M&A activity. During the second quarter, we returned $197 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends as our strong cash flow allows us to invest behind our highest-return growth initiatives, but also return capital to shareholders consistently. Our strategy to deliver long-term and sustainable growth remains unchanged. We are encouraged by the recovery we are experiencing in our COVID-impacted businesses, and we believe the stability and predictability of our subscription revenues will persist. We also have confidence in our ability to manage the cost structure effectively to protect profitability. While we do have tough cost comparisons this year, we believe that we should retain some of the margin expansion we experienced in 2020, delivering margins ahead of our 2019 level of 47%. Taking this all together, we believe that as the COVID impacts abate and the global economies continue to open up, we can return to our long-term growth model of 7% organic constant currency revenue growth, with core operating leverage allowing EBITDA to grow faster than revenue, although it is difficult to determine that -- to predict that timing. We hope this provides some useful context for you, and we look forward to addressing your questions. We continue to appreciate all of the support and interest in Verisk. [Operator Instructions]. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Greg Peters of Raymond James.\nCharles Peters: I'm going to let the other analysts focus on the financials. I'd like to pivot to the Insurance business beyond specifically, for the property casualty industry, we're seeing 2 variables, first of all, the -- come out of the lockdown. And then secondly, favorable pricing. And your organic was quite strong in insurance. The insurance industry is forecasting a moderation of growth for them for the balance of the year and into next year. Can you give us an expectation of how those variables are affecting your business?\nScott Stephenson: Yes. Scott here. Thanks for the question. Two things. One is, if you were to look at the pricing algorithms that apply into solutions that we provide to the insurance industry, the way that we price our solutions is related to the value of the solutions that we're getting to our customers. So it's not the case that in our -- to the pricing algorithm is a term, which is significant, and that relates to the amount of premium that our customers are putting through their own books of business. Our solutions are priced according to the amount of profitability and growth that they generate for our customers. And every CEO that I speak to in the insurance industry, every one of them to a person considers their business -- to grow the business. And so they are leaning into new methods as a way of trying to grow their businesses. And we expect that to persist. And it's always been the case actually that in our Insurance business, we have grown considerably faster than the underlying product marketplace. And actually, that's true to the energy vertical as well. And why? Because our customers are trying to make increasing use of data analytics solutions. So we're not really yoked to the net written premium volumes in the insurance industry.\nCharles Peters: Got it. My follow-up question, again sticking with operations, and you talked about your claim analytics and products and the suite of products you're offering there. Insurance industry is really beginning to struggle with inflation costs, repair costs on cars. Rental car rates have gone through the roof. And I'm just curious, from an operational perspective, the products -- your service providing to the industry, how are they adapting rapidly to these changing conditions in the marketplace to help the insurance industry?\nScott Stephenson: Yes, that is something that our customers care about a great deal. And so it's really incumbent upon us to make sure that the cost factors associated with the kinds of solutions we've got, which are aimed at understanding what it takes to repair something, we need to make sure that the underlying cost factors are current. And that is something that we give a lot of attention to. That has always been a part of the way that we approach this. But it's particularly important in a moment like this where demand, demand surge and, therefore, the price of the underlying commodities moves around.  You have highlighted something that our customers care quite a bit about. Actually, I'm going to turn to Mark here, who leads our insurance vertical. Not long ago, we were on a call with the CEO of one of the largest insurance companies in North America and this was one of the topics they highlighted. And we had a lot of conversation about what we're doing and the way that our solutions do keep up. So I'm really just affirming that the topic that you've highlighted there is on the minds of our customers. Mark, anything you want to add to that?\nMark Anquillare: No, I think our customers expect us to be on top of that. So as an example, it's -- the repair cost estimate solutions, we're making constant updates on a weekly basis. We're providing them what's the cost of lumber, as an example, which has been a very significant inflationary item. And their repair cost estimates are reflected that -- are reflecting that increase. We are very much into the world of social inflation, right? The cost of litigation and the cost of claims is up as a result of that. So that -- those trends are reflected in our loss costs. That's the pricing they do. It's reflected in the repair cost estimates. It's reflected in how they underwrite a property or any insurance risk, and I'd like to think that we are at the lead in thinking for them on that topic.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee of Bank of America.\nGary Bisbee: Scott, thanks for the updates on innovation and technology. And I wanted to ask a little bit about that. You talked about how the tech modernization progress you're making is accelerating the ability to innovate and reducing CapEx, which you're trading that off for higher capital spending on innovation and new products. I guess a 2-parter. As we think about innovation broadly across the company, do you keep internally -- or can you help us think about like the concept of a vitality index? How much more is all of this change you're doing contributing to growth from innovation? And then secondly, do you see that benefit more as something that should allow you continue to deliver to the long-term 7% revenue growth target that you have? Or is there potential as that innovation accelerates that you could begin to outperform that target more meaningfully as innovation and new products become a larger part of your revenue?\nScott Stephenson: Thanks, Gary. Well, maybe to your second question first. We do feel very good about the shape of our business, where we sit in the flow of what is happening in the business world. One of the most important things happening in the economy is businesses becoming the better, more analytic digital version of themselves. And that is fundamentally what is in and around and underneath our business and that we enjoy these tremendous relationships with our customers founded upon trust and some really, really valuable and distinctive solutions. That's our business. And the environment in which we're doing our work, obviously, the pandemic has had an effect as it did on everybody. But over longer periods of time, there are these very constructive trends. And so that's kind of fundamentally our growth story. Against that, our customers look to us to be their fill in the blank tech partner. There are -- in every one of the verticals we serve, there's a fill in the blank tech, InsurTech, fintech, energy tech. There's a list of players like that as long as both of your arms. Our customers expect us to be providing innovation. That is one of the reasons why they lean into the relationship with us in the first place. So I think the nature of your question, Gary, was like this investment into that solution and what is the effect of that in terms of our growth. We pay attention to that. It would probably surprise you to know the relatively modest size of investment opportunities that all the way to the office of the CEO we're looking at because it's the lifeblood of our business. And so we do -- we are resolving things down to the level of the individual solution, and we pay attention to how they're doing. And we make decisions about should we put more in because it looks very promising, should we pull back from it because it appears not to be gaining steam. We're doing that all the time. That is what we do on a moment-to-moment basis. But when you talk about vitality, you really -- you have to take it holistically. Because as we said earlier in this call, by count of corporate entity, in the insurance industry, the most rapidly growing segment are the InsurTechs, the new players. And I take such comfort in the fact that they show up with a clean sheet of paper. And they're rethinking everything. How are we going to build an insurance business? And they seem so consistently to want to standardize on all of our solutions. That's vitality. Now they're adopting solutions that we -- in some cases, that we created years ago. But they're buying into them because they remain right at the leading edge. I mean, they're very insistent that everything be cloud-native, tech-forward. They just -- they're not even going to look at you if you're not that way. So I would just encourage you to understand vitality means a lot of things. It means the infusion of value into a solution that has been around for a long period of time as well as the new solution. It's new customers as well as existing customers. But there's no question, if you pop all the way to the top of the organization and ask the question, look at that top line rate of organic revenue growth. One of the most powerful things that drives our growth is the adoption of solutions, whether it's a new solution by an existing customer or an existing but enhanced solution by a new customer. And the investing that we do in innovation is in support of all that. Mark, do you want to add something?\nMark Anquillare: Yes, just maybe to provide a good example of everything Scott described. I think one of the big success stories is really inside of what is our underwriting and rating ISO business. We continue to have a very big business focused on what we refer as loss cost rules and forms. And we have been growing kind of an inflationary way because we've been very thoughtful with our customers. The growth that we've seen, that has increased over the last several years is because of that innovation investment and kind of bundling things for these InsurTechs and others. So I just wanted to reaffirm and maybe provide tangible evidence to that.\nGary Bisbee: And then just a quick follow-up for Lee. Margins, you did a nice job keeping the majority of the pandemic benefit from the prior year in this year's quarter. What caused, I guess, travel's one probably that hasn't come back. But what other cause may not have fully normalized and sort of -- is this a good rule of thumb going forward? Or would you expect that more of the costs that came out last year likely will come back in, in the next quarter?\nMark Anquillare: Yes. Thank you, Gary. I try to look at the cost structure and evaluate what's temporal and what's structural. And there is some temporal element of this that we've been able to hold on to. But I think to your point on the travel and entertainment side, I think there are structural savings that we are -- we'll be able to take advantage of over time. And so I think some of that, there is a structural change.  I also think over the longer term, as we adopt or adapt to the flexible work structure that Scott described in his comments that it will provide opportunities for us from a productivity, from a real estate cost standpoint to reduce some of those expenses over time. But of course, that follows kind of the lease renewal process. But those will be things that we're able to achieve over time as well. And then finally, the other element is compensation, and that is more directly tied to our overall performance against the growth targets and overall head count growth. And I think that will -- that's the element that is likely and we'll certainly hope is going to normalize consistent with the achievement of our revenue growth and our EBITDA growth.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari of Jefferies.\nHamzah Mazari: I just wanted to go back to the question on your long-term sort of 7%-plus organic growth sort of aspiration. It was very consistent prior to 2015. And I realize, post-2015, you had mix issues, cyclicality, the business mix changed in the portfolio. But going forward, is it just the world reopens and you can get back to 7%-plus? Or you need to see some of these benefits from the big investment spend that's been going on? And that really lags. Just give us a sense of -- is it just the macro? Or is it execution or any other thing we should be paying attention to, to get back to 7%-plus consistently?\nScott Stephenson: Well, as I said before, the nature of our business is that because we're providing a unique kind of value to our customers, very consistently, our experience has been that we grow at a rate greater than the rate of growth in the verticals that we're serving. And I don't see any change in that. When you describe it that way, kind of stable normal environments are, all else equal, supportive. And you would have to expect over long periods of time, if you look at the marketplaces that we serve, they're very important elements of the economy. So a thesis, which is -- they will remain important is a pretty sound one. And then actually, the demography of the customer set inside of these verticals, they don't really change all that rapidly. Of course, we're always paying attention to that, but they don't tend to -- so you've got that as the background. But there is no question that there is a huge dependence upon execution. The whole innovation agenda has to be done well. We have to dig in with our customers as development partners to make sure that we hit what's needed, that we get it to market faster. All of those things have a lot to do with returns on any given innovation investment that we've made. So that's very important. And another thing, which -- I don't know, I suppose if you watch us really carefully over a long period of time, this would be evident, but I just want to highlight that there is a great deal of dynamic inside of what we're doing in terms of looking at the solution families and the solution sets that we've got and deciding where are they and where are they headed.  And we have a very long track record. I'll just -- I'll pick the insurance vertical since it's the largest one for us. Investing more inside of things that are showing a lot of promise, but retiring in some cases, selling off solution sets that we have as well. And so it can all look -- it's kind of like the duck on top of the lake. It looks very steady, but underneath, there's various paddling going on. And we get down to the level of individual solutions. Again, just using insurance as an example, through the years, we've retired a number of things that we were doing. We invented a whole lot of things. All of that is inside of getting to this long-term view of growth potential.\nLee Shavel: If I can just kind of supplement on that to provide some validation, I think you referenced a couple of elements here. But if you look at the underlying insurance business, it gets consistently delivered on that 7% organic growth area, where there have been negative impacts from that is it has either been because of some of the nearer-term cyclical elements associated with the energy business. But that business, as we have seen and demonstrated, particularly with the Lens platform, the investment in the energy transition practice, has demonstrated their potential to move to similar levels of growth. And Financial Services has been undergoing a transition to a more focus on sustainable growth, reducing some of that volatility. So I want to make certain that you appreciate that underneath the space is a consistent track record of delivering on that potential, with some of the other elements as we move down this path of investing in the platform in order to -- for us to deliver the value of those rapidly growing data sets, improved platforms against the business. That's been the recipe that is delivered and supports our conviction of the achievability of that going forward.\nHamzah Mazari: That's extremely helpful, really appreciate that. And then just my follow-up question is around capital allocation. Your leverage is arguably going to get very low next year. Your CapEx at some point is going to go down and so free cash flow should inflect a lot. Should we be thinking about buybacks being a much bigger piece of return on sort of your cash deployment? Or should we be thinking outsized growth in the dividend? You haven't done much large-scale M&A. So I'm assuming you can do M&A and return cash. Just any thoughts as to when you see that big free cash flow inflection at some point, what do you do with the cash?\nLee Shavel: So Hamzah, thanks for the question, and we appreciate you identifying the strength in the cash flow. I think the important thing to emphasize here is that we believe that one of the strongest elements that we have, the strongest opportunities that we have to create value is investing internally within the business, as Scott has described, in the technology, in the data sets, in new services for our clients. And so we want to make certain that we are taking every advantage to where we think we can generate incremental growth, where we can generate high incremental returns on capital from that. So we start from the position of how much capital do we have available that we're generating from the business. What are our opportunities first to invest in the business, in a way that takes advantage of those opportunities to generate growth and returns? Secondly, are there opportunities that we see in the M&A market to invest in businesses that we can create value by meaningfully improving their revenue growth through our distribution, utilizing their data sets more effectively or improving their technology? And FAST, as we've described, this has been a great example of that. Genscape in our energy business has been additive, has generated attractive returns on capital for us. So that's the second use. And then the decision on share repurchases is really an outcome of what capital do we have that we don't have an opportunity, we don't see an opportunity to invest, to contribute to growth or returns on capital. So it is an outcome of our capital allocation process, not something that we target at the outset. So kind of taking your question, if we don't see those opportunities, if the M&A market doesn't present opportunities for us given where valuations are or the nature of the business to create value, then we would expect that excess capital to be returned either through the dividend or through increased share repurchases, but it will all be driven by that investment opportunity and our discipline.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey of Truist Securities.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Mark, maybe a question for you on LightSpeed. It sounds like it's one of the more exciting revenue growth drivers within your insurance businesses, especially as you expand beyond auto. Can you maybe dimensionalize for us the kind of pricing power you might have in that business and how important that is to the durability of that 7% segment organic revenue growth target?\nMark Anquillare: Yes. So let me try to maybe provide some parameters. The way we're going about this is we really believe that insurer, in their search for the best experience to the customer, the digital engagement, they want information that's actionable and they can kind of have a bindable quote, meaning when you go online and you want to get a price, you don't want it to change. And basically, 33% to 40% of the cases, that price changes, if you say I'm interested. And they do all this underwriting and pull the information. we're bringing all that information forward and the combination of data we have and analytics so that the insurer has confidence to quote. And that's a big change. So that is noteworthy and important. And what we've tried to do in kind of thinking about the opportunity here, we know who's providing that information. And we feel it's about $1 billion that's going to be type of market opportunity in the insurance space. So we simply have a lot of runway, especially on the personal line side. We have a strong base on the commercial line side at the so that's kind of an extension, which hopefully provides you with a little bit of context of why we think it's important and also why we've continued to emphasize that .\nAndrew Jeffrey: Yes, that's really helpful. I think being able to quantify some of these TAMs will really help investors gain confidence in the long-term growth targets. And then a quick follow-up on cat modeling. It seemed like that was a decent tailwind this quarter. Is that something we need to think about in terms of volatility? How much of an impact does that have on your business from an issuance perspective on a quarterly basis?\nMark Anquillare: So the majority of our catastrophe modeling is around a touchdown subscription model that we've taken a lot of customers and we've had a lot of wins. So the growth you've seen, the underlying foundational growth, is us winning customers and bringing them on to the platform.  Where you're seeing a little bit of a spike and valley is inside of what is the ILS market. Those are the cat bonds we referred to. And that is a little bit a function of timing of the market. We had a good couple -- we had a good quarter. We probably would expect a strong for end of year. It's a little bit tough to tell whether that's going to grow in 2022. At the same time, I would say to you that the market in general is getting more and more collateralized those type of risks. So if you were to ask me what the growth perspective is for cat bonds over the next 5 years, I would say it's going to be up. It's going to be bigger, and we're well-positioned for it, whether it's going to be up or down in one particular quarter, that is a tough estimate for you. And I hope you can appreciate the difficulty we have in forecasting quarter-by-quarter, but I think we have feel for year-over-year.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh of Credit Suisse.\nKevin McVeigh: I wonder if you could just give us a little bit more context on the Duck Creek announcement earlier this quarter where they talked about the enhanced integration within your insured workflows and what that can mean to the business longer term in terms of similar template. Should we expect similar opportunities?\nMark Anquillare: Let me continue. Thank you for the question, another good opportunity. I think I've highlighted in past sessions here, one of the things we're seeing more and more frequently is our customers are looking forward to this interconnected ecosystem. They want the ability to use their internal solutions, their solutions or other third-party solutions in a connected way, whether that's through APIs or micro services. And we're spending a lot of time and money making that happen. So what we're seeing and what we're hearing and what it does is it really helps us because there are a lot of customers out there on those big insurance software solutions like Duck Creek. Guidewire would be another one. And we have integrated with those solutions in such a way that those customers get access information from Verisk and analytics from Verisk or claim solutions from Verisk, in a way that makes it easier for us to operate, more efficient for them to operate. And what it also does is it gives us an opportunity for easier to sell because the integration is built in and it's connected. So we find it to be very customer-focused, and it also gives us some runway in accelerated pipeline for sales.\nKevin McVeigh: Mark, just a follow-up. Does the cloud conversion enable you to do more of those, whereas maybe a year ago when it was more on-prem, you wouldn't have the functionality to do it? Or is it just coincidence in terms of the timing?\nMark Anquillare: So let me say it this way. I think what we have done over the last 20 years is we've had SaaS-based environments. So these are not locally installed solutions. So the SaaS-based business model facilitates this. Your question now is a good one. I think we can do it quicker and more efficiently when we want to integrate using the cloud and as we've kind of transitioned to cloud. So it's not been an enabler, but it has become more efficient in cost-effective.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler of Baird.\nJeffrey Meuler: I appreciate all of the updates in terms of your current thinking on the cloud transition. I was hoping you could give us a similar update on the associated expense park. I think we said that there's a headwind from increased cloud transition costs this year. So just would love any thoughts on how much are you spending per year. When does it flip positive? And when it flips positive, is it a step function change? Or should it just be viewed in the context of expanding organic EBITDA faster than organic revenue over time because there is a reallocation of those savings?\nLee Shavel: Yes. Thank you, Jeff, for the question. There are several elements to it. And I know that you're asking it was in the context of cost, which I'll address. But I also want to make sure that there's an appreciation that there is a CapEx element to this. And then there is also the productivity element to this transition. First, on the cost. You are taking on an additional cloud capacity from the provider before you are eliminating some of that legacy. So you have kind of a redundant, redundant period. In addition, you were taking on recoding expense for the applications as you migrate them into that new environment. And so as we have been implementing this process across hundreds of applications in our various businesses, you have that upfront cost that is a negative cost impact, which we view as an investment. And we look at it on individual project-by-project basis. Our technology team does a great job tracking the specific costs and the savings, but think of this as rolling across the organization.  And for the first year and second year, we are still in a net investment mode from a cost perspective within the business. CapEx will be more limited going forward, so you will be extracting CapEx savings over time because the CapEx intensity of our technology footprint is declining, but that's something that's achieved over time. And we're beginning to experience that in this second year of the project, but that will continue naturally into the third year and beyond. And so if we think about OpEx and CapEx, we're still in a net investment mode in the second year. We would expect that in the third year that turns into a positive contribution. Now the other thing to factor in is that, as Scott described on the CapEx front, that is -- it will enable us -- and this is also true on the OpEx front, to shift some of that OpEx into other investment areas. So when I've talked about margin in the past, I've described there is natural operating margin expansion on a pre-investment level, but then we consume a portion of that from an investment perspective, and that's where we generate incremental growth and returns. So we do believe that this will be additive going into the third year, and then we'll determine do we see investment opportunities to pursue that. Beyond and riding on top of all of that is, I think, the more material benefit of this, which is the pace of innovation, the ability to associate more data sets to populate platforms that are creating a broader lift, I think, within the business and is sensed by, I think, a number of the questions in terms of its impact on our overall growth. So I wanted to give you kind of a comprehensive sense of the way that we are thinking about it. And because of that complexity, I think it would be very limiting to kind of specifically just focus on the cost element of it. Yes, there will be cost benefits, but those have to be -- will be balanced by our investment decisions and then the broader impact from the transition.\nScott Stephenson: And just to add to what you were saying there, Lee, and not trying to sort of specify sort of a particular level of margin impact. I do think of this transition as being an event at a moment in time. And it does have some discrete elements associated with them. Just to call out a few of them, there will come a moment where we're no longer computing on mainframe. We're not fully at that point yet, but there -- I mean, we will have an event where we'll get out the sledgehammers and literally break up the cores inside the mainframe. And that -- we're already reducing the load on the mainframe, and we can find some ways to benefit from that. We run power data centers, 2 of them, in the United States. We will close them at some point. There are fixed costs associated with data centers. And so that will be an event, and we'll call out those events for you when we get to those. And then something else, which I think is really extremely important, is that you used to buy compute capacity in relatively large chunks. And then as we move more towards the server environment, the chunks got smaller, but you're still buying chunks. In a world like that, anybody who's writing an algorithm, anybody who is demanding compute power, for them, you've already bought the capacity within limits. And so incrementally, it doesn't cost you anything. And in a world like that, you can actually be a little bit -- I don't want to use the word sloppy, but you can essentially use more compute capacity in how you want to get to the answer you're trying to get to.  And maybe you don't have to cash that analysis you just did quite as much or you don't have to summarize at the column and row level once, and then work through those derivatives, et cetera. My point here being that there should be an interaction between how you analyze for -- how you compute in the context of analysis and the way that you consume computing capacity. And in a variabalized world, you have to pay more attention to that than you used to. And so our development and analytics are responding and need to respond to that. But on the other side of the transition you actually think differently about literally what do you encode that you did before so that you can be efficient in your use of compute capacity.  So what I'm saying is there's a multiyear thing here. But on the other side, it is actually very different than where you were into this transition. You don't run physical facilities. You don't run really large hardware and you think very differently about how you structure analysis. And that will just be a more -- that's a better world for a company like ours.\nJeffrey Meuler: I appreciate the comprehensive response. You addressed the InsurTech impact and the vertical software providers that serve the insurance industry. I want to ask about, I guess, the third category of maybe adjacent players to you, which is there's a lot of funding going to companies that are gathering data with or, I guess, horizontal ambitions, but some of them also have ambitions to apply the data to the insurance industry, and there's the real estate digital twin image capture companies, the satellite base, the telematics, there's a whole bunch of these companies that are out there. And I know you have the Verisk Data Exchange, but curious as to how you view the impact on Verisk or your customers from those types of options and if they're competitive partnership opportunities for you, et cetera.\nScott Stephenson: Yes, sort of in reverse order on your question, yes, there is partnership opportunities. It would probably be of interest to you. If I took a list of the top 50 InsurTech companies, the number of them that we're in communication with today. When I say InsurTech companies, I don't mean new form insurance companies, I mean providers of solutions. And the number of those companies that we're in conversation with -- many of those conversations, they are coming and looking for us. So we start out aware of the fact that, in this world, you can start out with some programming capability and try to create something where you're hosting it. And it's mostly about digital workflows, et cetera. We see this all the time. And so we do pay attention to it. I would just say also that there are a lot of reasons why our customers lean into a relationship with us. Some of it has to do with the breadth of our family of solutions. Some of it has to do with our proven track record. Some of it has to do with reliability. And customers really care about that when you're talking about an enterprise-level application. There are a lot of reasons. And we're powered by really, really strong content assets. And a lot of the fill-in-the-blank tech start-ups, they don't start with content. So we never walk around feeling overly confident. We're very aware of these developments, but we do feel as if we start out in a very strong place in this discussion. And we like talking to these fill-in-the-blank techs and they like talking to us. So if there's some place where 1 plus 1 can be greater than two, we're very alert to that.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm of UBS.\nAlexander Kramm: Sorry if I missed this earlier, but on the COVID impact, the 15% that grew 12% this quarter, did you -- or can you talk about where we are there? Do you feel like we are fully recovered? Or what areas do you still wait for, I guess, improvement? I guess I could point to a couple. But yes, where do you think we are in that transition?\nScott Stephenson: Yes. Thank you, Alex. I appreciate the question. So I would say that we are -- when we look at our COVID-sensitive revenues across the business as a whole, we're looking at it business-by-business. And so we are seeing some recovery, stronger recovery in certain areas, for instance, on the property side. We've seen in the insurance front probably the strongest recovery. Some recovery in driving, although driving is -- would not be what we would describe as fully recovered at this point. In Energy and Specialized Markets, we are seeing a strong rebound in consulting revenues, so that is demonstrating relatively robust recovery. We're also seeing some strengthening in our new subscriptions, which will flow in over time, I think, reflecting some of the improved pricing dynamics. Whereas in DFS, there is an element, which I refer to our spend-informed analytics, which because of advertising and marketing, we have seen an uplift. And that's performing better than we expected, but the bankruptcy element of our business is still experiencing the challenges of all of the government support out there in the environment. And so that's yet to recover. It becomes very difficult to kind of quantify how far -- how much of a recovery. I would say it's certainly a partial recovery, not a full recovery, but the trends that we see, we expect to see continuing improvement in that recovery for the business. And it's probably worth noting in our insurance -- in the Insurance and in the Energy and Specialized Markets business, our COVID-sensitive revenues were up 20% year-over-year. Financial Services are still seeing a year-over-year decline, even though we've seen an improvement in spend-informed analytics and a deterioration -- or not a deterioration, but kind of the same level of declines on the bankruptcy side. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of texture across the business for some of the trends that we're seeing.  I would also note, naturally, it should come as no surprise, that our travel business internationally is still suffering significantly from very low international travel. And so that's an important component.\nAlexander Kramm: Okay. Maybe just a very quick follow-up on this. On the energy side, specifically, if I look at some of the recurring transactional breakouts, which -- I know they're not perfect, but it does look like a lot of the upside this quarter came from that consulting on the more transactional side. Given all the things that you're talking about with Lens, et cetera, is that not driving the impact yet that you are hoping for? Or are there maybe some retention issues elsewhere? Doesn't it look like it's flowing through the business quite yet, the success you were talking about there. So maybe just flesh that out a little bit more.\nScott Stephenson: Sure, Alex. Thanks for asking that question as a follow-up in that regard. So I think it is a good distinction to make that the consulting element is where we are seeing that recovery on the COVID-sensitive side and focusing on the subscription side of the business, and I kind of want to build on my earlier comments. The impact of Lens, which has been very positively received by a lot of our clients, has been generating significant contract renewals with price increases in the mid- to high single digits. Now there are 2 elements to that in terms of its ongoing impact. One is going to be the rolling impact of that as subscriptions become -- come up for renewal. And the second element of that is that then, again, that subscription is something that will phase in over time given the nature of that. But the important point from my perspective is that we are seeing a very positive uptake. Clients are working with Lens. We've gotten several operational assessments. They've been very positive. And we've been able to achieve those price increases. So that will be based upon our feedback so far, a slow rolling but an improvement to the growth in that business, even before we also begin to utilize that platform to expand that customer set and the applications. We also are still experiencing some impact from the last cycles, loss of 1 client in the energy space and some consolidation in the upstream area that is having a near-term impact on the research component. So that's another element that's factoring into it. But I think the distinction that you made is relevant. Hopefully, that differentiates that near-term consulting boost against what we see as constructive longer-term trends from Lens, and the pricing experience that we've had and how that should flow through over time within the business.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan.\nAndrew Steinerman: Lee, I wanted to ask you, as you've taken over the operational responsibility of Argus, what have you found in terms of the fit of Argus in terms of Verisk's ability to create further customer value, five new customer segments for Argus data or just innovate in general within a subscription model?\nLee Shavel: Yes. Thank you for the question, Andrew. I have been able to spend more time with the team at Verisk Financial Services. And one thing I would first emphasize is that they have been very focused on trying to integrate the data sets that we have from the various businesses and move from a more compartmentalized approach to the business to a focus on our broader client objectives. And in fact, Lisa has implemented some organizational changes that support that approach and focus from the business, which we think moves that to a more effectively integrated platform for our businesses. And we have also taken the steps structurally to move that business from a more consulting-oriented revenue base to more sustainable growth. And we are seeing that from a new business signing and pipeline perspective in the way that we are bringing on new business and how we're structuring it and the types of business. To your question, one thing that's important to emphasize is that Verisk's Financial Services, in many ways, has been an intellectual capital engine for much of the rest of the business. A lot of what they have learned in dealing with very large data sets and integrating them, managing them, data architecture elements have been exported to the rest of the business. Many of the data scientists, including our CIO, Nick Daffan; our Chief Analytics Officer, Vikas Vats, have come from that background and are -- we're drawing from their expertise. So there are other elements of the -- of what they've contributed to Verisk has been helpful. We are pulling from some of those externalized elements in a variety of ways analytically to developing new products, the replatforming of Argus 2.0 is an example of where we've been able to draw from some of that external expertise. So I think there is a good dialogue across the 2 entities. And we also look for interactions between the credit dimensions that Verisk Financial Services have and some of the insurance elements of our business to inform and generate new opportunities.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley.\nToni Kaplan: Wanted to ask another question on the fintech side. I guess, by partnering with the software platforms, it sounds like there's potential for upside from selling additional solutions on there. Just wanted to understand, compared to history before these platforms were as prevalent, were you providing a platform to your customers? Or are they just using their own platform? And so in this case, this is just complete upside? Or is there any revenue that is sort of lost by them going to a sort of software platform that's not yours?\nScott Stephenson: No, there's not revenue loss by them going to a platform provided by another third party. So just to expand on that answer just a hair, so if you look at sort of over -- I'd say, over the course of the decade, you go back a decade ago, it was either -- basically, what we were doing was going to market either through our own platforms or our solutions were operating more as point solutions and most of the integration was occurring customer by customer. They were doing their own integration. So now that's where it's where we are today and where we're headed into the future. We are more platforms than we were, significantly more platform than we were. And that is constructive inside of the growth of our business now and into the future. And if you actually look at the pattern of investment, what are we spending money on, a great deal of it and a lot more than it used to be, is on developing software, which you should hear us building our own platforms. But when we strike a relationship with a third party that is itself, providing a platform. It's -- we're analyzing that in the context of, well, okay, we could go direct the customer through the integration themselves. But basically, that third-party platform that isn't ours is substituting for the customer's own integration efforts, but not in a way that it impacts the underlying value of what it is that we provide, which is being integrated and over there. So the whole movement towards platforms is customer-friendly and it's constructive for Verisk because we, ourselves, are doing a lot more of that than we used to.\nToni Kaplan: That's helpful. And then just in the past couple of quarters, Financial Services has had single-digit EBITDA margins. Is this the new normalized margin? Or is there something depressing it temporarily? And any updated thoughts on strategic options?\nScott Stephenson: Definitely not the new normal. Lee, I don't know if you want to add on that.\nLee Shavel: Yes. Toni, thanks for the question. It's not the case. We are -- what you are seeing in that quarterly impact is the impact of some of the contract transitions, but we are expecting, as we come through that third quarter, a period where we reached the end of that contract transition impact, that you will see more normalized margins within that business. So that is not -- what you see now is not the expected sustained element here.\nToni Kaplan: And normal looks like what it did last year, for example?\nLee Shavel: In that vicinity.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik of Barclays\nManav Patnaik: Yes, I just wanted to follow up on the Financial Services as well. We've heard the positive spin on the business for quite some time. But for 5 years now, the growth has declined. The margins have come down as well. So like you guys decided to cut the cord or what's the plan? How do we get comfortable that it can be additive to growth?\nScott Stephenson: Thank you, Manav. And we -- it's a fair point. We understand the frustration in -- with regard to growth. I think it's important to understand that there are 2 factors that are influencing where the growth rates are right now that are very significant. One is the -- are the contract transitions that we believe are, one, absolutely the right operational decision. They are structural, and they are finite. And as I've just indicated in the answer to Toni, we move those after the third quarter of this year. Element is naturally the impact from COVID on the business on our COVID-sensitive revenues, which clearly had an impact on spend informed activity, bankruptcy activity and even some of the bank consulting revenue. And so when we are evaluating, and we are constantly evaluating what we do with all of our businesses and what are our options to optimize the value of that, the right time frame that we think is to look at what's the structural transitions and the impact from COVID. And so certainly, 2022 should be what we believe is a much more normalized level from a revenue, revenue growth and from a margin perspective that informs our view of the more normal operating state of the business as well as a sense of how the structural changes that we have implemented and the operating changes will demonstrate their impact more clearly in terms of growth at a top line and an EBITDA level. So in short, I think, as we move through these 2 temporal impacts and the structural impact on the contract transition, 2022 should be a much more normalized basis for us to be...\nLee Shavel: Well, I'll say it more strongly. 2020 would have been coming out year party for Verisk Financial, but for the pandemic. 2020 would have been a coming out party for Verisk Financial. All these changes that we're talking about making. And yes, I mean the fact that the business has an above-average level of transaction revenues relative to the mix that is in Verisk has caused it to sort of respond differentially. But beginning in 2018, we acknowledge changes that needed to happen in the business model. They were all packaged and on deck and ready and then the pandemic happens.\nManav Patnaik: Okay. And then maybe just a similar question on Energy. I think Lens obviously has been doing really well, and you talked about energy transition growing. But I think, collectively, they're still a small part of the business, right? So how do you -- what is the other initiatives going on there as you helped us grow 7% in what's a pretty cyclical industry?\nScott Stephenson: Yes. So in that situation, when we look at the rapidly changing landscape within power, I think it's important, Manav, to understand kind of a legacy perception of where Wood Mackenzie was from an oil and gas market, resource asset, pricing orientation and their expertise and where they have evolved and where they -- their potential to continue to evolve in an environment where the energy transition from carbon-based to alternative tools and all of the capital decision, investment decision, expense decisions that this client base investors are addressing is we are incredibly well-positioned. And Lens is the platform that puts us in the space to be able to capture the rapid growth in data sets and analytics for that business. We're already seeing it, as I indicated, in terms of the pricing on the legacy product. We're seeing it in the growth in our energy transition revenues, both on a consulting and subscription basis within chemicals. You saw an acquisition in metals and mining, which have increasing relevance given the importance of battery raw materials. And so we view Wood Mackenzie and PowerAdvocate, our primary energy businesses, as positioning themselves very well for capturing the growth in demand for those products. And we see through the impact on consulting revenues and some of the challenges on the subscription basis that growth potential ahead. So I think it's a combination of both that future opportunity and the success that we've had to date in moving that business forward. One piece of evidence from that, if you look at a number of our competitors in that space, I think you will see very differentiated performance from a revenue growth and an earnings growth perspective, reflecting the significant progress that we've made in moving it from that legacy orientation around the upstream oil and gas sector.\nOperator: And our last question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra of RBC Capital Markets.\nAshish Sabadra: I just wanted to focus on the strength in the software within the Insurance segment, both international as well as the life insurance -- or international as well as life insurance. You obviously talked about strength in the FAST business. I was wondering what's really driving it. Is it new customers? Is it ability to cross-sell? How do you -- can you comment on the pipeline? And maybe just a follow-up on that is -- there was a lot of discussion about platform and partnership, but how do you think about buying and building or increasing your software intensity and expanding on the platform that you already have?\nMark Anquillare: Sure. Well, thank you for the question. Let me describe the 2 different verticals or 2 different businesses described. So first of all, with regard to international software, so the most part that represents our Sequel offering. So we were talking a little bit about platforms before the [indiscernible] the claim systems. We are a player in the market. We are the most significant player in the market. And that is about growth in customers. That is about extension of different solutions and products, including some of the acquisitions we did that helped extend that platform, line space, roll block sequel, all of those are this interconnected ecosystem. And we've taken that capability as it relates to, for the most part, specialty and commercial lines, and started to extend it outside of the U.K. and even into the United States. So those are good wins, those are good extensions and it's been very positive.  If I was to go over to the FAST side, which is the life side of things, what we've done is we've infused it with some analytics. But in large part, what you're seeing is, there are some very major life insurers who've made some very major decisions, and they've chosen FAST. These are very long-term contracts, 5 and 10 years. And we are implementing as we speak, and that will be a very nice and very substantial run. Because as we implement, what we will get is I'll refer to it as subscription-types of revenue. And as they put on new products and there's new volumes, we would see increased revenue on each of those lines. So the major wins across the life insurance software platform space, it's been with FAST, in almost every case that we're aware of. And again, those are new logos as well as extension into other solutions or products within existing customers. So hopefully, that answers your question. And what I did try to at least kind of conclude in there, we have significantly increased the investment to make sure we transition to the SaaS environment, to transition to the cloud. We've extended both our capabilities through acquisition and build.\nOperator: Thank you. I will turn the call over to our presenters for any closing remarks.\nScott Stephenson: Thank you. This is Scott. I'm seeing some more names. Okay. we are concluded. Thank you all for your time today, your interest. We'll be following up with a number of you. And appreciate as always the dialogue. Have a great rest of the day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Lee Shavel",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. Moving to the financial results for the quarter. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 10.1% to $748 million. Net income attributable to Verisk decreased 14% to $154 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share attributable to Verisk declined 13% to $0.94 per share. These declines are the result of a noncash revaluation charge related to the U.K. tax law change. Adjusting for the impact of the $0.21 per share noncash revaluation charge, diluted adjusted EPS increased 7% to $1.38. Moving to our organic constant currency results. Adjusted for nonoperating items, as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, we were very pleased with our operating results, led by consistent growth in our subscription revenues and recovery in our transactional revenues as our business rebounds from the COVID-related declines from last year. In the second quarter, organic constant currency revenue grew 6.3%, led by continued strength in our Insurance segment and sequential improvement in our Energy and Financial Services segment. Our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, as we defined at the beginning of the pandemic, increased 5.5% in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to the growth of 6.5% in the prior year quarter. This stable growth in our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, representing approximately 85% of our total revenues, reflects the durability and resilience of our primarily subscription model. Our COVID-sensitive revenues, which represent 15% of our consolidated revenues, continued on a sequential improvement trend and returned to growth this quarter, increasing 12.1%. This compares to declines of 20% in the second quarter last year and the prior quarter performance of declines of 5.9%. Growth was primarily the result of improvements in consulting in our Energy segment and a return to pre-pandemic growth rates in many of our products and services within Insurance, particularly within the U.S. We did experience continued COVID-related weakness in our Financial Services segment as government forbearance programs are negatively impacting bankruptcy volumes. Organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth was 4.2% in the second quarter, led by solid growth in Insurance and Energy, offset in part by weakness in Financial Services. Total adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter, which includes both organic and inorganic revenue and adjusted EBITDA, was 49.6% in the quarter, down 172 basis points on a year-over-year basis, but still above our pre-pandemic margin level of 46.6% recorded in the second quarter of 2019. Much of the decline is associated with the normalization of our costs as we anniversary the COVID benefits from last year, including reduced head count growth and lower incentive compensation. This margin also reflects an increase in the pace of investment in our technological transformation, including our cloud transition costs and the impact of acquisitions. On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. In the second quarter, Insurance segment revenues increased 7.8%, demonstrating strong resilience and recovery. We saw healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, catastrophe modeling solutions, repair cost estimating solutions and international insurance software solutions. We also experienced strong growth in transactional revenues, associated with an increased level of securitization revenues in our catastrophe modeling business, a modest benefit from storm-related revenue and double-digit recovery growth in our COVID-impacted revenues as we compare against declines last year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 6.6% in the second quarter while margins declined 148 basis points, reflecting a return to a normalized rate of head count growth compared to the prior year and higher year-over-year short-term incentive compensation expense. We also continue to invest in our breakout areas as well as our technology modernization, including our cloud transition. Energy and Specialized Markets revenue increased 5% in the second quarter due to a recovery in our consulting and project-based revenues across Energy and Power, strong growth in environmental health and safety solutions and our energy transition research. Included in the quarter was revenue associated with the strategic consulting project that added approximately 1 point to segment growth. We continue to benefit from strong adoption of our Lens platform as customers are seeing the value of our integrated cloud-based data analytic environment. We remain a key part of our customers' most strategic conversations as they deal with the ever-changing energy landscape and our broad base of solutions across all commodities are mission-critical to our customers as they navigate through this dynamic environment.  Adjusted EBITDA grew 8.4% in the second quarter, while margins expanded 74 basis points, reflecting continued cost discipline and leverage from sales growth. As we look to the remainder of 2021, we want to remind you that we have a very tough margin comparison in the third quarter, associated with some head count reductions, furloughs and compensation adjustments that we made in reaction to the tough operating environment in 2020. However, some of these costs were reversed in the fourth quarter of 2020. All that said, we have a solid track record of managing through volatile times effectively and believe we are well-positioned with our energy transition solutions as well as our Lens platform to continue to outperform the end market and help our customers navigate this broad energy transition.  Financial Services revenue declined 8.1% in the quarter, reflecting the continued impact of contract transitions that we undertook in 2020 and will continue through the third quarter of 2021 as well as a lower level of bankruptcy revenue because of government support and forbearance program.  Spend informed analytics demonstrated stronger growth than expected as spending and advertising improved, which enabled us to reduce some of the negative impact on revenue growth from the contract transitions that we originally anticipated. Adjusted EBITDA declined 77% in the quarter, reflecting the negative impact of lower sales and a larger impact of corporate expense allocations on the segment's smaller base. We continue to believe that the actions we have taken with E&S over the last few years are setting the business on a stronger foundation from which to grow going forward. Our reported effective tax rate was 35.6% compared to 20.4% in the prior year quarter. This higher tax rate is the result of an earlier-than-anticipated enactment of a U.K. tax law change that caused a noncash revaluation charge. This is simply a timing difference from our original expectations as the impact occurred in the second quarter instead of the third quarter as we had originally forecast. There is no change to full year results. Given the earlier timing of the tax law change and the fact that this charge was onetime in nature, we now expect our tax rate to approximate 20% to 22% for the second half of 2021.  Adjusted net income was $191 million, and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.17 for the second quarter 2021, adjusting for the impact of a $0.21 per share noncash revaluation charge related to the U.K. Tax Law change described earlier, diluted adjusted EPS increased 7% to $1.38. These increases reflect organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions and a lower average share count. Net cash provided by operating activities was $233 million for the quarter, down 6.5% from the prior year period. The prior year period cash flow benefited from a deferral in both federal income tax payments and certain employer payroll taxes as a result of the CARES Act, partly offset by earn-out payments.  Year-to-date, net cash provided by operating activities was $682 million, reflecting growth of 11.4% versus the prior year period. Capital expenditures were $62.5 million for the quarter, up 10.2%. We continue to believe that CapEx will be in the range of $250 million to $280 million, reflecting our continued investment in our innovation agenda, our technological transformation as well as the carryover of certain expenditures that were delayed in 2020 as a result of the pandemic. Related to CapEx, we expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization will be within the range of $200 million to $215 million and intangible amortization to be approximately $180 million, reflecting the impact of recent acquisitions and changes in foreign currency rates. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to FX variability, the timing of purchases and the completion of projects and future M&A activity. During the second quarter, we returned $197 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends as our strong cash flow allows us to invest behind our highest-return growth initiatives, but also return capital to shareholders consistently. Our strategy to deliver long-term and sustainable growth remains unchanged. We are encouraged by the recovery we are experiencing in our COVID-impacted businesses, and we believe the stability and predictability of our subscription revenues will persist. We also have confidence in our ability to manage the cost structure effectively to protect profitability. While we do have tough cost comparisons this year, we believe that we should retain some of the margin expansion we experienced in 2020, delivering margins ahead of our 2019 level of 47%. Taking this all together, we believe that as the COVID impacts abate and the global economies continue to open up, we can return to our long-term growth model of 7% organic constant currency revenue growth, with core operating leverage allowing EBITDA to grow faster than revenue, although it is difficult to determine that -- to predict that timing. We hope this provides some useful context for you, and we look forward to addressing your questions. We continue to appreciate all of the support and interest in Verisk. [Operator Instructions]. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions. If I can just kind of supplement on that to provide some validation, I think you referenced a couple of elements here. But if you look at the underlying insurance business, it gets consistently delivered on that 7% organic growth area, where there have been negative impacts from that is it has either been because of some of the nearer-term cyclical elements associated with the energy business. But that business, as we have seen and demonstrated, particularly with the Lens platform, the investment in the energy transition practice, has demonstrated their potential to move to similar levels of growth. And Financial Services has been undergoing a transition to a more focus on sustainable growth, reducing some of that volatility. So I want to make certain that you appreciate that underneath the space is a consistent track record of delivering on that potential, with some of the other elements as we move down this path of investing in the platform in order to -- for us to deliver the value of those rapidly growing data sets, improved platforms against the business. That's been the recipe that is delivered and supports our conviction of the achievability of that going forward. So Hamzah, thanks for the question, and we appreciate you identifying the strength in the cash flow. I think the important thing to emphasize here is that we believe that one of the strongest elements that we have, the strongest opportunities that we have to create value is investing internally within the business, as Scott has described, in the technology, in the data sets, in new services for our clients. And so we want to make certain that we are taking every advantage to where we think we can generate incremental growth, where we can generate high incremental returns on capital from that. So we start from the position of how much capital do we have available that we're generating from the business. What are our opportunities first to invest in the business, in a way that takes advantage of those opportunities to generate growth and returns? Secondly, are there opportunities that we see in the M&A market to invest in businesses that we can create value by meaningfully improving their revenue growth through our distribution, utilizing their data sets more effectively or improving their technology? And FAST, as we've described, this has been a great example of that. Genscape in our energy business has been additive, has generated attractive returns on capital for us. So that's the second use. And then the decision on share repurchases is really an outcome of what capital do we have that we don't have an opportunity, we don't see an opportunity to invest, to contribute to growth or returns on capital. So it is an outcome of our capital allocation process, not something that we target at the outset. So kind of taking your question, if we don't see those opportunities, if the M&A market doesn't present opportunities for us given where valuations are or the nature of the business to create value, then we would expect that excess capital to be returned either through the dividend or through increased share repurchases, but it will all be driven by that investment opportunity and our discipline. Yes. Thank you, Jeff, for the question. There are several elements to it. And I know that you're asking it was in the context of cost, which I'll address. But I also want to make sure that there's an appreciation that there is a CapEx element to this. And then there is also the productivity element to this transition. First, on the cost. You are taking on an additional cloud capacity from the provider before you are eliminating some of that legacy. So you have kind of a redundant, redundant period. In addition, you were taking on recoding expense for the applications as you migrate them into that new environment. And so as we have been implementing this process across hundreds of applications in our various businesses, you have that upfront cost that is a negative cost impact, which we view as an investment. And we look at it on individual project-by-project basis. Our technology team does a great job tracking the specific costs and the savings, but think of this as rolling across the organization.  And for the first year and second year, we are still in a net investment mode from a cost perspective within the business. CapEx will be more limited going forward, so you will be extracting CapEx savings over time because the CapEx intensity of our technology footprint is declining, but that's something that's achieved over time. And we're beginning to experience that in this second year of the project, but that will continue naturally into the third year and beyond. And so if we think about OpEx and CapEx, we're still in a net investment mode in the second year. We would expect that in the third year that turns into a positive contribution. Now the other thing to factor in is that, as Scott described on the CapEx front, that is -- it will enable us -- and this is also true on the OpEx front, to shift some of that OpEx into other investment areas. So when I've talked about margin in the past, I've described there is natural operating margin expansion on a pre-investment level, but then we consume a portion of that from an investment perspective, and that's where we generate incremental growth and returns. So we do believe that this will be additive going into the third year, and then we'll determine do we see investment opportunities to pursue that. Beyond and riding on top of all of that is, I think, the more material benefit of this, which is the pace of innovation, the ability to associate more data sets to populate platforms that are creating a broader lift, I think, within the business and is sensed by, I think, a number of the questions in terms of its impact on our overall growth. So I wanted to give you kind of a comprehensive sense of the way that we are thinking about it. And because of that complexity, I think it would be very limiting to kind of specifically just focus on the cost element of it. Yes, there will be cost benefits, but those have to be -- will be balanced by our investment decisions and then the broader impact from the transition. Yes. Thank you for the question, Andrew. I have been able to spend more time with the team at Verisk Financial Services. And one thing I would first emphasize is that they have been very focused on trying to integrate the data sets that we have from the various businesses and move from a more compartmentalized approach to the business to a focus on our broader client objectives. And in fact, Lisa has implemented some organizational changes that support that approach and focus from the business, which we think moves that to a more effectively integrated platform for our businesses. And we have also taken the steps structurally to move that business from a more consulting-oriented revenue base to more sustainable growth. And we are seeing that from a new business signing and pipeline perspective in the way that we are bringing on new business and how we're structuring it and the types of business. To your question, one thing that's important to emphasize is that Verisk's Financial Services, in many ways, has been an intellectual capital engine for much of the rest of the business. A lot of what they have learned in dealing with very large data sets and integrating them, managing them, data architecture elements have been exported to the rest of the business. Many of the data scientists, including our CIO, Nick Daffan; our Chief Analytics Officer, Vikas Vats, have come from that background and are -- we're drawing from their expertise. So there are other elements of the -- of what they've contributed to Verisk has been helpful. We are pulling from some of those externalized elements in a variety of ways analytically to developing new products, the replatforming of Argus 2.0 is an example of where we've been able to draw from some of that external expertise. So I think there is a good dialogue across the 2 entities. And we also look for interactions between the credit dimensions that Verisk Financial Services have and some of the insurance elements of our business to inform and generate new opportunities. Yes. Toni, thanks for the question. It's not the case. We are -- what you are seeing in that quarterly impact is the impact of some of the contract transitions, but we are expecting, as we come through that third quarter, a period where we reached the end of that contract transition impact, that you will see more normalized margins within that business. So that is not -- what you see now is not the expected sustained element here. In that vicinity. Well, I'll say it more strongly. 2020 would have been coming out year party for Verisk Financial, but for the pandemic. 2020 would have been a coming out party for Verisk Financial. All these changes that we're talking about making. And yes, I mean the fact that the business has an above-average level of transaction revenues relative to the mix that is in Verisk has caused it to sort of respond differentially. But beginning in 2018, we acknowledge changes that needed to happen in the business model. They were all packaged and on deck and ready and then the pandemic happens."

            "name": "Scott Stephenson",
            "content": "Thanks, Stacey, and good day, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. I'm pleased to share that Verisk delivered a strong second quarter result. The strength of our business model has been on full display since the start of the pandemic and continues in the recovery. We delivered solid top line and profit growth in every quarter last year despite the weak economic environment and operating challenges from lockdowns because of the consistent and durable growth in our subscription-based businesses. As expected, we are now fully participating in the recovery as our transactional businesses are showing strong resilience and rebounding with the rollout of vaccines and global economies opening up. To be more specific in the second quarter, Verisk delivered organic constant currency revenue growth of 6.3%, comprised of growth of 5.5% and are mostly subscription-based non-COVID-sensitive revenues, and growth of 12.1% in our mostly transactional COVID-sensitive revenues. In fact, certain of our transactional businesses have already returned to pre-COVID levels. We have confidence this general trend can continue and believe that as the COVID impacts fully abate, we can return to delivering financial results in line with our long-term model. Lee will provide more details in his financial review. These results were delivered through the hard work, dedication and consistent focus on our customers by our 9,000 employees around the globe. In many parts of the world, we've already begun welcoming our employees back to our offices, with a plan guided by our mission of protecting the health and well-being of our team members and in line with directives from local governments and public health officials. While our Global Protection Services team is keeping a close eye on developments with the delta variant, our teams are energized to work together in person again. In fact, Currently, more than half of our global offices are operating in a Phase 2 or 3 format. Across the U.S., we have plans to return to full use of our offices in September, unless circumstances change considerably. We have implemented a return to office policy of 3 days in the office, 4 with customers and 2 days for hub. This approach, which incorporates the best learnings from the pandemic, balances individual flexibility with the collaboration and creativity that stems from working together in person. We also believe that this flexible working policy will help to retain and attract the very best talent as we continue to grow in what is a very competitive hiring environment. Not only are we returning to office, we are also beginning to have certain in-person meetings with our customers, including on-site training and sales opportunities. Given how effectively we've worked in a fully remote format, we have confidence that this return to office policy is the optimal design. Our computing and network capacity have consistently and comfortably exceeded what we require, and our teams have adjusted to using all the virtual collaboration tools we have implemented enterprise-wide. On the topic of technology. We continue to make great strides on our efforts to modernize and optimize our technology platforms to always be best in class. As of today, we have effectively and seamlessly moved most of our applications off the mainframe. This has been a huge undertaking and is a great example of true collaboration and partnership between our IT teams and business units around the globe. In total, we currently have thousands of solutions running native in the cloud, including those that were moved from prior on-premise environments and those built native to the cloud. We are advancing our cloud-first strategy and currently have more than half of our compute environment running in the cloud. The migration to the cloud is a multifaceted multistage project, and we are pacing this transition in lockstep with our customers to ensure that we are always delivering on their highest expectations. In addition, as we advance on this journey, the process is ever improving, and we are seeing real benefits in terms of pace of innovation, resiliency, security and compliance. Our ability to introduce new products and release updates to existing products in a quick and efficient manner is vastly improved because of our shift to the cloud. We are also able to onboard new customers and enter new geographies faster and with reduced capital intensity. For example, we've successfully deployed our new cloud-based visualized ISO ClaimSearch platform to our P&C insurance customers. This modernized version of our industry-leading ClaimSearch platform provides a more engaging user experience for thousands of claim adjusters and investigators, and allows us to offer new features, functionality and solutions quickly and easily to customers through this platform. In addition, our new insurance digital media contributory database will take advantage of the flexibility and efficiencies of cloud technology to process, store and analyze claim-related digital images from more than 160 insurers. Initially, we expect to receive over 8 million digital media files per week as this new offering ramps up to help insurers better detect potential fraud and increase settlement fee for meritorious claims. The cloud is also advancing our sales process as we can offer customers an easy and cost-beneficial way to pilot or trial new solutions that was previously much more cumbersome in Verisk's prior on-premise format. This allows customers to truly see in action the value of our solutions. Our sales team can then focus on converting those customers to long-term subscriptions. The cloud has also made our solutions more resilient with less downtime as the duration of maintenance windows are greatly reduced. We no longer must take our cloud-native solutions off-line to do things like update or release new features or protect them with the latest security patches and protocols. We have also constructed a cloud security program that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to continuously monitor our entire environment, making us more secure and able to audit our entire process for full accountability. And finally, the cloud makes it easier to keep applications and data that are running in local geographies to adhere to the increasing nuances of regulatory and compliance requirements that are geographically specific. As our business expands globally, this becomes an increasing benefit of cloud. From a capital perspective, our cloud migration has reduced our ongoing need to spend on third-party hardware and software. We are reallocating those savings towards internal innovation and spending more on growth CapEx. We are leaning into our highest growth, highest return on invested capital organic opportunities across insurance and energy.  Within Insurance, we have seen great success with the development of the LightSpeed platform. This organically developed data-forward platform has automated and improved the underwriting process for our customers, and is driving strong top line growth within our ISO business as we have extended it across personal and commercial lines. Specific to Commercial Lines, we've seen continued success in small commercial for business owners and commercial auto. With LightSpeed, we have augmented our AI and machine learning capabilities, introducing image analytics that will help present a holistic view of risk at the point of quote and ensure that small business owners get the coverage they need. We've also expanded our entity resolution and benchmarking data and analytics to help our diverse client base scale and increase their speed to market. We are also accelerating our customers' journey towards 0 application questions, helping drive speed and efficiency. With over 80 traditional and InsurTech customers, leveraging LightSpeed commercial, we are enabling the industry to free up underwriting talent to focus on more complex risks and helping our customers become the carrier or managing general agent of choice in this fast-moving and profitable space. Within energy, our internally developed cloud-based Lens platform is transforming the way customers interact with the Mackenzie data as we are integrating our complex data sets seamlessly into their workflows. We have greatly reduced our research cycle times from days to hours, allowing us to commercialize solutions more quickly and update data in existing solutions more frequently. This empowers our customers with the data necessary to make timely and well-informed decisions about commodity markets around the globe. We are seeing strong value-based price realization and revenue growth, resulting in solid returns on capital for this platform. The capital management discipline is also evidenced in our acquisition strategy. While interest and valuations for data analytic assets are high, we've been very selective and focused our attention only on assets where we can create incremental value by combining data sets for new solutions, leveraging our infrastructure or improving sales and distribution, through our strong customer relationships and industry scale. Our recent acquisition of FAST is a great example of how we are leveraging our relationships across the industry to accelerate the adoption of FAST software, driving strong returns on invested capital. On the engagement front, even in a mostly virtual mode, we continue to get ever closer to our customers. This engagement starts with the C-suite and runs through all levels of the organization. This is evidenced by increasing frequency of meetings, better attendance at our virtual events and increasing interest from customers to work with us as development partners. In fact, we recently announced 2 key development partners for our Lens Power solution, namely Vestas and Quinbrook. It has also translated into building sales pipelines and more sales opportunities. And we're having great success converting these sales opportunities into new contracts as we benefit from our ability to bundle our broad offerings to meet our customers' unique needs. This is particularly evident with our fastest-growing customer segment in InsurTech. On the innovation front, we recently launched the Cyber Risk Navigator, our cyber risk modeling application. This release represented a year-long effort to redevelop the platform from an on-premise solution to cloud-native SaaS solution. Given the scalability of the cloud, clients are now able to run analyses in minutes that used to take hours. It also provides us the ability to bring new features and model updates to the market quickly, rather than being tied to annual software releases, which is essential for a rapidly changing risk such as cyber.  We also made great strides in advancing our offerings in the telematics space with the introduction of the DrivingDNA Score. This enhanced solution is powered by the unique data from Verisk Data Exchange, that includes 260 billion miles and growing of robust driving behavior data from 8 million connected car drivers. The DrivingDNA Score enables our customers to enter and expand to the rapidly growing usage-based insurance market and is another key addition to our whole suite of telematics solutions. Finally, I'm excited to share about the progress Verisk has made on our environmental stewardship commitments. We recently completed our 2020 greenhouse gas emissions inventory. And I'm pleased to report that, for the fourth straight year, we balanced 100% of Verisk's reported Scope 1, 2 and 3, including business air travel emissions, through a combination of purposeful reduction initiatives and investments in renewable energy certificates and carbon offsets. We remain focused on implementing meaningful physical and operational changes that will reduce our greenhouse gas emissions over the long term. Those include the consolidation of multiple Verisk offices in Boston and London into new energy-efficient business centers as well as the continuing strategic realignment of our data management activities, to take advantage of the major efficiencies presented by cloud computing. Building on the progress we've already achieved to date, I'm also pleased to share that Verisk has committed to an absolute 21% reduction in our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2024 compared with the 2019 baseline. In developing the targets, Verisk collaborated with Ecometrica, an accomplished leader in the field of sustainability metrics, software and services. The resulting targets incorporate the latest science-based targets guidance, aligned with the 1.5-degree celsius global future. I look forward to updating you on our progress as we remain committed to addressing the very real impacts of climate change today and for the benefit of future generations. I have great confidence that our focus on innovation and serving our customers will help us deliver on our long-term growth objectives, creating lasting shareholder value. As our business recovers from the short-term impacts of the pandemic, we continue to actively study the signs of resilience across the different parts of our company. Our dynamic capital process is designed to ensure that our capital is deployed into the highest-growth and highest-return opportunities. With that, let me turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results. Yes. Scott here. Thanks for the question. Two things. One is, if you were to look at the pricing algorithms that apply into solutions that we provide to the insurance industry, the way that we price our solutions is related to the value of the solutions that we're getting to our customers. So it's not the case that in our -- to the pricing algorithm is a term, which is significant, and that relates to the amount of premium that our customers are putting through their own books of business. Our solutions are priced according to the amount of profitability and growth that they generate for our customers. And every CEO that I speak to in the insurance industry, every one of them to a person considers their business -- to grow the business. And so they are leaning into new methods as a way of trying to grow their businesses. And we expect that to persist. And it's always been the case actually that in our Insurance business, we have grown considerably faster than the underlying product marketplace. And actually, that's true to the energy vertical as well. And why? Because our customers are trying to make increasing use of data analytics solutions. So we're not really yoked to the net written premium volumes in the insurance industry. Yes, that is something that our customers care about a great deal. And so it's really incumbent upon us to make sure that the cost factors associated with the kinds of solutions we've got, which are aimed at understanding what it takes to repair something, we need to make sure that the underlying cost factors are current. And that is something that we give a lot of attention to. That has always been a part of the way that we approach this. But it's particularly important in a moment like this where demand, demand surge and, therefore, the price of the underlying commodities moves around.  You have highlighted something that our customers care quite a bit about. Actually, I'm going to turn to Mark here, who leads our insurance vertical. Not long ago, we were on a call with the CEO of one of the largest insurance companies in North America and this was one of the topics they highlighted. And we had a lot of conversation about what we're doing and the way that our solutions do keep up. So I'm really just affirming that the topic that you've highlighted there is on the minds of our customers. Mark, anything you want to add to that? Thanks, Gary. Well, maybe to your second question first. We do feel very good about the shape of our business, where we sit in the flow of what is happening in the business world. One of the most important things happening in the economy is businesses becoming the better, more analytic digital version of themselves. And that is fundamentally what is in and around and underneath our business and that we enjoy these tremendous relationships with our customers founded upon trust and some really, really valuable and distinctive solutions. That's our business. And the environment in which we're doing our work, obviously, the pandemic has had an effect as it did on everybody. But over longer periods of time, there are these very constructive trends. And so that's kind of fundamentally our growth story. Against that, our customers look to us to be their fill in the blank tech partner. There are -- in every one of the verticals we serve, there's a fill in the blank tech, InsurTech, fintech, energy tech. There's a list of players like that as long as both of your arms. Our customers expect us to be providing innovation. That is one of the reasons why they lean into the relationship with us in the first place. So I think the nature of your question, Gary, was like this investment into that solution and what is the effect of that in terms of our growth. We pay attention to that. It would probably surprise you to know the relatively modest size of investment opportunities that all the way to the office of the CEO we're looking at because it's the lifeblood of our business. And so we do -- we are resolving things down to the level of the individual solution, and we pay attention to how they're doing. And we make decisions about should we put more in because it looks very promising, should we pull back from it because it appears not to be gaining steam. We're doing that all the time. That is what we do on a moment-to-moment basis. But when you talk about vitality, you really -- you have to take it holistically. Because as we said earlier in this call, by count of corporate entity, in the insurance industry, the most rapidly growing segment are the InsurTechs, the new players. And I take such comfort in the fact that they show up with a clean sheet of paper. And they're rethinking everything. How are we going to build an insurance business? And they seem so consistently to want to standardize on all of our solutions. That's vitality. Now they're adopting solutions that we -- in some cases, that we created years ago. But they're buying into them because they remain right at the leading edge. I mean, they're very insistent that everything be cloud-native, tech-forward. They just -- they're not even going to look at you if you're not that way. So I would just encourage you to understand vitality means a lot of things. It means the infusion of value into a solution that has been around for a long period of time as well as the new solution. It's new customers as well as existing customers. But there's no question, if you pop all the way to the top of the organization and ask the question, look at that top line rate of organic revenue growth. One of the most powerful things that drives our growth is the adoption of solutions, whether it's a new solution by an existing customer or an existing but enhanced solution by a new customer. And the investing that we do in innovation is in support of all that. Mark, do you want to add something? Well, as I said before, the nature of our business is that because we're providing a unique kind of value to our customers, very consistently, our experience has been that we grow at a rate greater than the rate of growth in the verticals that we're serving. And I don't see any change in that. When you describe it that way, kind of stable normal environments are, all else equal, supportive. And you would have to expect over long periods of time, if you look at the marketplaces that we serve, they're very important elements of the economy. So a thesis, which is -- they will remain important is a pretty sound one. And then actually, the demography of the customer set inside of these verticals, they don't really change all that rapidly. Of course, we're always paying attention to that, but they don't tend to -- so you've got that as the background. But there is no question that there is a huge dependence upon execution. The whole innovation agenda has to be done well. We have to dig in with our customers as development partners to make sure that we hit what's needed, that we get it to market faster. All of those things have a lot to do with returns on any given innovation investment that we've made. So that's very important. And another thing, which -- I don't know, I suppose if you watch us really carefully over a long period of time, this would be evident, but I just want to highlight that there is a great deal of dynamic inside of what we're doing in terms of looking at the solution families and the solution sets that we've got and deciding where are they and where are they headed.  And we have a very long track record. I'll just -- I'll pick the insurance vertical since it's the largest one for us. Investing more inside of things that are showing a lot of promise, but retiring in some cases, selling off solution sets that we have as well. And so it can all look -- it's kind of like the duck on top of the lake. It looks very steady, but underneath, there's various paddling going on. And we get down to the level of individual solutions. Again, just using insurance as an example, through the years, we've retired a number of things that we were doing. We invented a whole lot of things. All of that is inside of getting to this long-term view of growth potential. And just to add to what you were saying there, Lee, and not trying to sort of specify sort of a particular level of margin impact. I do think of this transition as being an event at a moment in time. And it does have some discrete elements associated with them. Just to call out a few of them, there will come a moment where we're no longer computing on mainframe. We're not fully at that point yet, but there -- I mean, we will have an event where we'll get out the sledgehammers and literally break up the cores inside the mainframe. And that -- we're already reducing the load on the mainframe, and we can find some ways to benefit from that. We run power data centers, 2 of them, in the United States. We will close them at some point. There are fixed costs associated with data centers. And so that will be an event, and we'll call out those events for you when we get to those. And then something else, which I think is really extremely important, is that you used to buy compute capacity in relatively large chunks. And then as we move more towards the server environment, the chunks got smaller, but you're still buying chunks. In a world like that, anybody who's writing an algorithm, anybody who is demanding compute power, for them, you've already bought the capacity within limits. And so incrementally, it doesn't cost you anything. And in a world like that, you can actually be a little bit -- I don't want to use the word sloppy, but you can essentially use more compute capacity in how you want to get to the answer you're trying to get to.  And maybe you don't have to cash that analysis you just did quite as much or you don't have to summarize at the column and row level once, and then work through those derivatives, et cetera. My point here being that there should be an interaction between how you analyze for -- how you compute in the context of analysis and the way that you consume computing capacity. And in a variabalized world, you have to pay more attention to that than you used to. And so our development and analytics are responding and need to respond to that. But on the other side of the transition you actually think differently about literally what do you encode that you did before so that you can be efficient in your use of compute capacity.  So what I'm saying is there's a multiyear thing here. But on the other side, it is actually very different than where you were into this transition. You don't run physical facilities. You don't run really large hardware and you think very differently about how you structure analysis. And that will just be a more -- that's a better world for a company like ours. Yes, sort of in reverse order on your question, yes, there is partnership opportunities. It would probably be of interest to you. If I took a list of the top 50 InsurTech companies, the number of them that we're in communication with today. When I say InsurTech companies, I don't mean new form insurance companies, I mean providers of solutions. And the number of those companies that we're in conversation with -- many of those conversations, they are coming and looking for us. So we start out aware of the fact that, in this world, you can start out with some programming capability and try to create something where you're hosting it. And it's mostly about digital workflows, et cetera. We see this all the time. And so we do pay attention to it. I would just say also that there are a lot of reasons why our customers lean into a relationship with us. Some of it has to do with the breadth of our family of solutions. Some of it has to do with our proven track record. Some of it has to do with reliability. And customers really care about that when you're talking about an enterprise-level application. There are a lot of reasons. And we're powered by really, really strong content assets. And a lot of the fill-in-the-blank tech start-ups, they don't start with content. So we never walk around feeling overly confident. We're very aware of these developments, but we do feel as if we start out in a very strong place in this discussion. And we like talking to these fill-in-the-blank techs and they like talking to us. So if there's some place where 1 plus 1 can be greater than two, we're very alert to that. Yes. Thank you, Alex. I appreciate the question. So I would say that we are -- when we look at our COVID-sensitive revenues across the business as a whole, we're looking at it business-by-business. And so we are seeing some recovery, stronger recovery in certain areas, for instance, on the property side. We've seen in the insurance front probably the strongest recovery. Some recovery in driving, although driving is -- would not be what we would describe as fully recovered at this point. In Energy and Specialized Markets, we are seeing a strong rebound in consulting revenues, so that is demonstrating relatively robust recovery. We're also seeing some strengthening in our new subscriptions, which will flow in over time, I think, reflecting some of the improved pricing dynamics. Whereas in DFS, there is an element, which I refer to our spend-informed analytics, which because of advertising and marketing, we have seen an uplift. And that's performing better than we expected, but the bankruptcy element of our business is still experiencing the challenges of all of the government support out there in the environment. And so that's yet to recover. It becomes very difficult to kind of quantify how far -- how much of a recovery. I would say it's certainly a partial recovery, not a full recovery, but the trends that we see, we expect to see continuing improvement in that recovery for the business. And it's probably worth noting in our insurance -- in the Insurance and in the Energy and Specialized Markets business, our COVID-sensitive revenues were up 20% year-over-year. Financial Services are still seeing a year-over-year decline, even though we've seen an improvement in spend-informed analytics and a deterioration -- or not a deterioration, but kind of the same level of declines on the bankruptcy side. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of texture across the business for some of the trends that we're seeing.  I would also note, naturally, it should come as no surprise, that our travel business internationally is still suffering significantly from very low international travel. And so that's an important component. Sure, Alex. Thanks for asking that question as a follow-up in that regard. So I think it is a good distinction to make that the consulting element is where we are seeing that recovery on the COVID-sensitive side and focusing on the subscription side of the business, and I kind of want to build on my earlier comments. The impact of Lens, which has been very positively received by a lot of our clients, has been generating significant contract renewals with price increases in the mid- to high single digits. Now there are 2 elements to that in terms of its ongoing impact. One is going to be the rolling impact of that as subscriptions become -- come up for renewal. And the second element of that is that then, again, that subscription is something that will phase in over time given the nature of that. But the important point from my perspective is that we are seeing a very positive uptake. Clients are working with Lens. We've gotten several operational assessments. They've been very positive. And we've been able to achieve those price increases. So that will be based upon our feedback so far, a slow rolling but an improvement to the growth in that business, even before we also begin to utilize that platform to expand that customer set and the applications. We also are still experiencing some impact from the last cycles, loss of 1 client in the energy space and some consolidation in the upstream area that is having a near-term impact on the research component. So that's another element that's factoring into it. But I think the distinction that you made is relevant. Hopefully, that differentiates that near-term consulting boost against what we see as constructive longer-term trends from Lens, and the pricing experience that we've had and how that should flow through over time within the business. No, there's not revenue loss by them going to a platform provided by another third party. So just to expand on that answer just a hair, so if you look at sort of over -- I'd say, over the course of the decade, you go back a decade ago, it was either -- basically, what we were doing was going to market either through our own platforms or our solutions were operating more as point solutions and most of the integration was occurring customer by customer. They were doing their own integration. So now that's where it's where we are today and where we're headed into the future. We are more platforms than we were, significantly more platform than we were. And that is constructive inside of the growth of our business now and into the future. And if you actually look at the pattern of investment, what are we spending money on, a great deal of it and a lot more than it used to be, is on developing software, which you should hear us building our own platforms. But when we strike a relationship with a third party that is itself, providing a platform. It's -- we're analyzing that in the context of, well, okay, we could go direct the customer through the integration themselves. But basically, that third-party platform that isn't ours is substituting for the customer's own integration efforts, but not in a way that it impacts the underlying value of what it is that we provide, which is being integrated and over there. So the whole movement towards platforms is customer-friendly and it's constructive for Verisk because we, ourselves, are doing a lot more of that than we used to. Definitely not the new normal. Lee, I don't know if you want to add on that. Thank you, Manav. And we -- it's a fair point. We understand the frustration in -- with regard to growth. I think it's important to understand that there are 2 factors that are influencing where the growth rates are right now that are very significant. One is the -- are the contract transitions that we believe are, one, absolutely the right operational decision. They are structural, and they are finite. And as I've just indicated in the answer to Toni, we move those after the third quarter of this year. Element is naturally the impact from COVID on the business on our COVID-sensitive revenues, which clearly had an impact on spend informed activity, bankruptcy activity and even some of the bank consulting revenue. And so when we are evaluating, and we are constantly evaluating what we do with all of our businesses and what are our options to optimize the value of that, the right time frame that we think is to look at what's the structural transitions and the impact from COVID. And so certainly, 2022 should be what we believe is a much more normalized level from a revenue, revenue growth and from a margin perspective that informs our view of the more normal operating state of the business as well as a sense of how the structural changes that we have implemented and the operating changes will demonstrate their impact more clearly in terms of growth at a top line and an EBITDA level. So in short, I think, as we move through these 2 temporal impacts and the structural impact on the contract transition, 2022 should be a much more normalized basis for us to be... Yes. So in that situation, when we look at the rapidly changing landscape within power, I think it's important, Manav, to understand kind of a legacy perception of where Wood Mackenzie was from an oil and gas market, resource asset, pricing orientation and their expertise and where they have evolved and where they -- their potential to continue to evolve in an environment where the energy transition from carbon-based to alternative tools and all of the capital decision, investment decision, expense decisions that this client base investors are addressing is we are incredibly well-positioned. And Lens is the platform that puts us in the space to be able to capture the rapid growth in data sets and analytics for that business. We're already seeing it, as I indicated, in terms of the pricing on the legacy product. We're seeing it in the growth in our energy transition revenues, both on a consulting and subscription basis within chemicals. You saw an acquisition in metals and mining, which have increasing relevance given the importance of battery raw materials. And so we view Wood Mackenzie and PowerAdvocate, our primary energy businesses, as positioning themselves very well for capturing the growth in demand for those products. And we see through the impact on consulting revenues and some of the challenges on the subscription basis that growth potential ahead. So I think it's a combination of both that future opportunity and the success that we've had to date in moving that business forward. One piece of evidence from that, if you look at a number of our competitors in that space, I think you will see very differentiated performance from a revenue growth and an earnings growth perspective, reflecting the significant progress that we've made in moving it from that legacy orientation around the upstream oil and gas sector. Thank you. This is Scott. I'm seeing some more names. Okay. we are concluded. Thank you all for your time today, your interest. We'll be following up with a number of you. And appreciate as always the dialogue. Have a great rest of the day."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Mark Anquillare",
            "content": "No, I think our customers expect us to be on top of that. So as an example, it's -- the repair cost estimate solutions, we're making constant updates on a weekly basis. We're providing them what's the cost of lumber, as an example, which has been a very significant inflationary item. And their repair cost estimates are reflected that -- are reflecting that increase. We are very much into the world of social inflation, right? The cost of litigation and the cost of claims is up as a result of that. So that -- those trends are reflected in our loss costs. That's the pricing they do. It's reflected in the repair cost estimates. It's reflected in how they underwrite a property or any insurance risk, and I'd like to think that we are at the lead in thinking for them on that topic. Yes, just maybe to provide a good example of everything Scott described. I think one of the big success stories is really inside of what is our underwriting and rating ISO business. We continue to have a very big business focused on what we refer as loss cost rules and forms. And we have been growing kind of an inflationary way because we've been very thoughtful with our customers. The growth that we've seen, that has increased over the last several years is because of that innovation investment and kind of bundling things for these InsurTechs and others. So I just wanted to reaffirm and maybe provide tangible evidence to that. Yes. Thank you, Gary. I try to look at the cost structure and evaluate what's temporal and what's structural. And there is some temporal element of this that we've been able to hold on to. But I think to your point on the travel and entertainment side, I think there are structural savings that we are -- we'll be able to take advantage of over time. And so I think some of that, there is a structural change.  I also think over the longer term, as we adopt or adapt to the flexible work structure that Scott described in his comments that it will provide opportunities for us from a productivity, from a real estate cost standpoint to reduce some of those expenses over time. But of course, that follows kind of the lease renewal process. But those will be things that we're able to achieve over time as well. And then finally, the other element is compensation, and that is more directly tied to our overall performance against the growth targets and overall head count growth. And I think that will -- that's the element that is likely and we'll certainly hope is going to normalize consistent with the achievement of our revenue growth and our EBITDA growth. Yes. So let me try to maybe provide some parameters. The way we're going about this is we really believe that insurer, in their search for the best experience to the customer, the digital engagement, they want information that's actionable and they can kind of have a bindable quote, meaning when you go online and you want to get a price, you don't want it to change. And basically, 33% to 40% of the cases, that price changes, if you say I'm interested. And they do all this underwriting and pull the information. we're bringing all that information forward and the combination of data we have and analytics so that the insurer has confidence to quote. And that's a big change. So that is noteworthy and important. And what we've tried to do in kind of thinking about the opportunity here, we know who's providing that information. And we feel it's about $1 billion that's going to be type of market opportunity in the insurance space. So we simply have a lot of runway, especially on the personal line side. We have a strong base on the commercial line side at the so that's kind of an extension, which hopefully provides you with a little bit of context of why we think it's important and also why we've continued to emphasize that . So the majority of our catastrophe modeling is around a touchdown subscription model that we've taken a lot of customers and we've had a lot of wins. So the growth you've seen, the underlying foundational growth, is us winning customers and bringing them on to the platform.  Where you're seeing a little bit of a spike and valley is inside of what is the ILS market. Those are the cat bonds we referred to. And that is a little bit a function of timing of the market. We had a good couple -- we had a good quarter. We probably would expect a strong for end of year. It's a little bit tough to tell whether that's going to grow in 2022. At the same time, I would say to you that the market in general is getting more and more collateralized those type of risks. So if you were to ask me what the growth perspective is for cat bonds over the next 5 years, I would say it's going to be up. It's going to be bigger, and we're well-positioned for it, whether it's going to be up or down in one particular quarter, that is a tough estimate for you. And I hope you can appreciate the difficulty we have in forecasting quarter-by-quarter, but I think we have feel for year-over-year. Let me continue. Thank you for the question, another good opportunity. I think I've highlighted in past sessions here, one of the things we're seeing more and more frequently is our customers are looking forward to this interconnected ecosystem. They want the ability to use their internal solutions, their solutions or other third-party solutions in a connected way, whether that's through APIs or micro services. And we're spending a lot of time and money making that happen. So what we're seeing and what we're hearing and what it does is it really helps us because there are a lot of customers out there on those big insurance software solutions like Duck Creek. Guidewire would be another one. And we have integrated with those solutions in such a way that those customers get access information from Verisk and analytics from Verisk or claim solutions from Verisk, in a way that makes it easier for us to operate, more efficient for them to operate. And what it also does is it gives us an opportunity for easier to sell because the integration is built in and it's connected. So we find it to be very customer-focused, and it also gives us some runway in accelerated pipeline for sales. So let me say it this way. I think what we have done over the last 20 years is we've had SaaS-based environments. So these are not locally installed solutions. So the SaaS-based business model facilitates this. Your question now is a good one. I think we can do it quicker and more efficiently when we want to integrate using the cloud and as we've kind of transitioned to cloud. So it's not been an enabler, but it has become more efficient in cost-effective. Sure. Well, thank you for the question. Let me describe the 2 different verticals or 2 different businesses described. So first of all, with regard to international software, so the most part that represents our Sequel offering. So we were talking a little bit about platforms before the [indiscernible] the claim systems. We are a player in the market. We are the most significant player in the market. And that is about growth in customers. That is about extension of different solutions and products, including some of the acquisitions we did that helped extend that platform, line space, roll block sequel, all of those are this interconnected ecosystem. And we've taken that capability as it relates to, for the most part, specialty and commercial lines, and started to extend it outside of the U.K. and even into the United States. So those are good wins, those are good extensions and it's been very positive.  If I was to go over to the FAST side, which is the life side of things, what we've done is we've infused it with some analytics. But in large part, what you're seeing is, there are some very major life insurers who've made some very major decisions, and they've chosen FAST. These are very long-term contracts, 5 and 10 years. And we are implementing as we speak, and that will be a very nice and very substantial run. Because as we implement, what we will get is I'll refer to it as subscription-types of revenue. And as they put on new products and there's new volumes, we would see increased revenue on each of those lines. So the major wins across the life insurance software platform space, it's been with FAST, in almost every case that we're aware of. And again, those are new logos as well as extension into other solutions or products within existing customers. So hopefully, that answers your question. And what I did try to at least kind of conclude in there, we have significantly increased the investment to make sure we transition to the SaaS environment, to transition to the cloud. We've extended both our capabilities through acquisition and build."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After today\u2019s prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, where we will limit participant to one question and one follow-up. We will have further instructions for you at that time. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk\u2019s Head of Investors Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.\nStacey Brodbar: Thank you, Mayra, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our first quarter 2021 financial results. Today\u2019s call will be led by Scott Stephenson, Verisk\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, who will provide an overview of our business. Lee Shavel, Chief Financial Officer and Group President, will follow with the financial review. Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer and Group President will join the team for the Q&A session. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30-days on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today\u2019s earnings release, I will remind everyone that today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk\u2019s future performance, including, but not limited to, the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott.\nScott Stephenson: Thanks, Stacey. Hello, everyone. And thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. 2021 is a special year here at Verisk as it marks our 50th anniversary as a company. For 50 years, our mission and purpose has been the same. We work non-stop in partnership with our customers using data and insights to make a difference by helping protect people, economies, society and our planet. On this journey, we used our unique data and combined it with advanced technologies in new ways to unlock meaningful insights about risk, becoming a global leader in cutting edge analytics. And while we are very proud of our accomplishments over the last 50 years, it inspires us to look ahead to all the difference we can make over the next 50 years. I\u2019m pleased to share that this year is off to a solid start marked by continued growth in our subscription businesses. We\u2019ve delivered solid growth in Insurance, a modest sequential improvement in our Energy segment. Yet we had a challenging quarter within Financial Services. While certain of our businesses continue to be impacted by the pandemic, those revenue streams show resilience as the underlying causal factors improve and we have confidence in this relationship. We will provide more detail on this financial review. For 2021, we remain focused on building long-term shareholder value, delivering for our customers through innovation and service, while also protecting the health and well being of our teammates around the globe. Currently, most of our offices are operating in a Phase 1 format and are available for those employees who have volunteered to work from the office. We do have certain offices that have advanced to Phase 2 and even Phase 2 as conditions in their local markets allow and employees are energized to be back in the office. Our Global Protection Services team closely monitors directives from local governments and public health officials around the world, as well as incorporates learnings from our local market experiences to make real-time decisions to maintain the safety of our people. To that end, our teams are closely monitoring the current situation in India in the face of the severe second wave of COVID and we are providing relief and assistance to our India colleagues including vaccination coverage, virtual medical services, emergency relief funds and other essential programs. To-date, we have experienced minimal or no disruption to our business or the services we provide. Over the duration of the pandemic, our teams have proven they can transition efficiently into different work modes with minimal interruption in service to our customers. So while there remains some uncertainty around return to office timing across our many different markets, I have complete confidence that our 9,000 plus teammates at Verisk will continue to navigate through these times effectively and deliver the highest value to our customers. Throughout the pandemic, I\u2019ve maintained a high level of engagement with our customers, CEOs across all three of our segments. Despite the virtual setting, the frequency of these meetings has increased, and the level of engagement and mutual respect has deepened. In these conversations, we are discussing our customers\u2019 highest strategic priorities. In all circumstances, we are receiving feedback that Verisk is a trusted and differentiated partner, and that our solutions and innovations played large and increasing role in our customers journeys to becoming more digitally engaged, more automated and more efficient. These types of constructive meetings are happening across all levels of our organization, most recently within our underwriting and claims councils, which include representatives from our top 25 customers in the Insurance vertical. With regard to digital engagement, we continue to see very strong adoption of our virtual claims processing platform, claims experience, as insurers continue to find additional use cases for remote claims handling outside the pandemic. Our virtual claims tools enable our customers to conduct business at a time when in-person processes were not possible. But it also has the added benefit of settling claims with greater speed. In fact, virtual claims are paid on average 30% faster than the traditional process. We\u2019ve recently added new features to enhance the solution including remote measurement, object recognition and an automated damage assessment tool. We also are having success converting customers from transactional usage to long-term contracts with committed volumes, as they build comfort with the tool and realize the value that remote claims processing can bring to their organization. One of the strongest signals of the deep and expanding relationships with our customers in our view is the fact that they entrust us with their data. I\u2019m pleased to share that in the most recent year 29 insurers have decided to newly contribute data to our ISO Statistical Database. This is the highest number of new participants in a single year over the last 10 years and represents a range of different customers from insure tech startups to multi-state carriers. On the sales front, we\u2019re having great success selling in virtual mode and remain committed to advancing our techniques with ongoing training across the many new virtual selling tools we employ. Our pipelines of new opportunities are some of the strongest in our history and they continue to build. Our customers are more engaged with Verisk as a partner, as evidenced by increased numbers of meetings, better attendance at our virtual conferences, and contract renewals and signings of new deals that are longer in duration. On the innovation front, we continue to make advances with our solutions to drive digital engagement, automate processes and create a seamless interconnected ecosystem, what we have various referred to as platforms analytic environments. While this is a journey we\u2019ve been on for some time, the pandemic has catalyzed our customers to move forward with greater urgency and speed. These platforms analytic environments offer our customers deep integration into their workflows and allow a massive amount of information to be rendered so that decisions can be made quickly and accurately. Often these environments are more software intensive, as we are utilizing this software to gather more data, automate more processes and become even more deeply embedded with our customers. These platforms are also driving healthy and profitable growth for Verisk across our verticals. Let me give you a few recent examples. Within Life Insurance, we\u2019re driving strong growth and profitability as we bundled the industry leading module software offerings at FAST. With the data analytics we have developed across Verisk to create a full suite of Life Insurance Solutions in one singular platform. We\u2019re having great success extending and accelerating the adoption of FAST Solutions across our broad customer base and have a strong pipeline of future deals. In addition, we recently launched new analytics including EHR Triage Engine and Life Risk Navigator. Electronic Health Record Triage Engine uses advanced data analytics and natural language processing to distill 1000s of pages of electronic medical records into a short summary and provides an automated underwriting store, both of which reduce underwriting costs and speed up the process and that leads to an improved buying experience for the end consumer. Life Risk Navigator is a cloud-based modeling platform that offers in depth portfolio analytics to enhance risk selection, quantify changes in mortality rates and drive overall better decision making. Further in March, we enhanced our capabilities in Life Insurance, through the acquisition of 4C Solutions, a software advisory firm with expertise in Group Life Insurance. The addition of 4C enables us to extend our expertise into the Group Life market and help address the needs for Group Life insurers and institutional annuity providers. While each solution is strong on its own, we believe we deliver even more value for our customers, as these solutions are integrated into one holistic interconnected ecosystem. We are also delivering very strong growth at Sequel as we help our customers in the specialty markets digitize and modernize. Sequel Solutions create a truly integrated ecosystem across carriers, brokers and managing general agents throughout the specialty market, and we\u2019re bringing in new customers and expanding our suite of products across existing customers. We are also beginning to see traction in our global expansion of Sequel with new clients signed in the U.S. and Asia-Pacific. To further enhance the value and capability of the Sequel ecosystem, we recently acquired a majority stake in Whitespace Software. The powerful combination of Whitespaces\u2019 digital placing platform with Sequel\u2019s pricing distribution and policy administration applications enables a seamless real-time quote-to-bind solution with straight through submissions for our existing and prospective customers. In our Energy business, we continue to make advances on the development of new modules and sales of new subscriptions for our Lens platform. Despite the softness in the energy end market, customers are recognizing the value and uniqueness of the platform, and this is reflected in new customer subscriptions and constructive pricing for customers that adopt Lens. Additionally, we have lots of interest in future releases for Lens and already have a group of development partners in place to support Lens Power, backed by the proprietary data assets of Wood Mackenzie and Genscape. Lens Power enables customers to maximize investment opportunities in clean energy and be on the forefront of the energy transition and further advances our market leading position in the energy transition. We are well positioned to capitalize on the growing trend of countries and companies around the world, increasing investment toward renewables and green energy, and our solutions will help inform these critical decisions at the highest levels. Lens Power is part of a broader suite of solutions that we have within our Energy segment to help our customers navigate the changing ESG landscape. We are seeing a positive market response to our Energy Customers Solutions for improve management of supply chain risk and ESG priorities like emissions benchmarking and supplier diversity programs. Not only are we helping our customers with their ESG initiatives, we have also moved forward on our own ESG agenda. In early April, we released our Annual CSR report, which you can find in the Corporate Social Responsibility section of our website. This year\u2019s report is notable for three reasons. First, the environmental section features our Climate Disclosure report, which speaks to the four pillars of TCFD, governance, risk and opportunities, risk management, and metrics and targets. Our Board and senior management team are very engaged on these subjects, including climate change and climate transition, both on the risks we face, but equally important on the opportunities they present for our business. We\u2019ve been helping customers understand, measure and manage risk associated with climate and weather for decades. Wind storms, wildfire and flood risk among others, and are building on a base of knowledge, data, predictive models, analytic expertise, industry leading standards and investments that are already in play, and serving our insurance and energy customers failing. Second, we used the CSR report as the vehicle to deliver our first ever disclosure in accordance with SASB\u2019s recommendations for professional and commercial services companies. The disclosure includes baseline metrics around workforce composition, diversity, engagement and turnover. We intend to update those metrics in our CSR report each year. And finally, the CSR report calls out Verisk approach to cybersecurity, a comprehensive document that describes our commitment and investments to strengthen data security and privacy. That commitment doesn\u2019t just exist on paper, but is reinforced through the mandatory training we conduct annually for all of our employees. We\u2019re very proud of the progress we made throughout 2020. Our Board and senior management team are very much engaged and our entire organization is committed to continue to move forward our ESG agenda over the coming years. I\u2019m confident we have the right strategy and team in place to meet our long-term growth objectives. Our deep domain expertise and relationships with our customers help inform our innovation agenda. And we are treating the year 2021 as one that provides a unique set of signals on the resilience of the different parts of our company which we are pulling into our always active capital process to ensure that our capital is deployed into the highest return opportunities. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results.\nLee Shavel: Thank you, Scott. First, I would like to bring to everyone\u2019s attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. Additionally, you may notice that we have a slightly new presentation of our financial statements. As Scott mentioned earlier during the quarter, we closed on a majority investment in Whitespace Software. As a result, we now report net income and earnings per share attributable to Verisk. Moving to the financial results for the first quarter. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 5.3% to $726 million, net income attributable to Verisk decreased 1.8% to $169 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share attributable to Verisk declined 1% to $1.03, reflecting a $19 million gain on dispositions in the prior year that did not reoccur. Moving to our organic constant currency results, adjusted for non-operating items as defined in the non-GAAP Financial Measures section of our press release. We were very pleased with our operating results considering the continued impact from COVID-19. In the first quarter, organic constant currency revenue grew 3.4% led by continued to strengthen our Insurance segment and modest sequential improvement in our Energy segment. This quarters\u2019 performance fundamentally reflected a year-over-year comparison to a largely pre-pandemic quarter, although we began to see progress in our COVID sensitive revenues, which improved sequentially. Our non-COVID sensitive revenues as we defined at the start of the pandemic grew approximately 4.9% on an organic constant currency basis, down from 6.5% rate in the fourth quarter, reflecting a lower level of catastrophe bond securitization activity at AIR and a higher level of impact from consolidation in the Insurance and Energy segments. We did continue to experience as we have since the onset of the pandemic, a negative impact from COVID-19 on certain of our products and services, largely transactional in nature, which represent the balance or approximately 15% of our revenues. However, we saw an improvement as certain of these products and services returned to growth on a year-over-year basis. COVID sensitive revenues declined approximately 5.9% on an organic constant currency basis during the first quarter, compared to the 12.5% decline in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of improved consulting activity in our Energy sector, but also reflecting a return to growth of several products and services, particularly in the U.S. Despite the impact on revenue in the first quarter, we are pleased to report that we delivered solid EBITDA growth and expanded margins as a result of effective expense management and lower travel expenses. Organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth was 5.2% in the first quarter, up from 4.9% growth in the fourth quarter. Total adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter, which includes both organic and inorganic revenue and adjusted EBITDA was 47.6% in the quarter, representing leverage across our Insurance and Energy verticals offset in part by weakness in Financial Services. This margin level includes roughly 150 basis points of benefit from lower travel expenses, but also reflects a return to a more normal pace of headcount growth and an increase in the pace of investment in our technological transformation, including our cloud transition costs. On that note, let\u2019s turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. In the first quarter, Insurance segment revenues increased 6%, reflecting healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, catastrophe modeling solutions, repair cost estimating solutions and insurance software solutions. We experienced a modest benefit from storm related revenues as a result of the ice storms in Texas and the Southeast. However, this was more than offset by lower level of securitization revenues in our catastrophe modeling business as issuance was lowered year-over-year. In addition, we experienced declines in certain transactional revenues that were negatively impacted by COVID-19, as we had very minimal COVID impact in the first quarter of 2020. Adjusted EBITDA grew 8.3% in the first quarter, while margins expanded 196 basis points, demonstrating strong margin expansion, despite certain revenue declines, investment in our breakout areas and increased costs associated with our cloud of transition. Energy and Specialized Markets revenue decreased 0.6% in the first quarter, due to declines in consulting and implementation projects and some modest headwinds related to consolidation in the end market. Growth in core research and environmental health and safety service revenues was offset by declines in transactional and consulting revenues. We attribute our performance to the diversification of our revenue streams into higher growth breakout areas like the energy transition and chemicals, the broad range of end markets that we serve and the strength of our relationships in the industry. Adjusted EBITDA grew 6.6% in the first quarter, while margins expanded 237 basis points, reflecting continued cost discipline and the benefit of lower travel expenses. As a key partner to our Energy customers, we are deeply engaged with them and part of their most strategic and important decisions. We have a track record of managing through volatile times effectively and believe we are well-positioned with our energy transition solutions, as well as our Lens platform to continue to outperform the end market and help our customers navigate this broad energy transition. Financial Services revenue declined 12.8% in the quarter, reflecting the continued impact of contract transitions that we undertook in 2020 and which will continue for the next two quarters, as well as lower levels of project spending from our bank customers, stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and fewer bankruptcies as a result of government support and forbearance programs. Adjusted EBITDA declined 74%, reflecting the negative impact of lower sales and a larger impact of corporate expense allocations on the segment\u2019s smaller base. We continue to make progress on our journey to transition Verisk Financial Services to a more sustainable subscription based business. We are achieving the goals we have set for the business and have taken actions that we believe benefits a business in the long run, but are likely to continue to negatively impact our growth over the next few quarters. To that end, given the continued impacts from COVID-19 and the contract transitions, we expect to see a similar level of revenue and profit performance in the second quarter of 2021. However, as the impact of the contract transitions abate and our COVID sensitive revenues improve, we anticipate a stronger back half of the year performance. Our reported effective tax rate was 22.5%, compared to 20.8% in the prior year quarter, mostly owing to lower stock option exercises in the current period. As we have discussed, there will likely continue to be some quarterly variability related to the impact of employee stock option exercises, which depends in part on the Verisk stock price and employee personal decisions. As a result of a tax law change in the U.K., we now believe that our full year tax rate for 2021 will be between 23% and 25%, up from the 20% to 22% we had previously provided. This U.K. legislation was passed in March and will increase the U.K. corporate tax rate to 25% from 19% previously. This U.K. tax rate increase is likely to create variability in our quarterly rates, as we expect we will be subject to a one-time non-cash revaluation charge in the third quarter related to a deferred tax liability when the bill was expected to become law. Our best estimate at this time is that our quarterly rate in the third quarter will be in the range of 33% to 35%. But we expect this to be primarily one-time in nature and do not anticipate a material long-term impact from this increase. Adjusted net income was $203 million and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.23 for the first quarter 2021, up 4.6% and 5.1% from the prior year, respectively. These increases reflect solid topline growth, cost discipline in the business, a reduction in travel expenses as a result of COVID-19 and a lower average share count. This was offset in part by a higher effective tax rate. Net cash provided by operating activities was $449 million for the quarter, up 24% from the prior year period, primarily due to increased customer collections and a reduction in travel payments as a result of COVID-19. Capital expenditures were $59 million for the quarter, up 12%. We continue to believe the CapEx will be in the range of $250 million to $280 million, reflecting our continued investment in our innovation agenda, our technological transformation, as well as the carryover of certain expenditures that were delayed in 2020 as a result of the pandemic. Related to capital expenditure, we expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization will be within the range of $200 million to $215 million. However, we now forecast intangible amortization to be approximately $180 million, reflecting the impact of recent acquisitions and changes in foreign currency rates. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to foreign exchange variability, the timing of purchases and the completion of projects and future M&A activity. During the first quarter, we returned $147 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In addition, in May, we repaid our 5.8% senior notes in the amount of $450 million through a combination of cash from operations and proceeds from our credit facility. Our strategy to deliver long-term sustainable growth remains unchanged and we believe the stability and predictability of our subscription revenues will persist. As we approach the anniversary of the onset of the pandemic, we plan to continue to provide updates on our non-COVID and COVID sensitive revenues to offer transparency on the recovery of our business. We remain confident the COVID impacts do not represent a structural change in our fundamental growth drivers and believe that as the underlying causal factors abate with the rollout of vaccinations and the opening of global economies, we will show strong resilience in recovery. We also have confidence in our ability to manage the cost structure effectively to protect profitability, that we would remind you that cost comparisons will be more challenging beginning in the second quarter. Taking this all together, we believe that as the COVID impacts abate, we can return to our long-term growth model of 7% organic constant currency revenue growth, with core operating leverage allowing EBITDA to grow faster than revenue, although it\u2019s difficult to predict that timing. We hope this provides some useful context for you and we look forward to addressing your questions. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk, given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I\u2019ll ask the Operator to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have our first question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks a lot. I was hoping, Scott, that you could give us an update on the renewables business. I know you touched on it in the prepared remarks. But I guess how big is it now? What are the fastest growing areas within it? And what -- what\u2019s proprietary within the renewables and energy transition? Thanks.\nScott Stephenson: Right. So it -- what we do in the renewables area, Toni, is across a very broad front. So it is everything from solar to wind to biomass. What differentiates us is a couple of things. One is we believe that we actually have unique data about really the supply side of those industries. In addition to that, we\u2019re able to relate the developments in that part of the energy ecosystem to the rest of the energy ecosystem. And that\u2019s really critical, because that is what all the players in the in the energy space want to do, including the traditional hydrocarbon-based players. They are all very, very interested in how they modify who they are in order to move into this future. And then on top of all of that, we believe that we have the best platform analytic environment going in Lens, which permits us to put all of this wonderful content into our customers decisioning workflows in a really easy to consume and we believe differentiated way.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you.\nScott Stephenson: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. I was just wondering as things are opening up here and you guys get a little bit more visibility. Just longer term, I guess, I wanted to just understand, how you guys think about that 7% growth targets for your entire company? I was just curious, like, if anything has changed if you need to kind of revisit that target?\nScott Stephenson: Yeah. Nothing has changed in our perspective on that Manav. One of the things that and I sort of referenced this in my comments upfront, but we are watching very carefully the results we\u2019re producing in 2021, both the -- what we deemed the COVID sensitive revenues, but also the non-COVID sensitive revenues and those would relate more to the subscription products that we have. And actually we see good progress in the performance of those and actually they really have been the most steady part of our performance over the last several quarters. And we also referenced our pipelines, both renewals, as well as new product -- new sales opportunities. And as I mentioned in my comments up front, we have some of the strongest pipelines we\u2019ve ever had. And our focus is so very definitely on subscription-based solutions. So the context from my answer to your question is, that\u2019s where we\u2019re focused. Those are in good shape. They have been in good shape through the pandemic and we think that they will remain on that track going forward.\nLee Shavel: And Manav, it\u2019s Lee, if I could just add to that. One thing that I think gave us confidence on the resilience of the growth rates, well, that -- was the overall performance of our non-COVID sensitive revenues through this period, that we maintain stability there, and in a lot of cases, given some of the value of our data and workflow-oriented products in this more remote environment. In some ways, I think, as we come out of this, it has accelerated some opportunities for us for the deployment of our data and analytics into these new environments.\nManav Patnaik: Okay. Understood. And then just on the breakout area investment, we -- I think you\u2019ve talked about kind of the ROIC and metrics and so forth before, but I was just curious from -- what time parameters do you put when you even make those decisions, like, how much of the long-term investment or do you have certain criteria that it has to return within a couple of years, et cetera? I was just curious if you could talk a little bit about that.\nScott Stephenson: Yeah. Lee, that\u2019s kind of into our work papers on how we look at the many investment opportunities we\u2019ve got. So maybe you want to talk to that?\nLee Shavel: Yeah. Manav, thanks for the question. And I think as you can appreciate that we -- when we look at that investment portfolio, we think of it in that regard, where we have a wide range of products with different time horizons and different levels of kind of risk associated with them, some earlier stage business opportunities, some later stage. We do try to manage those naturally in the country -- overall to deliver on return clearly in excess of our cost of capital and for higher risk, smaller projects at a level well above that at some premium reflecting that higher risk. And I would say that, on average, this of course, is going to vary from project-to-project. But we\u2019re generally looking to achieve those types of returns on a three-year to four-year timeframe in order to get to an acceptable return with upside on beyond that. That\u2019s the general parameters of the portfolio. And I think we also want to make it clear that that is not just internal investment or external investment in M&A, we are evaluating the utilization of capital against both of those investment opportunities. Certainly, on the internal investment, the opportunities to leverage our existing assets and our position in infrastructure are substantially enable us to deliver higher returns we expect, but on lower investments. On the M&A front, they are larger investments from a skill standpoint, but we are clearly focusing on how we are adding value to those and the success that we\u2019ve had with the life -- the FAST acquisition, with the Genscape acquisition, with a acquisition in our 3E area are all evidence of our ability to deliver value either through reduced costs or improved functionality of those businesses. So, hopefully, that gives you some context in how we look at both the internal and the external investment and some of the benchmarks that we use.\nManav Patnaik: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We have our next question comes from the line of David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good morning. Bridging to Manav\u2019s question, what are your current capital allocation priorities among acquisitions and share repurchase when you evaluate those two at current prices and valuations? And then third would be dividend growth?\nScott Stephenson: Yeah. So I\u2019m glad you added that last bit, David, because we have multiple forms for returning capital to shareholders. But even before that, I would really emphasize investment into the business to build these engines of growth. We -- you hear us talking all the time about platforms analytic environments. They are really the source of so many forms of goodness in terms of value for customers and the result of them is that we have much stickier relationships, which are just that much more recurrent. So I would -- so if I was to prioritize our use of capital, I would actually start with internal investment, which is a genuine focal point. We\u2019re very happy to return capital to shareholders. We have a long track record of doing that and we feel very good about that. And with respect to M&A, Lee, was already talking about kind of how we look at it. I mean, it\u2019s not as if we\u2019ve earmark some number of dollars or percentage of total capital available to go into M&A. They\u2019ve -- it\u2019s more a question with that third leg of whether or not the opportunity is compelling and meets our return hurdles. And we are definitely emphasizing that which in combination with what we -- who we already are, the whole becomes greater than the sum of the parts.\nLee Shavel: And David, it\u2019s interesting that you -- the -- and it\u2019s not uncommon for folks to make a comparison between share repurchases and M&A. I will tell you that we think of it differently in that, we view M&A as more akin and evaluate it relative to our internal investment, because both of them are capital investments that we\u2019re making to generate return for shareholders. And both of those are subject to our return thresholds that we think are necessary to create value. And then if we are unable to find return opportunities in either of those and I want to emphasize, Scott\u2019s point, we think there are -- one of the strengths of Verisk is the breadth and the depth of opportunity for us to invest internally in new products at very high incremental returns across a broad range of client driven opportunities in our industry sectors. But similarly, we see our other opportunities on the M&A front. If we don\u2019t see acceptable returns in either of those ventures, then we view share repurchases as with dividends an opportunity to return capital that we can\u2019t create value from in terms of higher returns. And then, finally, with regard to dividends, the -- as you have seen, we have established a pattern of increasing that dividend that becomes -- that remains subject to the Board\u2019s view on the dividend increase. But there is a recognition that companies that have demonstrated an ability to deliver consistent growth in the dividend over time are rewarded for that discipline. We believe that it has introduced a valuable additional component to our investor base, as more yield oriented investors that are looking for both growth and yield have been very additive to our shareholder base and so we think that that is a useful additional component in our capital return strategy.\nDavid Togut: Thanks very much. Appreciate it, Lee and Scott.\nScott Stephenson: You bet.\nOperator: We have our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Financial Services revenues are continuing to see the impact of contract transitions, which you know that will continue for the next two quarters. Is it possible to parse out how much impact is coming from contract transitions and how much is due to core reduced spending from banks and fewer bankruptcies?\nScott Stephenson: Yes. George, thanks for the question. We estimate that the impact of the contract transitions in the first quarter was approximately two-thirds of the of the revenue decline that we saw on a year-over-year basis. And as you know, this is something that will cycle through, we believe that those contract transitions, I would just remind folks represented in part, a rebalancing of our relationship with several of those contracts, shifting in our general strategy to move from less upfront revenues to more revenues extended over the relationship. So it reflects that. There is some upside in future periods that that balance that impact. But the short answer is, in the quarter it was about two thirds of the impact. And as you mentioned, we expect that impact to be to follow for the next two quarters.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. Very helpful. And just to follow-up, on the cost side, you mentioned that cost comparisons will be tougher in 2Q. How much in expenses do you expect to come back in the coming quarters?\nLee Shavel: So, yeah, George, thanks for the question. I appreciate what you\u2019re looking for. It\u2019s hard to quantify, I guess, I would approach it this way. One way to think of it as clearly we had a benefit from T&E of the reductions of the elimination of travel and we have described what the impact is from a margin standpoint of that, for instance, 150 basis points in the -- in this quarter. And we would expect that we would continue to see that benefit and so we will see an increase in T&E expenses, but I think that\u2019s going to be a gradual increase over time. The other element is going to be compensation and our incentive compensation in particular, where we\u2019re going to see a more normalized level. As we saw in 2020, the responsiveness of our compensation, particularly incentive compensation flex down. We are expecting a more normalized return, so we\u2019ll see some increase in that. Plus we are also beginning to normalize headcount, as we see demand from the businesses to support their overall growth. So there are a lot of factors. But as we move through 2021, one way to think about it is in reference to 2020. 2020 we saw the revenue impact, but we saw expenses decline more than the revenue impact driving EBITDA growth of nearly 10% over that period. In 2021, I think, we\u2019re going to see a recovery in revenue, but as we look at those comparisons, we will see higher expense growth. We still expect to be able to deliver EBITDA growth, but it will be driven by the pace of expense growth, fortunately, which remains within our control. So our hope is that we will be able to manage that expense growth on the T&E, on the compensation front in terms of headcount growth in order to continue to deliver growth, although not naturally at the same level that we were able to achieve in 2020. Another way to think of it is that, we do expect that that dynamic will drive some reduction in margin, but we still are expecting to be able to retain, as we\u2019ve said in the past, some meaningful level of the efficiencies that we achieved in 2020. I hope that gives you some direction towards your question, George.\nGeorge Tong: Yes. Very helpful. Thank you, Lee.\nOperator: We have our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nAlex Kramm: Yes. Hey. Good morning, everyone. Maybe just starting on the Energy business, not sure if I missed it? But clearly, trends have gotten better. You sound pretty optimistic about Energy transition in pipeline here. Does that basically mean you think the business has bottomed or are you still cautious in terms of the next few quarters? Maybe the broader cyclical impact could still be negative?\nScott Stephenson: Yeah. I\u2019ll just go back something that we\u2019ve said for a long period of time, which is, for business, in the Energy sector, in general to perform, we just need a normal environment. We don\u2019t need a roaring commodity price. We just need a normal kind of environment. And our view is that that\u2019s more or less where the system has gotten to?\nLee Shavel: And I would say, Alex, I think, we\u2019re encouraged by what we are experiencing both in the sales pipeline and in the consulting pipeline. We\u2019re also encouraged by the receptivity of our clients on two of the Lens platform as they are interacting with it and as they\u2019re using it. They are clearly seeing the value that we are adding to the data and the research products that we\u2019ve provided before. So, clearly, there is a lot of risk ahead as we manage through the pandemic. But we are seeing -- we think very constructive signs based upon the level of engagement we have so far.\nAlex Kramm: Okay. That\u2019s fair. And then secondarily, a little bit more holistic question, but Lee, obviously, the Energy and the Financials business started reporting to you I think it\u2019s been now three months. Not a long time, but three months nonetheless. And I think last quarter, when asked about the business mix, Scott sounded a little bit more open to holistically review the portfolio. So just wondering, Lee and maybe Scott to as you have maybe dug deeper into those businesses, any early findings, any areas for improvement or any things where you\u2019re saying, hey, this is maybe not as good of a fit than we thought historically. So any updates will be helpful on that front? Thank you.\nScott Stephenson: Well, why don\u2019t I start, but Lee, I think questions kind of directed to you and your oversight. But I\u2019ll just say that there is a playbook at Verisk, which when it is in place works very, very well. And that playbook is really centered on creating what we call platform to analytic environments and analytic objects, which become industry standard analyzed output. And the more that we feature those in the mix of what we do, in any part of Verisk the business becomes very sticky, very resilient, grows well, represents a lot of value for customers. And I\u2019ll just say that and I\u2019m going to pick Financial Services in particular, the focus here at the moment is, first of all, make sure that we capture all the COVID sensitive revenues as the environment changes, make sure that we capture all those revenues back into the mix, one. And two is the continued development of the platforms inside of Verisk financial that will represent that same kind of Verisk ways, the Verisk model really for joint business. And that\u2019s really what we\u2019re focused on and -- in the near-term and we\u2019re expected about both of those things as it relates to the business so that with respect to VFS and particularly. Lee, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything to that.\nLee Shavel: Yeah. I do. Alex, thanks for the question. And I would say just briefly really it is still early. I\u2019m spending a lot of time with both the Financial Services and the Energy business and really drilling into complement because of a top-down view from a financials, the bottoms up focus on products, on clients, on people to understand the underlying economics of the business. And one, I think observation that it\u2019s worth pointing out is that, of course, what\u2019s happening at those businesses is not wholly represented in what you see within the quarter. We\u2019ve talked about the contract transitions that while clearly a negative impact in this quarter represent very strong progress in the objective that we have on the management team and there has been moving very concertedly towards improving that base and I continue to work with them to evaluate what that broader opportunity is and what the sustainable growth rate for profitability and value is for over the long-term as I do with the Energy business. So we\u2019re actively engaged in it. I would just ask for everyone\u2019s patience as we work through that and evaluate the business as a whole rather than focusing on the specific quarter\u2019s results, but that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing.\nAlex Kramm: Very good. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: We have our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nGreg Peters: Good morning. I was wondering if you could provide some updated views on the changing competitive dynamics in the Insurance space, especially when we hear about or hearing more about the success of these software companies like Duck Creek and Guidewire. It seems like these companies are selling competitive -- competing services, we hear them talking about their claims management platform, their underwriting platforms, their reinsurance capabilities, it seems to be gathering some momentum in the Insurance vertical. So maybe you can provide some color around market share for Verisk versus these other companies or how you\u2019re working with these companies.\nScott Stephenson: Well, Lee, you want to take one.\nLee Shavel: Sure. Well, first of all, thanks for the question. I think what our customers are looking for these, our Insurance customers, they are looking for an interconnected ecosystem a way to pull information, a way to pull and process it seamless way. So we are very tightly aligned with a Duck Creek and a Guidewire. As an example, all of our ISO loss cost renewals, meaning, the way we codify rates is inside of both Duck Creek and Guidewire. We pull -- customers able to pull underwriting information from us through those two platforms. Claims fraud, same thing, we are integrated in a way that we are partners. So there is a way that we partner very effectively, but at the same time, the world is heading towards the analytics, Duck Creek, Guidewire as an example are doing more analytics probably more focused on the individual insurer information as the process to claim look like over the last quarter. How the rates looked for that insurer of last quarter. Where we tend to focus is we have aggregated view of the industry. So our analytics is more benchmark, its rollout to other peers. It\u2019s an industry view. Let me also remind you that as we think about software, we\u2019re becoming more software intense. So, Sequel software had been moving into United States, becoming certainly more a global player beyond the London market. So I think there is some more overlap with the two, but we continue to work together to satisfy customers. So, hopefully, that\u2019s responsive to the software play and I\u2019ll just highlight because of the nature of our industry standard programs, we\u2019re integrated with almost every policy and vendors. We are kind of across the Board. So we\u2019ll continue to do that to share our content with any insurer or reinsurance that needs it.\nGreg Peters: Got it. And then my follow-up question would just be pivot back to some comments, I think, we made earlier regarding just sort of the long-term targets around organic revenue growth and then EBITDA 7% and then EBITDA growing a little bit faster. I was wondering if you have a similar viewpoint or the Board has a similar viewpoint around free cash flow?\nScott Stephenson: Yeah. I don\u2019t see over the long-term a significant gap between the EBITDA -- the revenue and EBITDA growth rates and the -- and our cash flow. The two should be fairly consistent, obviously lot of variables that from a timing standpoint may influence that, but as kind of core growth rates. I don\u2019t see a substantial difference there.\nGreg Peters: Got it. Thanks for the answers.\nOperator: We have our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from Truist Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hi. Good morning. Appreciate you taking the question. As we see the greater digitization of insurance and more lifecycle solutions. I wonder if Verisk sees an opportunity in payments as far as supporting disbursements from the carriers to the insured?\nScott Stephenson: So thank you for the question and thank you for the look forward. We have recently introduced VeriskPay and we do believe that in this kind of world of interconnectivity automation electronic payments are going to factor into that. The places where we started was the places where we thought most weekly integrate into our solutions. So think of our exactly solution, which is representative as repair cost estimates and payment of property damage, and also in the world of real estate where we do some similar work and we feel that those electronic payments could facilitate, thanks for our customers. We\u2019re working with a big partner Pfizer and we hope to extend the use cases beyond claims and into some premium and other places like subrogation where we think that our insurance customers will benefit\nAndrew Jeffrey: Great. I look forward to learning more.\nOperator: We have our next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJeff Meuler: Thank you. Good morning. I want to ask about Insurance and I know the growth rates kind of in the typical pretty tight range, but it decelerated, so I heard a call out on cat bond issuance. I think I also heard something about some end market consolidation to me the cat bond issuances just more naturally variable quarter-to-quarter, the consolidation would be something that would take longer to recover from, so just any help parsing out between those factors? And then on the growth driver side is ISO pricing this calendar year similar to prior calendar years. And I heard you on pipeline, Scott, I guess, how is pipeline conversion and bookings especially for those strategically important platformed analytic environments and analytic objects?\nScott Stephenson: Yeah. So maybe I can start at the top it. Mark, you should come in real quick on especially the first part of Jeff\u2019s question. Thanks for the questions, Jeff. Yeah. I mean the -- most of the selling effort goes where we have the priority and the priority is on these, as just as you said, the platform to analytic environments, the analytic objects. So that is the majority of the pipeline and so all of those comments about contract length stretching out and the depth of the pipeline that applies fully for that part of the product suite. So there is no real differentiation there. When you look quarter -- when you look year-over-year on cat bond insurance, Q1 2020 was strong quarter. Q1 2021 was a strong quarter. We pay a lot of attention to that, cat bond issuance has picked up since the first quarter. So we don\u2019t see anything different in the environment, it was just really kind of moment in time. Mark, anything you want to add on that?\nMark Anquillare: I think the only thing I\u2019ll go to some of our traditional ISO information and that is again rock solid with customers. If you were to look at the way we kind of think about this, remember we\u2019re taking a long-term view. We would prefer to gather new sales from new solutions and customers as opposed to kind of past artificially high price increases. So, I think, we remain pretty modest in kind of the way we handle pricing price ISO. And you are correct, we did highlight some industry consolidation, which doesn\u2019t necessarily one plus one doesn\u2019t equal one, but sometimes equals like about 1.8 in the way. Some of our pricing algorithms work. So that was a headwind for the year, yes,\nScott Stephenson: There is no change to the pricing algorithm itself\u2026\nMark Anquillare: I know.\nScott Stephenson: \u2026 in 2021.\nMark Anquillare: Thank you.\nJeff Meuler: Got it. And then a question on the expense management approach in financial services, it seems like revenue is kind of rebasing lower for a period of time and I think you said that Q2 profitability should be similar to Q1, which was fairly depressed I guess in my eyes. So are you taking expenses out of the business or does it need to start growing again to start getting margins back up? Thanks\nLee Shavel: Yeah. Thanks Jeff. And certainly understand the questions. And so on the revenue front, we naturally have that impact of the contract on transitions. A part of that are contracts that -- are not there going forward. But as I indicated, there also is a component where revenue has shifted into future periods. So it\u2019s not a -- I wouldn\u2019t describe it as a complete rebasing or elimination of that. But the other factor or some of the COVID sensitive revenues that we have seen the impact, we\u2019ve talked about bankruptcy. We\u2019ve talked about spend-informed analytics. We\u2019re actually seeing some stronger improvement on the spend-informed analytics as things open up. So hopefully if that continues, we\u2019ll see strength in that regard. And of course, we\u2019re also watching the bankruptcy very carefully and then the overall performance of the banks, which are doing well and hopefully that translates into greater opportunities on the analytics and the consulting front. On the expense front, yes, in the quarter, we had probably a heavier load of expense than we typically have. And so looking ahead, we would anticipate and not as heavy an expense impact. And we are looking at making adjustments from an expense management standpoint that will help us avoid or offset the margin impact that we experienced in the first quarter.\nJeff Meuler: Got it. Thank you all.\nOperator: We have our next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Steinerman: Okay. Great. Lee, two questions, beyond the cap bond volatility in industry consolidation that you just recently mentioned, could you list any other drivers of why Verisk organic revenue growth on its non-COVID business that\u2019s the 85% of revenues decelerated to 4.9% in the first quarter versus 6.5% in the fourth quarter? Let me just kind of put out my other question too, it\u2019s the question about 2021 EBITDA margins. Lee in the last two quarters you mentioned a comment about 2021 EBITDA margins relative to 2020 and 2019. Just could you update your comments and is there any year that the margins are likely to be closer to this year?\nLee Shavel: Yeah. And thank you, Andrew. I mean, I just want to clarify, you were addressing the question of both at a consolidated level?\nAndrew Steinerman: Yeah.\nLee Shavel: Is that correct?\nAndrew Steinerman: Consolidated. Yeah.\nLee Shavel: Yeah. So I think we did describe that, the primary impacts as you\u2019ve indicated in terms of the catastrophe bond impact and some of the consolidation impacts. Naturally you can look at the other -- the performance of the other business units from a revenue standpoint in Financial Services in particular with the contract transitions and the COVID sensitive. I think from an Energy and Specialized Markets, it was kind of relatively flat quarter. So I would probably just point out that Financial Services clearly had a contribution to the overall growth rate in that regard. And as to your question on margin, I\u2019m going to kind of go back to the way I answered a previous question, which was that clearly we saw the margin benefit in 2020 resulting from or the reduction of expenses to a greater degree than the decline in revenues and looking ahead to 2021 where we will be coming out of this. We are expecting some revenue growth improvement, but that probably will be exceeded by the normalization of expenses. However, if you think about the responsiveness or the growth rates of those two lines, we are expecting that the rate of recovery from an expense standpoint will be slower, meaning that we will hope to hold on to some of that margin benefit that we experienced in 2020, but not all of it.\nAndrew Steinerman: Okay.\nLee Shavel: So that is I think the outcome of our expectations at this point kind of looking -- kind of reiterating that we are expecting that our margin still will be above where they were pre-pandemic, but will probably come down as those -- as the expenses normalize.\nAndrew Steinerman: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We have our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nHamzah Mazari: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. My question is around the international business within Insurance. I think a couple of years ago, you guys had flagged that you expected that business, I guess it was growing high-single digits and you expected it to double organically in five years? I think that was a couple of Analyst Days ago. And maybe I think you guys had flagged U.K., Ireland and Canada, Germany, France, India, Southeast Asia as future growth. So maybe just update us how big is international today as part of the total offering in Insurance? And then which countries are you sort of under versus over penetrated and where is the opportunity?\nMark Anquillare: Thank you for the question. This is Mark. So let me kind of give you a quick summary. So, first of all, good recollection of the overview that we provided. If I would now grade ourselves on where we are at that I would say from a U.K. perspective and Ireland we are well ahead of that plan. I think we are doing extremely well and I think we\u2019ve highlighted some of the benefits of the Sequel acquisition and just the progress that\u2019s been made there along with some of the work that we\u2019ve done on the claims and underwriting front. As we think about other regions, we did highlight France and Germany. And I would say there it\u2019s been a tougher sledding. We were looking for a combination of organic access, as well as moving into maybe some businesses that provide services there. I think from an M&A perspective. I think we\u2019ve done well from a cat bond perspective, cat modeling perspective. So there strong rates just probably less progress with some of the other underwriting and claims in that like France and Germany field. I think we kind of had talked about Asia-Pacific is more long-term. I\u2019m not sure I can comment on that. That\u2019s probably still on the horizon. So thank you for the question and I think it give ourselves overall strong grades.\nHamzah Mazari: Great. And just my follow-up question and you touched on it, Lee, a little bit on the timeframe in evaluating the Non-Insurance segment, but do you sort of have any high level color if that Financial Services business has changed structurally. I know a while back, and Lee, I know you weren\u2019t there at that time. But the healthcare business has structurally changed and the government had gotten more involved. The business wasn\u2019t as a global and there were some other items. As you look at this business with new competition or other stuff maybe diversifying away from banking customers has been slower. Do you have a sense of a timeframe wise is that sort of you\u2019re still looking into that or do you guys have a pretty good view there already?\nLee Shavel: And so, Hamzah, I think -- thank you for the question. And I think there are -- there was an external perspective and an internal perspective, if you\u2019re asking about the structural has the business changed structurally. And I think your primary question is from an external standpoint. And I would say that the presence of other players that serve that banking -- the banking industry particularly as it relates to cards, it remains -- has remained relatively consistent, the large players whether the credit bureaus or the network companies are there, they serve that industry. And the Verisk Financial Services entity has for a long time competed very successfully within that environment, given the very unique nature of the dataset and the unique relationships that they have with the industry and they provide a service by integrating that data set and delivering it in a way that others aren\u2019t able to do. And so I don\u2019t believe that there has been a material change, but we are mindful of the competitive environment that they operate in. From the other perspective from a structural change, I can say unequivocally that we have changed and improved the business in shifting it to more of a sustainable focus on growth within the business with the steps that the management team has made. Some of those have had obviously a up a challenging financial impact in the short-term, but we believe that the business is better positioned for the long-term given those structural changes. So I want to do address both parts of those questions.\nHamzah Mazari: That\u2019s great. Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nGary Bisbee: Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to go back to some earlier commentary on the Energy business. Scott, I think you said, you just need sort of a normal market environment, not necessarily a robust one to deliver to your goals in the business. I guess I wanted to ask, what is it you would expect to deliver in a normal environment. In the five years you\u2019ve own the business it\u2019s grown 7% once and not grown a couple of those years and so it\u2019s just not clear to me that this business is positioned particularly given the volatility inherent in the end market to deliver to the long-term revenue growth targets you\u2019ve set for the company and on a number of occasions actually said this business should outperform those over the long-term growth faster than some of your other assets. So what is it you\u2019re playing for in a normal Energy market if we\u2019re moving back into that today? Thank you.\nScott Stephenson: Yeah. You bet Gary. Thank you for the question. Yeah. When you sit and actually related to the way that we was responding to that prior question about Financial Services. So if you kind of get to the top of sort of our business and that ecosystem. What you\u2019re looking at is global customers that are large that are facing challenging issues in terms of how they\u2019re going to run their businesses in the future. Our calling increasingly upon data analytics to try to help these very, very important decisions and have only a few places that they can turn to outside of their own four walls in order to find support with respect to the kind of data analytics that they want to make the commercial decisions that they need to make. And then I would add to that one other point, which is the range of topics and the ecosystem that that can be covered. And those have really expanded in light of the Energy transition. And there was an earlier question about what do we do with respect to renewables. But I would point out also that in the Energy space, there is a great sensitivity to topics of climate change and so our ability to also observe on things like emissions is an important capability and a distinct capability. And so the summation of all of that for me Gary would be that, if you\u2019re right about the track record. I would point out in -- over the course of the last five years, there have been two relatively unprecedented shocks to the pricing of the commodity and I\u2019m not here to predict that there can\u2019t be any more of those, but they were pretty unusual and in a relatively compressed period of time. Against that I would put a very large global market with increasing appetite for data analytics of the kind that we provide. And so my summary and all of that would be that I look for this business to contribute at or above the targets we had as a company overall, we\u2019re going to hold it to that standard, so that\u2019s really it.\nGary Bisbee: Yeah. And then just one quick follow-up for, Lee, that -- a couple of years ago you had -- the company had discussed sort of a glide path lower in capital intensity, now of course, I think that was in large part on the Geomni business at the time and since then you\u2019ve stepped up technology investment considerably? I guess I\u2019m just wondering, if you can level that for us today, how are you thinking about capital intensity over the next few years as you get through more of the cloud projects should we, is the goal still that that moderates a couple of points lower over time or where are you at now? Thank you.\nLee Shavel: Yeah. Thank you, Gary. And so the short answer is, yes, and it is a function as you\u2019ve described of our migration to the cloud, which is reducing the level of CapEx that we would have typically spent on hardware in infrastructure. Now offsetting that, but we still think it\u2019s not completely offsetting that benefit is an increasing level of internal software development intensity, which is a function of some of the trends that Mark was talking about in terms of utilizing software opportunity as a way to activate and deliver our datasets and provide solutions for our clients. And so that is clearly an element that we think is added to our business, it\u2019s generating good returns. We never want the CapEx intensity metric to obscure our fundamental return objectives. So we do expect to see that improvement over time. It has probably been obscured by some of the real estate renovations that we have done recently that are included in that. But we are realizing real benefits in terms of reductions in CapEx and even OpEx, and expenses related to infrastructure as a result of that. And some of those are being reinvested in some of the software development elements as we develop that component of our -- of the delivery of our datasets.\nGary Bisbee: Thank you. That\u2019s helpful.\nOperator: And there are no further questions. I\u2019ll turn back the call over to you, Stacey.\nStacey Brodbar: Okay. Well, thank you everybody for joining us. Appreciate all the questions and the dialog and we will certainly as always be following up with many of you following this call. So thank you for the continued interest and support. We\u2019ll speak with you soon. Bye for today.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you all for participating and you may now disconnect. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Lee Shavel",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. Additionally, you may notice that we have a slightly new presentation of our financial statements. As Scott mentioned earlier during the quarter, we closed on a majority investment in Whitespace Software. As a result, we now report net income and earnings per share attributable to Verisk. Moving to the financial results for the first quarter. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 5.3% to $726 million, net income attributable to Verisk decreased 1.8% to $169 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share attributable to Verisk declined 1% to $1.03, reflecting a $19 million gain on dispositions in the prior year that did not reoccur. Moving to our organic constant currency results, adjusted for non-operating items as defined in the non-GAAP Financial Measures section of our press release. We were very pleased with our operating results considering the continued impact from COVID-19. In the first quarter, organic constant currency revenue grew 3.4% led by continued to strengthen our Insurance segment and modest sequential improvement in our Energy segment. This quarters' performance fundamentally reflected a year-over-year comparison to a largely pre-pandemic quarter, although we began to see progress in our COVID sensitive revenues, which improved sequentially. Our non-COVID sensitive revenues as we defined at the start of the pandemic grew approximately 4.9% on an organic constant currency basis, down from 6.5% rate in the fourth quarter, reflecting a lower level of catastrophe bond securitization activity at AIR and a higher level of impact from consolidation in the Insurance and Energy segments. We did continue to experience as we have since the onset of the pandemic, a negative impact from COVID-19 on certain of our products and services, largely transactional in nature, which represent the balance or approximately 15% of our revenues. However, we saw an improvement as certain of these products and services returned to growth on a year-over-year basis. COVID sensitive revenues declined approximately 5.9% on an organic constant currency basis during the first quarter, compared to the 12.5% decline in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of improved consulting activity in our Energy sector, but also reflecting a return to growth of several products and services, particularly in the U.S. Despite the impact on revenue in the first quarter, we are pleased to report that we delivered solid EBITDA growth and expanded margins as a result of effective expense management and lower travel expenses. Organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth was 5.2% in the first quarter, up from 4.9% growth in the fourth quarter. Total adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter, which includes both organic and inorganic revenue and adjusted EBITDA was 47.6% in the quarter, representing leverage across our Insurance and Energy verticals offset in part by weakness in Financial Services. This margin level includes roughly 150 basis points of benefit from lower travel expenses, but also reflects a return to a more normal pace of headcount growth and an increase in the pace of investment in our technological transformation, including our cloud transition costs. On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. In the first quarter, Insurance segment revenues increased 6%, reflecting healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, catastrophe modeling solutions, repair cost estimating solutions and insurance software solutions. We experienced a modest benefit from storm related revenues as a result of the ice storms in Texas and the Southeast. However, this was more than offset by lower level of securitization revenues in our catastrophe modeling business as issuance was lowered year-over-year. In addition, we experienced declines in certain transactional revenues that were negatively impacted by COVID-19, as we had very minimal COVID impact in the first quarter of 2020. Adjusted EBITDA grew 8.3% in the first quarter, while margins expanded 196 basis points, demonstrating strong margin expansion, despite certain revenue declines, investment in our breakout areas and increased costs associated with our cloud of transition. Energy and Specialized Markets revenue decreased 0.6% in the first quarter, due to declines in consulting and implementation projects and some modest headwinds related to consolidation in the end market. Growth in core research and environmental health and safety service revenues was offset by declines in transactional and consulting revenues. We attribute our performance to the diversification of our revenue streams into higher growth breakout areas like the energy transition and chemicals, the broad range of end markets that we serve and the strength of our relationships in the industry. Adjusted EBITDA grew 6.6% in the first quarter, while margins expanded 237 basis points, reflecting continued cost discipline and the benefit of lower travel expenses. As a key partner to our Energy customers, we are deeply engaged with them and part of their most strategic and important decisions. We have a track record of managing through volatile times effectively and believe we are well-positioned with our energy transition solutions, as well as our Lens platform to continue to outperform the end market and help our customers navigate this broad energy transition. Financial Services revenue declined 12.8% in the quarter, reflecting the continued impact of contract transitions that we undertook in 2020 and which will continue for the next two quarters, as well as lower levels of project spending from our bank customers, stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and fewer bankruptcies as a result of government support and forbearance programs. Adjusted EBITDA declined 74%, reflecting the negative impact of lower sales and a larger impact of corporate expense allocations on the segment's smaller base. We continue to make progress on our journey to transition Verisk Financial Services to a more sustainable subscription based business. We are achieving the goals we have set for the business and have taken actions that we believe benefits a business in the long run, but are likely to continue to negatively impact our growth over the next few quarters. To that end, given the continued impacts from COVID-19 and the contract transitions, we expect to see a similar level of revenue and profit performance in the second quarter of 2021. However, as the impact of the contract transitions abate and our COVID sensitive revenues improve, we anticipate a stronger back half of the year performance. Our reported effective tax rate was 22.5%, compared to 20.8% in the prior year quarter, mostly owing to lower stock option exercises in the current period. As we have discussed, there will likely continue to be some quarterly variability related to the impact of employee stock option exercises, which depends in part on the Verisk stock price and employee personal decisions. As a result of a tax law change in the U.K., we now believe that our full year tax rate for 2021 will be between 23% and 25%, up from the 20% to 22% we had previously provided. This U.K. legislation was passed in March and will increase the U.K. corporate tax rate to 25% from 19% previously. This U.K. tax rate increase is likely to create variability in our quarterly rates, as we expect we will be subject to a one-time non-cash revaluation charge in the third quarter related to a deferred tax liability when the bill was expected to become law. Our best estimate at this time is that our quarterly rate in the third quarter will be in the range of 33% to 35%. But we expect this to be primarily one-time in nature and do not anticipate a material long-term impact from this increase. Adjusted net income was $203 million and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.23 for the first quarter 2021, up 4.6% and 5.1% from the prior year, respectively. These increases reflect solid topline growth, cost discipline in the business, a reduction in travel expenses as a result of COVID-19 and a lower average share count. This was offset in part by a higher effective tax rate. Net cash provided by operating activities was $449 million for the quarter, up 24% from the prior year period, primarily due to increased customer collections and a reduction in travel payments as a result of COVID-19. Capital expenditures were $59 million for the quarter, up 12%. We continue to believe the CapEx will be in the range of $250 million to $280 million, reflecting our continued investment in our innovation agenda, our technological transformation, as well as the carryover of certain expenditures that were delayed in 2020 as a result of the pandemic. Related to capital expenditure, we expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization will be within the range of $200 million to $215 million. However, we now forecast intangible amortization to be approximately $180 million, reflecting the impact of recent acquisitions and changes in foreign currency rates. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to foreign exchange variability, the timing of purchases and the completion of projects and future M&A activity. During the first quarter, we returned $147 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In addition, in May, we repaid our 5.8% senior notes in the amount of $450 million through a combination of cash from operations and proceeds from our credit facility. Our strategy to deliver long-term sustainable growth remains unchanged and we believe the stability and predictability of our subscription revenues will persist. As we approach the anniversary of the onset of the pandemic, we plan to continue to provide updates on our non-COVID and COVID sensitive revenues to offer transparency on the recovery of our business. We remain confident the COVID impacts do not represent a structural change in our fundamental growth drivers and believe that as the underlying causal factors abate with the rollout of vaccinations and the opening of global economies, we will show strong resilience in recovery. We also have confidence in our ability to manage the cost structure effectively to protect profitability, that we would remind you that cost comparisons will be more challenging beginning in the second quarter. Taking this all together, we believe that as the COVID impacts abate, we can return to our long-term growth model of 7% organic constant currency revenue growth, with core operating leverage allowing EBITDA to grow faster than revenue, although it's difficult to predict that timing. We hope this provides some useful context for you and we look forward to addressing your questions. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk, given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I'll ask the Operator to open the line for questions. And Manav, it's Lee, if I could just add to that. One thing that I think gave us confidence on the resilience of the growth rates, well, that -- was the overall performance of our non-COVID sensitive revenues through this period, that we maintain stability there, and in a lot of cases, given some of the value of our data and workflow-oriented products in this more remote environment. In some ways, I think, as we come out of this, it has accelerated some opportunities for us for the deployment of our data and analytics into these new environments. Yeah. Manav, thanks for the question. And I think as you can appreciate that we -- when we look at that investment portfolio, we think of it in that regard, where we have a wide range of products with different time horizons and different levels of kind of risk associated with them, some earlier stage business opportunities, some later stage. We do try to manage those naturally in the country -- overall to deliver on return clearly in excess of our cost of capital and for higher risk, smaller projects at a level well above that at some premium reflecting that higher risk. And I would say that, on average, this of course, is going to vary from project-to-project. But we're generally looking to achieve those types of returns on a three-year to four-year timeframe in order to get to an acceptable return with upside on beyond that. That's the general parameters of the portfolio. And I think we also want to make it clear that that is not just internal investment or external investment in M&A, we are evaluating the utilization of capital against both of those investment opportunities. Certainly, on the internal investment, the opportunities to leverage our existing assets and our position in infrastructure are substantially enable us to deliver higher returns we expect, but on lower investments. On the M&A front, they are larger investments from a skill standpoint, but we are clearly focusing on how we are adding value to those and the success that we've had with the life -- the FAST acquisition, with the Genscape acquisition, with a acquisition in our 3E area are all evidence of our ability to deliver value either through reduced costs or improved functionality of those businesses. So, hopefully, that gives you some context in how we look at both the internal and the external investment and some of the benchmarks that we use. And David, it's interesting that you -- the -- and it's not uncommon for folks to make a comparison between share repurchases and M&A. I will tell you that we think of it differently in that, we view M&A as more akin and evaluate it relative to our internal investment, because both of them are capital investments that we're making to generate return for shareholders. And both of those are subject to our return thresholds that we think are necessary to create value. And then if we are unable to find return opportunities in either of those and I want to emphasize, Scott's point, we think there are -- one of the strengths of Verisk is the breadth and the depth of opportunity for us to invest internally in new products at very high incremental returns across a broad range of client driven opportunities in our industry sectors. But similarly, we see our other opportunities on the M&A front. If we don't see acceptable returns in either of those ventures, then we view share repurchases as with dividends an opportunity to return capital that we can't create value from in terms of higher returns. And then, finally, with regard to dividends, the -- as you have seen, we have established a pattern of increasing that dividend that becomes -- that remains subject to the Board's view on the dividend increase. But there is a recognition that companies that have demonstrated an ability to deliver consistent growth in the dividend over time are rewarded for that discipline. We believe that it has introduced a valuable additional component to our investor base, as more yield oriented investors that are looking for both growth and yield have been very additive to our shareholder base and so we think that that is a useful additional component in our capital return strategy. So, yeah, George, thanks for the question. I appreciate what you're looking for. It's hard to quantify, I guess, I would approach it this way. One way to think of it as clearly we had a benefit from T&E of the reductions of the elimination of travel and we have described what the impact is from a margin standpoint of that, for instance, 150 basis points in the -- in this quarter. And we would expect that we would continue to see that benefit and so we will see an increase in T&E expenses, but I think that's going to be a gradual increase over time. The other element is going to be compensation and our incentive compensation in particular, where we're going to see a more normalized level. As we saw in 2020, the responsiveness of our compensation, particularly incentive compensation flex down. We are expecting a more normalized return, so we'll see some increase in that. Plus we are also beginning to normalize headcount, as we see demand from the businesses to support their overall growth. So there are a lot of factors. But as we move through 2021, one way to think about it is in reference to 2020. 2020 we saw the revenue impact, but we saw expenses decline more than the revenue impact driving EBITDA growth of nearly 10% over that period. In 2021, I think, we're going to see a recovery in revenue, but as we look at those comparisons, we will see higher expense growth. We still expect to be able to deliver EBITDA growth, but it will be driven by the pace of expense growth, fortunately, which remains within our control. So our hope is that we will be able to manage that expense growth on the T&E, on the compensation front in terms of headcount growth in order to continue to deliver growth, although not naturally at the same level that we were able to achieve in 2020. Another way to think of it is that, we do expect that that dynamic will drive some reduction in margin, but we still are expecting to be able to retain, as we've said in the past, some meaningful level of the efficiencies that we achieved in 2020. I hope that gives you some direction towards your question, George. And I would say, Alex, I think, we're encouraged by what we are experiencing both in the sales pipeline and in the consulting pipeline. We're also encouraged by the receptivity of our clients on two of the Lens platform as they are interacting with it and as they're using it. They are clearly seeing the value that we are adding to the data and the research products that we've provided before. So, clearly, there is a lot of risk ahead as we manage through the pandemic. But we are seeing -- we think very constructive signs based upon the level of engagement we have so far. Yeah. I do. Alex, thanks for the question. And I would say just briefly really it is still early. I'm spending a lot of time with both the Financial Services and the Energy business and really drilling into complement because of a top-down view from a financials, the bottoms up focus on products, on clients, on people to understand the underlying economics of the business. And one, I think observation that it's worth pointing out is that, of course, what's happening at those businesses is not wholly represented in what you see within the quarter. We've talked about the contract transitions that while clearly a negative impact in this quarter represent very strong progress in the objective that we have on the management team and there has been moving very concertedly towards improving that base and I continue to work with them to evaluate what that broader opportunity is and what the sustainable growth rate for profitability and value is for over the long-term as I do with the Energy business. So we're actively engaged in it. I would just ask for everyone's patience as we work through that and evaluate the business as a whole rather than focusing on the specific quarter's results, but that's what we've been doing. Sure. Well, first of all, thanks for the question. I think what our customers are looking for these, our Insurance customers, they are looking for an interconnected ecosystem a way to pull information, a way to pull and process it seamless way. So we are very tightly aligned with a Duck Creek and a Guidewire. As an example, all of our ISO loss cost renewals, meaning, the way we codify rates is inside of both Duck Creek and Guidewire. We pull -- customers able to pull underwriting information from us through those two platforms. Claims fraud, same thing, we are integrated in a way that we are partners. So there is a way that we partner very effectively, but at the same time, the world is heading towards the analytics, Duck Creek, Guidewire as an example are doing more analytics probably more focused on the individual insurer information as the process to claim look like over the last quarter. How the rates looked for that insurer of last quarter. Where we tend to focus is we have aggregated view of the industry. So our analytics is more benchmark, its rollout to other peers. It's an industry view. Let me also remind you that as we think about software, we're becoming more software intense. So, Sequel software had been moving into United States, becoming certainly more a global player beyond the London market. So I think there is some more overlap with the two, but we continue to work together to satisfy customers. So, hopefully, that's responsive to the software play and I'll just highlight because of the nature of our industry standard programs, we're integrated with almost every policy and vendors. We are kind of across the Board. So we'll continue to do that to share our content with any insurer or reinsurance that needs it. Yeah. Thanks Jeff. And certainly understand the questions. And so on the revenue front, we naturally have that impact of the contract on transitions. A part of that are contracts that -- are not there going forward. But as I indicated, there also is a component where revenue has shifted into future periods. So it's not a -- I wouldn't describe it as a complete rebasing or elimination of that. But the other factor or some of the COVID sensitive revenues that we have seen the impact, we've talked about bankruptcy. We've talked about spend-informed analytics. We're actually seeing some stronger improvement on the spend-informed analytics as things open up. So hopefully if that continues, we'll see strength in that regard. And of course, we're also watching the bankruptcy very carefully and then the overall performance of the banks, which are doing well and hopefully that translates into greater opportunities on the analytics and the consulting front. On the expense front, yes, in the quarter, we had probably a heavier load of expense than we typically have. And so looking ahead, we would anticipate and not as heavy an expense impact. And we are looking at making adjustments from an expense management standpoint that will help us avoid or offset the margin impact that we experienced in the first quarter. Yeah. And thank you, Andrew. I mean, I just want to clarify, you were addressing the question of both at a consolidated level? Is that correct? Yeah. So I think we did describe that, the primary impacts as you've indicated in terms of the catastrophe bond impact and some of the consolidation impacts. Naturally you can look at the other -- the performance of the other business units from a revenue standpoint in Financial Services in particular with the contract transitions and the COVID sensitive. I think from an Energy and Specialized Markets, it was kind of relatively flat quarter. So I would probably just point out that Financial Services clearly had a contribution to the overall growth rate in that regard. And as to your question on margin, I'm going to kind of go back to the way I answered a previous question, which was that clearly we saw the margin benefit in 2020 resulting from or the reduction of expenses to a greater degree than the decline in revenues and looking ahead to 2021 where we will be coming out of this. We are expecting some revenue growth improvement, but that probably will be exceeded by the normalization of expenses. However, if you think about the responsiveness or the growth rates of those two lines, we are expecting that the rate of recovery from an expense standpoint will be slower, meaning that we will hope to hold on to some of that margin benefit that we experienced in 2020, but not all of it. So that is I think the outcome of our expectations at this point kind of looking -- kind of reiterating that we are expecting that our margin still will be above where they were pre-pandemic, but will probably come down as those -- as the expenses normalize. And so, Hamzah, I think -- thank you for the question. And I think there are -- there was an external perspective and an internal perspective, if you're asking about the structural has the business changed structurally. And I think your primary question is from an external standpoint. And I would say that the presence of other players that serve that banking -- the banking industry particularly as it relates to cards, it remains -- has remained relatively consistent, the large players whether the credit bureaus or the network companies are there, they serve that industry. And the Verisk Financial Services entity has for a long time competed very successfully within that environment, given the very unique nature of the dataset and the unique relationships that they have with the industry and they provide a service by integrating that data set and delivering it in a way that others aren't able to do. And so I don't believe that there has been a material change, but we are mindful of the competitive environment that they operate in. From the other perspective from a structural change, I can say unequivocally that we have changed and improved the business in shifting it to more of a sustainable focus on growth within the business with the steps that the management team has made. Some of those have had obviously a up a challenging financial impact in the short-term, but we believe that the business is better positioned for the long-term given those structural changes. So I want to do address both parts of those questions. Yeah. Thank you, Gary. And so the short answer is, yes, and it is a function as you've described of our migration to the cloud, which is reducing the level of CapEx that we would have typically spent on hardware in infrastructure. Now offsetting that, but we still think it's not completely offsetting that benefit is an increasing level of internal software development intensity, which is a function of some of the trends that Mark was talking about in terms of utilizing software opportunity as a way to activate and deliver our datasets and provide solutions for our clients. And so that is clearly an element that we think is added to our business, it's generating good returns. We never want the CapEx intensity metric to obscure our fundamental return objectives. So we do expect to see that improvement over time. It has probably been obscured by some of the real estate renovations that we have done recently that are included in that. But we are realizing real benefits in terms of reductions in CapEx and even OpEx, and expenses related to infrastructure as a result of that. And some of those are being reinvested in some of the software development elements as we develop that component of our -- of the delivery of our datasets."

            "name": "Scott Stephenson",
            "content": "Thanks, Stacey. Hello, everyone. And thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. 2021 is a special year here at Verisk as it marks our 50th anniversary as a company. For 50 years, our mission and purpose has been the same. We work non-stop in partnership with our customers using data and insights to make a difference by helping protect people, economies, society and our planet. On this journey, we used our unique data and combined it with advanced technologies in new ways to unlock meaningful insights about risk, becoming a global leader in cutting edge analytics. And while we are very proud of our accomplishments over the last 50 years, it inspires us to look ahead to all the difference we can make over the next 50 years. I'm pleased to share that this year is off to a solid start marked by continued growth in our subscription businesses. We've delivered solid growth in Insurance, a modest sequential improvement in our Energy segment. Yet we had a challenging quarter within Financial Services. While certain of our businesses continue to be impacted by the pandemic, those revenue streams show resilience as the underlying causal factors improve and we have confidence in this relationship. We will provide more detail on this financial review. For 2021, we remain focused on building long-term shareholder value, delivering for our customers through innovation and service, while also protecting the health and well being of our teammates around the globe. Currently, most of our offices are operating in a Phase 1 format and are available for those employees who have volunteered to work from the office. We do have certain offices that have advanced to Phase 2 and even Phase 2 as conditions in their local markets allow and employees are energized to be back in the office. Our Global Protection Services team closely monitors directives from local governments and public health officials around the world, as well as incorporates learnings from our local market experiences to make real-time decisions to maintain the safety of our people. To that end, our teams are closely monitoring the current situation in India in the face of the severe second wave of COVID and we are providing relief and assistance to our India colleagues including vaccination coverage, virtual medical services, emergency relief funds and other essential programs. To-date, we have experienced minimal or no disruption to our business or the services we provide. Over the duration of the pandemic, our teams have proven they can transition efficiently into different work modes with minimal interruption in service to our customers. So while there remains some uncertainty around return to office timing across our many different markets, I have complete confidence that our 9,000 plus teammates at Verisk will continue to navigate through these times effectively and deliver the highest value to our customers. Throughout the pandemic, I've maintained a high level of engagement with our customers, CEOs across all three of our segments. Despite the virtual setting, the frequency of these meetings has increased, and the level of engagement and mutual respect has deepened. In these conversations, we are discussing our customers' highest strategic priorities. In all circumstances, we are receiving feedback that Verisk is a trusted and differentiated partner, and that our solutions and innovations played large and increasing role in our customers journeys to becoming more digitally engaged, more automated and more efficient. These types of constructive meetings are happening across all levels of our organization, most recently within our underwriting and claims councils, which include representatives from our top 25 customers in the Insurance vertical. With regard to digital engagement, we continue to see very strong adoption of our virtual claims processing platform, claims experience, as insurers continue to find additional use cases for remote claims handling outside the pandemic. Our virtual claims tools enable our customers to conduct business at a time when in-person processes were not possible. But it also has the added benefit of settling claims with greater speed. In fact, virtual claims are paid on average 30% faster than the traditional process. We've recently added new features to enhance the solution including remote measurement, object recognition and an automated damage assessment tool. We also are having success converting customers from transactional usage to long-term contracts with committed volumes, as they build comfort with the tool and realize the value that remote claims processing can bring to their organization. One of the strongest signals of the deep and expanding relationships with our customers in our view is the fact that they entrust us with their data. I'm pleased to share that in the most recent year 29 insurers have decided to newly contribute data to our ISO Statistical Database. This is the highest number of new participants in a single year over the last 10 years and represents a range of different customers from insure tech startups to multi-state carriers. On the sales front, we're having great success selling in virtual mode and remain committed to advancing our techniques with ongoing training across the many new virtual selling tools we employ. Our pipelines of new opportunities are some of the strongest in our history and they continue to build. Our customers are more engaged with Verisk as a partner, as evidenced by increased numbers of meetings, better attendance at our virtual conferences, and contract renewals and signings of new deals that are longer in duration. On the innovation front, we continue to make advances with our solutions to drive digital engagement, automate processes and create a seamless interconnected ecosystem, what we have various referred to as platforms analytic environments. While this is a journey we've been on for some time, the pandemic has catalyzed our customers to move forward with greater urgency and speed. These platforms analytic environments offer our customers deep integration into their workflows and allow a massive amount of information to be rendered so that decisions can be made quickly and accurately. Often these environments are more software intensive, as we are utilizing this software to gather more data, automate more processes and become even more deeply embedded with our customers. These platforms are also driving healthy and profitable growth for Verisk across our verticals. Let me give you a few recent examples. Within Life Insurance, we're driving strong growth and profitability as we bundled the industry leading module software offerings at FAST. With the data analytics we have developed across Verisk to create a full suite of Life Insurance Solutions in one singular platform. We're having great success extending and accelerating the adoption of FAST Solutions across our broad customer base and have a strong pipeline of future deals. In addition, we recently launched new analytics including EHR Triage Engine and Life Risk Navigator. Electronic Health Record Triage Engine uses advanced data analytics and natural language processing to distill 1000s of pages of electronic medical records into a short summary and provides an automated underwriting store, both of which reduce underwriting costs and speed up the process and that leads to an improved buying experience for the end consumer. Life Risk Navigator is a cloud-based modeling platform that offers in depth portfolio analytics to enhance risk selection, quantify changes in mortality rates and drive overall better decision making. Further in March, we enhanced our capabilities in Life Insurance, through the acquisition of 4C Solutions, a software advisory firm with expertise in Group Life Insurance. The addition of 4C enables us to extend our expertise into the Group Life market and help address the needs for Group Life insurers and institutional annuity providers. While each solution is strong on its own, we believe we deliver even more value for our customers, as these solutions are integrated into one holistic interconnected ecosystem. We are also delivering very strong growth at Sequel as we help our customers in the specialty markets digitize and modernize. Sequel Solutions create a truly integrated ecosystem across carriers, brokers and managing general agents throughout the specialty market, and we're bringing in new customers and expanding our suite of products across existing customers. We are also beginning to see traction in our global expansion of Sequel with new clients signed in the U.S. and Asia-Pacific. To further enhance the value and capability of the Sequel ecosystem, we recently acquired a majority stake in Whitespace Software. The powerful combination of Whitespaces' digital placing platform with Sequel's pricing distribution and policy administration applications enables a seamless real-time quote-to-bind solution with straight through submissions for our existing and prospective customers. In our Energy business, we continue to make advances on the development of new modules and sales of new subscriptions for our Lens platform. Despite the softness in the energy end market, customers are recognizing the value and uniqueness of the platform, and this is reflected in new customer subscriptions and constructive pricing for customers that adopt Lens. Additionally, we have lots of interest in future releases for Lens and already have a group of development partners in place to support Lens Power, backed by the proprietary data assets of Wood Mackenzie and Genscape. Lens Power enables customers to maximize investment opportunities in clean energy and be on the forefront of the energy transition and further advances our market leading position in the energy transition. We are well positioned to capitalize on the growing trend of countries and companies around the world, increasing investment toward renewables and green energy, and our solutions will help inform these critical decisions at the highest levels. Lens Power is part of a broader suite of solutions that we have within our Energy segment to help our customers navigate the changing ESG landscape. We are seeing a positive market response to our Energy Customers Solutions for improve management of supply chain risk and ESG priorities like emissions benchmarking and supplier diversity programs. Not only are we helping our customers with their ESG initiatives, we have also moved forward on our own ESG agenda. In early April, we released our Annual CSR report, which you can find in the Corporate Social Responsibility section of our website. This year's report is notable for three reasons. First, the environmental section features our Climate Disclosure report, which speaks to the four pillars of TCFD, governance, risk and opportunities, risk management, and metrics and targets. Our Board and senior management team are very engaged on these subjects, including climate change and climate transition, both on the risks we face, but equally important on the opportunities they present for our business. We've been helping customers understand, measure and manage risk associated with climate and weather for decades. Wind storms, wildfire and flood risk among others, and are building on a base of knowledge, data, predictive models, analytic expertise, industry leading standards and investments that are already in play, and serving our insurance and energy customers failing. Second, we used the CSR report as the vehicle to deliver our first ever disclosure in accordance with SASB's recommendations for professional and commercial services companies. The disclosure includes baseline metrics around workforce composition, diversity, engagement and turnover. We intend to update those metrics in our CSR report each year. And finally, the CSR report calls out Verisk approach to cybersecurity, a comprehensive document that describes our commitment and investments to strengthen data security and privacy. That commitment doesn't just exist on paper, but is reinforced through the mandatory training we conduct annually for all of our employees. We're very proud of the progress we made throughout 2020. Our Board and senior management team are very much engaged and our entire organization is committed to continue to move forward our ESG agenda over the coming years. I'm confident we have the right strategy and team in place to meet our long-term growth objectives. Our deep domain expertise and relationships with our customers help inform our innovation agenda. And we are treating the year 2021 as one that provides a unique set of signals on the resilience of the different parts of our company which we are pulling into our always active capital process to ensure that our capital is deployed into the highest return opportunities. Now, I'll turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results. Right. So it -- what we do in the renewables area, Toni, is across a very broad front. So it is everything from solar to wind to biomass. What differentiates us is a couple of things. One is we believe that we actually have unique data about really the supply side of those industries. In addition to that, we're able to relate the developments in that part of the energy ecosystem to the rest of the energy ecosystem. And that's really critical, because that is what all the players in the in the energy space want to do, including the traditional hydrocarbon-based players. They are all very, very interested in how they modify who they are in order to move into this future. And then on top of all of that, we believe that we have the best platform analytic environment going in Lens, which permits us to put all of this wonderful content into our customers decisioning workflows in a really easy to consume and we believe differentiated way. You're welcome. Yeah. Nothing has changed in our perspective on that Manav. One of the things that and I sort of referenced this in my comments upfront, but we are watching very carefully the results we're producing in 2021, both the -- what we deemed the COVID sensitive revenues, but also the non-COVID sensitive revenues and those would relate more to the subscription products that we have. And actually we see good progress in the performance of those and actually they really have been the most steady part of our performance over the last several quarters. And we also referenced our pipelines, both renewals, as well as new product -- new sales opportunities. And as I mentioned in my comments up front, we have some of the strongest pipelines we've ever had. And our focus is so very definitely on subscription-based solutions. So the context from my answer to your question is, that's where we're focused. Those are in good shape. They have been in good shape through the pandemic and we think that they will remain on that track going forward. Yeah. Lee, that's kind of into our work papers on how we look at the many investment opportunities we've got. So maybe you want to talk to that? Yeah. So I'm glad you added that last bit, David, because we have multiple forms for returning capital to shareholders. But even before that, I would really emphasize investment into the business to build these engines of growth. We -- you hear us talking all the time about platforms analytic environments. They are really the source of so many forms of goodness in terms of value for customers and the result of them is that we have much stickier relationships, which are just that much more recurrent. So I would -- so if I was to prioritize our use of capital, I would actually start with internal investment, which is a genuine focal point. We're very happy to return capital to shareholders. We have a long track record of doing that and we feel very good about that. And with respect to M&A, Lee, was already talking about kind of how we look at it. I mean, it's not as if we've earmark some number of dollars or percentage of total capital available to go into M&A. They've -- it's more a question with that third leg of whether or not the opportunity is compelling and meets our return hurdles. And we are definitely emphasizing that which in combination with what we -- who we already are, the whole becomes greater than the sum of the parts. You bet. Yes. George, thanks for the question. We estimate that the impact of the contract transitions in the first quarter was approximately two-thirds of the of the revenue decline that we saw on a year-over-year basis. And as you know, this is something that will cycle through, we believe that those contract transitions, I would just remind folks represented in part, a rebalancing of our relationship with several of those contracts, shifting in our general strategy to move from less upfront revenues to more revenues extended over the relationship. So it reflects that. There is some upside in future periods that that balance that impact. But the short answer is, in the quarter it was about two thirds of the impact. And as you mentioned, we expect that impact to be to follow for the next two quarters. Yeah. I'll just go back something that we've said for a long period of time, which is, for business, in the Energy sector, in general to perform, we just need a normal environment. We don't need a roaring commodity price. We just need a normal kind of environment. And our view is that that's more or less where the system has gotten to? Well, why don't I start, but Lee, I think questions kind of directed to you and your oversight. But I'll just say that there is a playbook at Verisk, which when it is in place works very, very well. And that playbook is really centered on creating what we call platform to analytic environments and analytic objects, which become industry standard analyzed output. And the more that we feature those in the mix of what we do, in any part of Verisk the business becomes very sticky, very resilient, grows well, represents a lot of value for customers. And I'll just say that and I'm going to pick Financial Services in particular, the focus here at the moment is, first of all, make sure that we capture all the COVID sensitive revenues as the environment changes, make sure that we capture all those revenues back into the mix, one. And two is the continued development of the platforms inside of Verisk financial that will represent that same kind of Verisk ways, the Verisk model really for joint business. And that's really what we're focused on and -- in the near-term and we're expected about both of those things as it relates to the business so that with respect to VFS and particularly. Lee, I don't know if you want to add anything to that. Well, Lee, you want to take one. Yeah. I don't see over the long-term a significant gap between the EBITDA -- the revenue and EBITDA growth rates and the -- and our cash flow. The two should be fairly consistent, obviously lot of variables that from a timing standpoint may influence that, but as kind of core growth rates. I don't see a substantial difference there. So thank you for the question and thank you for the look forward. We have recently introduced VeriskPay and we do believe that in this kind of world of interconnectivity automation electronic payments are going to factor into that. The places where we started was the places where we thought most weekly integrate into our solutions. So think of our exactly solution, which is representative as repair cost estimates and payment of property damage, and also in the world of real estate where we do some similar work and we feel that those electronic payments could facilitate, thanks for our customers. We're working with a big partner Pfizer and we hope to extend the use cases beyond claims and into some premium and other places like subrogation where we think that our insurance customers will benefit Yeah. So maybe I can start at the top it. Mark, you should come in real quick on especially the first part of Jeff's question. Thanks for the questions, Jeff. Yeah. I mean the -- most of the selling effort goes where we have the priority and the priority is on these, as just as you said, the platform to analytic environments, the analytic objects. So that is the majority of the pipeline and so all of those comments about contract length stretching out and the depth of the pipeline that applies fully for that part of the product suite. So there is no real differentiation there. When you look quarter -- when you look year-over-year on cat bond insurance, Q1 2020 was strong quarter. Q1 2021 was a strong quarter. We pay a lot of attention to that, cat bond issuance has picked up since the first quarter. So we don't see anything different in the environment, it was just really kind of moment in time. Mark, anything you want to add on that? There is no change to the pricing algorithm itself... ... in 2021. Yeah. You bet Gary. Thank you for the question. Yeah. When you sit and actually related to the way that we was responding to that prior question about Financial Services. So if you kind of get to the top of sort of our business and that ecosystem. What you're looking at is global customers that are large that are facing challenging issues in terms of how they're going to run their businesses in the future. Our calling increasingly upon data analytics to try to help these very, very important decisions and have only a few places that they can turn to outside of their own four walls in order to find support with respect to the kind of data analytics that they want to make the commercial decisions that they need to make. And then I would add to that one other point, which is the range of topics and the ecosystem that that can be covered. And those have really expanded in light of the Energy transition. And there was an earlier question about what do we do with respect to renewables. But I would point out also that in the Energy space, there is a great sensitivity to topics of climate change and so our ability to also observe on things like emissions is an important capability and a distinct capability. And so the summation of all of that for me Gary would be that, if you're right about the track record. I would point out in -- over the course of the last five years, there have been two relatively unprecedented shocks to the pricing of the commodity and I'm not here to predict that there can't be any more of those, but they were pretty unusual and in a relatively compressed period of time. Against that I would put a very large global market with increasing appetite for data analytics of the kind that we provide. And so my summary and all of that would be that I look for this business to contribute at or above the targets we had as a company overall, we're going to hold it to that standard, so that's really it."

            "content": "I think the only thing I'll go to some of our traditional ISO information and that is again rock solid with customers. If you were to look at the way we kind of think about this, remember we're taking a long-term view. We would prefer to gather new sales from new solutions and customers as opposed to kind of past artificially high price increases. So, I think, we remain pretty modest in kind of the way we handle pricing price ISO. And you are correct, we did highlight some industry consolidation, which doesn't necessarily one plus one doesn't equal one, but sometimes equals like about 1.8 in the way. Some of our pricing algorithms work. So that was a headwind for the year, yes, I know. Thank you. Thank you for the question. This is Mark. So let me kind of give you a quick summary. So, first of all, good recollection of the overview that we provided. If I would now grade ourselves on where we are at that I would say from a U.K. perspective and Ireland we are well ahead of that plan. I think we are doing extremely well and I think we've highlighted some of the benefits of the Sequel acquisition and just the progress that's been made there along with some of the work that we've done on the claims and underwriting front. As we think about other regions, we did highlight France and Germany. And I would say there it's been a tougher sledding. We were looking for a combination of organic access, as well as moving into maybe some businesses that provide services there. I think from an M&A perspective. I think we've done well from a cat bond perspective, cat modeling perspective. So there strong rates just probably less progress with some of the other underwriting and claims in that like France and Germany field. I think we kind of had talked about Asia-Pacific is more long-term. I'm not sure I can comment on that. That's probably still on the horizon. So thank you for the question and I think it give ourselves overall strong grades."

[Operator Instructions]  For opening remarks and introductions, I would now turn -- like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, you may go ahead.\nStacey Brodbar : Thank you, Devin, and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our fourth quarter 2022 financial results. On the call today are Lee Shavel, Verisk President and Chief Executive Officer; and Elizabeth Mann, Chief Financial Officer. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as our traditional quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-K can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. As set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance, including those related to our financial guidance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that the financial results for recent dispositions are included in our consolidated and GAAP results are excluded from all organic constant currency growth figures. A reconciliation of reported and historic non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call is provided in our 8-K and today's earnings presentation posted on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. However, we are not able to provide a reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable expected GAAP results because of the unreasonable effort and high unpredictability of estimating certain items that are excluded from projected non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, including, for example, tax consequences, acquisition-related costs, gain or loss from dispositions and other nonrecurring expenses, the effect of which may be significant. And now I would like to turn the call over to Lee Shavel.\nLee Shavel : Good morning, everyone, and thank you, Stacey, and thanks to you all for participating today. We've really been looking forward to this call because it's our first opportunity to reintroduce Verisk in our new insurance-focused configuration, to discuss the momentum in the fourth quarter and given all the structural changes, give you a forward view of our expected performance in 2023. We accomplished an extraordinary amount in 2022, so let me provide a brief summary. First, there's been a lot of structural change. In March, we sold 3E, our environmental health and safety business, for net cash proceeds of $575 million. In April, we sold Verisk Financial Services for net cash proceeds of approximately $500 million. And most recently in February, we sold Wood Mackenzie for approximately $3.1 billion. We've begun the process of returning a substantial majority of the after-tax proceeds of those transactions to shareholders through share repurchases as promised. Despite a challenging economic, geopolitical and financing environment, we were able to complete these transactions at attractive valuations through the strong underlying businesses, capable management teams and a well-organized sale process. Let's turn to governance change. Structural change wasn't the only transition at Verisk. We also made a number of governance changes that shareholders suggested. We are transitioning to a declassified Board with annual elections. We added four new directors with fresh perspectives and experiences: Jeff Dailey, Wendy Lane, Olumide Soroye and Kim Stevenson. We separated the Chairman and CEO role with the election of Bruce Hansen as our new Chair. I have to personally thank Bruce for his advice and leadership through my transition. As a former CEO, he's been a great coach to me as have been all of our directors. Let's turn to organizational change. Finally, organizationally, we've had substantial change. In addition to Scott Stephenson's retirement last year, Mark Anquillare stepping down in January and the addition of Elizabeth Mann as our CFO, we have made over a dozen changes in senior management. These have enabled the next generation of management to rise, bringing new energy and fresh perspectives how we can make Verisk better. At the highest level, I have reconstituted our Senior Operating Committee with 10 colleagues, six of whom are new to the committee, who represent a better balance of business unit leaders and corporate leaders for improved integration and coordination. I'm also proud that the committee represents 50% gender diversity and 40% ethnic diversity, a strong signal for our entire organization. We all share the common mission of creating value for our clients, employees and shareholders.  With all this change, we were, of course, carefully watching for disruption with our employees and clients. While there is some understandable anxiety with any organizational change, the feedback from employees at three town halls, anonymous surveys and informal feedback has been very positive with enthusiasm for our refocused strategy in insurance and new leadership. In particular, our purpose of working together to build global resilience for individuals, communities and businesses has resonated strongly with our employees as has our new cultural values of learning, caring and results. As I believe all of you can appreciate, what we accomplished in terms of structure and organizational change in 2022 was no foregone conclusion, and the delivery of a clear view of our insurance-only operations in our 10-K was a massively complex exercise. It required the effort, expertise and commitment of hundreds of our employees to accomplish. So I'd like to take this opportunity to personally thank all of our nearly 7,000 employees for their professionalism, commitment and understanding as we have undergone so much change in 2022. They are absolutely talented and critical to our future success. What we accomplished this year demonstrates what we're capable of ahead. On the client front, we have also received a positive response from many clients who appreciate our renewed insurance focus and desire to improve our relationships across their organizations. I experienced this first-hand at our Elevate Conference in Salt Lake City and dozens of client meetings and calls. Their feedback reinforces that while we have been a great product organization, we can be a much better client organization. And that's an area where I'm dedicating substantial time and leading from the front. I spent most of my career as a client professional, and I'm excited to be returning to this particular role. Let's move to financial change. I won't steal Elizabeth's thunder on the financials. However, there are two elements that matter most to me in our 2022 performance and what we intend to achieve in 2023. First is our ability to continue to deliver strong revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth despite the changes and challenging environment in 2022 and the clear momentum in the fourth quarter results. We have clearly demonstrated what Verisk is capable of in the fourth quarter by delivering organic constant currency revenue growth of over 7% in the insurance-only business even after eliminating the impact of storms.  I'd also note that fiscal year 2022, the insurance OCC revenue growth of 6.5% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 8% is a solid result for a year of substantial change and macroeconomic challenges and is a strong reflection of the stability of our business and a good foundation to build on to in 2023 and beyond. Second is our delivery of clear margin improvement consistent with the clear goals we set for the insurance-focused business of 300 basis points to 500 basis points improvement from a normalized base of 50% to 51% in 2021. At 52.7% for the fourth quarter, we are on the cusp of delivering at the low end of our targeted range of 53% to 56% for 2024. And our guidance for 2023 is for adjusted EBITDA margin to be between 53% and 54%. Finally, we are providing expanded financial guidance for 2023 as a reflection of the complex structural changes in 2022 as well as an expectation of more predictable growth with our refocused business. This decision also reflects the input from many of our shareholders who ask for improved financial guidance. Naturally, it will come with the necessary caveats that we can't predict all contingencies but represents our best assessment of 2023 financial performance. So where does that leave us after all of these changes? We are, as of this moment, a new Verisk, new structurally, organizationally and with a reenergized and refocused purpose values. There's a lot that you'll be familiar with, including our insurance focus, industry centrality, strong market position, stable growth and strong margins and some new elements that are expanding our growth opportunities in areas such as life assurance, marketing solutions and in our European businesses, including specialty business solutions, where we are improving workflows and efficiency in the Lloyd's nonstandard market. You will also see changes in our expense discipline to drive margin expansion and a new approach to providing financial guidance for the year ahead. Let's step back and take a moment to reframe our opportunity. The insurance industry is massive, complex and growing globally. Our clients face substantial technology, regulatory and macroeconomic challenges in a rapidly evolving environment. This is less an assertion than an often repeated sentiment that I hear from the leaders of our clients. One of my favorite client quotes was, \"Lee, we need Verisk's help to address this, but more importantly, the industry needs Verisk's help.\" That crystallizes our opportunity and position. You'll hear at Investor Day from several clients that Verisk is considered a true business partner rather than a vendor and that we work together to collectively solve problems for the insurance industry. We create value for our clients through a simple economic mechanism. We invest in data, analytics and software at scale to address industry needs much more efficiently than individual companies can. We are addressing hundreds of billions of dollars of premiums and expense across the industry to improve revenue growth, risk outcomes, fund experience, productivity and margins. These investments deliver real value to the industry and in turn, drive our growth, operating leverage and high incremental returns on capital. Much of this opportunity is realized by facilitating connectivity across the insurance ecosystem. Hence, the theme of our annual report for 2022: Connecting What Matters. To connect, you must be central. You must be trusted, and you must understand the needs of the ecosystem. No company is better positioned than Verisk with our scale, relationships and expertise to create this value for the insurance industry. We're very proud of what we accomplished in 2022, but it was all to put us in this position where we can demonstrate our full potential, focused on serving the substantial and expanding needs of the insurance industry. With a reconfigured and energized organization bound together by a common purpose and values, we are very excited about the path ahead and can already feel the benefits of this better integrated and focused approach. This is the way. As our 2023 financial guidance implies and as you'll hear at our upcoming Investor Day, we believe this path will see continued growth, improving margins and strong returns on capital. I'll end with thanks to our shareholders who encouraged us to consider new approaches and offered their perspectives directly or indirectly through surveys and our analyst community. We and our Board have listened carefully. And our actions and path ahead clearly reflect your input. We are here to expand the opportunity, execute on the plan and deliver value on your behalf. I can't imagine us being in a better position to do so, and we're off to a solid start. With that, I'll hand it over to Elizabeth to review our financial results for the quarter, the year and our financial guidance for 2023.\nElizabeth Mann : Thanks, Lee, and good day to everyone on the call. Before I start with the fourth quarter results, I have a few reminders for everyone. First, all consolidated and GAAP numbers are negatively impacted by the dispositions of 3E and Verisk Financial Services. This effect will continue through the first quarter of 2023 when we will anniversary those transactions. Second, as we described previously, due to its materiality, Wood Mackenzie is accounted for as discontinued operations beginning this quarter. And its results are not included in our revenue or adjusted EBITDA results in either the current period or the prior period. Third, in the earnings presentation now posted on the Investors section of our website, we have included certain pro forma quarterly financial metrics, removing the operational results of all our divestitures as well as a reconciliation to our historical reported results, which we hope you will find helpful. Turning now to the financial results. I'm pleased to share that we had a strong finish to 2022. For the fourth quarter, on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue was $630 million, up slightly versus the prior year, reflecting growth in insurance, offset by the impact of the VFS and 3E dispositions. Income from continuing operations was $216 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share attributable to Verisk was $1.37. Moving to our organic constant currency results adjusted for non-operating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, we are very pleased with our operating results, which demonstrated strong sequential improvement relative to the third quarter as a broad-based recovery across our business contributed to the strongest quarter of the year. In the fourth quarter, OCC revenues grew 8.1% with growth of 6.5% in underwriting and rating and 11.9% in claims. This quarter's results included $5.6 million in storm-related revenue associated with Hurricane Ian. Excluding the storm-related revenues, OCC revenue would have grown 7.1%. Our subscription revenues, which comprise 80% of our total revenue in the quarter, grew 7.2% on an OCC basis. We saw broad-based growth across most of our businesses with strength in core underwriting, property estimating solutions, extreme events, antifraud and life insurance solutions. We did experience a modest negative impact from the liquidations in Florida. As we noted in previous calls, Florida has been a trouble spot for the insurance industry, and the losses from Hurricane Ian add complication. In 2022, the market saw six liquidations. And so far in '23, we have seen one company placed into receivership after higher-than-expected losses from Hurricane Ian, which is the carrier into insolvency. We continue to work to offset this headwind through engagement with our customers by helping them adapt to Florida's new roof coverage rules and by better segmenting risk using both new and existing sources such as our roof age data and aerial imagery. Our analytics have been integrated into our LightSpeed platform and can help customers leverage data earlier in their quoting process, ensuring they underwrite risk appropriately as well as help drive non-rate action for in-force policies. Transactional OCC revenue growth of 12.1%, representing 20% of total revenue in the fourth quarter, also improved from the third quarter, reflecting the revenues associated with Hurricane Ian. Adjusting for the storm impact, transactional growth was a healthy 8.2% comprised of continued strong recovery in international travel, strong sales of life insurance solutions and a modest contribution from our workers' compensation business, which is improving though, continues to be below pre-pandemic levels. This was offset in part by continued weakness across auto underwriting and marketing solutions. On the auto underwriting side, we continue to see cyclical softness across our auto underwriting and marketing solutions as carriers are dealing with the impact of rising inflation and increasing loss ratios. To that end, carriers have pulled back on underwriting new auto policies as well as on marketing spending to drive new policy volume and customer acquisition. Carriers are working to reset pricing, which we think could take another six to 12 months to truly take effect. To help our customers bridge this uncertain time and drive growth for Verisk, we are working with them to help identify ways to improve profitability with targeted non-rate actions that minimize premium leakage. We are actively engaging with customers about our risk check renewal product, which allows insurance -- which allows insurers to analyze an entire book of business with minimal IT resources and pinpoint policies that require attention. Moving now to our adjusted EBITDA results. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 12.9% in the fourth quarter, reflecting core operating leverage and the impact of certain cost reduction actions we have taken in connection with our margin expansion objectives. Total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results, was 52.7%, up 210 basis points from the reported results in the prior year, reflecting the benefit from recent dispositions, strong cost and operational discipline, the impact of certain cost reduction actions and the high incremental margins associated with storm-related revenue. This level of margin also includes a number of margin headwinds, including approximately 110 basis points from recent acquisitions as well as 80 basis points from the headwinds from our ongoing technological transformation and higher T&E expenses. In addition, this quarter included certain onetime or non-operating expenses including severance, FX impact and a decrease in our pension credit, which collectively negatively impacted margins by 190 basis points.  Finally, if you compare the fourth quarter margins on a pro forma basis for all divestitures, the 4Q 2022 margins of 52.7% represent an 80 basis point margin expansion from 51.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021 pro forma. Reflecting on our objective to deliver 300 basis points to 500 basis points of margin improvement in 2024 from a normalized base of 50% to 51% in 2021, we took great strides in 2022 with full year adjusted EBITDA margin of 52% on a pro forma basis, reflecting approximately 140 basis points of margin expansion associated with our operational excellence focus. To date, we have made decisions and taken actions to address more than 60% of the run rate cost savings we are targeting. The impact of those actions will be realized through 2024 with about 30% of the cumulated expected cost savings already achieved in the reported results in 2022. Our business continues to demonstrate the operating leverage embedded in our data analytics business model. And we have confidence in our ability to deliver on the objective in 2024. Interest expense. Interest expense totaled $41 million for the fourth quarter compared to $30.2 million in the prior year. For the full year, interest expense totaled $139 million versus $127 million in 2021. This increase in interest expense is related to higher balances on our revolving credit facility as well as higher interest rates. We have paid off all borrowings under our credit facility as of February 2023. And in the near term, we'll look to establish a go-forward balance sheet for the business, staying within our targeted leverage range of 2x to 3x adjusted EBITDA. Taxes. Our reported effective tax rate was 9.9% compared to 16.8% in the prior year quarter. This lower tax rate included a onetime benefit of approximately $30 million, which was primarily the result of transaction benefits related to our Wood Mackenzie divestiture, offset in part by lower stock compensation benefits versus the prior year period. For the full year '22, our effective tax rate was 17.5% as compared to 22.8% in the prior year, including approximately $67.7 million in benefits related to all our dispositions throughout the year. The net effect of these transaction-related tax benefits was a reduction in our full year effective tax rate of 5.4%. Adjusted net income and diluted adjusted EPS. Adjusted net income increased 14% to $225 million, and diluted adjusted EPS increased 18% to $1.43 for the fourth quarter '22. These changes reflect organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions, a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count. Capital returns. During the fourth quarter, we returned $514 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends as our strong cash flow allows us to consistently return capital to shareholders while also investing in our business. In particular, included in that amount is $366 million of share repurchases we have completed since the announcement of the Wood Mackenzie transaction back in November. In the coming days, we intend to enter into an additional $2.5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement for a total capital return of $2.87 billion associated with the transaction proceeds. This is consistent with our plan to return the majority of the proceeds from the Wood Mackenzie divestiture to shareholders via share repurchases. We continue to expect the dilution from the transaction to be within the 4% to 6% range. Looking ahead to 2023, as Lee mentioned, we have listened to shareholder feedback, and we'll now be providing annual financial guidance. We have posted a summary of all guidance measures in the earnings deck on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. Specifically, for 2023, we expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $2.59 billion to $2.63 billion versus $2.437 billion in 2022 pro forma. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.37 billion to $1.42 billion versus $1.266 billion in 2022 pro forma and adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 53% to 54%. Working further down the P&L, we expect fixed asset D&A to be between $175 million and $195 million and intangible amortization to be approximately $70 million. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to FX variability, the timing of purchases, the completion of projects and future M&A activity. We also expect capital expenditures to be between $200 million and $230 million as we continue to invest organically behind our highest return on investment opportunities. These include a modernization of our core line services to digitize our industry standard offering and enable expansion into new workflows that improve productivity for the industry. We are also investing in an upgrade of our financial and human capital systems that will enable future efficiencies once implemented. As previously communicated, we expect the tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%, bringing adjusted earnings per share to a range of $5.20 to $5.50. This range represents strong double-digit growth rates on EPS after normalizing for the impact of transaction tax benefits in 2022. Before I turn the call over to Lee, I just want to remind everyone that we're hosting an Investor Day on March 14 here in Jersey City, where we will provide more transparency and clarity on our strategic profile, growth drivers and long-term financial targets. And now I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments.\nLee Shavel : Thanks, Elizabeth. In summary, we are excited to focus all our attention, talent and resources on the global insurance industry where we can deliver substantial value to our clients through improved decision-making and operational efficiency. We will be engaged more intensively as a strategic technology partner to our clients and the broader insurance industry to identify and develop ways for Verisk to support their objectives. With our scale, relationships and expertise, we are well positioned to help make those connections in this period of accelerated change for the industry and by extension, to the people and communities they serve. Our motivating purpose is to work together with our clients in building resilience for individuals, communities and businesses globally. Combined with our focused business model and unique market position, this is a formula that will deliver value to our shareholders through growth and returns. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question.  With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.\nToni Kaplan : Congrats on the results today and particularly, I think your progress on the margin front. You talked about hitting 53% to 54% margin in '23. And as you mentioned, that will essentially be at the low end of the '24 target range. Does this change your strategy around investment, meaning does this allow you to go more aggressively after growth opportunities, just given that your margin is in a really solid place?\nLee Shavel : Thanks, Toni. I'm going to hand it over to Elizabeth to start.\nElizabeth Mann : Thanks, Toni. I don't think it changes our overall strategy. We are committed to the targets delivering in '24. We're happy to be in the low end of that range already ahead of schedule. But we'll maintain that level of focus on margin while still maintaining investment in the business as we have been balancing so far.\nLee Shavel : Yes. And Toni, I'll just add, I think we're very comfortable in our ability to meet those targets, to build on that while still continuing to support the growth objectives that we have for the business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.\nGeorge Tong : You've reaffirmed your commitment to deliver 300 bps to 500 bps of EBITDA margin improvement from a normalized base of 50% to 51% in 2021. Recently, you restated historical financials suggesting an insurance-only Verisk has normalized EBITDA margins of approximately 52%. Can you discuss upside potential to your 53% to 56% 2024 target for EBITDA margins?\nElizabeth Mann : Yes. Thanks. We remain committed to that range. Right now, I'm here talking about 2023, I think there's been some headwinds in '22 that we've talked about previously as well as some benefits to the business. So on balance, we're committed to the range.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Heather Balsky with Bank of America.\nHeather Balsky : I'll continue the streak of margin questions on the Q&A. And just ask, if you could help us just bridge a little bit more what gets you to 53 to 54, what's coming from the savings? What's sort of the impact from the stranded costs and some of the other chunkier lines that kind of get you from '22 to '23?\nElizabeth Mann : Yes. Let me talk a little bit about that. If you start with the baseline '22 of 52% that pro forma, that already includes the headwinds from stranded costs, and it includes most of the headwinds from recent M&A. As we move forward on that, there is still a little bit more headwinds from those previously identified items in our baseline, call it, about 30 basis points collectively from ongoing impact of the T&E normalization, the cloud and technology investments, including some of the financial and capital systems that we talked about. So all those investments, 30 basis points.  There's probably still 30 basis points of headwind also from the pension credit, which we know today based on current assumptions will be -- will continue to be a drag in 2023. Offsetting that, you'll see -- so that's about 60 basis points. Collectively, that's offsetting about 150 basis points to 250 basis points of sort of core operating leverage. I haven't broken that down between operating leverage, gross impact and the cost savings target, but those are all included in that 150 basis points to 250 basis points, bringing us to the net of 100 basis points to 200 basis points margin expansion.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets.\nAshish Sabadra : Changing gears and moving to the top line, really strong OCC growth in the quarter. I was wondering for your 2023 guidance, what is the organic constant currency assumption for that guidance range? And then as we think about a quarterly cadence, I was wondering if you could provide any color on that? And any color on the puts and takes as we think about auto underwriting coming back, worker comp improving as well as any color on pricing trends and comping some of the Florida insurance headwinds. So any incremental color.\nLee Shavel : It\u2019s like a four-part question. So let's choose -- I would consider that multiple choice. So\u2026\nElizabeth Mann : I'll try to hit the main points there. So on the OCC revenue growth, we haven't given that on a forecasted basis. We will report that out as the quarters develop. The one piece of slice for you, for 2023, the acquisitions that roll in from inorganic to organic are not -- don't create a major swing in the growth rates. And obviously, FX is -- we're not predicting. In terms of -- you asked about the quarterly cadence of how that plays out, there's nothing that we see here today that would imply a meaningful swing in the quarters from a financial perspective. If you look at the OCC comparability results to 2022, those could have some swings just based on the swings in '22.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies.\nHans Hoffman : This is Hans Hoffman on for Stephanie. Congrats on a strong quarter. Just wanted to talk a bit about your strategy within insurance, specifically internationally and just how organic growth is trending there? And then just kind of maybe as part of that, are there any acquisitions in the international pipeline that could help you gain further critical mass therein going forward?\nLee Shavel : Yes. Thank you for the question. Let me try to address the components of that. So I think I outlined in my comments the general strategy where we are looking to make investments in data or technology that solve industry problems that we can monetize across that industry. And that strategy really holds across the business. Internationally where we've had a very solid success of finding businesses that have established products in international context, and I'll use our acquisition of Sequel as an example, we have taken that business. We have found ways to support that with addition of other components such as a rate-making component or a binding component in that business that add value to the total offering for our business, thereby integrating components for the market participants in that ecosystem. We will continue to look for opportunities to leverage those types of additions as well as data sets and functionality that we have within the U.S. business. We recently made an acquisition in Sweden, and you may be familiar with both our acquisitions of ACTINEO in Germany and Opta where we're deploying similar strategies. And generally, across our international businesses, we have been able to deliver growth faster than our overall rate and generally in the double-digit range because of the penetration opportunities we have within those marketplaces. So hopefully that ties together with our general strategy and how it applies internationally and the contributions to growth from each of those elements.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird.\nJeff Meuler : I want to ask about the pickup in claims underlying growth normalized for the discrete storm revenue. I mean, it's a pretty big step-up. So I'm just trying to understand were there any other like onetime benefits in the quarter? Is this mostly about COVID recovery because the factors you cited were things like recovery in international travel, workers' comp or what I'm really looking for, was there like a pickup in like cross-selling and upselling trends in the business, and the stepped-up growth rate could be sustainable?\nLee Shavel : Thanks, Jeff. So I would say the general dimension has been that it has been the normalization of activity across the business in a couple of fronts, driving activity being one of that. I think that has had a positive improvement in some of our antifraud categories. Elizabeth made reference to some of the return to growth in our workers' comp businesses. And I think on the property estimating side, I think we've seen higher and more normalized levels of activity. Some of that -- well, excluding the actual storm revenue, I just -- I think we have seen more activity. I'd ask my colleague, Maroun Mourad, who leads our claims business if there's anything that he'd like to add to that, the general pickup that we've seen in the claims business.\nMaroun Mourad : Thank you. Thank you, Lee. Thank you, Jeff, for the question. We've been experiencing overall healthy growth across the different claims businesses that we've got. So in addition to the comments made by Elizabeth and Lee around property estimating solutions as well as the casualty workers' comp business, we continue to see the customer engagement that is resulting in very healthy growth activity across our antifraud suite of solutions. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.\nAlexander Hess : This is Alex Hess on for Andrew Steinerman. I want to ask maybe a bit about retention rate and the pressures you saw from Florida? And then as a sort of second part to that question, any sort of operational or balance sheet efficiency statistics you can provide for the standalone insurance Verisk? So to that Florida question, maybe what are -- what was your retention rate in '23 and then -- in '22 and what was it sort of ex Florida?\nLee Shavel : So, Alex, thanks. I would say we are experiencing continued high client retention rates. And I think what we talked about, there's been one liquidation in Florida. And so that's something that we have called out. But I don't think -- and I look to my colleague, Neil Spector, here to see if there are other than that situation, whether we have seen any changes in our overall retention on the underwriting side of the business. So I think those remain very solid. We're watching it carefully because of the risks in Florida. But to date, I think we've only had one liquidation. Neil, anything you'd like to add?\nNeil Spector : Thanks, Lee. No, I think you summarized it well. I would just say that while there are potential for liquidations down there, there's also new formations of companies that come into the market because there's need for coverage, which gives us opportunities. So just -- it isn't a one-way flow of businesses exiting, there's businesses entering as well, which helps offset some of that.\nLee Shavel : Thank you. And the question, I don't know on the operational and the balance sheet. Elizabeth, I think, can respond.\nElizabeth Mann : Yes. Thanks for that, Alex. We haven't -- I don't have any specific stats pulled out on that right now. But I think in general, the insurance business is the most cash flow generative and sort of the most capital efficient of our former businesses. It generates strong free cash flow, negative working capital characteristics and high kind of yields on EBITDA.\nLee Shavel : And when I think about balance sheet efficiency, Alex, I think the most striking thing is that with these dispositions, we have released a lot of capital that was not generating as high a return as in our core insurance businesses. And so I think you will see that in the return on invested capital, particularly as we utilize the proceeds to repurchase shares. That's probably the most significant balance sheet efficiency in my mind.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Greg Peters with Raymond James.\nGregory Peters : Lee, in your comments, you acknowledged all the changes that the company has gone through over the last year. Now that you're laser-focused on the insurance piece, can you talk about how you're tracking customer satisfaction? Specifically, is there something like a comprehensive customer survey that you're using, where you can collect unfiltered feedback rather than just looking at retention numbers and feedback you get at conferences?\nLee Shavel : Yes. Great. Thank you very much. And you really touched on something that we -- I think we have a good system. We undertake a survey and an NPS scoring twice a year. In 2022, that is in the mid-40s, which is consistent with where we've been before the pandemic and through the pandemic. And I think we saw an increase in that during the pandemic as a function of kind of a general lift from working from home, from our clients, some of the features that we offered through client experience that were well received but still a very solid number. So we undertake that, but we also have customer experience unit that is always looking to gauge the feedback that we receive from our clients on product experience. So at that level, we're trying to provide a number of means for them to communicate anonymously their level of satisfaction. I would also say anecdotally, we have intensified our efforts to engage at a senior level, particularly at C-suite with how we are providing value and solving problems for them. The feedback of knowing of -- their feedback to our renewed focus on just the insurance industry has been very positive. The outreach from some clients, where we haven't had a strong relationship, has been very positive, and we've actually seen a higher level of engagement from them as a result. So we're looking at that across at different layers. And so far, I think the response has been positive, and we'll continue to build on that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities.\nAndrew Jeffrey : I appreciate all the sort of succinct summation of the changes you made in your business. And the guidance, I agree, that's really helpful. We also appreciate all the callouts of the business drivers. Now that you're a pure-play, can you -- are there some areas where you think Verisk has particular ability to focus and accelerate growth? I'm thinking about life or extreme event modeling as we think more about climate change. I just wonder if there's more of a laser focus on areas we think Verisk has the ability to really leverage assets and potentially accelerate top line.\nLee Shavel : Yes. Andrew, thank you very much for the question. And I will -- I'll do my best to address it here. But I think we're really excited about drilling into that at Investor Day. So forgive me for another advertisement for Investor Day, but I really think that it will be a great opportunity for you to hear not only what I have to say strategically, but also hear it directly from the business and the investments that we're making. So I'm going to try to limit it to three. The first is, as you referenced, in new areas for us like life insurance and in marketing that are current needs for those businesses that we have the opportunity to penetrate the existing insurance industry or segments of the insurance industry that we have not served before are already delivering significant growth that enhances our overall growth rate. So we will continue to look for those opportunities. The second level is internationally, as we've described, also a penetration opportunity where our international businesses are growing faster. They represent an opportunity for us to deliver some of the data, the analytics and technology into those markets as well as developing new solutions. And so the success that we've had in UK we hope to follow up with success in Canada and in Continental Europe with some of our work there. And that's not just acquisition-driven. It's also integrating some of the features and products that we have in the U.S. And the third element that I would just point to is I think that we have a broader opportunity based upon the conversations that we've -- that I've had with other CEOs and other C-suite clients around the opportunity to improve the efficiency of the broader insurance industry. I think to my earlier point, I think we've been great on the products that are focused on specific underwriting or specific claims applications, but our ability to tie those solutions together, potentially find shared services or more automated solutions to address the hundreds of billions of dollars of expenditure by the industry is an area that has a very strong reception from the clients we've dealt with. One element that I'll tease that has gotten a lot of interest is our ability to digitize more of the forms elements and the standard policy language, which, as you can imagine, can sometimes expand exponentially with tweaks to that language. Being able to manage and track that on a digitized basis is part of the investment that we're making in our core lines reimagine. Those are the types of solutions where we can, given our centrality, given the data sets that we have really revolutionize the way that, that process is being handled, creating efficiencies across the industry as a whole. So that hopefully gives you a little bit of a start in terms of where we think we can find new areas to potentially expand that growth rate.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.\nJeff Silber : I wanted to focus on your auto underwriting and marketing that you talked about, actually a two-part question. Can you just remind us what your exposure is there? What it was as a percentage of revenues pre-pandemic, what it is now? And what gives you the confidence that these companies can really reset premiums within the next six to 12 months?\nLee Shavel : Yes. So one, I'm going to address the second part first. And then just also ask Elizabeth or Stacey to kind of refresh me on the overall exposure element. But I think we're confident because we are already seeing in a number of regulatory areas that those rate increases are being approved. There was a -- previously a bit of a delay, I think, because of elections that probably created some delay from a regulatory standpoint. We're now seeing those begin to emerge. I think a recognition that the inflationary costs that the auto insurers have borne is something that is legitimate needs to be factored into overall pricing. There are some areas that I think we're concerned about, particularly in California and approvals on that front. But I think we're getting a sense of momentum in those rate increases. And from an overall exposure standpoint...\nElizabeth Mann : Yes, we've said that the auto -- exposure to the auto industry is about 10% of our total insurance revenue.\nJeff Silber : And that's what it was or that's what it is now?\nElizabeth Mann : In general.\nLee Shavel : It has been at that level consistently. It hasn't changed materially.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.\nManav Patnaik : And first, thank you so much for the guidance details and providing that. I just had a question around the pricing environment. If you could just talk about what pricing -- how pricing fared, I guess, this year and then looking out into '23, if you should expect any incremental improvement versus that?\nLee Shavel : Yes. Thanks, Manav. So as you can appreciate, we have hundreds of products. And so each has a different pricing dynamic reflecting what we view as the demand elements for that, the value that we provide. And first and foremost, our primary pricing philosophy is driven by the value of the product and what it's delivering. And so we are often trying to calibrate pricing to be a fraction of the value that the client received. And when we think about our growth from pricing, it is primarily a reflection of our ability to deliver value to clients.  Now we also recognize that there is an element in our pricing that is tied to net premium growth. We are -- that is a factor. It has been a decreasing factor over time as other products not tied to that have grown faster. But that is an element where we are expecting some lift, given generally stronger premium growth as we've seen in different part of the businesses. And then finally, I would say going into 2023, reflecting somewhat of the higher inflationary environment and the imposed costs on us from a compensation standpoint, we have included a somewhat in certain instances, a higher inflationary component to reflect that reality as we think most of our clients have done in similar situations. So all of those factor into the guidance from a revenue standpoint as it relates to pricing. I would say, however, that while pricing and particularly the value-added element is the most important component, we do also expect contributions from new customers, from upsell with existing products, from growth from our new initiatives and our higher growth to contribute a like amount to our overall growth rate.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.\nAndrew Nicholas : I wanted to ask just in terms of kind of the top and bottom end of revenue guidance. Is it fair to say that the recovery of some of the headwinds you've called out the past couple of quarters on auto underwriting, marketing solutions and the sort are the primary drivers to the top and bottom end? Or are there other kind of puts and takes to call out that underlie the '23 guidance range?\nElizabeth Mann : Yes. Good question. Yes, as you flagged kind of one of the swing factors between the top and bottom end would be the recovery of some of the more sensitive -- macro sensitive parts of our business like auto. In general, with the 80% subscription revenue, there's a lot of stability in the overall. One or two other environment-related factors that I would point out that could contribute to the difference in that, the top and bottom end of that range as you say, the amount of storm-related revenue is inherently unpredictable, obviously. We have included some assumptions for that in the budget but a sort of moderate assumption in there. And then there's one or two other sort of macro-related factors like the level of cat loss activity and other things that could contribute to that range.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.\nAlexander Kramm : Quick clean-up question, and sorry if I missed it, I dropped earlier. But I don't think you guided on interest expense, and you gave us a couple of pieces here in terms of paying off some of the debt already in February. So can you just be a little bit more specific on what we should be expecting there? Because I think some people are struggling getting from your EBITDA guide to EPS.\nElizabeth Mann : Yes, it's a great question. We're not giving a specific number on interest guidance, but I can give you some dimensionality to it. I think if you look at our fourth quarter interest expense, that was obviously higher than it was kind of on a run rate basis for the full year. I think for 2023, we would assume that the interest expense is slightly less than it was in the fourth quarter annualized but higher than it was for kind of the full year of '22 or between those two factors.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank.\nFaiza Alwy : And I just want to say congratulations on executing all the changes in 2022, and thank you from me also on providing guidance. Today, I wanted to just go back on margins and specifically about the 2024 goals. The range is still pretty wide. And wanted to get a sense of what are some of the factors that would take you to the low end of the range versus the high end of the range?\nElizabeth Mann : Yes. Thanks, Faiza, for the question. Really, we're here today to talk about the quarter and the 2023 view. So sort of longer-term discussions, we'll talk about at Investor Day.\nLee Shavel : Yes. And Faiza, I would just say, look, we clearly an objective of delivering on that, and we want to demonstrate our ability to improve that margin. Longer term, I think what we'll talk about are the trade-offs between investment and margin and the value that the investment can deliver in terms of growth and returns. I think that's not a new dynamic. That's something that we have always worked to try to find a balance to demonstrate margin strength, but also not at the cost of delivering where we think value is created most significantly, which is through growth and returns. But we are fully committed to delivering on the guidance that we set initially of that 53% to 56% range, and we're working to deliver a strong result as we possibly can.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time, which concludes today's conference.

            "name": "Lee Shavel",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you, Stacey, and thanks to you all for participating today. We've really been looking forward to this call because it's our first opportunity to reintroduce Verisk in our new insurance-focused configuration, to discuss the momentum in the fourth quarter and given all the structural changes, give you a forward view of our expected performance in 2023. We accomplished an extraordinary amount in 2022, so let me provide a brief summary. First, there's been a lot of structural change. In March, we sold 3E, our environmental health and safety business, for net cash proceeds of $575 million. In April, we sold Verisk Financial Services for net cash proceeds of approximately $500 million. And most recently in February, we sold Wood Mackenzie for approximately $3.1 billion. We've begun the process of returning a substantial majority of the after-tax proceeds of those transactions to shareholders through share repurchases as promised. Despite a challenging economic, geopolitical and financing environment, we were able to complete these transactions at attractive valuations through the strong underlying businesses, capable management teams and a well-organized sale process. Let's turn to governance change. Structural change wasn't the only transition at Verisk. We also made a number of governance changes that shareholders suggested. We are transitioning to a declassified Board with annual elections. We added four new directors with fresh perspectives and experiences: Jeff Dailey, Wendy Lane, Olumide Soroye and Kim Stevenson. We separated the Chairman and CEO role with the election of Bruce Hansen as our new Chair. I have to personally thank Bruce for his advice and leadership through my transition. As a former CEO, he's been a great coach to me as have been all of our directors. Let's turn to organizational change. Finally, organizationally, we've had substantial change. In addition to Scott Stephenson's retirement last year, Mark Anquillare stepping down in January and the addition of Elizabeth Mann as our CFO, we have made over a dozen changes in senior management. These have enabled the next generation of management to rise, bringing new energy and fresh perspectives how we can make Verisk better. At the highest level, I have reconstituted our Senior Operating Committee with 10 colleagues, six of whom are new to the committee, who represent a better balance of business unit leaders and corporate leaders for improved integration and coordination. I'm also proud that the committee represents 50% gender diversity and 40% ethnic diversity, a strong signal for our entire organization. We all share the common mission of creating value for our clients, employees and shareholders.  With all this change, we were, of course, carefully watching for disruption with our employees and clients. While there is some understandable anxiety with any organizational change, the feedback from employees at three town halls, anonymous surveys and informal feedback has been very positive with enthusiasm for our refocused strategy in insurance and new leadership. In particular, our purpose of working together to build global resilience for individuals, communities and businesses has resonated strongly with our employees as has our new cultural values of learning, caring and results. As I believe all of you can appreciate, what we accomplished in terms of structure and organizational change in 2022 was no foregone conclusion, and the delivery of a clear view of our insurance-only operations in our 10-K was a massively complex exercise. It required the effort, expertise and commitment of hundreds of our employees to accomplish. So I'd like to take this opportunity to personally thank all of our nearly 7,000 employees for their professionalism, commitment and understanding as we have undergone so much change in 2022. They are absolutely talented and critical to our future success. What we accomplished this year demonstrates what we're capable of ahead. On the client front, we have also received a positive response from many clients who appreciate our renewed insurance focus and desire to improve our relationships across their organizations. I experienced this first-hand at our Elevate Conference in Salt Lake City and dozens of client meetings and calls. Their feedback reinforces that while we have been a great product organization, we can be a much better client organization. And that's an area where I'm dedicating substantial time and leading from the front. I spent most of my career as a client professional, and I'm excited to be returning to this particular role. Let's move to financial change. I won't steal Elizabeth's thunder on the financials. However, there are two elements that matter most to me in our 2022 performance and what we intend to achieve in 2023. First is our ability to continue to deliver strong revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth despite the changes and challenging environment in 2022 and the clear momentum in the fourth quarter results. We have clearly demonstrated what Verisk is capable of in the fourth quarter by delivering organic constant currency revenue growth of over 7% in the insurance-only business even after eliminating the impact of storms.  I'd also note that fiscal year 2022, the insurance OCC revenue growth of 6.5% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 8% is a solid result for a year of substantial change and macroeconomic challenges and is a strong reflection of the stability of our business and a good foundation to build on to in 2023 and beyond. Second is our delivery of clear margin improvement consistent with the clear goals we set for the insurance-focused business of 300 basis points to 500 basis points improvement from a normalized base of 50% to 51% in 2021. At 52.7% for the fourth quarter, we are on the cusp of delivering at the low end of our targeted range of 53% to 56% for 2024. And our guidance for 2023 is for adjusted EBITDA margin to be between 53% and 54%. Finally, we are providing expanded financial guidance for 2023 as a reflection of the complex structural changes in 2022 as well as an expectation of more predictable growth with our refocused business. This decision also reflects the input from many of our shareholders who ask for improved financial guidance. Naturally, it will come with the necessary caveats that we can't predict all contingencies but represents our best assessment of 2023 financial performance. So where does that leave us after all of these changes? We are, as of this moment, a new Verisk, new structurally, organizationally and with a reenergized and refocused purpose values. There's a lot that you'll be familiar with, including our insurance focus, industry centrality, strong market position, stable growth and strong margins and some new elements that are expanding our growth opportunities in areas such as life assurance, marketing solutions and in our European businesses, including specialty business solutions, where we are improving workflows and efficiency in the Lloyd's nonstandard market. You will also see changes in our expense discipline to drive margin expansion and a new approach to providing financial guidance for the year ahead. Let's step back and take a moment to reframe our opportunity. The insurance industry is massive, complex and growing globally. Our clients face substantial technology, regulatory and macroeconomic challenges in a rapidly evolving environment. This is less an assertion than an often repeated sentiment that I hear from the leaders of our clients. One of my favorite client quotes was, \"Lee, we need Verisk's help to address this, but more importantly, the industry needs Verisk's help.\" That crystallizes our opportunity and position. You'll hear at Investor Day from several clients that Verisk is considered a true business partner rather than a vendor and that we work together to collectively solve problems for the insurance industry. We create value for our clients through a simple economic mechanism. We invest in data, analytics and software at scale to address industry needs much more efficiently than individual companies can. We are addressing hundreds of billions of dollars of premiums and expense across the industry to improve revenue growth, risk outcomes, fund experience, productivity and margins. These investments deliver real value to the industry and in turn, drive our growth, operating leverage and high incremental returns on capital. Much of this opportunity is realized by facilitating connectivity across the insurance ecosystem. Hence, the theme of our annual report for 2022: Connecting What Matters. To connect, you must be central. You must be trusted, and you must understand the needs of the ecosystem. No company is better positioned than Verisk with our scale, relationships and expertise to create this value for the insurance industry. We're very proud of what we accomplished in 2022, but it was all to put us in this position where we can demonstrate our full potential, focused on serving the substantial and expanding needs of the insurance industry. With a reconfigured and energized organization bound together by a common purpose and values, we are very excited about the path ahead and can already feel the benefits of this better integrated and focused approach. This is the way. As our 2023 financial guidance implies and as you'll hear at our upcoming Investor Day, we believe this path will see continued growth, improving margins and strong returns on capital. I'll end with thanks to our shareholders who encouraged us to consider new approaches and offered their perspectives directly or indirectly through surveys and our analyst community. We and our Board have listened carefully. And our actions and path ahead clearly reflect your input. We are here to expand the opportunity, execute on the plan and deliver value on your behalf. I can't imagine us being in a better position to do so, and we're off to a solid start. With that, I'll hand it over to Elizabeth to review our financial results for the quarter, the year and our financial guidance for 2023. Thanks, Elizabeth. In summary, we are excited to focus all our attention, talent and resources on the global insurance industry where we can deliver substantial value to our clients through improved decision-making and operational efficiency. We will be engaged more intensively as a strategic technology partner to our clients and the broader insurance industry to identify and develop ways for Verisk to support their objectives. With our scale, relationships and expertise, we are well positioned to help make those connections in this period of accelerated change for the industry and by extension, to the people and communities they serve. Our motivating purpose is to work together with our clients in building resilience for individuals, communities and businesses globally. Combined with our focused business model and unique market position, this is a formula that will deliver value to our shareholders through growth and returns. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question.  With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions. Thanks, Toni. I'm going to hand it over to Elizabeth to start. Yes. And Toni, I'll just add, I think we're very comfortable in our ability to meet those targets, to build on that while still continuing to support the growth objectives that we have for the business. It's like a four-part question. So let's choose -- I would consider that multiple choice. So... Yes. Thank you for the question. Let me try to address the components of that. So I think I outlined in my comments the general strategy where we are looking to make investments in data or technology that solve industry problems that we can monetize across that industry. And that strategy really holds across the business. Internationally where we've had a very solid success of finding businesses that have established products in international context, and I'll use our acquisition of Sequel as an example, we have taken that business. We have found ways to support that with addition of other components such as a rate-making component or a binding component in that business that add value to the total offering for our business, thereby integrating components for the market participants in that ecosystem. We will continue to look for opportunities to leverage those types of additions as well as data sets and functionality that we have within the U.S. business. We recently made an acquisition in Sweden, and you may be familiar with both our acquisitions of ACTINEO in Germany and Opta where we're deploying similar strategies. And generally, across our international businesses, we have been able to deliver growth faster than our overall rate and generally in the double-digit range because of the penetration opportunities we have within those marketplaces. So hopefully that ties together with our general strategy and how it applies internationally and the contributions to growth from each of those elements. Thanks, Jeff. So I would say the general dimension has been that it has been the normalization of activity across the business in a couple of fronts, driving activity being one of that. I think that has had a positive improvement in some of our antifraud categories. Elizabeth made reference to some of the return to growth in our workers' comp businesses. And I think on the property estimating side, I think we've seen higher and more normalized levels of activity. Some of that -- well, excluding the actual storm revenue, I just -- I think we have seen more activity. I'd ask my colleague, Maroun Mourad, who leads our claims business if there's anything that he'd like to add to that, the general pickup that we've seen in the claims business. So, Alex, thanks. I would say we are experiencing continued high client retention rates. And I think what we talked about, there's been one liquidation in Florida. And so that's something that we have called out. But I don't think -- and I look to my colleague, Neil Spector, here to see if there are other than that situation, whether we have seen any changes in our overall retention on the underwriting side of the business. So I think those remain very solid. We're watching it carefully because of the risks in Florida. But to date, I think we've only had one liquidation. Neil, anything you'd like to add? Thank you. And the question, I don't know on the operational and the balance sheet. Elizabeth, I think, can respond. And when I think about balance sheet efficiency, Alex, I think the most striking thing is that with these dispositions, we have released a lot of capital that was not generating as high a return as in our core insurance businesses. And so I think you will see that in the return on invested capital, particularly as we utilize the proceeds to repurchase shares. That's probably the most significant balance sheet efficiency in my mind. Yes. Great. Thank you very much. And you really touched on something that we -- I think we have a good system. We undertake a survey and an NPS scoring twice a year. In 2022, that is in the mid-40s, which is consistent with where we've been before the pandemic and through the pandemic. And I think we saw an increase in that during the pandemic as a function of kind of a general lift from working from home, from our clients, some of the features that we offered through client experience that were well received but still a very solid number. So we undertake that, but we also have customer experience unit that is always looking to gauge the feedback that we receive from our clients on product experience. So at that level, we're trying to provide a number of means for them to communicate anonymously their level of satisfaction. I would also say anecdotally, we have intensified our efforts to engage at a senior level, particularly at C-suite with how we are providing value and solving problems for them. The feedback of knowing of -- their feedback to our renewed focus on just the insurance industry has been very positive. The outreach from some clients, where we haven't had a strong relationship, has been very positive, and we've actually seen a higher level of engagement from them as a result. So we're looking at that across at different layers. And so far, I think the response has been positive, and we'll continue to build on that. Yes. Andrew, thank you very much for the question. And I will -- I'll do my best to address it here. But I think we're really excited about drilling into that at Investor Day. So forgive me for another advertisement for Investor Day, but I really think that it will be a great opportunity for you to hear not only what I have to say strategically, but also hear it directly from the business and the investments that we're making. So I'm going to try to limit it to three. The first is, as you referenced, in new areas for us like life insurance and in marketing that are current needs for those businesses that we have the opportunity to penetrate the existing insurance industry or segments of the insurance industry that we have not served before are already delivering significant growth that enhances our overall growth rate. So we will continue to look for those opportunities. The second level is internationally, as we've described, also a penetration opportunity where our international businesses are growing faster. They represent an opportunity for us to deliver some of the data, the analytics and technology into those markets as well as developing new solutions. And so the success that we've had in UK we hope to follow up with success in Canada and in Continental Europe with some of our work there. And that's not just acquisition-driven. It's also integrating some of the features and products that we have in the U.S. And the third element that I would just point to is I think that we have a broader opportunity based upon the conversations that we've -- that I've had with other CEOs and other C-suite clients around the opportunity to improve the efficiency of the broader insurance industry. I think to my earlier point, I think we've been great on the products that are focused on specific underwriting or specific claims applications, but our ability to tie those solutions together, potentially find shared services or more automated solutions to address the hundreds of billions of dollars of expenditure by the industry is an area that has a very strong reception from the clients we've dealt with. One element that I'll tease that has gotten a lot of interest is our ability to digitize more of the forms elements and the standard policy language, which, as you can imagine, can sometimes expand exponentially with tweaks to that language. Being able to manage and track that on a digitized basis is part of the investment that we're making in our core lines reimagine. Those are the types of solutions where we can, given our centrality, given the data sets that we have really revolutionize the way that, that process is being handled, creating efficiencies across the industry as a whole. So that hopefully gives you a little bit of a start in terms of where we think we can find new areas to potentially expand that growth rate. Yes. So one, I'm going to address the second part first. And then just also ask Elizabeth or Stacey to kind of refresh me on the overall exposure element. But I think we're confident because we are already seeing in a number of regulatory areas that those rate increases are being approved. There was a -- previously a bit of a delay, I think, because of elections that probably created some delay from a regulatory standpoint. We're now seeing those begin to emerge. I think a recognition that the inflationary costs that the auto insurers have borne is something that is legitimate needs to be factored into overall pricing. There are some areas that I think we're concerned about, particularly in California and approvals on that front. But I think we're getting a sense of momentum in those rate increases. And from an overall exposure standpoint... It has been at that level consistently. It hasn't changed materially. Yes. Thanks, Manav. So as you can appreciate, we have hundreds of products. And so each has a different pricing dynamic reflecting what we view as the demand elements for that, the value that we provide. And first and foremost, our primary pricing philosophy is driven by the value of the product and what it's delivering. And so we are often trying to calibrate pricing to be a fraction of the value that the client received. And when we think about our growth from pricing, it is primarily a reflection of our ability to deliver value to clients.  Now we also recognize that there is an element in our pricing that is tied to net premium growth. We are -- that is a factor. It has been a decreasing factor over time as other products not tied to that have grown faster. But that is an element where we are expecting some lift, given generally stronger premium growth as we've seen in different part of the businesses. And then finally, I would say going into 2023, reflecting somewhat of the higher inflationary environment and the imposed costs on us from a compensation standpoint, we have included a somewhat in certain instances, a higher inflationary component to reflect that reality as we think most of our clients have done in similar situations. So all of those factor into the guidance from a revenue standpoint as it relates to pricing. I would say, however, that while pricing and particularly the value-added element is the most important component, we do also expect contributions from new customers, from upsell with existing products, from growth from our new initiatives and our higher growth to contribute a like amount to our overall growth rate. Yes. And Faiza, I would just say, look, we clearly an objective of delivering on that, and we want to demonstrate our ability to improve that margin. Longer term, I think what we'll talk about are the trade-offs between investment and margin and the value that the investment can deliver in terms of growth and returns. I think that's not a new dynamic. That's something that we have always worked to try to find a balance to demonstrate margin strength, but also not at the cost of delivering where we think value is created most significantly, which is through growth and returns. But we are fully committed to delivering on the guidance that we set initially of that 53% to 56% range, and we're working to deliver a strong result as we possibly can."

            "name": "Elizabeth Mann",
            "content": "Thanks, Lee, and good day to everyone on the call. Before I start with the fourth quarter results, I have a few reminders for everyone. First, all consolidated and GAAP numbers are negatively impacted by the dispositions of 3E and Verisk Financial Services. This effect will continue through the first quarter of 2023 when we will anniversary those transactions. Second, as we described previously, due to its materiality, Wood Mackenzie is accounted for as discontinued operations beginning this quarter. And its results are not included in our revenue or adjusted EBITDA results in either the current period or the prior period. Third, in the earnings presentation now posted on the Investors section of our website, we have included certain pro forma quarterly financial metrics, removing the operational results of all our divestitures as well as a reconciliation to our historical reported results, which we hope you will find helpful. Turning now to the financial results. I'm pleased to share that we had a strong finish to 2022. For the fourth quarter, on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue was $630 million, up slightly versus the prior year, reflecting growth in insurance, offset by the impact of the VFS and 3E dispositions. Income from continuing operations was $216 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share attributable to Verisk was $1.37. Moving to our organic constant currency results adjusted for non-operating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, we are very pleased with our operating results, which demonstrated strong sequential improvement relative to the third quarter as a broad-based recovery across our business contributed to the strongest quarter of the year. In the fourth quarter, OCC revenues grew 8.1% with growth of 6.5% in underwriting and rating and 11.9% in claims. This quarter's results included $5.6 million in storm-related revenue associated with Hurricane Ian. Excluding the storm-related revenues, OCC revenue would have grown 7.1%. Our subscription revenues, which comprise 80% of our total revenue in the quarter, grew 7.2% on an OCC basis. We saw broad-based growth across most of our businesses with strength in core underwriting, property estimating solutions, extreme events, antifraud and life insurance solutions. We did experience a modest negative impact from the liquidations in Florida. As we noted in previous calls, Florida has been a trouble spot for the insurance industry, and the losses from Hurricane Ian add complication. In 2022, the market saw six liquidations. And so far in '23, we have seen one company placed into receivership after higher-than-expected losses from Hurricane Ian, which is the carrier into insolvency. We continue to work to offset this headwind through engagement with our customers by helping them adapt to Florida's new roof coverage rules and by better segmenting risk using both new and existing sources such as our roof age data and aerial imagery. Our analytics have been integrated into our LightSpeed platform and can help customers leverage data earlier in their quoting process, ensuring they underwrite risk appropriately as well as help drive non-rate action for in-force policies. Transactional OCC revenue growth of 12.1%, representing 20% of total revenue in the fourth quarter, also improved from the third quarter, reflecting the revenues associated with Hurricane Ian. Adjusting for the storm impact, transactional growth was a healthy 8.2% comprised of continued strong recovery in international travel, strong sales of life insurance solutions and a modest contribution from our workers' compensation business, which is improving though, continues to be below pre-pandemic levels. This was offset in part by continued weakness across auto underwriting and marketing solutions. On the auto underwriting side, we continue to see cyclical softness across our auto underwriting and marketing solutions as carriers are dealing with the impact of rising inflation and increasing loss ratios. To that end, carriers have pulled back on underwriting new auto policies as well as on marketing spending to drive new policy volume and customer acquisition. Carriers are working to reset pricing, which we think could take another six to 12 months to truly take effect. To help our customers bridge this uncertain time and drive growth for Verisk, we are working with them to help identify ways to improve profitability with targeted non-rate actions that minimize premium leakage. We are actively engaging with customers about our risk check renewal product, which allows insurance -- which allows insurers to analyze an entire book of business with minimal IT resources and pinpoint policies that require attention. Moving now to our adjusted EBITDA results. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 12.9% in the fourth quarter, reflecting core operating leverage and the impact of certain cost reduction actions we have taken in connection with our margin expansion objectives. Total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results, was 52.7%, up 210 basis points from the reported results in the prior year, reflecting the benefit from recent dispositions, strong cost and operational discipline, the impact of certain cost reduction actions and the high incremental margins associated with storm-related revenue. This level of margin also includes a number of margin headwinds, including approximately 110 basis points from recent acquisitions as well as 80 basis points from the headwinds from our ongoing technological transformation and higher T&E expenses. In addition, this quarter included certain onetime or non-operating expenses including severance, FX impact and a decrease in our pension credit, which collectively negatively impacted margins by 190 basis points.  Finally, if you compare the fourth quarter margins on a pro forma basis for all divestitures, the 4Q 2022 margins of 52.7% represent an 80 basis point margin expansion from 51.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021 pro forma. Reflecting on our objective to deliver 300 basis points to 500 basis points of margin improvement in 2024 from a normalized base of 50% to 51% in 2021, we took great strides in 2022 with full year adjusted EBITDA margin of 52% on a pro forma basis, reflecting approximately 140 basis points of margin expansion associated with our operational excellence focus. To date, we have made decisions and taken actions to address more than 60% of the run rate cost savings we are targeting. The impact of those actions will be realized through 2024 with about 30% of the cumulated expected cost savings already achieved in the reported results in 2022. Our business continues to demonstrate the operating leverage embedded in our data analytics business model. And we have confidence in our ability to deliver on the objective in 2024. Interest expense. Interest expense totaled $41 million for the fourth quarter compared to $30.2 million in the prior year. For the full year, interest expense totaled $139 million versus $127 million in 2021. This increase in interest expense is related to higher balances on our revolving credit facility as well as higher interest rates. We have paid off all borrowings under our credit facility as of February 2023. And in the near term, we'll look to establish a go-forward balance sheet for the business, staying within our targeted leverage range of 2x to 3x adjusted EBITDA. Taxes. Our reported effective tax rate was 9.9% compared to 16.8% in the prior year quarter. This lower tax rate included a onetime benefit of approximately $30 million, which was primarily the result of transaction benefits related to our Wood Mackenzie divestiture, offset in part by lower stock compensation benefits versus the prior year period. For the full year '22, our effective tax rate was 17.5% as compared to 22.8% in the prior year, including approximately $67.7 million in benefits related to all our dispositions throughout the year. The net effect of these transaction-related tax benefits was a reduction in our full year effective tax rate of 5.4%. Adjusted net income and diluted adjusted EPS. Adjusted net income increased 14% to $225 million, and diluted adjusted EPS increased 18% to $1.43 for the fourth quarter '22. These changes reflect organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions, a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count. Capital returns. During the fourth quarter, we returned $514 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends as our strong cash flow allows us to consistently return capital to shareholders while also investing in our business. In particular, included in that amount is $366 million of share repurchases we have completed since the announcement of the Wood Mackenzie transaction back in November. In the coming days, we intend to enter into an additional $2.5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement for a total capital return of $2.87 billion associated with the transaction proceeds. This is consistent with our plan to return the majority of the proceeds from the Wood Mackenzie divestiture to shareholders via share repurchases. We continue to expect the dilution from the transaction to be within the 4% to 6% range. Looking ahead to 2023, as Lee mentioned, we have listened to shareholder feedback, and we'll now be providing annual financial guidance. We have posted a summary of all guidance measures in the earnings deck on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. Specifically, for 2023, we expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $2.59 billion to $2.63 billion versus $2.437 billion in 2022 pro forma. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.37 billion to $1.42 billion versus $1.266 billion in 2022 pro forma and adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 53% to 54%. Working further down the P&L, we expect fixed asset D&A to be between $175 million and $195 million and intangible amortization to be approximately $70 million. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to FX variability, the timing of purchases, the completion of projects and future M&A activity. We also expect capital expenditures to be between $200 million and $230 million as we continue to invest organically behind our highest return on investment opportunities. These include a modernization of our core line services to digitize our industry standard offering and enable expansion into new workflows that improve productivity for the industry. We are also investing in an upgrade of our financial and human capital systems that will enable future efficiencies once implemented. As previously communicated, we expect the tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%, bringing adjusted earnings per share to a range of $5.20 to $5.50. This range represents strong double-digit growth rates on EPS after normalizing for the impact of transaction tax benefits in 2022. Before I turn the call over to Lee, I just want to remind everyone that we're hosting an Investor Day on March 14 here in Jersey City, where we will provide more transparency and clarity on our strategic profile, growth drivers and long-term financial targets. And now I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments. Thanks, Toni. I don't think it changes our overall strategy. We are committed to the targets delivering in '24. We're happy to be in the low end of that range already ahead of schedule. But we'll maintain that level of focus on margin while still maintaining investment in the business as we have been balancing so far. Yes. Thanks. We remain committed to that range. Right now, I'm here talking about 2023, I think there's been some headwinds in '22 that we've talked about previously as well as some benefits to the business. So on balance, we're committed to the range. Yes. Let me talk a little bit about that. If you start with the baseline '22 of 52% that pro forma, that already includes the headwinds from stranded costs, and it includes most of the headwinds from recent M&A. As we move forward on that, there is still a little bit more headwinds from those previously identified items in our baseline, call it, about 30 basis points collectively from ongoing impact of the T&E normalization, the cloud and technology investments, including some of the financial and capital systems that we talked about. So all those investments, 30 basis points.  There's probably still 30 basis points of headwind also from the pension credit, which we know today based on current assumptions will be -- will continue to be a drag in 2023. Offsetting that, you'll see -- so that's about 60 basis points. Collectively, that's offsetting about 150 basis points to 250 basis points of sort of core operating leverage. I haven't broken that down between operating leverage, gross impact and the cost savings target, but those are all included in that 150 basis points to 250 basis points, bringing us to the net of 100 basis points to 200 basis points margin expansion. I'll try to hit the main points there. So on the OCC revenue growth, we haven't given that on a forecasted basis. We will report that out as the quarters develop. The one piece of slice for you, for 2023, the acquisitions that roll in from inorganic to organic are not -- don't create a major swing in the growth rates. And obviously, FX is -- we're not predicting. In terms of -- you asked about the quarterly cadence of how that plays out, there's nothing that we see here today that would imply a meaningful swing in the quarters from a financial perspective. If you look at the OCC comparability results to 2022, those could have some swings just based on the swings in '22. Yes. Thanks for that, Alex. We haven't -- I don't have any specific stats pulled out on that right now. But I think in general, the insurance business is the most cash flow generative and sort of the most capital efficient of our former businesses. It generates strong free cash flow, negative working capital characteristics and high kind of yields on EBITDA. Yes, we've said that the auto -- exposure to the auto industry is about 10% of our total insurance revenue. In general. Yes. Good question. Yes, as you flagged kind of one of the swing factors between the top and bottom end would be the recovery of some of the more sensitive -- macro sensitive parts of our business like auto. In general, with the 80% subscription revenue, there's a lot of stability in the overall. One or two other environment-related factors that I would point out that could contribute to the difference in that, the top and bottom end of that range as you say, the amount of storm-related revenue is inherently unpredictable, obviously. We have included some assumptions for that in the budget but a sort of moderate assumption in there. And then there's one or two other sort of macro-related factors like the level of cat loss activity and other things that could contribute to that range. Yes, it's a great question. We're not giving a specific number on interest guidance, but I can give you some dimensionality to it. I think if you look at our fourth quarter interest expense, that was obviously higher than it was kind of on a run rate basis for the full year. I think for 2023, we would assume that the interest expense is slightly less than it was in the fourth quarter annualized but higher than it was for kind of the full year of '22 or between those two factors. Yes. Thanks, Faiza, for the question. Really, we're here today to talk about the quarter and the 2023 view. So sort of longer-term discussions, we'll talk about at Investor Day."

Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After today\u2019s prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk\u2019s Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.\nStacey Brodbar: Thank you, Savannah, and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our third quarter 2022 financial results. On the call today are Lee Shavel, Verisk\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; Mark Anquillare, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Elizabeth Mann, Chief Financial Officer.

A reconciliation is provided in our 8-K. And now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our CEO, Lee Shavel.\nLee Shavel: Thanks, Stacey, and good day, everyone. Before I jump into the earnings results, I want to officially welcome Elizabeth Mann to Verisk. Elizabeth brings operational and corporate finance experience from her three years at S&P Global capital markets and strategic sophistication from her 12 years of investment banking experience at Goldman Sachs, and finally, an impressive academic foundation and enthusiasm for mathematics that fits perfectly into our analytical culture. She is coming up the curve quickly and has already established herself as a valued part of the team. I\u2019m pleased to share that we delivered on our stated intention to become a global insurance-focused data analytics and technology company. As we announced on Monday, we have signed a definitive agreement to sell Wood Mackenzie to Veritas Capital for $3.1 billion in cash consideration, payable at closing, plus future additional contingent consideration of up to $200 million. Our ability to achieve this result in the midst of a deteriorating deal environment speaks to the quality of the asset and the momentum of the business. Wood Mackenzie is the globally recognized leader in natural resources intelligence, with in-depth proprietary data sets and subject matter experts that cover the full energy and natural resource value chain. Since we acquired Wood Mackenzie in 2015, the business has increased revenue and EBITDA; integrated acquisitions; developed new areas of growth in the energy transition, chemicals and metals and mining; and most recently, upgraded their client platform, Lens. This has transformed Wood Mackenzie from an advisory services business focused on transactional research and consulting to a data analytics business bolstered by long-term subscription contracts, a leading brand and market position. We have been honored to work with and support our friends and colleagues at Wood Mackenzie and we wish them well and look forward to their continued growth and success under the proven leadership of Mark Brinin and Joe Levesque, and their respected future owners, Veritas Capital. The future for Wood Mackenzie is very bright, and we look forward to having an ongoing productive relationship with them. This transaction, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023, will best position Wood Mackenzie to fully capitalize on secular industry tailwinds, including the energy transition and deliver on the growth opportunity that lies ahead. The closing of this transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. Going forward, the Wood Mackenzie business will be reported as discontinued operations beginning with Verisk\u2019s fourth quarter earnings report and 10-K filing. We plan to use the approximate $3.1 billion in proceeds, primarily for share repurchases and debt paydown. After accounting for share repurchase and debt paydown, we expect this transaction to be modestly dilutive to Verisk\u2019s earnings in the range of 4% to 6%. That said, over the longer term, we believe the deal will bring Verisk the added benefit of increased focus on our core insurance business, more consistent growth in line with our long-term targets and improved return on capital, which should drive shareholder value. Now let me turn my attention to our third quarter earnings results. Verisk delivered solid third quarter results as we partner with our customers to help them navigate through environmental challenges in the marketplace, including inflation and elevated losses in certain lines of insurance. Adjusted for the impact of the suspension of commercial operations in Russia, Verisk delivered mid-single-digit organic constant currency revenue growth and margin expansion, resulting in organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth of 7%. This performance reflects our focus on cost discipline, operational efficiency and the early benefits of initial steps taken in previously announced margin improvement initiative. Elizabeth will provide more detail in her financial review. On our EBITDA margin expansion objective, we continue to be confident in our ability to achieve our stated target to deliver 300 to 500 basis points of margin expansion by 2024, an insurance-only baseline of 50% to 51% normalized adjusted EBITDA margins. We have taken actions to enhance operating efficiency, improve productivity and streamline processes. During the quarter, we eliminated certain roles across the organization, sunset legacy products and reduced office square footage. Additionally, we entered into an agreement to sublease our data center to a third-party as we move more of our computing infrastructure to the cloud, delivering long-term savings for Verisk. We have also advanced on our future of data collection project, where we are improving the efficiency and productivity of our field force, which not only saves money, but enhances our solutions. We expect that over the next two years, about half of our identified cost savings will come from headcount actions, about 25% from reductions in spending from IT infrastructure and about 25% from third-party spending, including real estate. To-date, we have made decisions and taken actions to address more than half of the cost savings we are targeting. Turning to our customers. Our Insurance customers continue to be generally healthy while they\u2019re dealing with the cross-currents of inflation and increasing loss ratios, which are negatively impacting profitability across the industry. This is having a disproportionate impact in personal lines, insurtech companies and certain geographic markets. While insurers are increasing rates to help cover inflation in repair costs, it takes time to get rates approved by the regulators and then implement it across the entire book of business. To-date, premium growth has not yet caught up to loss costs. Specifically, in personal auto, we continue to see pressure on underwriting activity across the industry as insurance providers are holding back on writing new business. In fact, combined ratios across the industry continue to trend lower, and as a result, insurers are cutting back on marketing spend as a way to protect profitability. The net result is lower transactional revenues for Verisk across both our personal lines and auto underwriting solutions as well as certain of our marketing solutions. We believe this is a cyclical issue and will abate over time. As we noted last quarter, Florida is a trouble spot for the insurance industry, and the losses from Hurricane Ian add complication. We are experiencing an increasing level of insolvencies across the market, with four companies liquidating just this quarter, while other carriers are electing to exit the market entirely. This has had a negative impact on both our subscription and transactional revenues. To address these issues and drive future growth, our sales teams are engaged with the new entrants into the market as well as expanding our relationship with a state-backed insurer to help price and select risk. We are also working with our existing customers to help them understand the impact of inflation across their book of business and to help them price the risks accordingly as policies come up for renewal. Apart from the near-term challenges, we continue to believe that the opportunity for Verisk to address the long-term strategic and operating needs of the insurance industry remains substantial. In my many conversations with insurance CEOs, they have consistently encouraged us to develop a more strategic dialogue and how we can help the industry address technology, regulatory and operating issues, leveraging our unique and legacy position as an effective utility for the industry. To that objective, we have been coordinating a series of CEO and CIO roundtables to develop solutions that can improve industry operating efficiency and capital efficiency as well as productivity. While these initiatives will take time to develop and implement, they represent a substantial incremental opportunity for Verisk. We are very excited about the opportunity to engage with the industry at the strategic level and broaden our technology partnership with them. In recognition of our commitment to innovate on behalf of clients, Verisk was recognized by Celent as a Luminary for developing innovative solutions that help property, casualty and life insurers detect claims fraud. Our solutions were recognized by highly advanced functionality and ability to integrate with third-party data, driving faster outcomes and a more accurate claims experience. Similarly, we are committed to creating value for our employees, which includes providing an exceptional workplace. And we were awarded the Great Place to Work designation this year in the U.S., UK, India, Spain and New York. We were also recognized as a Great Place to Work for Women in the UK. In today\u2019s rapidly evolving workplace, we are focused on talent attraction, development and retention by supporting our teammates\u2019 passion and having a purpose-driven culture that allows unlimited success. Finally, as a demonstration of our commitment to ESG priorities, Verisk has been ranked third out of 100 Best ESG Companies in 2022 by Investor\u2019s Business Daily. The list recognized companies with superior environmental, social and governance ratings, in addition to fundamental and technical stock performance. We are honored to receive this recognition for our commitment to sustainability and the ability of our strong and growing business to meet customer and investor expectations. As we move forward, I am more confident than ever that with our proprietary data sets, talented and dedicated people, deep industry knowledge and technical expertise, Verisk is best positioned to create value for our customers by helping them evolve in a new digital environment, integrate rapidly growing data sets and achieve new levels of efficiency. This, in turn, will create value for our employees and shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Mark for some more color on the Insurance business performance.\nMark Anquillare: Thanks, Lee. I\u2019m pleased to share that the Insurance segment delivered another solid quarter. In Insurance, we are experiencing strong growth in subscription revenues across both underwriting and claims, resulting in OCC subscription growth of 6.1% for the segment overall. Within Underwriting, we had strong results from core underwriting, extreme event solutions and our international businesses. We also had healthy contribution with double-digit growth achieved in certain of our newer acquired businesses, including life insurance and specialty business software solutions. Extreme event solutions had a strong quarter, driven by the addition of new customers to our core Touchstone Platform as well as the expansion of multi-year deals with existing customers. New environment of rising inflation, insurers and reinsurers are challenged to keep up with the growth in their exposures. To help our customers understand the risk of the inflation and assess their exposures, we recently released our 2022 Global Modeled Catastrophe Losses Report, detailing key global financial loss metrics based on our latest suite of catastrophe models. Additionally, we are supporting insurers with a broad array of property data solutions so that they can ensure they\u2019re keeping up with the impacts of inflation and have a more informed view of risk and ongoing exposures. Our sustainability and country risk business also had a very strong quarter as demand for our risk indices in both the corporate and investor segments continue to drive strong double-digit growth. We\u2019re also beginning to get traction with the expansion of our sustainability offerings into the Insurance segment. Within Life Insurance, we\u2019re delivering strong double-digit growth through the addition of new customers as well as the expansion of our relationships with existing customers. Our low-code, no-code technology is leading the industry\u2019s modernization by helping carriers gain efficiencies and improve profitability at scale with a simpler technology ecosystem and a faster time for implementation. We continue to be excited about the growth potential for our Life business. And our success here serves as a great blueprint for our ability to drive growth and value creation through the extension into large, addressable and adjacent insurance markets. Insurance transactional revenues grew a more modest 1.8%. This quarter\u2019s transactional revenues were negatively impacted by a lower level of storm activity versus the prior year when Hurricane Ida made landfall in Louisiana, as well as the environmental impact of software results in our personal auto underwriting and marketing businesses. We do expect to see some benefit in the fourth quarter from Hurricane Ian claims, but we caution that some of this can be offset by more liquidations or insolvencies within the core insurance market. Additionally, we expect the environmental headwinds in personal auto and marketing to persist. In our effort to advance the dialogue and our work on ethical AI and algorithm preparedness, we recently coordinated and sponsored the Insurance Fairness Forum, where we presented on social fairness, pricing and underwriting for insurance, with a preliminary study focused on personal auto rate-making. During the conference, we engaged with consumer advocates, insurance regulators, as we want to ensure that we\u2019re at the forefront of the conversation on this very important topic. The insurance industry is inherently trying to differentiate, selecting and pricing risks, but our goal is to ensure that there is no unfair discrimination. In our customer conversations, we hear that they need help to become more automated, more digitally engaged and more connected. The insurance industry is directing their spending towards these projects and, in turn, to Verisk, as a key ecosystem partner to drive these initiatives forward, which has been a key driver of growth for us. The industry continues to look to us to innovate and respond to recent industry events with leading-edge solutions. For example, our Verisk teams responded to Hurricane Ian by helping clients track damage, dispatch adjusters and staff, estimate the cost to repair the damage and speed the claims process to get properties repaired and safely return families to their homes. Our catastrophe loss estimate of $42 billion to $57 billion was an early and accurate estimate of insured losses related to Hurricane Ian, allowing insurers and reinsurers to understand the impact on their portfolios. In California, insurers face new regulatory measures to address rating, property coverage, wildfire from areas. Verisk is helping our customers comply with these new regulations. We continue to help our customers select and price risk and root out fraud with our advanced data and analytics, and believe that we are well positioned to continue to grow as we advance our mission to become the trusted technology partner for the industry. Now let me turn the call over to our new CFO, Elizabeth Mann, for financial review.\nElizabeth Mann: Thanks, Mark, and good morning to all of you here on the call. I\u2019m so happy to be here at Verisk and speaking to you today. I have admired the company and its phenomenal insurance business for over a decade as I worked in the information services sector. And now is a particularly exciting time to join as we have an opportunity to redefine our strategy as a global insurance-focused data analytics and technology company. We can now focus our capital and all of our industry knowledge to support the needs of our customers, as Lee and Mark have already highlighted. As I\u2019ve joined Verisk over the last six weeks, and I\u2019ve been getting to know the people and digging into the business, I\u2019ve been focused on a few priorities. The first is a focus on cost discipline and execution against the margin targets we\u2019ve committed. Second, Lee has established a framework for capital allocation and ROIC metrics, which I intend to continue. The resulting transparency and accountability on our deployment of capital will support our ability to invest with confidence to drive top line growth and strong returns. Third, I will prioritize investor engagement, gathering feedback and providing transparency into the business. So I look forward to getting out on the road and meeting all of you. Let me now turn to our third quarter results. Before I begin, I want to remind everyone that all consolidated and GAAP numbers are negatively impacted by the recent dispositions of 3E and Verisk Financial Services. This effect will continue through the first quarter of 2023 when we will anniversary those transactions. As noted, due to its materiality, Wood Mackenzie will be accounted for as discontinued operations beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the third quarter of 2022, on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue was $745 million, a modest decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of recent dispositions and foreign currency exchange rate headwinds, which are most pronounced in our Energy segment, offset in part by acquisitions. Net income attributable to Verisk decreased 6% to $189 million while diluted GAAP earnings per share attributable to Verisk decreased 3% to $1.20. The decline was primarily due to the dispositions within the former Energy and Specialized Markets and Verisk Financial Services segments, including the loss incurred as part of the true-up of the closing adjustments. Moving to our organic constant currency results, adjusted for non-operating items, as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release. We are pleased with our operating results, led by continued growth in our subscription revenues. In the third quarter, OCC revenues grew 4.8%, driven by continued strength in our Insurance segment and continued sequential improvement in our Energy segment. Our subscription revenues increased 5.6% while our transactional revenues increased a more modest 1.2%. Adjusting for $3.3 million in prior year revenue associated with our Energy business in Russia, OCC revenue would have grown 5.3% and subscription revenues would have grown 6.2%. Consolidated OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 6% in the third quarter. Normalizing for the prior year revenue associated with our Energy in Russia and the incremental expenses associated with exiting that business, OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 7%. Total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results, was 51.5%, up 160 basis points from the year prior, reflecting strong cost and operational discipline as well as the benefit from recent dispositions. This level of margin includes approximately 60 basis points of headwind from recent acquisitions; 50 basis points of headwind from our ongoing technological transformation, including cloud expenses, which we absorbed into our cost structure; and 40 basis points from higher year-over-year T&E expenses. Despite the environment and cyclical headwinds to margin, this quarter\u2019s margin expansion is further demonstration of our commitment to efficiency. On that note, let\u2019s turn to our segment results on an OCC basis. For Insurance. In the third quarter, Insurance segment revenues increased 5.3%. We saw healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, claims analytics, extreme events, life insurance and specialty business solutions. Subscription revenues increased 6.1%, reflecting tougher comparisons versus last year\u2019s 7.9% growth as well as the impact of some of the environmental factors Lee and Mark spoke about earlier. Transactional revenues increased 1.8% in the quarter, reflecting a lower level of storm activity in the quarter as well as continued softness from personal auto, underwriting and marketing. This was offset in part by strong recovery growth in international travel insurance solutions. Within workers\u2019 compensation, we have seen a return to modest growth, though the business is not yet back to pre-pandemic levels. Adjusted EBITDA grew 6.9% in the third quarter while margins declined 70 basis points to 55.2%. These margins reflect a heavier burden from the corporate costs that were previously allocated to businesses that have been disposed as well as the impact of recently acquired businesses, higher cloud expenses and the partial normalization of travel expenses back into the business. This level of margin also includes continued investment in our high-growth areas like life insurance and specialty business solutions and the impact of recently acquired businesses. Energy and Specialized Markets. Revenue increased 2.5% in the third quarter. Normalizing for the impact of our exit from Russia, Energy revenue growth was 5.2%. Our subscription revenues increased 3.5% or 6.8%, normalizing for the Russian exit, led by double-digit growth in energy transition, chemicals and metals and mining research, coupled with modest growth in our core research subscriptions. Additionally, we continue to experience strong adoption and contract expansion from our Lens renewals. Transactional revenues decreased 1.8% as growth was constrained by consulting resources. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 0.2% in the third quarter, and margins contracted 210 basis points to 34.4%. These adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin figures include $0.2 million in incremental expense related to the suspension of operations in Russia. Normalizing for that impact, adjusted EBITDA growth would have been 7.8%. On taxes. Our reported effective tax rate was 22.7% compared to 20.9% in the prior year quarter. This higher year-over-year tax rate was the result of lower level of stock option activity versus the prior year. Looking ahead to the remainder of 2022, we expect the tax rate in the fourth quarter to be approximately 24% to 26%, reflecting the impact of discontinued operations as well as a lower than originally expected level of stock option activity. On adjusted net income and diluted adjusted EPS. Adjusted net income decreased 1.9% to $230 million, and diluted adjusted EPS increased 1.4% to $1.46 for the third quarter of 2022. These changes reflect organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions and a lower average share count, offset in part by the impact of divestitures and the higher interest expense and tax rate. For free cash flow, net cash provided by operating activities was $280 million for the quarter, down 1.8% from the prior year period due to the loss of operating cash flows related to the dispositions. Normalizing for the impact of the 3E and Verisk Financial Services dispositions, free cash flow would have been up 7.5%. Capital expenditures were $66 million for the quarter, up 7% versus last year, reflecting increases in capitalized software development, offset in part by savings on third-party hardware and software as we move to the cloud. We now expect capital expenditures for the full year to be within the range of $270 million to $280 million. This range supports our plans to increase our software investment into core underwriting, where we believe there is a significant opportunity for platform enhancement. In addition, we now expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization to be within the range of $195 million to $205 million, and intangible amortization should be approximately $145 million for the full year 2022. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to foreign currency variability, the timing of purchases, the completion of projects and future M&A activity. On capital returns. During the third quarter, we returned $349 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, as our strong cash flow allows us to consistently return capital to shareholders while also investing in the business. Additionally, in October of 2022, we entered into a new $100 million accelerated share repurchase agreement to be completed in the fourth quarter, as is our normal practice. Looking ahead, we plan to optimize the use of proceeds from the sale of Wood Mackenzie while also maintaining our leverage range. We will achieve this through a combination of debt paydown and share repurchases and may act opportunistically from a timing standpoint. Before I turn the call back over to Lee, I just want to remind everyone that we will be hosting an Investor Day in March, where we will provide more transparency and clarity on our strategic and financial profile and growth drivers as a global insurance-focused data analytics and technology company. And now I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments.\nLee Shavel: Thanks, Elizabeth. In summary, our business is strong, as evidenced by our organic constant currency, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA growth of 7% and strong margin performance in the quarter. We are confident that we have the team in place to execute on our operational efficiency plans over the next two years and deliver on our margin expansion targets. Longer-term, we continue to believe as well that the opportunity to create value for our customers and employees will drive value for our shareholders. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. And with that, I\u2019ll ask the operator to open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And with that we will take our first question from Ashish Sabadra from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nAshish Sabadra: Congrats, Elizabeth, and look forward to working with you. Lee thanks for providing the details on the impact of the divestiture. I was just wondering if you could provide some underlying assumptions. Any color on that? If there is any tax leakage, how does the tax increase for the remaining companies, stranded cost? Any color on those fronts will be helpful. Thank you.\nLee Shavel: Thank you, Ashish. First, let me say on the question on tax leakage. The $3.1 billion in proceeds, I think, if your question is directed towards that, we are not expecting any significant tax leakage. There may be some upside for us on that modestly. But we think that we will be able to deploy the full amount of that in share repurchases and debt paydowns. As it relates to the future tax rate, we have provided some guidance for the fourth quarter. But we \u2013 it\u2019s obviously a complex issue that we are working through in terms of the longer-term impact. It depends upon the composition of the business overall, and we would intend to provide more clarity for that as we look ahead. I think it\u2019s fair to assume, of course, kind of as implicated in the fourth quarter, that our effective tax rate will be higher. But we\u2019ll try to provide more specific guidance as we sort that out and in the time frame that we typically do with our fourth quarter earnings results.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Go ahead.\nJeff Meuler: Thank you. Lee or Mark, maybe if you could just give us a more holistic perspective on what the adjacent market opportunity is for you as you focus your efforts in capital on insurance. You talked about life being a blueprint for extension into adjacent markets, and you talked about developing solutions. That\u2019s an incremental opportunity for you coming out of the CEO and CIO roundtables. But maybe if you could just give us more holistically address just how you see addressable market or adjacent opportunities.\nLee Shavel: Sure. Thank you, Jeff. I\u2019m going to take a first crack at it and then hand it over to Mark for his perspective. But the one way that we\u2019re looking at this is we\u2019re looking at the totality of the insurance industry spend in aggregate. And that\u2019s a very substantial number in kind of the [indiscernible] and Jeff, I think you may be rattling a paper there. But we\u2019re looking at that aggregate amount. And I think as we\u2019ve talked to investors previously, when we look at the amount of revenue that Verisk generates from the insurance industry relative to their operating costs, it is a 40 to 45 basis point amount. And we think that there\u2019s a broader opportunity for us to address their marketing spend in finding efficiencies, in finding solutions to drive productivity gains, to find efficiencies on technology spend, which are substantially larger opportunities for us relative to the scale of what we\u2019re doing. So that will give you a sense of why we think that\u2019s a substantial opportunity. And we\u2019ve been engaged in addressing a lot of those with current initiatives that we look to expand on. And I know Mark can certainly speak to some of the things that we\u2019ve been doing on that front.\nMark Anquillare: Super. So maybe I\u2019ll try to give you three examples. We talked about life. But even within life, we have the ability to continue to extend into group life. We are focused today from a life insurance perspective primarily in the United States. We can go international. To the extent you think about other lines of insurance, other lines of business related to life, you have disability. That\u2019s an opportunity for us. We see opportunities to extend into pet insurance, travel insurance. Those are some examples of like customer sets that we don\u2019t operate in. I\u2019ll make the obvious example, but I just do want to remind everybody that from a marketing perspective, that is a huge customer set, the marketing departments inside of insurers that we just never really dealt with before, and now we have access to through some recent acquisitions. And it really is forming the foundation of how we kind of go to market with some of our customers, really helping them understand the best target markets and where and how to price. Last but not least, you have heard it throughout the themes here. We think we can do more from a software and technology platform perspective with our customers. We don\u2019t deal with the CIO as being the chief information officers inside of our major customers. And we see ourselves as a technology player and has been a strong partner to them. So hopefully, that helps.\nLee Shavel: Yes. And Jeff, I think you see there are three dimensions there that we\u2019re talking about. One is a functional orientation. And so that\u2019s Mark speaking to the marketing opportunity. We see similar opportunities on the technology side. And then operationally, there is the business line opportunity or dimension that we\u2019re looking at with travel and other areas. And then, of course, there is the international, where we feel as though the opportunity to bring some of that expertise. All of those are \u2013 create, I think, a broad envelope for us to look to expand on what we\u2019re doing.\nJeff Meuler: Thank you, both.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Alex Kramm with UBS Financial. Please go ahead.\nAlex Kramm: Yes. Good morning, everyone. Maybe just a quick follow-up to Ashish\u2019s question. But since you didn\u2019t report this quarter as discontinued operation but will next, maybe you can give us the apples-to-apples EBITDA margin, how it would have been if it would have been a discontinued operation already? And if you can\u2019t add into that specifically, maybe outline what the stranded or servicing costs related to Wood Mac will be and how they will fade away over time. Thanks.\nLee Shavel: Yes. Alex, thanks for the question. We\u2019re not at the point where we have broken through both the combination of the adjustments that we\u2019re making in the overhead costs or the overhead allocation. So I think that is something that we\u2019ll look to provide more input on as we move ahead, probably with the fourth quarter earnings, where we\u2019ll have that discontinued operations. Our focus has been on getting the transaction done. As you can imagine, that has been, I think, a pretty solid accomplishment in a difficult market. It will take time for us to sort through the accounting consequences now that we understand that, and there are a lot of transitional elements that we need to take into account. So it\u2019s not a simple metrics to us.\nAlex Kramm: Understood. Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you. Thanks very much. Wanted to ask about your pricing, how that\u2019s looking for 2023. I know you mentioned the insurers currently trying to put through sizable rate increases to cover inflation. I guess, will you be able to benefit from that by being able to increase your subscription prices? How should we think about the magnitude of price increases next year versus 2022 or versus a normal year, however you want to break that out? Thanks.\nMark Anquillare: Yes. Thank you, Toni. I appreciate. This is Mark. Let me first remind everybody, we do have some connectivity of pricing to premium volumes. The utility of our products are seen and demonstrated through the premiums they write. So to the extent that it\u2019s a harder market or meaning price is going up and there\u2019s more premium, we will see that on a little bit of a lag effect. To your more direct and short-term, I think what we\u2019re trying to do is really balance the opportunity to hopefully maybe take a little bit more price, only because, like everybody, we\u2019re incurring some more costs around labor and other inflationary type of spend. But at the same time, we\u2019re in it for the long-term. And what we\u2019re trying to do is make sure that we are able to sell new products, new solutions to customers and not cause any short-term angst degree with regard to pricing today.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. You just called out kind of broader insurance inflation pressures, I guess, and then more specifically, the Florida issues as well. Is there any way to quantify how much each of that impacted the growth? And how long should this headwind continue?\nLee Shavel: Thank you, Manav. So these are \u2013 there are a variety of factors, some of which are difficult to kind of fully separate. I\u2019m going to ask Mark to kind of give his perspective on both impact and sustainability of these effects that you\u2019re asking about.\nMark Anquillare: So quantifying is difficult. So I\u2019m going to maybe qualify \u2013 kind of quantify, I apologize. So inside the auto market, what we\u2019re seeing is just a general theme of people trying to write less business or quote less new business. They are waiting for their rate filings to be implemented and in turn, wait for higher prices or higher premium before they write. So that seems like a depression that will occur and be soft, I would guess, probably for another six months or so into 2023. That\u2019s our take. But at the same time, it is something that cyclically will come and will go, so we expect it to rebound. Two, Florida is clearly a challenge. There has been an insurer last resort. Basically, rates there have been subsidized when people try to get into the market. They\u2019ve been hurt by large cat and inside of those new customers and those existing customers that are going out of business. That does affect us and will be \u2013 let me say it this way, that will be a little bit longer term. Ultimately, new emerging insurers will rise. We will hopefully serve them. We are working with them now, but that will take time. So that rebound would probably be over the course of a year or more, I would say, in that regard. I think the last comment that you were referring to or at least we\u2019re referring to is the workers\u2019 comp space. We did see some growth this quarter. At the same time, the market is still depressed. Some of that is regulation, I think I\u2019ve highlighted in the past. Some of it, I do believe it\u2019s just the fact that the work-from-home environment leads to fewer claims in the future. So I think we\u2019ve started to anniversary the challenge. I think it will start to rebound a bit. I don\u2019t want to be optimistic, but I would assume that should occur in 2023 at some point. I hope those are the three trends or themes that you were talking about. The other thing that affected us a little timing was storms. Obviously, Ida last year, Ian this year, both pretty big storms affecting different quarters.\nLee Shavel: Yes. And I would add one other dimension, Manav, which is I think that what we\u2019ve seen is kind of fairly solid subscription growth. I think that what you saw in 2022 was some weakness on the transactional revenue growth. And I think it will probably manifest itself, some of these trends in \u2013 some sustaining of that weaker growth into 2023 if these dynamics have the impact that we described. But again, also subject to variability on storm levels, but hopefully, that\u2019s helpful.\nManav Patnaik: Yes, thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question will come from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi, it\u2019s Andrew. I\u2019m going to ask you about Verisk\u2019s ongoing organic revenue growth goal of 7%. And my question is, how long will it take Verisk Insurance to get there? And what needs to happen? And where your comments about Florida workers\u2019 comp going to hold us back from getting there?\nLee Shavel: Thank you, Andrew. So we certainly understand that. What I will first say and reiterate that our confidence in that long-term target remains in place given what we see as the opportunities in front of us. I think when you look at what we\u2019ve even achieved in 2021 at a more challenging environment, where we had two quarters of organic revenue growth above 7% clearly demonstrates the ability of the insurance \u2013 of our insurance business to achieve that. We\u2019ve had some weakness related to pandemic effects, such as lower driving activity, impact on workers\u2019 comp. And I think, to Mark\u2019s comments, we are seeing some weakness as a result of the economic environment, but we\u2019re also seeing recovery in some of the pandemic-related effects. And I think that biases us towards stronger performance ahead from a growth perspective as we come out of some of these stronger elements. Some of the macroeconomics may persist, but I think we\u2019re seeing kind of more momentum towards that target ahead. That would be the way, I think, about it, both from a longer-term perspective, which we are still confident that we can deliver on that. We have to work our way through, I think, the conflicting impacts of some recovery from pandemic impacts and then some of the more sustained macroeconomic, which, I think, are of a lower magnitude than what we experienced through the pandemic.\nAndrew Steinerman: Got it, thanks Lee.\nOperator: The next question will come from Greg Peters with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nGreg Peters: Yes, good morning, everyone. I guess, I\u2019ll step back and ask a bigger picture question. I heard in your comments, Lee, about talking with all your customers and trying to partner with them to help innovate, et cetera, and that\u2019s going to require investment in your business. And so I guess, what I\u2019m getting at here is, just to go back and sort of reset or recast a die in how you\u2019re going to balance the desire to improve margins. And you\u2019re sending out some margin targets versus the need really, to invest in your business in order to help your customers get the innovation they\u2019re looking for.\nLee Shavel: Greg, thanks for the question. And particularly \u2013 I would particularly value your perspective and knowledge around the insurance industry. And so you probably better understand better than most the challenges that the insurance industry is facing. And so let me kind of break that apart. I think the opportunity to invest in these new opportunities have generated both growth and very strong returns for the internal investments that we have made in a variety of areas. And I would probably cite our LightSpeed product, where we\u2019ve been able to accelerate delivery of quote to \u2013 a bindable quote to the point of sale, has generated a very strong economic growth for us and a very good return on capital. So we\u2019re looking for similar elements to that. We\u2019ve been talking about our investment in the core lines, reimagined initiative to migrate a lot of our data and services into that new technology platform, which delivers substantially greater value for our clients on that front, opening up, I think new opportunities for growth and certainly a high return that we can generate on that. So those \u2013 and the third point that I would make is that on the margin efficiency target, that has been focused on looking at \u2013 not at cutting investment within the business, but looking for areas of opportunity from an operational efficiency perspective within the business that, I think, it\u2019s been a very healthy exercise for us that we\u2019ve demonstrated progress against, but it hasn\u2019t come at the cost of us pursuing these overall opportunities. So I think if you \u2013 the fundamental concern is, look, we\u2019re hearing that there are a lot of opportunities to invest. How does that \u2013 does that conflict with the margin objective? I don\u2019t believe so. I think that we can continue to make these investments. We can deliver on the operational efficiencies within the business to drive that margin improvement and continue to generate very solid growth and strong returns on capital.\nGreg Peters: I appreciate the additional color.\nLee Shavel: Thanks, Greg.\nOperator: The next question will come from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. With respect to the Wood Mackenzie sale proceeds, how are you thinking about splitting the $3.1 billion between debt paydown and share repurchases? Do you have a target leverage multiple in mind for the stand-alone insurance company?\nLee Shavel: Thank you, George. I\u2019m going to hand that over to Elizabeth to address.\nElizabeth Mann: Yes, hey George, thanks for asking. Like we said, we\u2019re going to balance it between debt paydown and share repurchases. We don\u2019t \u2013 we haven\u2019t established a precise number for debt paydown, other than to state there\u2019s no change to our target leverage range of 2x to 3x in order to maintain our investment-grade rating. Within that, we\u2019ll look to optimize, over time, kind of the best balance of interest savings versus share repurchases. And either way, the majority of it, the significant majority will be on share repurchase. But either way, sort of farther to where we end up within that fairly small range, we\u2019ll still be within the accretion dilution range that we quoted.\nGeorge Tong: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hi, good morning. I appreciate taking the question. Mark, I\u2019m intrigued when I hear you talk about some of these new markets, which really would be true extensions for Verisk, pet being one, I think, that you mentioned. I\u2019m wondering if you have \u2013 do you think you have the data and the kind of digital customer-facing solutions that you might need to expand into those markets? Or if you think you\u2019re going to need to add capabilities to be able to penetrate those new markets and drive new revenue streams.\nMark Anquillare: So Andrew, great question. I appreciate that. I think when we attack new markets, we typically go at it with a theory that we could build some great models. And then as data information starts to flow, we can improve those models. So pet as an example. What we do with travel is not that travel, you would think like, boy, I missed my flight. It\u2019s going to being short. This is the type of travel that focuses on somebody who has a pre-existing medical condition. And to the extent that they\u2019re traveling, how do they get the right medical. So that is a modeled outcome and that has kind of the data we have around it. We can apply those type of models to pets, dogs, cats, more traditional pets, in a way that we can understand how health of the pet and existing conditions cause and will affect payouts. So I hope that\u2019s just an example of ways we can kind of adjust our models. I think the digital engagement and the way we\u2019ve gone at those things are very best-in-class and very digitally engaged. So I think we\u2019re well-positioned there. We do not hold the same data advantage that we do in some of the United States\u2019 admitted lines. But that doesn\u2019t cause us to shy away from and actually provides us with an opportunity to find a way to gather some information. I hope that\u2019s responsive.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Yes. I look forward to seeing your progress there.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJeff Silber: Thanks so much. That\u2019s close enough. I want to go back to Manav\u2019s question where you parsed out some of the environmental impacts affecting the business. I understand the impacts on the non-subscription revenue. But I was just curious on the subscription side in terms of the slowdown. I know if you\u2019ve got customers that go bankrupt, obviously, that\u2019s an impact. But why are we seeing the slowdown in subscription revenue? And is that something we should expect to continue? Thanks.\nMark Anquillare: Yes. So one of the things I think we tried to do is to share that, even though you would think of subscriptions as being this wonderfully flat ride from quarter-to-quarter, even inside of our subscription businesses, when we bring on new customers, where we have some anniversary of dates, there is a little bit of an up and down inside that. So to the extent that you look at this year\u2019s subscription to last year\u2019s, I think that\u2019s a good rule of thumb. If you look at it quarter-by-quarter, there\u2019s some up and downs. I would not read anything into subscription level growth in the quarter. Everything is very solid, and everything is running as we would expect. So I will kind of reinforce Lee\u2019s earlier comments about the subscription growth being strong and more optimistic.\nJeff Silber: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nFaiza Alwy: Hey guys. Hi, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to focus a little bit more on the insurance-specific margins. And I think those came in a lot better than what we had talked about. Because I think, previously, you had talked about those margins declining in line with year-to-date that you had seen in the second quarter. So I\u2019m curious what drove the upside? I think it sounds like you\u2019ve made some progress around your cost savings initiatives that you had talked about. So maybe just address how much that contributed to margins and how we should think about it in the fourth quarter. And maybe, Lee, if you can talk about if your confidence in those targets has improved as you\u2019ve done some work around them.\nElizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks, Faiza. Thanks for the question. Let me comment a bit on the Insurance-only margin for Q3. While it was a slight year-over-year decline, I think we reminded you that, that was offsetting some of the headwinds in the baseline that included the reallocation of corporate expenses from the divestitures. It included the impact of recent acquisitions, which are themselves lower-margin businesses, and it offsets our investment in cloud and the return of T&E expenses. Offsetting those, there is the natural kind of operating leverage in the business and business growth. So those things kind of offset each other. The one other thing I might call out in the quarter there is it\u2019s also offsetting a slight decrease in the pension credit, which happened at the corporate level. And so the Insurance business had its allocation of that component. And that is expected to continue in the fourth quarter. More generally, as we look ahead to the fourth quarter for Insurance, these headwinds will continue. The impact may not be exactly linear quarter-to-quarter, so that could move around.\nLee Shavel: Yes. And what Elizabeth is describing, Faiza, is that underneath the overall margin performance, when you kind of strip away the reallocations, there is still a very strong operating leverage that is expressing itself in terms of looking at it before we look at kind of the non-operational elements. And so that\u2019s the core of the business, and that\u2019s how we will drive EBITDA growth ahead of revenue growth. On the second part of your question, the confidence that we have on achieving our targets is driven by a very methodical process that we\u2019ve gone through to identify all areas of potential savings that \u2013 as we indicated on the call, that we have identified and taken actions that address over half of that target at this point. And we have line of sight on additional opportunities that we\u2019ll be pursuing over time. Part of these will be influenced by the transitional demands of the separation of our businesses. And so we have transition service obligations for those until those businesses are separated. That\u2019s a factor. And we wanted to see how those sorted out before we worked towards the further or the additional decisions that we need to make to achieve that. But we feel very confident in our ability to meet those expectations.\nFaiza Alwy: Great. Very helpful. Thank you, both.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nStephanie Moore: Hey, good morning. I was hoping to get a bit more color on just the international business, maybe some update on how it performed during the quarter and kind of your expectations going forward. Thank you.\nLee Shavel: Sure. Thank you, Stephanie. So I would start off by saying that our international businesses and, obviously, I\u2019m going to presume that the question is directed to our Insurance international businesses. Wood Mackenzie, of course, is an international business, but we kind of covered that in the call. But on the Insurance side, we have a variety of businesses, on the Claims and on the Underwriting side, probably, most significantly, our Specialty business services or what was formerly known as Sequel, that addresses the Lloyds non-standard market with a workflow platform and management system for that market. That continues to have great success in delivering a very compelling solution, both on the front end of business origination, pricing and rating and then, ultimately, kind of the policy management side. That has continued to drive double-digit growth. And we\u2019ve seen similar performance from a lot of the other international businesses that we\u2019ve had. I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark for some additional color perhaps on the businesses other than Specialty business.\nMark Anquillare: Well, I think you had it right. I think we are seeing growth there, which is in excess of our U.S. business. What I also like to highlight, although not organic at this point, the acquisition of Opta, which is a business intelligence solution up in Canada, is a wonderful business, very much aligned with what we do. And the synergies that we anticipated are greater than we anticipated. So I think we\u2019re making great progress there, and it\u2019s a really nice addition to the Verisk family.\nStephanie Moore: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on kind of the end-market health and the insurers profitability pressures. I understand that there are some environmental factors here that seem a bit more temporary: auto market, Florida, workers\u2019 comp and the like. But are you seeing that lead into kind of the more kind of core traditional conversations? Has there been any impact on the sales cycle in your P&C business or the pipeline? Just trying to understand if some of these issues are truly concentrated in the items that you called out, or if there is the risk of this being a bit more pervasive. Thank you.\nMark Anquillare: Yes, good question. I mean, I think you\u2019ve read it. You\u2019ve seen it. I mean the insurance industry is, like many, under a little bit of pressure. Inflationary costs and inflation in general is causing pain to their bottom line. The cat, along with some other cats, I mean, another big year, probably $100 billion of losses. So that creates stress and pressure on them to look at costs, look at ways. They can be more focused on underwriting and underwriting discipline. So I would tell you that we have this wonderful business that continues to have a wonderful spot inside of their key decisions. And we have not seen anybody trying to move away, but there is definitely pressure there. There is definitely people scrutinizing every purchase and scrutinizing when and how they buy. So we are seeing some of that. And we\u2019ve highlighted some of the areas where it\u2019s been most \u2013 fall more on the transactional side.\nLee Shavel: And Andrew, I want to extend on Mark\u2019s comment because that near-term pressure that you\u2019re asking too specifically is part of what we\u2019re experiencing, but it also creates that broader opportunity because that focus on how do we address the impact of those inflationary costs, not just on our loss and loss adjustment expenses, but also on our operational efficiency and the inflation that we\u2019re experiencing that, is driving a more robust dialogue around automation, how we can utilize data to better select risk, how we can improve the processes by creating more connections through the ecosystem to handle a lot of the steps that are probably not as efficient as we could be. So I think that while it is creating that \u2013 some of that near-term pressure, it is also bringing a greater urgency and focus, as I described, in the strategic orientation of our client CEOs around how do we solve industry problems that can create a lot of value and savings for them.\nAndrew Nicholas: Makes sense. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: And our final question will come from Heather Balsky with Bank of America.\nHeather Balsky: Thanks for taking my question. I\u2019d love to get an update from you guys on your cloud transformation and how it\u2019s progressing. And then just any color you can give on the implementation costs and then when you kind of expect to see some savings, and what type of savings? And then just with regards to your margin expansion goals, does that incorporate the cost of implementation rolling off and those savings flowing through? Or is that incremental to that target?\nLee Shavel: Yes. Thanks, Heather. And I would \u2013 so with regard to cloud transformation, in prior calls, we identified the fact that we\u2019re in kind of the final year of that implementation. And we have achieved \u2013 this is a very important distinction. We have achieved operating cash savings when you look at our incremental cloud expenses netted against what would have previously been CapEx expenditure in the business. And so that\u2019s \u2013 we believe that it has delivered real cash savings to us. However, it\u2019s important to understand that, that, from an accounting standpoint, from an EBITDA perspective, means that we have added EBITDA expense to our P&L. And so that has come on. We\u2019ve been able to adjust that, but we\u2019re effectively converting depreciation and amortization to EBITDA expense. That\u2019s why you\u2019ll hear us talk about the headwinds from the cloud and the cloud implementation. We do think that, that incremental cost is one that we are substantially through. And in addition, we have been able to take out the OpEx expense through some of the outsourcing to that third party that we described earlier in the call. All of that is included in the \u2013 in our overall margin improvement targets. So as we have realized those savings, that is factored into the margin element, particularly the outsourcing of our legacy data centers. I think that addresses the two parts of your question.\nHeather Balsky: Thank you very much.\nOperator: And that will conclude today\u2019s earnings conference call. Thank you very much for participating, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Lee Shavel",
            "content": "Thanks, Stacey, and good day, everyone. Before I jump into the earnings results, I want to officially welcome Elizabeth Mann to Verisk. Elizabeth brings operational and corporate finance experience from her three years at S&P Global capital markets and strategic sophistication from her 12 years of investment banking experience at Goldman Sachs, and finally, an impressive academic foundation and enthusiasm for mathematics that fits perfectly into our analytical culture. She is coming up the curve quickly and has already established herself as a valued part of the team. I'm pleased to share that we delivered on our stated intention to become a global insurance-focused data analytics and technology company. As we announced on Monday, we have signed a definitive agreement to sell Wood Mackenzie to Veritas Capital for $3.1 billion in cash consideration, payable at closing, plus future additional contingent consideration of up to $200 million. Our ability to achieve this result in the midst of a deteriorating deal environment speaks to the quality of the asset and the momentum of the business. Wood Mackenzie is the globally recognized leader in natural resources intelligence, with in-depth proprietary data sets and subject matter experts that cover the full energy and natural resource value chain. Since we acquired Wood Mackenzie in 2015, the business has increased revenue and EBITDA; integrated acquisitions; developed new areas of growth in the energy transition, chemicals and metals and mining; and most recently, upgraded their client platform, Lens. This has transformed Wood Mackenzie from an advisory services business focused on transactional research and consulting to a data analytics business bolstered by long-term subscription contracts, a leading brand and market position. We have been honored to work with and support our friends and colleagues at Wood Mackenzie and we wish them well and look forward to their continued growth and success under the proven leadership of Mark Brinin and Joe Levesque, and their respected future owners, Veritas Capital. The future for Wood Mackenzie is very bright, and we look forward to having an ongoing productive relationship with them. This transaction, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023, will best position Wood Mackenzie to fully capitalize on secular industry tailwinds, including the energy transition and deliver on the growth opportunity that lies ahead. The closing of this transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. Going forward, the Wood Mackenzie business will be reported as discontinued operations beginning with Verisk's fourth quarter earnings report and 10-K filing. We plan to use the approximate $3.1 billion in proceeds, primarily for share repurchases and debt paydown. After accounting for share repurchase and debt paydown, we expect this transaction to be modestly dilutive to Verisk's earnings in the range of 4% to 6%. That said, over the longer term, we believe the deal will bring Verisk the added benefit of increased focus on our core insurance business, more consistent growth in line with our long-term targets and improved return on capital, which should drive shareholder value. Now let me turn my attention to our third quarter earnings results. Verisk delivered solid third quarter results as we partner with our customers to help them navigate through environmental challenges in the marketplace, including inflation and elevated losses in certain lines of insurance. Adjusted for the impact of the suspension of commercial operations in Russia, Verisk delivered mid-single-digit organic constant currency revenue growth and margin expansion, resulting in organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth of 7%. This performance reflects our focus on cost discipline, operational efficiency and the early benefits of initial steps taken in previously announced margin improvement initiative. Elizabeth will provide more detail in her financial review. On our EBITDA margin expansion objective, we continue to be confident in our ability to achieve our stated target to deliver 300 to 500 basis points of margin expansion by 2024, an insurance-only baseline of 50% to 51% normalized adjusted EBITDA margins. We have taken actions to enhance operating efficiency, improve productivity and streamline processes. During the quarter, we eliminated certain roles across the organization, sunset legacy products and reduced office square footage. Additionally, we entered into an agreement to sublease our data center to a third-party as we move more of our computing infrastructure to the cloud, delivering long-term savings for Verisk. We have also advanced on our future of data collection project, where we are improving the efficiency and productivity of our field force, which not only saves money, but enhances our solutions. We expect that over the next two years, about half of our identified cost savings will come from headcount actions, about 25% from reductions in spending from IT infrastructure and about 25% from third-party spending, including real estate. To-date, we have made decisions and taken actions to address more than half of the cost savings we are targeting. Turning to our customers. Our Insurance customers continue to be generally healthy while they're dealing with the cross-currents of inflation and increasing loss ratios, which are negatively impacting profitability across the industry. This is having a disproportionate impact in personal lines, insurtech companies and certain geographic markets. While insurers are increasing rates to help cover inflation in repair costs, it takes time to get rates approved by the regulators and then implement it across the entire book of business. To-date, premium growth has not yet caught up to loss costs. Specifically, in personal auto, we continue to see pressure on underwriting activity across the industry as insurance providers are holding back on writing new business. In fact, combined ratios across the industry continue to trend lower, and as a result, insurers are cutting back on marketing spend as a way to protect profitability. The net result is lower transactional revenues for Verisk across both our personal lines and auto underwriting solutions as well as certain of our marketing solutions. We believe this is a cyclical issue and will abate over time. As we noted last quarter, Florida is a trouble spot for the insurance industry, and the losses from Hurricane Ian add complication. We are experiencing an increasing level of insolvencies across the market, with four companies liquidating just this quarter, while other carriers are electing to exit the market entirely. This has had a negative impact on both our subscription and transactional revenues. To address these issues and drive future growth, our sales teams are engaged with the new entrants into the market as well as expanding our relationship with a state-backed insurer to help price and select risk. We are also working with our existing customers to help them understand the impact of inflation across their book of business and to help them price the risks accordingly as policies come up for renewal. Apart from the near-term challenges, we continue to believe that the opportunity for Verisk to address the long-term strategic and operating needs of the insurance industry remains substantial. In my many conversations with insurance CEOs, they have consistently encouraged us to develop a more strategic dialogue and how we can help the industry address technology, regulatory and operating issues, leveraging our unique and legacy position as an effective utility for the industry. To that objective, we have been coordinating a series of CEO and CIO roundtables to develop solutions that can improve industry operating efficiency and capital efficiency as well as productivity. While these initiatives will take time to develop and implement, they represent a substantial incremental opportunity for Verisk. We are very excited about the opportunity to engage with the industry at the strategic level and broaden our technology partnership with them. In recognition of our commitment to innovate on behalf of clients, Verisk was recognized by Celent as a Luminary for developing innovative solutions that help property, casualty and life insurers detect claims fraud. Our solutions were recognized by highly advanced functionality and ability to integrate with third-party data, driving faster outcomes and a more accurate claims experience. Similarly, we are committed to creating value for our employees, which includes providing an exceptional workplace. And we were awarded the Great Place to Work designation this year in the U.S., UK, India, Spain and New York. We were also recognized as a Great Place to Work for Women in the UK. In today's rapidly evolving workplace, we are focused on talent attraction, development and retention by supporting our teammates' passion and having a purpose-driven culture that allows unlimited success. Finally, as a demonstration of our commitment to ESG priorities, Verisk has been ranked third out of 100 Best ESG Companies in 2022 by Investor's Business Daily. The list recognized companies with superior environmental, social and governance ratings, in addition to fundamental and technical stock performance. We are honored to receive this recognition for our commitment to sustainability and the ability of our strong and growing business to meet customer and investor expectations. As we move forward, I am more confident than ever that with our proprietary data sets, talented and dedicated people, deep industry knowledge and technical expertise, Verisk is best positioned to create value for our customers by helping them evolve in a new digital environment, integrate rapidly growing data sets and achieve new levels of efficiency. This, in turn, will create value for our employees and shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Mark for some more color on the Insurance business performance. Thanks, Elizabeth. In summary, our business is strong, as evidenced by our organic constant currency, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA growth of 7% and strong margin performance in the quarter. We are confident that we have the team in place to execute on our operational efficiency plans over the next two years and deliver on our margin expansion targets. Longer-term, we continue to believe as well that the opportunity to create value for our customers and employees will drive value for our shareholders. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions. Thank you, Ashish. First, let me say on the question on tax leakage. The $3.1 billion in proceeds, I think, if your question is directed towards that, we are not expecting any significant tax leakage. There may be some upside for us on that modestly. But we think that we will be able to deploy the full amount of that in share repurchases and debt paydowns. As it relates to the future tax rate, we have provided some guidance for the fourth quarter. But we \u2013 it's obviously a complex issue that we are working through in terms of the longer-term impact. It depends upon the composition of the business overall, and we would intend to provide more clarity for that as we look ahead. I think it's fair to assume, of course, kind of as implicated in the fourth quarter, that our effective tax rate will be higher. But we'll try to provide more specific guidance as we sort that out and in the time frame that we typically do with our fourth quarter earnings results. Sure. Thank you, Jeff. I'm going to take a first crack at it and then hand it over to Mark for his perspective. But the one way that we're looking at this is we're looking at the totality of the insurance industry spend in aggregate. And that's a very substantial number in kind of the [indiscernible] and Jeff, I think you may be rattling a paper there. But we're looking at that aggregate amount. And I think as we've talked to investors previously, when we look at the amount of revenue that Verisk generates from the insurance industry relative to their operating costs, it is a 40 to 45 basis point amount. And we think that there's a broader opportunity for us to address their marketing spend in finding efficiencies, in finding solutions to drive productivity gains, to find efficiencies on technology spend, which are substantially larger opportunities for us relative to the scale of what we're doing. So that will give you a sense of why we think that's a substantial opportunity. And we've been engaged in addressing a lot of those with current initiatives that we look to expand on. And I know Mark can certainly speak to some of the things that we've been doing on that front. Yes. And Jeff, I think you see there are three dimensions there that we're talking about. One is a functional orientation. And so that's Mark speaking to the marketing opportunity. We see similar opportunities on the technology side. And then operationally, there is the business line opportunity or dimension that we're looking at with travel and other areas. And then, of course, there is the international, where we feel as though the opportunity to bring some of that expertise. All of those are \u2013 create, I think, a broad envelope for us to look to expand on what we're doing. Yes. Alex, thanks for the question. We're not at the point where we have broken through both the combination of the adjustments that we're making in the overhead costs or the overhead allocation. So I think that is something that we'll look to provide more input on as we move ahead, probably with the fourth quarter earnings, where we'll have that discontinued operations. Our focus has been on getting the transaction done. As you can imagine, that has been, I think, a pretty solid accomplishment in a difficult market. It will take time for us to sort through the accounting consequences now that we understand that, and there are a lot of transitional elements that we need to take into account. So it's not a simple metrics to us. Thank you, Manav. So these are \u2013 there are a variety of factors, some of which are difficult to kind of fully separate. I'm going to ask Mark to kind of give his perspective on both impact and sustainability of these effects that you're asking about. Yes. And I would add one other dimension, Manav, which is I think that what we've seen is kind of fairly solid subscription growth. I think that what you saw in 2022 was some weakness on the transactional revenue growth. And I think it will probably manifest itself, some of these trends in \u2013 some sustaining of that weaker growth into 2023 if these dynamics have the impact that we described. But again, also subject to variability on storm levels, but hopefully, that's helpful. Thank you, Andrew. So we certainly understand that. What I will first say and reiterate that our confidence in that long-term target remains in place given what we see as the opportunities in front of us. I think when you look at what we've even achieved in 2021 at a more challenging environment, where we had two quarters of organic revenue growth above 7% clearly demonstrates the ability of the insurance \u2013 of our insurance business to achieve that. We've had some weakness related to pandemic effects, such as lower driving activity, impact on workers' comp. And I think, to Mark's comments, we are seeing some weakness as a result of the economic environment, but we're also seeing recovery in some of the pandemic-related effects. And I think that biases us towards stronger performance ahead from a growth perspective as we come out of some of these stronger elements. Some of the macroeconomics may persist, but I think we're seeing kind of more momentum towards that target ahead. That would be the way, I think, about it, both from a longer-term perspective, which we are still confident that we can deliver on that. We have to work our way through, I think, the conflicting impacts of some recovery from pandemic impacts and then some of the more sustained macroeconomic, which, I think, are of a lower magnitude than what we experienced through the pandemic. Greg, thanks for the question. And particularly \u2013 I would particularly value your perspective and knowledge around the insurance industry. And so you probably better understand better than most the challenges that the insurance industry is facing. And so let me kind of break that apart. I think the opportunity to invest in these new opportunities have generated both growth and very strong returns for the internal investments that we have made in a variety of areas. And I would probably cite our LightSpeed product, where we've been able to accelerate delivery of quote to \u2013 a bindable quote to the point of sale, has generated a very strong economic growth for us and a very good return on capital. So we're looking for similar elements to that. We've been talking about our investment in the core lines, reimagined initiative to migrate a lot of our data and services into that new technology platform, which delivers substantially greater value for our clients on that front, opening up, I think new opportunities for growth and certainly a high return that we can generate on that. So those \u2013 and the third point that I would make is that on the margin efficiency target, that has been focused on looking at \u2013 not at cutting investment within the business, but looking for areas of opportunity from an operational efficiency perspective within the business that, I think, it's been a very healthy exercise for us that we've demonstrated progress against, but it hasn't come at the cost of us pursuing these overall opportunities. So I think if you \u2013 the fundamental concern is, look, we're hearing that there are a lot of opportunities to invest. How does that \u2013 does that conflict with the margin objective? I don't believe so. I think that we can continue to make these investments. We can deliver on the operational efficiencies within the business to drive that margin improvement and continue to generate very solid growth and strong returns on capital. Thanks, Greg. Thank you, George. I'm going to hand that over to Elizabeth to address. Yes. And what Elizabeth is describing, Faiza, is that underneath the overall margin performance, when you kind of strip away the reallocations, there is still a very strong operating leverage that is expressing itself in terms of looking at it before we look at kind of the non-operational elements. And so that's the core of the business, and that's how we will drive EBITDA growth ahead of revenue growth. On the second part of your question, the confidence that we have on achieving our targets is driven by a very methodical process that we've gone through to identify all areas of potential savings that \u2013 as we indicated on the call, that we have identified and taken actions that address over half of that target at this point. And we have line of sight on additional opportunities that we'll be pursuing over time. Part of these will be influenced by the transitional demands of the separation of our businesses. And so we have transition service obligations for those until those businesses are separated. That's a factor. And we wanted to see how those sorted out before we worked towards the further or the additional decisions that we need to make to achieve that. But we feel very confident in our ability to meet those expectations. Sure. Thank you, Stephanie. So I would start off by saying that our international businesses and, obviously, I'm going to presume that the question is directed to our Insurance international businesses. Wood Mackenzie, of course, is an international business, but we kind of covered that in the call. But on the Insurance side, we have a variety of businesses, on the Claims and on the Underwriting side, probably, most significantly, our Specialty business services or what was formerly known as Sequel, that addresses the Lloyds non-standard market with a workflow platform and management system for that market. That continues to have great success in delivering a very compelling solution, both on the front end of business origination, pricing and rating and then, ultimately, kind of the policy management side. That has continued to drive double-digit growth. And we've seen similar performance from a lot of the other international businesses that we've had. I'll turn it over to Mark for some additional color perhaps on the businesses other than Specialty business. And Andrew, I want to extend on Mark's comment because that near-term pressure that you're asking too specifically is part of what we're experiencing, but it also creates that broader opportunity because that focus on how do we address the impact of those inflationary costs, not just on our loss and loss adjustment expenses, but also on our operational efficiency and the inflation that we're experiencing that, is driving a more robust dialogue around automation, how we can utilize data to better select risk, how we can improve the processes by creating more connections through the ecosystem to handle a lot of the steps that are probably not as efficient as we could be. So I think that while it is creating that \u2013 some of that near-term pressure, it is also bringing a greater urgency and focus, as I described, in the strategic orientation of our client CEOs around how do we solve industry problems that can create a lot of value and savings for them. Yes. Thanks, Heather. And I would \u2013 so with regard to cloud transformation, in prior calls, we identified the fact that we're in kind of the final year of that implementation. And we have achieved \u2013 this is a very important distinction. We have achieved operating cash savings when you look at our incremental cloud expenses netted against what would have previously been CapEx expenditure in the business. And so that's \u2013 we believe that it has delivered real cash savings to us. However, it's important to understand that, that, from an accounting standpoint, from an EBITDA perspective, means that we have added EBITDA expense to our P&L. And so that has come on. We've been able to adjust that, but we're effectively converting depreciation and amortization to EBITDA expense. That's why you'll hear us talk about the headwinds from the cloud and the cloud implementation. We do think that, that incremental cost is one that we are substantially through. And in addition, we have been able to take out the OpEx expense through some of the outsourcing to that third party that we described earlier in the call. All of that is included in the \u2013 in our overall margin improvement targets. So as we have realized those savings, that is factored into the margin element, particularly the outsourcing of our legacy data centers. I think that addresses the two parts of your question."

            "content": "Thanks, Mark, and good morning to all of you here on the call. I'm so happy to be here at Verisk and speaking to you today. I have admired the company and its phenomenal insurance business for over a decade as I worked in the information services sector. And now is a particularly exciting time to join as we have an opportunity to redefine our strategy as a global insurance-focused data analytics and technology company. We can now focus our capital and all of our industry knowledge to support the needs of our customers, as Lee and Mark have already highlighted. As I've joined Verisk over the last six weeks, and I've been getting to know the people and digging into the business, I've been focused on a few priorities. The first is a focus on cost discipline and execution against the margin targets we've committed. Second, Lee has established a framework for capital allocation and ROIC metrics, which I intend to continue. The resulting transparency and accountability on our deployment of capital will support our ability to invest with confidence to drive top line growth and strong returns. Third, I will prioritize investor engagement, gathering feedback and providing transparency into the business. So I look forward to getting out on the road and meeting all of you. Let me now turn to our third quarter results. Before I begin, I want to remind everyone that all consolidated and GAAP numbers are negatively impacted by the recent dispositions of 3E and Verisk Financial Services. This effect will continue through the first quarter of 2023 when we will anniversary those transactions. As noted, due to its materiality, Wood Mackenzie will be accounted for as discontinued operations beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the third quarter of 2022, on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue was $745 million, a modest decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of recent dispositions and foreign currency exchange rate headwinds, which are most pronounced in our Energy segment, offset in part by acquisitions. Net income attributable to Verisk decreased 6% to $189 million while diluted GAAP earnings per share attributable to Verisk decreased 3% to $1.20. The decline was primarily due to the dispositions within the former Energy and Specialized Markets and Verisk Financial Services segments, including the loss incurred as part of the true-up of the closing adjustments. Moving to our organic constant currency results, adjusted for non-operating items, as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release. We are pleased with our operating results, led by continued growth in our subscription revenues. In the third quarter, OCC revenues grew 4.8%, driven by continued strength in our Insurance segment and continued sequential improvement in our Energy segment. Our subscription revenues increased 5.6% while our transactional revenues increased a more modest 1.2%. Adjusting for $3.3 million in prior year revenue associated with our Energy business in Russia, OCC revenue would have grown 5.3% and subscription revenues would have grown 6.2%. Consolidated OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 6% in the third quarter. Normalizing for the prior year revenue associated with our Energy in Russia and the incremental expenses associated with exiting that business, OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 7%. Total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results, was 51.5%, up 160 basis points from the year prior, reflecting strong cost and operational discipline as well as the benefit from recent dispositions. This level of margin includes approximately 60 basis points of headwind from recent acquisitions; 50 basis points of headwind from our ongoing technological transformation, including cloud expenses, which we absorbed into our cost structure; and 40 basis points from higher year-over-year T&E expenses. Despite the environment and cyclical headwinds to margin, this quarter's margin expansion is further demonstration of our commitment to efficiency. On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an OCC basis. For Insurance. In the third quarter, Insurance segment revenues increased 5.3%. We saw healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, claims analytics, extreme events, life insurance and specialty business solutions. Subscription revenues increased 6.1%, reflecting tougher comparisons versus last year's 7.9% growth as well as the impact of some of the environmental factors Lee and Mark spoke about earlier. Transactional revenues increased 1.8% in the quarter, reflecting a lower level of storm activity in the quarter as well as continued softness from personal auto, underwriting and marketing. This was offset in part by strong recovery growth in international travel insurance solutions. Within workers' compensation, we have seen a return to modest growth, though the business is not yet back to pre-pandemic levels. Adjusted EBITDA grew 6.9% in the third quarter while margins declined 70 basis points to 55.2%. These margins reflect a heavier burden from the corporate costs that were previously allocated to businesses that have been disposed as well as the impact of recently acquired businesses, higher cloud expenses and the partial normalization of travel expenses back into the business. This level of margin also includes continued investment in our high-growth areas like life insurance and specialty business solutions and the impact of recently acquired businesses. Energy and Specialized Markets. Revenue increased 2.5% in the third quarter. Normalizing for the impact of our exit from Russia, Energy revenue growth was 5.2%. Our subscription revenues increased 3.5% or 6.8%, normalizing for the Russian exit, led by double-digit growth in energy transition, chemicals and metals and mining research, coupled with modest growth in our core research subscriptions. Additionally, we continue to experience strong adoption and contract expansion from our Lens renewals. Transactional revenues decreased 1.8% as growth was constrained by consulting resources. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 0.2% in the third quarter, and margins contracted 210 basis points to 34.4%. These adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin figures include $0.2 million in incremental expense related to the suspension of operations in Russia. Normalizing for that impact, adjusted EBITDA growth would have been 7.8%. On taxes. Our reported effective tax rate was 22.7% compared to 20.9% in the prior year quarter. This higher year-over-year tax rate was the result of lower level of stock option activity versus the prior year. Looking ahead to the remainder of 2022, we expect the tax rate in the fourth quarter to be approximately 24% to 26%, reflecting the impact of discontinued operations as well as a lower than originally expected level of stock option activity. On adjusted net income and diluted adjusted EPS. Adjusted net income decreased 1.9% to $230 million, and diluted adjusted EPS increased 1.4% to $1.46 for the third quarter of 2022. These changes reflect organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions and a lower average share count, offset in part by the impact of divestitures and the higher interest expense and tax rate. For free cash flow, net cash provided by operating activities was $280 million for the quarter, down 1.8% from the prior year period due to the loss of operating cash flows related to the dispositions. Normalizing for the impact of the 3E and Verisk Financial Services dispositions, free cash flow would have been up 7.5%. Capital expenditures were $66 million for the quarter, up 7% versus last year, reflecting increases in capitalized software development, offset in part by savings on third-party hardware and software as we move to the cloud. We now expect capital expenditures for the full year to be within the range of $270 million to $280 million. This range supports our plans to increase our software investment into core underwriting, where we believe there is a significant opportunity for platform enhancement. In addition, we now expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization to be within the range of $195 million to $205 million, and intangible amortization should be approximately $145 million for the full year 2022. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to foreign currency variability, the timing of purchases, the completion of projects and future M&A activity. On capital returns. During the third quarter, we returned $349 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, as our strong cash flow allows us to consistently return capital to shareholders while also investing in the business. Additionally, in October of 2022, we entered into a new $100 million accelerated share repurchase agreement to be completed in the fourth quarter, as is our normal practice. Looking ahead, we plan to optimize the use of proceeds from the sale of Wood Mackenzie while also maintaining our leverage range. We will achieve this through a combination of debt paydown and share repurchases and may act opportunistically from a timing standpoint. Before I turn the call back over to Lee, I just want to remind everyone that we will be hosting an Investor Day in March, where we will provide more transparency and clarity on our strategic and financial profile and growth drivers as a global insurance-focused data analytics and technology company. And now I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments. Yes, hey George, thanks for asking. Like we said, we're going to balance it between debt paydown and share repurchases. We don't \u2013 we haven't established a precise number for debt paydown, other than to state there's no change to our target leverage range of 2x to 3x in order to maintain our investment-grade rating. Within that, we'll look to optimize, over time, kind of the best balance of interest savings versus share repurchases. And either way, the majority of it, the significant majority will be on share repurchase. But either way, sort of farther to where we end up within that fairly small range, we'll still be within the accretion dilution range that we quoted. Yes. Thanks, Faiza. Thanks for the question. Let me comment a bit on the Insurance-only margin for Q3. While it was a slight year-over-year decline, I think we reminded you that, that was offsetting some of the headwinds in the baseline that included the reallocation of corporate expenses from the divestitures. It included the impact of recent acquisitions, which are themselves lower-margin businesses, and it offsets our investment in cloud and the return of T&E expenses. Offsetting those, there is the natural kind of operating leverage in the business and business growth. So those things kind of offset each other. The one other thing I might call out in the quarter there is it's also offsetting a slight decrease in the pension credit, which happened at the corporate level. And so the Insurance business had its allocation of that component. And that is expected to continue in the fourth quarter. More generally, as we look ahead to the fourth quarter for Insurance, these headwinds will continue. The impact may not be exactly linear quarter-to-quarter, so that could move around."

            "name": "Mark Anquillare",
            "content": "Thanks, Lee. I'm pleased to share that the Insurance segment delivered another solid quarter. In Insurance, we are experiencing strong growth in subscription revenues across both underwriting and claims, resulting in OCC subscription growth of 6.1% for the segment overall. Within Underwriting, we had strong results from core underwriting, extreme event solutions and our international businesses. We also had healthy contribution with double-digit growth achieved in certain of our newer acquired businesses, including life insurance and specialty business software solutions. Extreme event solutions had a strong quarter, driven by the addition of new customers to our core Touchstone Platform as well as the expansion of multi-year deals with existing customers. New environment of rising inflation, insurers and reinsurers are challenged to keep up with the growth in their exposures. To help our customers understand the risk of the inflation and assess their exposures, we recently released our 2022 Global Modeled Catastrophe Losses Report, detailing key global financial loss metrics based on our latest suite of catastrophe models. Additionally, we are supporting insurers with a broad array of property data solutions so that they can ensure they're keeping up with the impacts of inflation and have a more informed view of risk and ongoing exposures. Our sustainability and country risk business also had a very strong quarter as demand for our risk indices in both the corporate and investor segments continue to drive strong double-digit growth. We're also beginning to get traction with the expansion of our sustainability offerings into the Insurance segment. Within Life Insurance, we're delivering strong double-digit growth through the addition of new customers as well as the expansion of our relationships with existing customers. Our low-code, no-code technology is leading the industry's modernization by helping carriers gain efficiencies and improve profitability at scale with a simpler technology ecosystem and a faster time for implementation. We continue to be excited about the growth potential for our Life business. And our success here serves as a great blueprint for our ability to drive growth and value creation through the extension into large, addressable and adjacent insurance markets. Insurance transactional revenues grew a more modest 1.8%. This quarter's transactional revenues were negatively impacted by a lower level of storm activity versus the prior year when Hurricane Ida made landfall in Louisiana, as well as the environmental impact of software results in our personal auto underwriting and marketing businesses. We do expect to see some benefit in the fourth quarter from Hurricane Ian claims, but we caution that some of this can be offset by more liquidations or insolvencies within the core insurance market. Additionally, we expect the environmental headwinds in personal auto and marketing to persist. In our effort to advance the dialogue and our work on ethical AI and algorithm preparedness, we recently coordinated and sponsored the Insurance Fairness Forum, where we presented on social fairness, pricing and underwriting for insurance, with a preliminary study focused on personal auto rate-making. During the conference, we engaged with consumer advocates, insurance regulators, as we want to ensure that we're at the forefront of the conversation on this very important topic. The insurance industry is inherently trying to differentiate, selecting and pricing risks, but our goal is to ensure that there is no unfair discrimination. In our customer conversations, we hear that they need help to become more automated, more digitally engaged and more connected. The insurance industry is directing their spending towards these projects and, in turn, to Verisk, as a key ecosystem partner to drive these initiatives forward, which has been a key driver of growth for us. The industry continues to look to us to innovate and respond to recent industry events with leading-edge solutions. For example, our Verisk teams responded to Hurricane Ian by helping clients track damage, dispatch adjusters and staff, estimate the cost to repair the damage and speed the claims process to get properties repaired and safely return families to their homes. Our catastrophe loss estimate of $42 billion to $57 billion was an early and accurate estimate of insured losses related to Hurricane Ian, allowing insurers and reinsurers to understand the impact on their portfolios. In California, insurers face new regulatory measures to address rating, property coverage, wildfire from areas. Verisk is helping our customers comply with these new regulations. We continue to help our customers select and price risk and root out fraud with our advanced data and analytics, and believe that we are well positioned to continue to grow as we advance our mission to become the trusted technology partner for the industry. Now let me turn the call over to our new CFO, Elizabeth Mann, for financial review. Super. So maybe I'll try to give you three examples. We talked about life. But even within life, we have the ability to continue to extend into group life. We are focused today from a life insurance perspective primarily in the United States. We can go international. To the extent you think about other lines of insurance, other lines of business related to life, you have disability. That's an opportunity for us. We see opportunities to extend into pet insurance, travel insurance. Those are some examples of like customer sets that we don't operate in. I'll make the obvious example, but I just do want to remind everybody that from a marketing perspective, that is a huge customer set, the marketing departments inside of insurers that we just never really dealt with before, and now we have access to through some recent acquisitions. And it really is forming the foundation of how we kind of go to market with some of our customers, really helping them understand the best target markets and where and how to price. Last but not least, you have heard it throughout the themes here. We think we can do more from a software and technology platform perspective with our customers. We don't deal with the CIO as being the chief information officers inside of our major customers. And we see ourselves as a technology player and has been a strong partner to them. So hopefully, that helps. Yes. Thank you, Toni. I appreciate. This is Mark. Let me first remind everybody, we do have some connectivity of pricing to premium volumes. The utility of our products are seen and demonstrated through the premiums they write. So to the extent that it's a harder market or meaning price is going up and there's more premium, we will see that on a little bit of a lag effect. To your more direct and short-term, I think what we're trying to do is really balance the opportunity to hopefully maybe take a little bit more price, only because, like everybody, we're incurring some more costs around labor and other inflationary type of spend. But at the same time, we're in it for the long-term. And what we're trying to do is make sure that we are able to sell new products, new solutions to customers and not cause any short-term angst degree with regard to pricing today. So quantifying is difficult. So I'm going to maybe qualify \u2013 kind of quantify, I apologize. So inside the auto market, what we're seeing is just a general theme of people trying to write less business or quote less new business. They are waiting for their rate filings to be implemented and in turn, wait for higher prices or higher premium before they write. So that seems like a depression that will occur and be soft, I would guess, probably for another six months or so into 2023. That's our take. But at the same time, it is something that cyclically will come and will go, so we expect it to rebound. Two, Florida is clearly a challenge. There has been an insurer last resort. Basically, rates there have been subsidized when people try to get into the market. They've been hurt by large cat and inside of those new customers and those existing customers that are going out of business. That does affect us and will be \u2013 let me say it this way, that will be a little bit longer term. Ultimately, new emerging insurers will rise. We will hopefully serve them. We are working with them now, but that will take time. So that rebound would probably be over the course of a year or more, I would say, in that regard. I think the last comment that you were referring to or at least we're referring to is the workers' comp space. We did see some growth this quarter. At the same time, the market is still depressed. Some of that is regulation, I think I've highlighted in the past. Some of it, I do believe it's just the fact that the work-from-home environment leads to fewer claims in the future. So I think we've started to anniversary the challenge. I think it will start to rebound a bit. I don't want to be optimistic, but I would assume that should occur in 2023 at some point. I hope those are the three trends or themes that you were talking about. The other thing that affected us a little timing was storms. Obviously, Ida last year, Ian this year, both pretty big storms affecting different quarters. So Andrew, great question. I appreciate that. I think when we attack new markets, we typically go at it with a theory that we could build some great models. And then as data information starts to flow, we can improve those models. So pet as an example. What we do with travel is not that travel, you would think like, boy, I missed my flight. It's going to being short. This is the type of travel that focuses on somebody who has a pre-existing medical condition. And to the extent that they're traveling, how do they get the right medical. So that is a modeled outcome and that has kind of the data we have around it. We can apply those type of models to pets, dogs, cats, more traditional pets, in a way that we can understand how health of the pet and existing conditions cause and will affect payouts. So I hope that's just an example of ways we can kind of adjust our models. I think the digital engagement and the way we've gone at those things are very best-in-class and very digitally engaged. So I think we're well-positioned there. We do not hold the same data advantage that we do in some of the United States' admitted lines. But that doesn't cause us to shy away from and actually provides us with an opportunity to find a way to gather some information. I hope that's responsive. Yes. So one of the things I think we tried to do is to share that, even though you would think of subscriptions as being this wonderfully flat ride from quarter-to-quarter, even inside of our subscription businesses, when we bring on new customers, where we have some anniversary of dates, there is a little bit of an up and down inside that. So to the extent that you look at this year's subscription to last year's, I think that's a good rule of thumb. If you look at it quarter-by-quarter, there's some up and downs. I would not read anything into subscription level growth in the quarter. Everything is very solid, and everything is running as we would expect. So I will kind of reinforce Lee's earlier comments about the subscription growth being strong and more optimistic. Well, I think you had it right. I think we are seeing growth there, which is in excess of our U.S. business. What I also like to highlight, although not organic at this point, the acquisition of Opta, which is a business intelligence solution up in Canada, is a wonderful business, very much aligned with what we do. And the synergies that we anticipated are greater than we anticipated. So I think we're making great progress there, and it's a really nice addition to the Verisk family. Yes, good question. I mean, I think you've read it. You've seen it. I mean the insurance industry is, like many, under a little bit of pressure. Inflationary costs and inflation in general is causing pain to their bottom line. The cat, along with some other cats, I mean, another big year, probably $100 billion of losses. So that creates stress and pressure on them to look at costs, look at ways. They can be more focused on underwriting and underwriting discipline. So I would tell you that we have this wonderful business that continues to have a wonderful spot inside of their key decisions. And we have not seen anybody trying to move away, but there is definitely pressure there. There is definitely people scrutinizing every purchase and scrutinizing when and how they buy. So we are seeing some of that. And we've highlighted some of the areas where it's been most \u2013 fall more on the transactional side."

Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After today's prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.\nStacey Brodbar: Thank you, Chris, and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our second quarter 2022 financial results. On the call today are Lee Shavel, Verisk's Chief Executive Officer; Mark Anquillare, President and Chief Operating Officer; and David Grover, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as our traditional quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days, on our website and by dial-in. As set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone, today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Finally, I'd also like to remind everyone that the financial results for recent dispositions included in our consolidated and GAAP results, but are excluded from all organic constant currency growth figures. A reconciliation is provided in our 8-K. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Verisk's CEO, Lee Shavel.\nLee Shavel: Thanks, Stacey, and good day, everyone. I'm pleased to share that Verisk delivered solid second quarter results. As you review the financial results, please be aware that due to the dispositions of 3E and Verisk Financial Services, certain year-over-year comparisons will be distorted by the impacts of these transactions. For example, the decrease in our free cash flow year-over-year was primarily the result of a significant tax on the realized gain from the sale of 3E. Dave will provide more details in his financial review. Second quarter organic constant currency revenue grew approximately 5% and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA grew approximately 4%. Adjusted for the impact of the suspension of commercial operations in Russia, organic constant currency revenue grew approximately 6% and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA grew approximately 6%. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 140 basis points to 51% through cost discipline, operational efficiencies, the benefit of decisions affecting recent portfolio actions and some very early steps taken in our previously announced margin improvement initiative. This level of margin also includes headwinds from cloud transition and a partial normalization of travel and entertainment expenses as we continue to hold more in-person conferences and visits as we engage with our customers. While overall organic constant currency revenue growth, excluding Russian revenues was below our long-term targets, we saw solid performance in our subscription revenues offset by weakness in our transactional revenues due to the continued impact of the work from home environment on certain businesses as we'll describe. We did see sequential improvements in the second quarter, reflecting some normalization in certain businesses including international travel. Subscription revenue organic constant currency growth excluding Russian revenues of approximately 7%, representing 81% of total revenue was solid and improved sequentially in both insurance and energy. Insurance OCC subscription revenues were above our 7% long-term target, demonstrating the mission critical nature of our solutions. Energy subscription growth improved sequentially as positive pricing momentum from our Lens investment and strong annual contract value growth begins to convert into revenue growth. We also had strong growth in our energy transition, chemicals and metals and mining research. Transactional organic constant currency revenue growth of approximately 2%, representing 19% of total revenue, improved slightly in the quarter with sequential improvement in insurance due to the solid underwriting growth offset by weaker performance and claims due to ongoing declines in workers' compensation claims volumes across the industry of at least 25%. And new regulations that went into effect in early 2022 that are slowing claims settlement. In addition, we are also experiencing some softness in personal lines auto related to the market dislocation as Mark will describe in his section. We have seen normalization progress across our businesses and expect this to continue. However, several of these impacts are having longer cycle recovery times than we originally expected. Energy transactional revenue declined modestly on an organic constant currency basis, due primarily to resource constraints in our consulting business as a result of strong demand from our professionals, particularly in [technical difficulty] region as well as tough compares versus last year's rebound level growth rates. You can find more details about our subscription and transactional growth rates by segment in our quarterly earnings deck, which can be found in the Investors section of our website. Since taking over the CEO role at the end of May, I've been meeting with the leadership teams of many of our key customers and stakeholders. In these valuable conversations where I'm learning how we can improve, I hear repeatedly that Verisk is a critical partner with a unique seat to analyze performance and technology across the industries we serve and most importantly, implement technology change for the benefit of all of our clients. As one of our clients put it not only do we need to Verisk help on this issue, the industry needs your help. Our value proposition is clear. Verisk strategically invests in data and technology at scale to deliver economic value to our customers through operational efficiencies and better decision making. In both the insurance and energy industries, we benefit from the growing demand for data analytics from our customers, along with their increased ability to ingest and use our rapidly growing datasets. We deliver greater value per dollar invested than our clients would be able to individually and we are in an advantaged position as few companies enjoy closer ties to and a greater understanding of their clients businesses than Verisk. This is a responsibility that we do not take lightly, as it is this unique proposition that will power our growth and drive long-term value creation for shareholders, customers and employees. As we focus and define the strategic orientation over 2022, we expect to lay out our plans in greater detail at an Investor Day in the first quarter of 2023, following the reporting of our fourth quarter 2022 results. During the second quarter, we made a series of new leadership announcements as we build out the team that will lead Verisk forward. Of importance to many of you on this call, we recently announced that Elizabeth Mann will be joining Verisk as our Chief Financial Officer. Elizabeth joins us from S&P Global, where she was the Chief Financial Officer of Ratings and Mobility divisions. And before that she was Senior Vice President of Capital Management, which included oversight of the Treasury department Elizabeth will bring very relevant experience and a fresh perspective that I know will improve our organization financially and operationally. She will be joining us on September 15, and we look forward to introducing her to you and she will welcome your perspectives as she comes up the curve on Verisk. In addition, we recently announced that Maroun Mourad has been named President of Claims Solutions. Maroun has been a key leader in our Underwriting and Rating business since 2015, serving as President of ISO, Commercial Lines, President, Global Underwriting and most recently President, Life & Growth markets. Maroun brings deep industry expertise from as many leadership roles at Gen Re, AIG, Arch and Zurich across underwriting, operations and general management. He also brings a great entrepreneurial spirit and a true customer-centric approach to the business and is the right leader to help drive our vision of revolutionizing claims for the industry to automation, technology and advanced analytics. Maroun takes the reigns from Rich Della Rocca who has retired after 27 years with Verisk. We thank Rich for all of his many contributions to Verisk and wish him very well in his retirement. We also announced that Tim Rayner has been named President of Verisk Specialty Business Solutions. Our U.K.-based business centered around our Sequel suite of insurance software. The Specialty Business Solutions team is a linchpin in our strategy to create an automated in interconnected ecosystem for the insurance industry in the U.K., EU and beyond. And Tim is the right leader to drive that strategy. Tim joined Verisk in 2018, after a long and successful career in the insurance industry holding various leadership roles at Miller Insurance Services. Now, let me provide an update on both our progress towards being an insurance focus data analytic solutions provider and our commitment to furthering margin expansion. We're making steady progress on our evaluation of the separation of the energy business. The preparation of the internal separation analysis and standalone financials are ongoing and we have hired a team of outside advisors who are engaged in the next phase of our process of developing alternatives available to us. Our timing expectations remain unchanged and as we have stated previously, our decisions will continue to be guided by shareholder feedback, value considerations and market conditions. As many of you know, we have also undertaken a broad shareholder survey for the benefit of your perspectives, not only on the energy separation, but how we can improve in meeting investor expectations generally. On our EBITDA margin expansion objective, we continue to be very confident in our ability to achieve our stated target to deliver 300 to 500 basis points of margin expansion by 2024 often insurance only baseline of 50% to 51% normalized adjusted EBITDA margins. We have taken some early steps, including the restructuring of our marketing function, office space consolidation and a greater emphasis on our global talent optimization hiring. Additionally, we have embarked on a span of control analysis to guide further operational efficiencies. We continue to experience the impact of the stranded corporate allocations from the businesses we have sold in our reported segment margins. It is important to remember that 2022 is likely to remain quite noisy due to the impact of portfolio changes and implementation costs. As such, we continue to expect to the margin expansion to be increasingly visible over 2023 as we move past the timing impacts of the portfolio changes in implementations and work toward previously stated 2024 target. Now I will turn the call over to Mark for some more color on the insurance business performance.\nMark Anquillare: Thanks, Lee. I'm pleased to share that the Insurance segment delivered another solid quarter. Across insurance, we're experiencing strong growth in subscription revenues across both underwriting and claims, resulting in OCC subscription growth of 7.3% segment overall and demonstrate stability and consistency of our business model and the must have nature of our solutions. Within underwriting, we had strong results from core underwriting, extreme event solutions and our international software business. We also had healthy contribution certain of our newer acquired businesses including life insurance and marketing solutions. Within life insurance, we had delivered strong sales growth from the addition of new customers and expansion of existing relationships. Life insurers are embarking on the modernization and digital transformation of the core systems and FAST software offers flexibility and speed of implementation helps insurers achieve their goals in a timely and cost efficient manner. Extreme event solutions had a strong quarter, driven by the addition of new customers added to our core touchdown platform as well as expansion of multi-year deals with existing customers. In addition to catastrophe bond market continues to be strong and Verisk is growing its share in that market. Our sustainability and country risk business also had a strong quarter as demand for our risk indices in both corporate and investor segments continue to drive strong double-digit growth. Within claims, we're experiencing strong growth in our fraud fighting analytics, driven by the addition of new customers and expanded use cases. More specifically, our new claims essentials bundle designed for self-insured and third party administrators provides an end-to-end claim solutions. It is deriving conversion to subscriptions from customers approval to use our solutions on a more limited and transactional basis. We also recently announced exclusive partnership with LIMRA and LOMA, an industry research organization, life and annuity insurance industry fight the account takeover flood situation. Insurance transaction revenues grew a more modest 2.7%. We have seen a strong rebound in our international travel business that has been offset by headwinds for both our workers' compensation claims solutions and softer results from our personal auto underwriting. In addition, in the first half of the year has seen a lower level of storm activity versus the prior year and historic averages. More specifically, our workers compensation solutions are dealing with two headwinds, including volume levels are down at least 25% across the industry, as well as new regulations, that are slowing the pace settlement. That said, we are not sitting still. We have recently implemented process improvements to help drive greater throughput, a new customer outreach to drive volumes to Verisk. U.S. insurance industry is generally healthy shorter term insurers are dealing with the impact of interest rate volatility inflation and rising loss ratios. This is having disproportionate impact on personal lines in InsurTech players in certain geographic markets. While insurers are increasing rates to help cover inflation and repair costs, it takes time to fully take effect across the entire book of business. Specifically in personal auto, we're seeing lower levels of underwriting activity, which is resulting in lower transaction volumes and revenue. The industry is dealing with higher inflation and supply chain shortages, which are pushing up physical damage claims costs. As a result, the industry's raising rates a temporary pulling back on new business to improve profitability. Notably, we're also watching carefully the developments in Florida homeowners insurance market. This is a market that is dominated by small local companies as widespread exposure to climate related risks and is dealing with elevated levels of litigation in fraud. This combination is leading to pull back underwriting and increase in insurer liquidations and exits from the market. As a result, these risks are moving to the state-run insurer of last resort. The state of Florida recently created a reinsurance facility to bring more stability to the homeowners market to address these issues and help our customers on the underwriting side, we are facilitating new market participants and have expanded our relationship with the statewide insurer to help price and select risk. On the claims slide, we're helping customers including State government agencies with this claim score and analytics to improve their ability to investigate and identify fraud. This is a developing situation almost staying close to our customers and regulators. Through our customer engagement, we know that the insurance industry is focused on becoming more automated, more digitally engaged and more connected and they're directing, spending toward these projects. They turn to Verisk as a key partner to drive these initiatives forge, which has been a key driver of our growth. We can use to help our customers select and price risk and route out fraud with our advanced data analytics and believe that we are well positioned to continue to grow as we advance our mission to become a trusted partner from the technology and analyst perspective for the industry. I turn the call over to Interim CFO. David Grover for financial review.\nDavid Grover: Thanks, Mark. Before I begin, I want to remind everyone that all consolidating GAAP results are negatively impacted by the recent dispositions of 3E and Verisk Financial Services. That will continue through the first quarter of 2023 when we will earn anniversary those transactions. For the second quarter of 2022, on a consolidated basis, revenues were $746 million, a modest decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of recent dispositions and headwinds from FX rate changes, which were most pronounced in our Energy segment offset and part by acquisitions. Net income attributable to Verisk increased 28% to $198 million while diluted GAAP EPS attributable to Verisk increased 32% to $1.24. The increase was primarily due to a lower tax provision this year versus the prior-year period, which included a non-cash revaluation charge related to an increase in U.K. tax rates that became [effective] last year. Moving to our OCC results, adjusted for non-operating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, we are pleased with our operating results led by continued and consistent growth in our subscription revenues. In the second quarter, OCC revenues grew 5.3% driven by continued strength in our insurance segment. Our subscription revenues increased 6.2% while our transactional revenues increased a more modest 1.7%. Adjusting for $3.5 million in prior year revenues associated with our energy business in Russia, OCC revenues would have grown 5.9% and subscription revenues would have grown 6.9%. Consolidated OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 4.4% in the second quarter, normalizing for the prior year revenue associated with our energy business in Russia and the incremental expenses associated with exiting that business. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 5.7%. Total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results was 51.0%, up 140 basis points from the prior year, reflecting strong cost and operational discipline as well as the benefits from recent dispositions. This level of margin includes approximately 80 basis points of headwind from recent acquisitions, 60 basis points of headwind from our ongoing technological transformation, including cloud expenses, which we absorbed into our cost structure and 60 basis points from higher year-over-year G&A expenses. Finally, this margin also reflects about 60 basis points of headwind from the timing shifts related to executive compensation, which we told you about last quarter, and will have no impact on full-year results. On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an OCC basis. In the second quarter, Insurance segment revenues increased 6.4%. We saw healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, claims analytics, extreme events, life insurance and international specialty business solutions, subscription revenues increased 7.3% while transactional revenues were up 2.7%. We continue to experience strong recovery growth in certain of our transactional businesses, including international travel insurance solution, but continues to be pressured by weakness in workers compensation, as well as softness in personal auto underwriting as the dealing with some dislocation as Mark described earlier. Adjusted EBITDA grew 6.1% in the second quarter, while margins declined 180 basis points to 54.7%. These margins reflect heavier burden from the corporate costs that were previously allocated to businesses that have been disposed the impact of recently acquired businesses, higher cloud expenses and the partial normalization of travel back into the business. This level of margin also includes continued investment in our high growth areas like life insurance and marketing solutions. Energy and specialized market revenues increased 0.8% in the second quarter, normalizing for the impact of suspended operations in Russia, energy revenue growth was 3.6%. The end market continues to be volatile and impacted by geopolitical developments, but we are seeing sequential improvements in our subscription revenue growth rates as our customers are trying to witness some of the data and analytics. Our subscription revenues increased 1.7% and was affected by our decision to suspend all commercial operations in Russia. Normalizing for Russia, subscription revenue growth was 5.2% led by double-digit growth in energy transitions, chemicals and metals and mining research coupled with modest growth in our core research subscriptions. Additionally, we continue to experience strong adoption [technical difficulty] expansion from our Lens renewals. Transactional revenues decreased 2.8% as growth was constrained by consulting resources as we are seeing an elevated level of employee attrition due to a competitive market for expertise in energy and technology. We are working to offset this trend and have demonstrated success in attracting talent to our energy business as well. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 6.4% in the second quarter and margins contracted 90 basis points to 34.6%. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin includes $1.1 million in incremental expense related to the suspension of operations in Russia. Normalizing for the Russian impact, adjusted EBITDA growth would have been 3.6%. In addition to the incremental Russian expense, this margin also reflects the partial normalization of travel expense back into the business and higher cloud expenses. It also reflects continued investment in Lens as we further build our capability to garner maximum value from the platform including Lens power, energy transitions, chemicals and metals and mining. Looking to the remainder of 2022, loss of Russian revenues and adjusted EBITDA will negatively impact each quarter by approximately $4 million per quarter. Verisk Financial Services results are included in our reported numbers, but not in the OCC figures. We sold Verisk Financial Services to TransUnion on April 8. Our reported effective tax rate was 18.3% compared to 35.6% in the prior year quarter. The prior year's tax rate was elevated due to a non-cash revaluation charge with a U.K. tax law change, we also benefited in the quarter from higher level stock option exercise activity as compared to last year. Looking ahead to the remainder of 2022, we expect the tax rate to be between 20% and 23% in the third and fourth quarters of 2022, though, there could likely be some quarterly variability related to employee stock option exercise activity. Adjusted net income increased 28% to $244 million and diluted adjusted EPS increased 31% to $1.53 for the second quarter of 2022. These increases reflect organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions, a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count. Net cash provided by operating activities was $130 million for the quarter, down 44% from the prior year period due to a tax payment of $122 million primarily related to the gain on sale of 3E as well as the loss of operating cash flows related to the dispositions. Adjusting for these unique items, operating cash flow would have increased by a double-digit rate year-over-year. Capital expenditures were $69 million for the quarter, up 11% versus last year, reflecting increases in capitalized software development, offset in part by savings on third-party hardware and software as we move to the cloud. We continue to expect our capital expenditures to be within the range of $280 million to $310 million. This range supports our plans to increase our software investment through the acceleration of our pace of development in Lens and extending software development into core underwriting that we believe there is similar opportunity for platform enhancement. Related to CapEx, we now expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization to be within the range of $210 million to $230 million and intangible amortization to be approximately $170 million. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to FX variability, the timing of purchases, and completion of projects and future M&A activity. During the second quarter, we returned $374 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends as our strong cash flow allows us to invest behind our highest growth and highest return initiatives while also consistently returning capital to shareholders. Additionally, in June, we entered into a new $300 million accelerated share repurchase agreement to be completed in the third quarter. And now, I'll turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments.\nLee Shavel: Thanks, Dave. In summary, our businesses are strong and we are making important progress, executing on our strategic and operational initiatives, including the evaluation of the separation of the energy business and our margin expansion targets. As we evaluate options for the energy business, we will continue to focus on pursuing the most value creating path for our shareholders and we'll also consider market conditions and timing. We are confident that with the recent transformation of our portfolio and active cost management over we can deliver growth in line with our long-term objectives with organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth ahead of revenue growth, reflecting our strong operating leverage. Finally, I wanted to remind you that we are planning an Investor Day for the first quarter of 2023 to be held at our offices in Jersey City. We will provide more details as it gets closer and we certainly hope you will join us. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nHeather Balsky: Hi, thank you for taking my question. I'd love to get an update on your cost savings program. And just kind of hear how big, I mean, you talked about it earlier in the call, but just -- how things are tracking. You talked about really seeing impact in 2023 kind of what the phasing might be next year. And also I think there is some concerns about the macro. Your business has proven to be pretty stable in a downturn. But how -- I guess, how to think about the margin improvement and how sales may play into that or not. Thank you.\nLee Shavel: Thank you, Heather. I'll start off and then ask offer Mark an opportunity to provide additional color as the Chief Operating Officer. He has been leading that initiative and really driving it's today. At a high level, as I indicated in the call, we are very confident that we will be in a position to deliver on the expected range of margin improvement of 300 to 500 basis points of that 50% to 51% baseline for an insurance only business described the elements that we are considering. We've taken a look at all alternatives that have been identified to us internally and externally. And are working against those directly, some of those have already been underway. I'll let Mark kind of describe, but some of the things that we have been doing. In terms of phasing, we are [technical difficulty] at this point to give specific direction potentially as we kind of look towards the Investor Day, and we have a clear picture of 2023 and specifically the macroeconomic environment that we're looking at. We might be in a position to provide some greater clarity around that. But this at this point, there are too many moving pieces for us to estimate. But as I indicated, we'll expect to see clear progress across 2023. And with that, just offer Mark an opportunity to add any color.\nMark Anquillare: So first of all, I think I can tell you we are on plan. I think all of our businesses and support centers have kind of stepped up to the challenge of trying to be more effective and more efficient. As a result of just our overall cost structure, a lot of the focus has been on people and trying to make sure that we are thoughtful about where we need to replace and where we need positions, and we've tried to maintain a rigor around that both when we're hiring new and where that position could be. So a part of the thought is not only to be more effective and more efficient inside of our operations. It's also about where are those people could and should be hired. So we have some operations in Hyderabad, we have some operations that are in Malaga, we have some operation that are in [indiscernible] and we have some operations in Costa Rica, which in the place and we try to become a little bit more internationally where we place those positions and try to make sure that we have the right talent and maybe at lower costs. Facilities is key to that, I think we're making some progress there. We've limited smaller offices. We made some progress with a couple of our major ones. The real estate market, commercial real estate market particular is a little bit slow. So we are probably a little behind on one of those -- probably a little ahead one of those major offices. And then I think I just kind of talk more broadly about where we want to invest and I think the teams have doing a great job of really focusing on where can we get the best ROIC. So there is instances where we're going to reallocate dollars into higher opportunities and we're sunsetting some opportunities where we say due to that maybe that return is not so great. And we probably have kind of come up with the notion of a little bit about more fast sale on some of the smaller products. And I think you're around on track and I think you'll see as we said good benefits from that program as we transition into 2023.\nLee Shavel: And Heather, the only thing I would add is that of course, as I think all companies are these days are aware of the impact of inflation across the business, and particularly the competitive environment from a compensation standpoint. And so we have factored that in at this point, we believe that we can absorb those costs make some steps and improving our retention and still deliver on that. So to your macroeconomic comment, we do recognize that there have been some pressures that may influence the results in 2023 and 2024, but reiterate our confidence in the original target that we set out.\nHeather Balsky: Great. Thank you so much for the answer.\nOperator: The next question is from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is John filling in for Ashish. Congratulations on the strong results. Could you just help us understand the return of transactional revenue specifically around workers' compensation, as well as personal auto underwriting, as well as some of the property estimating solutions as well. Thanks.\nLee Shavel: Thank you, John. Mark, do you want to take that.\nMark Anquillare: Sure. So let me provide a little color as to what I say, I don't remember exactly, your auto, let me start with workers' comp and I'll segue through it. So on the claims side, what we've seen is two things, really. Overall, the industry today relative to pre-pandemic, there's just fewer workers compensation claims. I think in large part, that's a function of you working at home. There's not a lot of slip and falls when you're sitting in your living room and as a result, there's just an overall downturn in the number of claims and that business is transactional. Two, there has been regulation. This is kind of inside of the world of how the government interacts insurers as to who pays us set aside and what that change has done. This has caused some of the insurers to kind of change their processes, probably moving towards a more rigorous process by which they submit those claims as opposed to some of the maybe short cuts that we're starting to happen. So that has also slowed down the buying. That is just a timing thing. The first one is more systemic at least time being, which relate to work from home. Two, on the claims side, I think you were talking a little bit about volumes in -- our repair cost estimating and how weather -- personal auto was the third one, okay. So I'll go to personal next. From a personal auto perspective, I think the other item that we're seeing is because of the challenges in the industry, meaning the world of inflation and cost repairing cars, profitability is starting to be hurt by that loss ratios are up. So when you bring on new business, right, usually there is a short-term loss, so the cost of bringing on that new business. And it takes time to get insurance rate increases. So you have to file those. So there is a general pullback and some of the underwriting of new business, there is less shopping online and because there's less shopping, there is less transactions and people pulling our data around those auto transactions things like loss histories, who is the prior coverage with things around motor vehicle reports. That's the type of information we typically provide. So hopefully that color is there. If I heard correctly, I think the last thing was just generally from a recurrent cost estimate perspective, it's been a very quiet storm season, most of our business is subscription based there is some transactional element to when storms happen, there is typically some adjusters that why software transactions kind of fluctuate up and down with storms.\nLee Shavel: And so, John, at a high level, as Mark describing, there are a lot of individual effects on the transactional businesses, some of which are shorter term timing related, there may be some systemic or secular elements on the workers comp. But generally, I think across those transactional businesses, we did see sequential improvement from the first quarter, the second quarter and I think the kind of the stronger trend will be kind of a continued normalization. So certainly, there are a lot of factors and individual elements, but we feel as though we should see kind of continued normalization on those growth rates.\nUnidentified Analyst: Very helpful. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: The next question is from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.\nAlex Kramm: Yes. Hi, good morning, everyone. Hi, to spend my question on the energy trend transition here rather potential changes in that business for you. But maybe you can just remind us, you mentioned that your evaluation is ongoing at the timelines are what you've outlined before. So maybe remind us, if I remember correctly, I think you committed to making a decision in the third quarter and maybe the transaction of last resort would be a spin out in the first quarter of next year. So just wondering if anything has changed of those timelines are still the same. And as you think about that spin out is that still something that you're evaluating or could there still be a future given market conditions, where you actually think you -- it makes sense to keep the business. So maybe just a quick update here. Thanks.\nLee Shavel: Yes. Thank you for the question, Alex. So in terms of overall timing that remains the same. We are on track to have a decision on energy by the end of the third quarter in conjunction with our third quarter earnings release with execution of that alternative to actually follow given the various kind of timing of executing on that. And with that, timing, I would describe this as being exactly where we anticipated completing the kind of separation of the accounting work and analysis. As I indicated, we have advisors that are engaged in this project, they along with our team are actively evaluating all of the alternatives. And so everything from a private sale to a separately capitalized spin out as well as retention are still alternatives that we are weighing. We're being guided by what we think is in the best interest of our shareholders from a value perspective and factoring risk in timing. I've seen the markets are different almost by definition from where we were when we originally announced this. And so the financing market as a function of changes in interest rates is more challenging than it was previously. And naturally, obviously equity markets are also down. Those are all factors that we will consider as we think about the value of the business and the value to our shareholders.\nAlex Kramm: Great. Thanks for the reminder.\nLee Shavel: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks so much. Wanted to ask also about energy, ex-Russia grew about 3.6% organically in the quarter, very slight deceleration sequentially. I maybe would have thought that just given how strong energy prices have been year-to-date and I would think it's a really conducive environment for selling more information just given all the uncertainty, you also of the Lens platform that you launched in the last couple of years. So just what's holding back growth in this segment. Why isn't this growing 5% or more just what's holding it back. Thanks.\nLee Shavel: Thank you for the question, Toni. And I think the simple answer is the differentiated performance between our subscription-oriented business, where we are capturing the strength of the value of that Lens platform as well as the strong demand for our energy transition, our chemicals, metals and mining business. And so there, excluding the Russian impact the overall growth in that business is solidly in that mid-single digits level at 5.2%. And the weak part of it has been in the consulting side. And there - I think there are two factors. We had a very strong 2021 with the rebound in that and it has been challenged by resource constraints frankly, the level of demand for the businesses there. But given the demand for our professionals with energy and energy transition expertise, it has been more challenging for us to have the resources against those consulting projects. And so, I think the combination of those two factors and the decline in revenues in that business while a very strong environment as you indicated has obscured what we think is the fundamentals we're seeing re-achieving again and positive momentum in the subscription revenues. We continue to see very solid growth in our ACV from Lens and research as a function of everything that you described. But that's the short answer, right. I think that addresses your question, Toni.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you so much.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. I was hoping you could perhaps talk about in a life insurance business there, maybe just a sense of how big it is today. And just what the - how we should think about the strategic vision for building up life insurance?\nLee Shavel: Thank you for the question, Manav. I'll turn it over for Mark for his perspective.\nMark Anquillare: Yes, I look forward to and thank you for the question. I think we talked about life and marketing. Life has been a wonderful story. What we've seen is, inside of those insurers that are really looking to upgrade probably decades, old technology. Our fast solution has been winning the day and that is a combination of trying true traditional life insurers and there's been a lot of the secondary market or a lot of M&A, where private equities getting involved and buying books of business. Because we're able to implement quickly and then a very low cost in this no-code low-code environment we have been the kind of gender and strategic partner of choice. The beauty of these contracts at the beginning is a little bit implementation, but everyone is going to be moving on to the platform and what you see is not only do they put their business on, they start adding lines and they start extending across legal entities. So we have a combination of new logos, but also more business coming onto the platform. And as you think about the way we - for that obviously, the subscription revenue associated with those like - are going to continue to grow nicely. What we are doing is kind of uniquely positioning solution with not only a combination of great modular software, but analytics, so you can better understand - underwrite business which parallels a lot of the things we did in P&C. So we've kind of taken a little bit about P&C playbook, we've augmented with some great technology and I think we're starting to really make a difference in the life insurance space so, very happy with the progress there. I don't know, we've given the size of that business, but it is certainly growing quite quickly with the high double-digits\nLee Shavel: Yes and Manav, I would add. I was recently out on the West Coast and had an opportunity to meet a number of our clients in the InsurTech space that are out there. And several of them are specifically focused on life applications. And I will tell you the thing that is really - the two things that are really compelling. One is, how they are availing themselves of broader datasets that formally really weren't as relevant in the life space. So there is an appetite for data and a utilization of data and there is a real focus on the availability of instantaneous data so that they can make underwriting decisions. So I mentioned that, because I think they represent the leading edge of where we see life insurance going and that speaks to the broader opportunity that we face or the broader opportunity that we have in front of us to be gathering those datasets of scale. Developing those applications and then deploying it against our relationships on the insurance side, we have done incredibly successfully with the FAST acquisition. So while still, I'm not material contributor to our overall business, it is one that clearly we believe has tremendous penetration potential and growth potential.\nMark Anquillare: And just to tie it altogether, we referenced [indiscernible] that's an example of us kind of bring it in industry dataset and industry organization to fight fraud things that we do well in the P&C side. So kind of a good example of these comments.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJeff Silber: I'm getting a lot of e-mails from some of your investors regarding exactly how you calculated the EBITDA in terms of maybe transferring some of the costs from the disposed businesses and I'm sorry to waste my question on this. We just get a high level overview, because a number of investors just asking that? Thanks.\nLee Shavel: So Jeff, I'll start and then I'll ask is Stacey to describe it. Essentially, we have the allocated corporate costs that exist, but we still are - we still bear or simply be allocated on a variety of basis, but generally kind of proportionate to the scale of the business. And so that impact, we have to allocate those cost somewhere and they are being allocated to the insurance in the energy business. Stacey, you feel [ph] you're embellishing.\nStacey Brodbar: Jeff, so just to be clear, the two dispositions that we did, do not hit the materiality threshold for discontinued operations. So that's why the accounting is a little bit confusing. And on organic constant currency basis, we have adjusted and taken out Verisk Financial and 3E. So all organic constant currency growth figure are adjusted for the impact of those transaction. However, our total adjusted EBITDA dollars and margin include the impact of all of those businesses. There is reconciliation at the end of the press release, which will show you all the moving pieces and parts. But it does take and as Lee said, we did take allocations that were previously associated with 3E and associated with Verisk Financial put them into just the energy segment and the insurance segment overall. The allocations to insurance basically hurt insurance margin by 80 basis points year-over-year. So that will give you a sense of what the impact is. Hopefully, that's clear. And we can talk later offline.\nJeff Silber: Yes, I'll say, I'll definitely follow-up. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question is from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nFaiza Alwy: Yes, hi. Thank you. And so, I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the international business, and you mentioned some management changes in the U.K. Just wanted to get clear in terms of - how you see that business trending. How it trended in the quarter and how you see a trending going forward?\nLee Shavel: So Faiza, thanks for the question. So when - we talk about our international business naturally, our energy business is substantially an international business. And so I - in that regard, we've kind of commented on two - in answer to Toni's questions, the strength that we've seen in subscription - growth on basis for us and function of our successful wins as well as on the consulting side. On the international business from an insurance perspective, there are a, variety of businesses, the most significant of which is our specialty business solutions business. And our business that is providing a software-oriented ecosystem to the non-standard Lloyd's market. It is a business that has generated very strong revenue growth rates. It's a double - it has been a double-digit grower within the business, we have successfully integrated other bolt-on acquisitions such as a ratings engine within that business. And we're very happy with the performance of that business and our ability to expand off of that. That is one piece of a larger portfolio of insurance businesses that we have developed, which have generally been additive to our overall growth rate. I'll ask Mark, maybe to describe a couple of the other components of the businesses and generally the performance and their contributions to our international businesses. But I just want to make that distinction between energy and insurance.\nMark Anquillare: Yes, that's great. And I think we highlighted that what you would probably recognize Sequel suite of insurance software has been the bigger element and the big grower over U.K. and beyond. We also have an underwriting business that kind of [technical difficulty] as it relates to understanding risks, understanding exposures. But we go beyond there and talk about insurance as it relates to travel and even pet insurance. Those have both come back and it started to grow nicely. That has been nice grower, once again, we're thinking of our international businesses contributing to and actually helping us accelerate our overall organic growth. Other two things that I'll quickly highlight is we kind of continue to extend selectively often it does a lot of the things that we do here in United States, as it relates to property underwriting, they do it in Canada. So, that is a new acquisition that has been a good contributor and kind of new to the Verisk family as well as ACTINEO, which takes us into Germany again inside the claims space, primarily around auto. So our approach broadly, it's been more around software and a little bit on the claims side around services augmented with solutions and things that we do in the U.S., trying to export them with a local footprint and all of that has been successful with - our international growth.\nLee Shavel: And so I think as we expect it to continue to be additive, we also view it as the broader opportunity and recognizing that in the U.S., we have the advantage of having been a utility or the P&C insurance industry and that doesn't exist to the same extent internationally, but software provides an ability for us to connect and create ecosystems, where we achieve a similar dynamic. And that's going to specifically what we have observed with our specialty business solutions element. And so, we're particularly interested in businesses, where we are connecting the industry and we are facilitating industry efficiencies and improved performance. And the international market, in many respects, is not as developed as what we have here in the U.S., and that's what we're excited about continuing to pursue.\nFaiza Alwy: Great, thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hi, good morning. Appreciate taking the question and all the color on the business. Mark, I wanted to ask you about another relatively new area for you, which is marketing. And I wonder if you could sort of give us a sense of what the long-term roadmap to that business looks like. And also I'm wondering if there are any cyclical considerations, discretionary spend considerations you mentioned some pressures that underwriters are facing today. Is that a business you think grows through the cycle, how do we think about that?\nMark Anquillare: Great, so Andrew thanks again. So our theme that is across all insurers is this digital engagement trying to make sure they really satisfy the customer. So what we've attempted to do from a P&C perspective, especially, on the personal line side is due to this ultimate prefill. I mean, that's kind of the way, sometimes you hear described. If you call and you give us your name a number, we can fill in all the information, everything about you and give you a quote, that is you being an insurer, and we support to facilitate that. But we wanted to go one step further, we wanted to go even further to the front-end and as you're providing that quote, what if we found the right group of people to share that quotes. So what our team at [indiscernible] and some of the marketing solution SaaS is, we are the industry standard as that we know sitting a website who's shopping. So we know who's actually shopping for insurance. So this is a wide and very real opportunity to kind of drive this pipeline to drive this funnel a real opportunity and provide that. So the marketing solutions have been a nice extension to both our P&C, as well as our life insurance opportunities. It's that front end that gives us the opportunity. There probably is some cyclicality of that, if it's a difficult time and people are trying to cut costs. There's probably more or less marketing spend that happens. But because of the unique situation that our marketing solution to [indiscernible] we sit on these websites. No one else really had the ability to do what we do, it's not like we're competing directly against Google, it's - we have these relationships that we understand who the - real candidates are. And what we also have the ability to do selectively is to take that capability and extend it beyond P&C. So it allows us to do life and P&C insurance, but to the extent that someone's buy house, they're a prime candidate for P&C insurance, but it's also a prime candidate for someone who needs a mortgage. So there is an extension and big opportunity even inside of other vertical markets where we're selectively looking. So I hope that gives you the color you're looking for.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Yes, it does. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: The next question is from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open.\nJeff Meuler: Yes, thanks. And part of related question, but related to the personal auto underwriting, I guess, it seems like the insurers are - rate actions now. So if you can run this forward because I would think there is also some countercyclical demand in terms of consumer rate shopping to save money for going into a recession. So just -- are there any historical parallels in terms of like what's the lag between those rate actions? And when you see the increased churn that has the positive impact on your business and then just to be clear on the last answer since you said there is probably some cyclicality. Are you seeing delayed uptake because of the cyclical headwinds of LightSpeed in the marketing capabilities, because it sounds like the markets talking a lot about a need for more sophisticated segmentation? Thank you.\nMark Anquillare: Yes so, great question. Now I'm going to piece it back together and respond may be a little out of order. So first of all, from the end to beginning, we are continuing to see uptake in LightSpeed, people love the concept and people continue to buy the solution. What we're seeing though is the volumes coming through the solution are depressed a little bit. And the short answer is, there's less shopping. I'll give you the example that I think you're looking for. Some of the InsurTechs that had been our early adopters who had a lot of volume coming through all of a sudden now start to focus on profitability. As they start to focus on profitability, that causes them to pull back on writing new business, right. There is a direct correlation, there at least nearly life of a policy. So that's a step of it. Two, kind of your other question-- related question is to about rate and taking rate. Everybody is working rates. I've seen some rate increases as high as 40% by some filings as it relates to certain states. They are coming, but people will start to write again when they get the rate increases they want. How long does that take, it really depends, sometimes on the inner workings of some insurers especially in personal auto, they use this as [technical difficulty] they don't use our direct filings. So that could take six months to nine months to get in place for before things start to ramp up again, because they have price that they expect make them profitable hope that was responsive to most of your questions.\nLee Shavel: And Jeff, I would just add kind of a broader overlay which is as Mark is describing, we are seeing some of that near-term pressure on in the business, but longer term, we believe the fundamental driver is the demand for that marketing technology, that demand for kind of delivering that data in that underwriting decision increasingly at the point of sale is what we continue to drive the growth in that business as the industry moves to deliver on that digital experience that Mark described.\nJeff Meuler: Clear and comprehensive, thank you, both.\nOperator: The next question is from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is open.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi, good morning, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to circle back on your answer to an earlier question about transaction revenue. It sounds like, the vast majority of transaction revenue you would expect to kind of normalize to a higher rate over time. But there are some secular structural challenges and workers' comp and maybe some of the other pieces of that business? So my question is, is the expectation for transaction revenue within insurance to ultimately arrive at the 7% plus kind of growth target that you have for the full business over time? Or should we kind of think of achievement of that objective as being driven more by the subscription revenue piece and transaction at some level below that. Thank you.\nDavid Grover: Yes. Andrew, thank you for the question and the opportunity to address that. I want to be very clear. We believe that the transaction revenue over time, it's something that is -- at least at the 7% and actually historically has contributed a higher level of growth and reflects in a lot of ways the applications of new data and new technology that is expressed at the initial stage in transaction related activity that generates revenue for us. So I think what we are experiencing right now are the impacts a bit of the overhang of the pandemic, more people working from home, as Mark described workers comp impact on auto in the macroeconomic environment. But we maintain complete confidence that the transactional driven businesses over time and on a normalized basis will be additive to our overall growth rate and can certainly exceed our 7% long-term target\nLee Shavel: And maybe summarizing that, we are taking share across all this. So when volumes return, we have taken share and that will be reflected in transactions.\nAndrew Nicholas: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi, I just wanted to ask if directionally you expect your energy and specialized markets business to accelerate in the second half of the year. Lee, you did point out like you see on Slide 6 that non-subs business and energy and specialized was down because of consulting constraints. Do you expect those constraints to resolve themselves? Or is that going to be with us near-term and then you mentioned solid growth in ACV. I would think the solid growth in ACV would translate into stronger growth in -- for energy and specialized.\nLee Shavel: Andrew, thank you for the very clear question. And so I'll deal with it in the two parts. I think the conclusion that you drew or the logic that you described is consistent that we see with the ACV growth. And the layering on additional contracts where we've been able to up price the research product as a function of the value of our clients see in Lens. That should continue to have a positive impact on the overall growth rate. And so we do anticipate momentum on that front over the balance of the year. The more difficult element estimate is the consulting side. And so I think that is one where in this competitive market, we face a challenge in getting the level of resources that we think fully address the demand. So I would say, I think we believe that's the case for the research business. On the consulting side, it's a little bit more difficult. And I'd say conservatively that we probably wouldn't anticipate at this point a material change on the consulting front.\nAndrew Steinerman: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Your line open\nHans Hoffman: Hi, this is Hans Hoffman filling in for Hamzah. Thanks for taking my question. Could you just walk us through how you're thinking about further M&A and where the focus is there and then sort of what the pipeline looks like.\nLee Shavel: Certainly. So thanks for the questions. So as you can imagine, our primary focus at this stage is on the near-term objective of the energy separation analysis and project, and two the margin expansion opportunity. And so that is where most of our corporate resources are focused M&A from an M&A standpoint. And then secondly, as we are -- opportunity to evaluate where the business is where we want to take it. What are other opportunities that we have in front of it and how we want to think about internal versus external investment that is occupying that of the next largest part of our time and as we defined that certainly M&A will be a part of how we think about deploying capital and creating value. We have demonstrated in areas particularly on the insurance side, where we have a new dataset for a new technology as with FAST and with Sequel and with Jornaya, we have the ability to materially accelerate revenue growth within those businesses and integrating those with our dataset. So I want to say that we are -- we will continue to look for opportunities where we can materially improve the business and create value through strong returns on the invested capital. That will be our primary focus. It will be in the scale level, but I think you've seen, but for the near-term, we don't expect this high level of activity. One thing that I want to emphasize is that we are not looking at any new verticals outside of insurance and I think until we come to a resolution on the energy business looking at anything in the energy space. So that would be the direction that I provide you.\nHans Hoffman: Thanks.\nHans Hoffman: Our final question today is from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. You committed to expand margins 300 to 500 bps off 50% to 51% baseline for an insurance only business. I wanted to confirm that you can achieve those margin targets regardless of the outcome of your energy strategic review. And since you've taken a close look at costs and the insurance business as part of the strategic process, how likely are you able to also take out medium term organic revenue growth for insurance beyond the historical 7% range.\nLee Shavel: Thank you for the question, George. I may ask you to repeat the rather extended second part of the question. Let me remind you George, as we said explicitly when we provided the guidance that the margin improvement of 300 to 500 basis points was specifically associated with focused entity. I'm sorry just ask you to review that I think there is the answer to your question. The determination of what we do with energy, we'll have to evaluate. So if that business is retain then there will be a different margin profile. We will still seek to achieve those cost savings related to the insurance business overall and look for margin expansion, but those savings were clearly defined as specific to an insurance focus entity. And I ask you to reiterate the second part of your question, George.\nGeorge Tong: Sure. The second part is since you've already taken a look at the insurance business from a cost perspective. Have you also taking it aligns to the business from a growth perspective and insurance, how likely are you able to take up the medium-term organic revenue growth for insurance beyond 7%.\nLee Shavel: George, we continue to maintain our long-term targets for the overall business we've said repeatedly in the past that 7% organic growth is our target. We demonstrated ability to achieve that. We are -- I'm not at the stage where we're changing our long-term guidance for the business, obviously we have an ongoing objective to exceed that growth rate and our compensation systems are tied to over achieving against that goal.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: We have no further questions at this time. And this will conclude today's conference call. Thank you everyone for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Lee Shavel",
            "content": "Thanks, Stacey, and good day, everyone. I'm pleased to share that Verisk delivered solid second quarter results. As you review the financial results, please be aware that due to the dispositions of 3E and Verisk Financial Services, certain year-over-year comparisons will be distorted by the impacts of these transactions. For example, the decrease in our free cash flow year-over-year was primarily the result of a significant tax on the realized gain from the sale of 3E. Dave will provide more details in his financial review. Second quarter organic constant currency revenue grew approximately 5% and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA grew approximately 4%. Adjusted for the impact of the suspension of commercial operations in Russia, organic constant currency revenue grew approximately 6% and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA grew approximately 6%. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 140 basis points to 51% through cost discipline, operational efficiencies, the benefit of decisions affecting recent portfolio actions and some very early steps taken in our previously announced margin improvement initiative. This level of margin also includes headwinds from cloud transition and a partial normalization of travel and entertainment expenses as we continue to hold more in-person conferences and visits as we engage with our customers. While overall organic constant currency revenue growth, excluding Russian revenues was below our long-term targets, we saw solid performance in our subscription revenues offset by weakness in our transactional revenues due to the continued impact of the work from home environment on certain businesses as we'll describe. We did see sequential improvements in the second quarter, reflecting some normalization in certain businesses including international travel. Subscription revenue organic constant currency growth excluding Russian revenues of approximately 7%, representing 81% of total revenue was solid and improved sequentially in both insurance and energy. Insurance OCC subscription revenues were above our 7% long-term target, demonstrating the mission critical nature of our solutions. Energy subscription growth improved sequentially as positive pricing momentum from our Lens investment and strong annual contract value growth begins to convert into revenue growth. We also had strong growth in our energy transition, chemicals and metals and mining research. Transactional organic constant currency revenue growth of approximately 2%, representing 19% of total revenue, improved slightly in the quarter with sequential improvement in insurance due to the solid underwriting growth offset by weaker performance and claims due to ongoing declines in workers' compensation claims volumes across the industry of at least 25%. And new regulations that went into effect in early 2022 that are slowing claims settlement. In addition, we are also experiencing some softness in personal lines auto related to the market dislocation as Mark will describe in his section. We have seen normalization progress across our businesses and expect this to continue. However, several of these impacts are having longer cycle recovery times than we originally expected. Energy transactional revenue declined modestly on an organic constant currency basis, due primarily to resource constraints in our consulting business as a result of strong demand from our professionals, particularly in [technical difficulty] region as well as tough compares versus last year's rebound level growth rates. You can find more details about our subscription and transactional growth rates by segment in our quarterly earnings deck, which can be found in the Investors section of our website. Since taking over the CEO role at the end of May, I've been meeting with the leadership teams of many of our key customers and stakeholders. In these valuable conversations where I'm learning how we can improve, I hear repeatedly that Verisk is a critical partner with a unique seat to analyze performance and technology across the industries we serve and most importantly, implement technology change for the benefit of all of our clients. As one of our clients put it not only do we need to Verisk help on this issue, the industry needs your help. Our value proposition is clear. Verisk strategically invests in data and technology at scale to deliver economic value to our customers through operational efficiencies and better decision making. In both the insurance and energy industries, we benefit from the growing demand for data analytics from our customers, along with their increased ability to ingest and use our rapidly growing datasets. We deliver greater value per dollar invested than our clients would be able to individually and we are in an advantaged position as few companies enjoy closer ties to and a greater understanding of their clients businesses than Verisk. This is a responsibility that we do not take lightly, as it is this unique proposition that will power our growth and drive long-term value creation for shareholders, customers and employees. As we focus and define the strategic orientation over 2022, we expect to lay out our plans in greater detail at an Investor Day in the first quarter of 2023, following the reporting of our fourth quarter 2022 results. During the second quarter, we made a series of new leadership announcements as we build out the team that will lead Verisk forward. Of importance to many of you on this call, we recently announced that Elizabeth Mann will be joining Verisk as our Chief Financial Officer. Elizabeth joins us from S&P Global, where she was the Chief Financial Officer of Ratings and Mobility divisions. And before that she was Senior Vice President of Capital Management, which included oversight of the Treasury department Elizabeth will bring very relevant experience and a fresh perspective that I know will improve our organization financially and operationally. She will be joining us on September 15, and we look forward to introducing her to you and she will welcome your perspectives as she comes up the curve on Verisk. In addition, we recently announced that Maroun Mourad has been named President of Claims Solutions. Maroun has been a key leader in our Underwriting and Rating business since 2015, serving as President of ISO, Commercial Lines, President, Global Underwriting and most recently President, Life & Growth markets. Maroun brings deep industry expertise from as many leadership roles at Gen Re, AIG, Arch and Zurich across underwriting, operations and general management. He also brings a great entrepreneurial spirit and a true customer-centric approach to the business and is the right leader to help drive our vision of revolutionizing claims for the industry to automation, technology and advanced analytics. Maroun takes the reigns from Rich Della Rocca who has retired after 27 years with Verisk. We thank Rich for all of his many contributions to Verisk and wish him very well in his retirement. We also announced that Tim Rayner has been named President of Verisk Specialty Business Solutions. Our U.K.-based business centered around our Sequel suite of insurance software. The Specialty Business Solutions team is a linchpin in our strategy to create an automated in interconnected ecosystem for the insurance industry in the U.K., EU and beyond. And Tim is the right leader to drive that strategy. Tim joined Verisk in 2018, after a long and successful career in the insurance industry holding various leadership roles at Miller Insurance Services. Now, let me provide an update on both our progress towards being an insurance focus data analytic solutions provider and our commitment to furthering margin expansion. We're making steady progress on our evaluation of the separation of the energy business. The preparation of the internal separation analysis and standalone financials are ongoing and we have hired a team of outside advisors who are engaged in the next phase of our process of developing alternatives available to us. Our timing expectations remain unchanged and as we have stated previously, our decisions will continue to be guided by shareholder feedback, value considerations and market conditions. As many of you know, we have also undertaken a broad shareholder survey for the benefit of your perspectives, not only on the energy separation, but how we can improve in meeting investor expectations generally. On our EBITDA margin expansion objective, we continue to be very confident in our ability to achieve our stated target to deliver 300 to 500 basis points of margin expansion by 2024 often insurance only baseline of 50% to 51% normalized adjusted EBITDA margins. We have taken some early steps, including the restructuring of our marketing function, office space consolidation and a greater emphasis on our global talent optimization hiring. Additionally, we have embarked on a span of control analysis to guide further operational efficiencies. We continue to experience the impact of the stranded corporate allocations from the businesses we have sold in our reported segment margins. It is important to remember that 2022 is likely to remain quite noisy due to the impact of portfolio changes and implementation costs. As such, we continue to expect to the margin expansion to be increasingly visible over 2023 as we move past the timing impacts of the portfolio changes in implementations and work toward previously stated 2024 target. Now I will turn the call over to Mark for some more color on the insurance business performance. Thanks, Dave. In summary, our businesses are strong and we are making important progress, executing on our strategic and operational initiatives, including the evaluation of the separation of the energy business and our margin expansion targets. As we evaluate options for the energy business, we will continue to focus on pursuing the most value creating path for our shareholders and we'll also consider market conditions and timing. We are confident that with the recent transformation of our portfolio and active cost management over we can deliver growth in line with our long-term objectives with organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth ahead of revenue growth, reflecting our strong operating leverage. Finally, I wanted to remind you that we are planning an Investor Day for the first quarter of 2023 to be held at our offices in Jersey City. We will provide more details as it gets closer and we certainly hope you will join us. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions. Thank you, Heather. I'll start off and then ask offer Mark an opportunity to provide additional color as the Chief Operating Officer. He has been leading that initiative and really driving it's today. At a high level, as I indicated in the call, we are very confident that we will be in a position to deliver on the expected range of margin improvement of 300 to 500 basis points of that 50% to 51% baseline for an insurance only business described the elements that we are considering. We've taken a look at all alternatives that have been identified to us internally and externally. And are working against those directly, some of those have already been underway. I'll let Mark kind of describe, but some of the things that we have been doing. In terms of phasing, we are [technical difficulty] at this point to give specific direction potentially as we kind of look towards the Investor Day, and we have a clear picture of 2023 and specifically the macroeconomic environment that we're looking at. We might be in a position to provide some greater clarity around that. But this at this point, there are too many moving pieces for us to estimate. But as I indicated, we'll expect to see clear progress across 2023. And with that, just offer Mark an opportunity to add any color. And Heather, the only thing I would add is that of course, as I think all companies are these days are aware of the impact of inflation across the business, and particularly the competitive environment from a compensation standpoint. And so we have factored that in at this point, we believe that we can absorb those costs make some steps and improving our retention and still deliver on that. So to your macroeconomic comment, we do recognize that there have been some pressures that may influence the results in 2023 and 2024, but reiterate our confidence in the original target that we set out. Thank you, John. Mark, do you want to take that. And so, John, at a high level, as Mark describing, there are a lot of individual effects on the transactional businesses, some of which are shorter term timing related, there may be some systemic or secular elements on the workers comp. But generally, I think across those transactional businesses, we did see sequential improvement from the first quarter, the second quarter and I think the kind of the stronger trend will be kind of a continued normalization. So certainly, there are a lot of factors and individual elements, but we feel as though we should see kind of continued normalization on those growth rates. Yes. Thank you for the question, Alex. So in terms of overall timing that remains the same. We are on track to have a decision on energy by the end of the third quarter in conjunction with our third quarter earnings release with execution of that alternative to actually follow given the various kind of timing of executing on that. And with that, timing, I would describe this as being exactly where we anticipated completing the kind of separation of the accounting work and analysis. As I indicated, we have advisors that are engaged in this project, they along with our team are actively evaluating all of the alternatives. And so everything from a private sale to a separately capitalized spin out as well as retention are still alternatives that we are weighing. We're being guided by what we think is in the best interest of our shareholders from a value perspective and factoring risk in timing. I've seen the markets are different almost by definition from where we were when we originally announced this. And so the financing market as a function of changes in interest rates is more challenging than it was previously. And naturally, obviously equity markets are also down. Those are all factors that we will consider as we think about the value of the business and the value to our shareholders. Thank you. Thank you for the question, Toni. And I think the simple answer is the differentiated performance between our subscription-oriented business, where we are capturing the strength of the value of that Lens platform as well as the strong demand for our energy transition, our chemicals, metals and mining business. And so there, excluding the Russian impact the overall growth in that business is solidly in that mid-single digits level at 5.2%. And the weak part of it has been in the consulting side. And there - I think there are two factors. We had a very strong 2021 with the rebound in that and it has been challenged by resource constraints frankly, the level of demand for the businesses there. But given the demand for our professionals with energy and energy transition expertise, it has been more challenging for us to have the resources against those consulting projects. And so, I think the combination of those two factors and the decline in revenues in that business while a very strong environment as you indicated has obscured what we think is the fundamentals we're seeing re-achieving again and positive momentum in the subscription revenues. We continue to see very solid growth in our ACV from Lens and research as a function of everything that you described. But that's the short answer, right. I think that addresses your question, Toni. Thank you for the question, Manav. I'll turn it over for Mark for his perspective. Yes and Manav, I would add. I was recently out on the West Coast and had an opportunity to meet a number of our clients in the InsurTech space that are out there. And several of them are specifically focused on life applications. And I will tell you the thing that is really - the two things that are really compelling. One is, how they are availing themselves of broader datasets that formally really weren't as relevant in the life space. So there is an appetite for data and a utilization of data and there is a real focus on the availability of instantaneous data so that they can make underwriting decisions. So I mentioned that, because I think they represent the leading edge of where we see life insurance going and that speaks to the broader opportunity that we face or the broader opportunity that we have in front of us to be gathering those datasets of scale. Developing those applications and then deploying it against our relationships on the insurance side, we have done incredibly successfully with the FAST acquisition. So while still, I'm not material contributor to our overall business, it is one that clearly we believe has tremendous penetration potential and growth potential. So Jeff, I'll start and then I'll ask is Stacey to describe it. Essentially, we have the allocated corporate costs that exist, but we still are - we still bear or simply be allocated on a variety of basis, but generally kind of proportionate to the scale of the business. And so that impact, we have to allocate those cost somewhere and they are being allocated to the insurance in the energy business. Stacey, you feel [ph] you're embellishing. So Faiza, thanks for the question. So when - we talk about our international business naturally, our energy business is substantially an international business. And so I - in that regard, we've kind of commented on two - in answer to Toni's questions, the strength that we've seen in subscription - growth on basis for us and function of our successful wins as well as on the consulting side. On the international business from an insurance perspective, there are a, variety of businesses, the most significant of which is our specialty business solutions business. And our business that is providing a software-oriented ecosystem to the non-standard Lloyd's market. It is a business that has generated very strong revenue growth rates. It's a double - it has been a double-digit grower within the business, we have successfully integrated other bolt-on acquisitions such as a ratings engine within that business. And we're very happy with the performance of that business and our ability to expand off of that. That is one piece of a larger portfolio of insurance businesses that we have developed, which have generally been additive to our overall growth rate. I'll ask Mark, maybe to describe a couple of the other components of the businesses and generally the performance and their contributions to our international businesses. But I just want to make that distinction between energy and insurance. And so I think as we expect it to continue to be additive, we also view it as the broader opportunity and recognizing that in the U.S., we have the advantage of having been a utility or the P&C insurance industry and that doesn't exist to the same extent internationally, but software provides an ability for us to connect and create ecosystems, where we achieve a similar dynamic. And that's going to specifically what we have observed with our specialty business solutions element. And so, we're particularly interested in businesses, where we are connecting the industry and we are facilitating industry efficiencies and improved performance. And the international market, in many respects, is not as developed as what we have here in the U.S., and that's what we're excited about continuing to pursue. And Jeff, I would just add kind of a broader overlay which is as Mark is describing, we are seeing some of that near-term pressure on in the business, but longer term, we believe the fundamental driver is the demand for that marketing technology, that demand for kind of delivering that data in that underwriting decision increasingly at the point of sale is what we continue to drive the growth in that business as the industry moves to deliver on that digital experience that Mark described. And maybe summarizing that, we are taking share across all this. So when volumes return, we have taken share and that will be reflected in transactions. Andrew, thank you for the very clear question. And so I'll deal with it in the two parts. I think the conclusion that you drew or the logic that you described is consistent that we see with the ACV growth. And the layering on additional contracts where we've been able to up price the research product as a function of the value of our clients see in Lens. That should continue to have a positive impact on the overall growth rate. And so we do anticipate momentum on that front over the balance of the year. The more difficult element estimate is the consulting side. And so I think that is one where in this competitive market, we face a challenge in getting the level of resources that we think fully address the demand. So I would say, I think we believe that's the case for the research business. On the consulting side, it's a little bit more difficult. And I'd say conservatively that we probably wouldn't anticipate at this point a material change on the consulting front. Certainly. So thanks for the questions. So as you can imagine, our primary focus at this stage is on the near-term objective of the energy separation analysis and project, and two the margin expansion opportunity. And so that is where most of our corporate resources are focused M&A from an M&A standpoint. And then secondly, as we are -- opportunity to evaluate where the business is where we want to take it. What are other opportunities that we have in front of it and how we want to think about internal versus external investment that is occupying that of the next largest part of our time and as we defined that certainly M&A will be a part of how we think about deploying capital and creating value. We have demonstrated in areas particularly on the insurance side, where we have a new dataset for a new technology as with FAST and with Sequel and with Jornaya, we have the ability to materially accelerate revenue growth within those businesses and integrating those with our dataset. So I want to say that we are -- we will continue to look for opportunities where we can materially improve the business and create value through strong returns on the invested capital. That will be our primary focus. It will be in the scale level, but I think you've seen, but for the near-term, we don't expect this high level of activity. One thing that I want to emphasize is that we are not looking at any new verticals outside of insurance and I think until we come to a resolution on the energy business looking at anything in the energy space. So that would be the direction that I provide you. Thank you for the question, George. I may ask you to repeat the rather extended second part of the question. Let me remind you George, as we said explicitly when we provided the guidance that the margin improvement of 300 to 500 basis points was specifically associated with focused entity. I'm sorry just ask you to review that I think there is the answer to your question. The determination of what we do with energy, we'll have to evaluate. So if that business is retain then there will be a different margin profile. We will still seek to achieve those cost savings related to the insurance business overall and look for margin expansion, but those savings were clearly defined as specific to an insurance focus entity. And I ask you to reiterate the second part of your question, George. George, we continue to maintain our long-term targets for the overall business we've said repeatedly in the past that 7% organic growth is our target. We demonstrated ability to achieve that. We are -- I'm not at the stage where we're changing our long-term guidance for the business, obviously we have an ongoing objective to exceed that growth rate and our compensation systems are tied to over achieving against that goal."

            "content": "Thanks, Mark. Before I begin, I want to remind everyone that all consolidating GAAP results are negatively impacted by the recent dispositions of 3E and Verisk Financial Services. That will continue through the first quarter of 2023 when we will earn anniversary those transactions. For the second quarter of 2022, on a consolidated basis, revenues were $746 million, a modest decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of recent dispositions and headwinds from FX rate changes, which were most pronounced in our Energy segment offset and part by acquisitions. Net income attributable to Verisk increased 28% to $198 million while diluted GAAP EPS attributable to Verisk increased 32% to $1.24. The increase was primarily due to a lower tax provision this year versus the prior-year period, which included a non-cash revaluation charge related to an increase in U.K. tax rates that became [effective] last year. Moving to our OCC results, adjusted for non-operating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, we are pleased with our operating results led by continued and consistent growth in our subscription revenues. In the second quarter, OCC revenues grew 5.3% driven by continued strength in our insurance segment. Our subscription revenues increased 6.2% while our transactional revenues increased a more modest 1.7%. Adjusting for $3.5 million in prior year revenues associated with our energy business in Russia, OCC revenues would have grown 5.9% and subscription revenues would have grown 6.9%. Consolidated OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 4.4% in the second quarter, normalizing for the prior year revenue associated with our energy business in Russia and the incremental expenses associated with exiting that business. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 5.7%. Total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results was 51.0%, up 140 basis points from the prior year, reflecting strong cost and operational discipline as well as the benefits from recent dispositions. This level of margin includes approximately 80 basis points of headwind from recent acquisitions, 60 basis points of headwind from our ongoing technological transformation, including cloud expenses, which we absorbed into our cost structure and 60 basis points from higher year-over-year G&A expenses. Finally, this margin also reflects about 60 basis points of headwind from the timing shifts related to executive compensation, which we told you about last quarter, and will have no impact on full-year results. On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an OCC basis. In the second quarter, Insurance segment revenues increased 6.4%. We saw healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, claims analytics, extreme events, life insurance and international specialty business solutions, subscription revenues increased 7.3% while transactional revenues were up 2.7%. We continue to experience strong recovery growth in certain of our transactional businesses, including international travel insurance solution, but continues to be pressured by weakness in workers compensation, as well as softness in personal auto underwriting as the dealing with some dislocation as Mark described earlier. Adjusted EBITDA grew 6.1% in the second quarter, while margins declined 180 basis points to 54.7%. These margins reflect heavier burden from the corporate costs that were previously allocated to businesses that have been disposed the impact of recently acquired businesses, higher cloud expenses and the partial normalization of travel back into the business. This level of margin also includes continued investment in our high growth areas like life insurance and marketing solutions. Energy and specialized market revenues increased 0.8% in the second quarter, normalizing for the impact of suspended operations in Russia, energy revenue growth was 3.6%. The end market continues to be volatile and impacted by geopolitical developments, but we are seeing sequential improvements in our subscription revenue growth rates as our customers are trying to witness some of the data and analytics. Our subscription revenues increased 1.7% and was affected by our decision to suspend all commercial operations in Russia. Normalizing for Russia, subscription revenue growth was 5.2% led by double-digit growth in energy transitions, chemicals and metals and mining research coupled with modest growth in our core research subscriptions. Additionally, we continue to experience strong adoption [technical difficulty] expansion from our Lens renewals. Transactional revenues decreased 2.8% as growth was constrained by consulting resources as we are seeing an elevated level of employee attrition due to a competitive market for expertise in energy and technology. We are working to offset this trend and have demonstrated success in attracting talent to our energy business as well. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 6.4% in the second quarter and margins contracted 90 basis points to 34.6%. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin includes $1.1 million in incremental expense related to the suspension of operations in Russia. Normalizing for the Russian impact, adjusted EBITDA growth would have been 3.6%. In addition to the incremental Russian expense, this margin also reflects the partial normalization of travel expense back into the business and higher cloud expenses. It also reflects continued investment in Lens as we further build our capability to garner maximum value from the platform including Lens power, energy transitions, chemicals and metals and mining. Looking to the remainder of 2022, loss of Russian revenues and adjusted EBITDA will negatively impact each quarter by approximately $4 million per quarter. Verisk Financial Services results are included in our reported numbers, but not in the OCC figures. We sold Verisk Financial Services to TransUnion on April 8. Our reported effective tax rate was 18.3% compared to 35.6% in the prior year quarter. The prior year's tax rate was elevated due to a non-cash revaluation charge with a U.K. tax law change, we also benefited in the quarter from higher level stock option exercise activity as compared to last year. Looking ahead to the remainder of 2022, we expect the tax rate to be between 20% and 23% in the third and fourth quarters of 2022, though, there could likely be some quarterly variability related to employee stock option exercise activity. Adjusted net income increased 28% to $244 million and diluted adjusted EPS increased 31% to $1.53 for the second quarter of 2022. These increases reflect organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions, a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count. Net cash provided by operating activities was $130 million for the quarter, down 44% from the prior year period due to a tax payment of $122 million primarily related to the gain on sale of 3E as well as the loss of operating cash flows related to the dispositions. Adjusting for these unique items, operating cash flow would have increased by a double-digit rate year-over-year. Capital expenditures were $69 million for the quarter, up 11% versus last year, reflecting increases in capitalized software development, offset in part by savings on third-party hardware and software as we move to the cloud. We continue to expect our capital expenditures to be within the range of $280 million to $310 million. This range supports our plans to increase our software investment through the acceleration of our pace of development in Lens and extending software development into core underwriting that we believe there is similar opportunity for platform enhancement. Related to CapEx, we now expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization to be within the range of $210 million to $230 million and intangible amortization to be approximately $170 million. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to FX variability, the timing of purchases, and completion of projects and future M&A activity. During the second quarter, we returned $374 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends as our strong cash flow allows us to invest behind our highest growth and highest return initiatives while also consistently returning capital to shareholders. Additionally, in June, we entered into a new $300 million accelerated share repurchase agreement to be completed in the third quarter. And now, I'll turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments. Yes. Andrew, thank you for the question and the opportunity to address that. I want to be very clear. We believe that the transaction revenue over time, it's something that is -- at least at the 7% and actually historically has contributed a higher level of growth and reflects in a lot of ways the applications of new data and new technology that is expressed at the initial stage in transaction related activity that generates revenue for us. So I think what we are experiencing right now are the impacts a bit of the overhang of the pandemic, more people working from home, as Mark described workers comp impact on auto in the macroeconomic environment. But we maintain complete confidence that the transactional driven businesses over time and on a normalized basis will be additive to our overall growth rate and can certainly exceed our 7% long-term target"

            "content": "Thanks, Lee. I'm pleased to share that the Insurance segment delivered another solid quarter. Across insurance, we're experiencing strong growth in subscription revenues across both underwriting and claims, resulting in OCC subscription growth of 7.3% segment overall and demonstrate stability and consistency of our business model and the must have nature of our solutions. Within underwriting, we had strong results from core underwriting, extreme event solutions and our international software business. We also had healthy contribution certain of our newer acquired businesses including life insurance and marketing solutions. Within life insurance, we had delivered strong sales growth from the addition of new customers and expansion of existing relationships. Life insurers are embarking on the modernization and digital transformation of the core systems and FAST software offers flexibility and speed of implementation helps insurers achieve their goals in a timely and cost efficient manner. Extreme event solutions had a strong quarter, driven by the addition of new customers added to our core touchdown platform as well as expansion of multi-year deals with existing customers. In addition to catastrophe bond market continues to be strong and Verisk is growing its share in that market. Our sustainability and country risk business also had a strong quarter as demand for our risk indices in both corporate and investor segments continue to drive strong double-digit growth. Within claims, we're experiencing strong growth in our fraud fighting analytics, driven by the addition of new customers and expanded use cases. More specifically, our new claims essentials bundle designed for self-insured and third party administrators provides an end-to-end claim solutions. It is deriving conversion to subscriptions from customers approval to use our solutions on a more limited and transactional basis. We also recently announced exclusive partnership with LIMRA and LOMA, an industry research organization, life and annuity insurance industry fight the account takeover flood situation. Insurance transaction revenues grew a more modest 2.7%. We have seen a strong rebound in our international travel business that has been offset by headwinds for both our workers' compensation claims solutions and softer results from our personal auto underwriting. In addition, in the first half of the year has seen a lower level of storm activity versus the prior year and historic averages. More specifically, our workers compensation solutions are dealing with two headwinds, including volume levels are down at least 25% across the industry, as well as new regulations, that are slowing the pace settlement. That said, we are not sitting still. We have recently implemented process improvements to help drive greater throughput, a new customer outreach to drive volumes to Verisk. U.S. insurance industry is generally healthy shorter term insurers are dealing with the impact of interest rate volatility inflation and rising loss ratios. This is having disproportionate impact on personal lines in InsurTech players in certain geographic markets. While insurers are increasing rates to help cover inflation and repair costs, it takes time to fully take effect across the entire book of business. Specifically in personal auto, we're seeing lower levels of underwriting activity, which is resulting in lower transaction volumes and revenue. The industry is dealing with higher inflation and supply chain shortages, which are pushing up physical damage claims costs. As a result, the industry's raising rates a temporary pulling back on new business to improve profitability. Notably, we're also watching carefully the developments in Florida homeowners insurance market. This is a market that is dominated by small local companies as widespread exposure to climate related risks and is dealing with elevated levels of litigation in fraud. This combination is leading to pull back underwriting and increase in insurer liquidations and exits from the market. As a result, these risks are moving to the state-run insurer of last resort. The state of Florida recently created a reinsurance facility to bring more stability to the homeowners market to address these issues and help our customers on the underwriting side, we are facilitating new market participants and have expanded our relationship with the statewide insurer to help price and select risk. On the claims slide, we're helping customers including State government agencies with this claim score and analytics to improve their ability to investigate and identify fraud. This is a developing situation almost staying close to our customers and regulators. Through our customer engagement, we know that the insurance industry is focused on becoming more automated, more digitally engaged and more connected and they're directing, spending toward these projects. They turn to Verisk as a key partner to drive these initiatives forge, which has been a key driver of our growth. We can use to help our customers select and price risk and route out fraud with our advanced data analytics and believe that we are well positioned to continue to grow as we advance our mission to become a trusted partner from the technology and analyst perspective for the industry. I turn the call over to Interim CFO. David Grover for financial review. So first of all, I think I can tell you we are on plan. I think all of our businesses and support centers have kind of stepped up to the challenge of trying to be more effective and more efficient. As a result of just our overall cost structure, a lot of the focus has been on people and trying to make sure that we are thoughtful about where we need to replace and where we need positions, and we've tried to maintain a rigor around that both when we're hiring new and where that position could be. So a part of the thought is not only to be more effective and more efficient inside of our operations. It's also about where are those people could and should be hired. So we have some operations in Hyderabad, we have some operations that are in Malaga, we have some operation that are in [indiscernible] and we have some operations in Costa Rica, which in the place and we try to become a little bit more internationally where we place those positions and try to make sure that we have the right talent and maybe at lower costs. Facilities is key to that, I think we're making some progress there. We've limited smaller offices. We made some progress with a couple of our major ones. The real estate market, commercial real estate market particular is a little bit slow. So we are probably a little behind on one of those -- probably a little ahead one of those major offices. And then I think I just kind of talk more broadly about where we want to invest and I think the teams have doing a great job of really focusing on where can we get the best ROIC. So there is instances where we're going to reallocate dollars into higher opportunities and we're sunsetting some opportunities where we say due to that maybe that return is not so great. And we probably have kind of come up with the notion of a little bit about more fast sale on some of the smaller products. And I think you're around on track and I think you'll see as we said good benefits from that program as we transition into 2023. Sure. So let me provide a little color as to what I say, I don't remember exactly, your auto, let me start with workers' comp and I'll segue through it. So on the claims side, what we've seen is two things, really. Overall, the industry today relative to pre-pandemic, there's just fewer workers compensation claims. I think in large part, that's a function of you working at home. There's not a lot of slip and falls when you're sitting in your living room and as a result, there's just an overall downturn in the number of claims and that business is transactional. Two, there has been regulation. This is kind of inside of the world of how the government interacts insurers as to who pays us set aside and what that change has done. This has caused some of the insurers to kind of change their processes, probably moving towards a more rigorous process by which they submit those claims as opposed to some of the maybe short cuts that we're starting to happen. So that has also slowed down the buying. That is just a timing thing. The first one is more systemic at least time being, which relate to work from home. Two, on the claims side, I think you were talking a little bit about volumes in -- our repair cost estimating and how weather -- personal auto was the third one, okay. So I'll go to personal next. From a personal auto perspective, I think the other item that we're seeing is because of the challenges in the industry, meaning the world of inflation and cost repairing cars, profitability is starting to be hurt by that loss ratios are up. So when you bring on new business, right, usually there is a short-term loss, so the cost of bringing on that new business. And it takes time to get insurance rate increases. So you have to file those. So there is a general pullback and some of the underwriting of new business, there is less shopping online and because there's less shopping, there is less transactions and people pulling our data around those auto transactions things like loss histories, who is the prior coverage with things around motor vehicle reports. That's the type of information we typically provide. So hopefully that color is there. If I heard correctly, I think the last thing was just generally from a recurrent cost estimate perspective, it's been a very quiet storm season, most of our business is subscription based there is some transactional element to when storms happen, there is typically some adjusters that why software transactions kind of fluctuate up and down with storms. Yes, I look forward to and thank you for the question. I think we talked about life and marketing. Life has been a wonderful story. What we've seen is, inside of those insurers that are really looking to upgrade probably decades, old technology. Our fast solution has been winning the day and that is a combination of trying true traditional life insurers and there's been a lot of the secondary market or a lot of M&A, where private equities getting involved and buying books of business. Because we're able to implement quickly and then a very low cost in this no-code low-code environment we have been the kind of gender and strategic partner of choice. The beauty of these contracts at the beginning is a little bit implementation, but everyone is going to be moving on to the platform and what you see is not only do they put their business on, they start adding lines and they start extending across legal entities. So we have a combination of new logos, but also more business coming onto the platform. And as you think about the way we - for that obviously, the subscription revenue associated with those like - are going to continue to grow nicely. What we are doing is kind of uniquely positioning solution with not only a combination of great modular software, but analytics, so you can better understand - underwrite business which parallels a lot of the things we did in P&C. So we've kind of taken a little bit about P&C playbook, we've augmented with some great technology and I think we're starting to really make a difference in the life insurance space so, very happy with the progress there. I don't know, we've given the size of that business, but it is certainly growing quite quickly with the high double-digits And just to tie it altogether, we referenced [indiscernible] that's an example of us kind of bring it in industry dataset and industry organization to fight fraud things that we do well in the P&C side. So kind of a good example of these comments. Yes, that's great. And I think we highlighted that what you would probably recognize Sequel suite of insurance software has been the bigger element and the big grower over U.K. and beyond. We also have an underwriting business that kind of [technical difficulty] as it relates to understanding risks, understanding exposures. But we go beyond there and talk about insurance as it relates to travel and even pet insurance. Those have both come back and it started to grow nicely. That has been nice grower, once again, we're thinking of our international businesses contributing to and actually helping us accelerate our overall organic growth. Other two things that I'll quickly highlight is we kind of continue to extend selectively often it does a lot of the things that we do here in United States, as it relates to property underwriting, they do it in Canada. So, that is a new acquisition that has been a good contributor and kind of new to the Verisk family as well as ACTINEO, which takes us into Germany again inside the claims space, primarily around auto. So our approach broadly, it's been more around software and a little bit on the claims side around services augmented with solutions and things that we do in the U.S., trying to export them with a local footprint and all of that has been successful with - our international growth. Great, so Andrew thanks again. So our theme that is across all insurers is this digital engagement trying to make sure they really satisfy the customer. So what we've attempted to do from a P&C perspective, especially, on the personal line side is due to this ultimate prefill. I mean, that's kind of the way, sometimes you hear described. If you call and you give us your name a number, we can fill in all the information, everything about you and give you a quote, that is you being an insurer, and we support to facilitate that. But we wanted to go one step further, we wanted to go even further to the front-end and as you're providing that quote, what if we found the right group of people to share that quotes. So what our team at [indiscernible] and some of the marketing solution SaaS is, we are the industry standard as that we know sitting a website who's shopping. So we know who's actually shopping for insurance. So this is a wide and very real opportunity to kind of drive this pipeline to drive this funnel a real opportunity and provide that. So the marketing solutions have been a nice extension to both our P&C, as well as our life insurance opportunities. It's that front end that gives us the opportunity. There probably is some cyclicality of that, if it's a difficult time and people are trying to cut costs. There's probably more or less marketing spend that happens. But because of the unique situation that our marketing solution to [indiscernible] we sit on these websites. No one else really had the ability to do what we do, it's not like we're competing directly against Google, it's - we have these relationships that we understand who the - real candidates are. And what we also have the ability to do selectively is to take that capability and extend it beyond P&C. So it allows us to do life and P&C insurance, but to the extent that someone's buy house, they're a prime candidate for P&C insurance, but it's also a prime candidate for someone who needs a mortgage. So there is an extension and big opportunity even inside of other vertical markets where we're selectively looking. So I hope that gives you the color you're looking for. Yes so, great question. Now I'm going to piece it back together and respond may be a little out of order. So first of all, from the end to beginning, we are continuing to see uptake in LightSpeed, people love the concept and people continue to buy the solution. What we're seeing though is the volumes coming through the solution are depressed a little bit. And the short answer is, there's less shopping. I'll give you the example that I think you're looking for. Some of the InsurTechs that had been our early adopters who had a lot of volume coming through all of a sudden now start to focus on profitability. As they start to focus on profitability, that causes them to pull back on writing new business, right. There is a direct correlation, there at least nearly life of a policy. So that's a step of it. Two, kind of your other question-- related question is to about rate and taking rate. Everybody is working rates. I've seen some rate increases as high as 40% by some filings as it relates to certain states. They are coming, but people will start to write again when they get the rate increases they want. How long does that take, it really depends, sometimes on the inner workings of some insurers especially in personal auto, they use this as [technical difficulty] they don't use our direct filings. So that could take six months to nine months to get in place for before things start to ramp up again, because they have price that they expect make them profitable hope that was responsive to most of your questions."

Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After today\u2019s prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.\nStacey Brodbar: Thank you, Justin, and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our first quarter 2022 financial results. On the call are Scott Stephenson, Verisk's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Lee Shavel, incoming CEO; Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer and incoming President; and David Grover, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as our traditional and quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days, on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about our future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. I would also like to note that the financial results for recent dispositions of 3E and Verisk Financial Services are included in our consolidated and GAAP results are excluded from all organic constant currency growth figures. A reconciliation is provided in our 8-K. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Scott.\nScott Stephenson: Thanks, Stacey. Good day, everyone. And thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. The past 21 years at Verisk had been an incredible and rewarding journey. It's been my absolute privilege to serve as Chairman and CEO during such a transformative time for our company. I'm incredibly proud of the growth that we delivered and the value that we created for customers, employees and shareholders. And we always deliver this value by acting with the highest level of integrity. Our company's success has always been a team effort. To that end I'm delighted we have such a deep bench of talent, including our incoming CEO. Lee Shavel and incoming President, Mark Anquillare, who I know will drive continued growth for our company and Verisk towards becoming a global insurance focused data analytics solution provider. I look forward to seeing the work that all Verisk teammates will do to drive innovation and growth or long-term success. As this is my final earnings call, I also wanted to take a moment to thank all the shareholders and analysts that have covered Verisk for your effort and your support over the years. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Lee.\nLee Shavel: Thanks, Scott, and Good day everyone. On behalf of the entire Verisk team, Scott, let me thank you for your dedication and service to Verisk. We wish you all the very best in your well-deserved retirement. It has been a privilege to work with you and learn from you over the past five years and I'm fortunate to have your ongoing support and counsel. I'm pleased to share that Verisk delivered solid first quarter results. First quarter organic constant currency revenue grew 5.3% and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA grew 4.1%. Adjusted for the impact of the suspension of our commercial operations in Russia and higher discrete professional fees, organic constant currency revenue grew 5.7% and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA grew 6.9% We delivered solid growth across the insurance segment with the fastest growth reported in Marketing Solutions, International Specialty Business Solutions, Life Insurance, Extreme Events Solutions and Claims Analytics. We also had solid contributions from our industry standard solutions in underwriting. Within energy we continued to see improving results across both subscriptions and consulting with the strongest growth in the energy transition, chemicals and metals and mining. We have experienced softness in certain of our transactional businesses, including workers compensation, which is experiencing continued weakness as carriers are adjusting to new regulation within the industry. In addition, our property estimating solutions had weaker transactional growth related to a slower storm season versus last year's ice storms in Texas. Finally, the auto underwriting business continues to deal with a lower level of shopping activity. Our results also included headwinds from the suspension of commercial operations in Russia, increased cloud costs, higher discrete professional fees in the quarter, and the partial normalization of travel and entertainment in the post-pandemic environment. We will provide more details on the financial review section of the call. In preparation for officially stepping into the role as CEO over the last 75 days, we have visited our offices in London, Boston, Lehi, Utah, and of course Jersey City to meet with the employees and leadership teams of all our business units. Many of these individuals are longtime colleagues, and I'm excited to build on these relationships going forward. In addition, I've had the opportunity to meet with more than a dozen of our most significant customers, some of whom I've interacted with throughout my tenure here. I've long known the valued role we play as a technology partner to our customers, and I'm more energized than ever about the extraordinary opportunity we have to expand the breadth and the depth of those relationships. Our value proposition is very clear. Verisk strategically invest in data and technology at scale in order to deliver economic value to our customers through operational efficiencies and better decision-making across the industries we serve. In insurance our customers look to us to help them better select risk and facilitate the automation of legacy processes to improve efficiencies and underwriting and claims. They also turn to Verisk for support with the digitization of their customer experience. And to enable the use of new datasets and platforms for expanded product lines. The development of our Touchstone platform and Extreme Events Solutions, the Lightspeed product suite and underwriting and the development of our life business are tangible examples of what we have delivered to clients. And in energy understanding the complex impacts of the energy transition and the geopolitical events continuing to unfold in Ukraine on the global energy economy remain a primary customer focus. There is strong demand for improved data delivery and analytics and we continue to deliver on that demand for our customers through our Lens platform. In fact, the first quarter was our fourth consecutive quarter of mid-to-high single-digit ACB growth helped by new multiyear contracts with material upsell for customers that are adopting Lens as they recognize the value of this new platform delivers. In both insurance and energy, we benefit from the growing demand for data analytics from our customers, along with their increased ability to ingest and utilize our rapidly growing datasets and technologies to make better decisions and drive operational efficiency. We create lift from these growth engines through the industry scale at which we can deliver greater value per dollar invested than our clients will be able to individually. Growth and returns on invested capital have been and will continue to be the primary driver of value creation for our shareholders over the long-term, and my highest priority as CEO will be to continue to deliver on both. We are well positioned in industries with massive opportunities that will require investment in focus in areas where we can maximize value for our customers. It also requires delivering value for our employees and when we rely for their talent, commitment and effort. We operate in a highly competitive market for talent and must be sure that Verisk remains a very attractive destination for the best and brightest. Moving from our long-term value creation strategy to our near-term focus on the activities we described to drive enhance shareholder value. I wanted to provide an update on both our progress towards being an insurance focused data analytics solutions provider and our commitment to achieving margin expansion. We are making steady progress on the separation of the energy business. We are actively engaged in a detailed planning and modeling exercise of the financial, legal, tax and operational costs associated with separating the business. This analysis will inform valuation and the transaction structure that we intend to pursue subject to market conditions and shareholder value considerations. Our timing expectations remain unchanged. On our EBITDA improvement objectives as Mark will describe in greater detail those still early we have identified several areas of organic cost efficiencies at the operating and corporate level to drive margin expansion. These opportunities include the consolidation of certain real estate locations, as leases come due, or to the extent sudden lease opportunities are available. The increased usage of our global talent optimization locations for new hires and more efficient technology investment, including the closure of our on-premise data centers. We will also reduce corporate overhead after we complete the transition services agreements associated with the sale of 3d and Verisk Financial Services. As we previously announced in mid-March, the company continues moving towards the goal of being a global insurance focused data analytics solutions provider. We expect to deliver 300 to 500 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion and the consolidated remaining insurance focused business by 2024 against a baseline of 50% to 51%, normalized adjusted EBITDA margins, now the 55% adjusted EBITDA margin that our insurance segment delivered in 2021. Indeed, 55% does not represent a normalized run rate for the insurance business as it does not account for a number of offsets, including first corporate overhead costs allocated to other businesses of approximately 200 basis points. Second, the impact of three strategic insurance related acquisitions made over the last two quarters, approximately 80 basis points. And finally, the normalization for incremental cloud transition, and post-pandemic travel and entertainment expenses, for a combined approximately 170 basis points. In addition, investments in new financial and human capital systems will provide greater efficiency opportunities when fully implemented but will pressure margins in the near-term as well inflationary and competitive compensation pressures, but these effects are all embedded in the 300 to 500 basis point target. We should note, the 2022 is likely to be quite noisy due to the impact of portfolio changes and implementation costs, as well as the impact of other environmental issues. As such, we expect the margin expansion to be most visible beginning in 2023 as we move past the timing impacts of the portfolio changes in implementation. Based on our work to-date, we are very confident in our ability to achieve our stated target for EBITDA expansion by 2024 as we originally disclosed. Before turning it over to Mark, let me provide a quick update on the CFO search. We continue to make progress and are prioritizing public companies CFOs with operational efficiency experience. In the meantime, David Grover, Verisk\u2019s Controller and Chief Accounting Officer has been acting as Interim Chief Financial Officer and is well suited for this job. I'll now turn it over to Mark for some more color on the insurance business.\nMark Anquillare: Thanks, Lee. Before I begin, I also want to take a moment to thank Scott for all that he has contributed to Verisk. The legacy that you're leaving is rooted in the way our teams innovate, and always deliver for our customers. I wish you the very best in your retirement. It has been a pleasure to partner with you for all these years. And I'm excited to build on the strong foundation of success as we move to the next chapter of Verisk story. I'm pleased to share that the insurance segment delivered another solid quarter. Across insurance we're seeing strong results from both commercial and personal lines and seeing contributions to growth from our newly acquired businesses like Marketing and Life Insurance Solutions. Within our core, underwriting and Claims Solutions, growth is being driven by strong renewal cycles with existing customers, as well as from the addition of new customers and expanded use cases for Claim Solutions. Within marketing, we're seeing strong growth driven by continued adoption from T&C carriers using our solutions to optimize lead acquisition programs, build more intelligent marketing, segmentation and monitor portfolios for right timed outreach, and for improved customer retention. We're excited about the opportunity head as we combine Jornaya with our newly acquired in future business to further enhance these capabilities by synergizing products and offerings. Our Life Insurance Solutions continue to help our life and annuity customers along with their digital transformation. All the while delivering very strong growth for Verisk with the addition of new customers as well as expansion of relationships with existing customers. Life insurance recognize the benefits of a module and flexible software solutions and are standardizing on fast platform. Within stream events, we are seeing strong growth in our core Touchdown platform with the signing of new customers as well as extension of multiyear deals with existing customers. In addition, the catastrophe bond market continued to be strong, with Verisk participating in more than half of the deals placed in the quarter. Our sustainability business also had a very strong quarter as demand for ESG and resilience global risk indices in both the corporate and financial sector whose strong double digits. In the quarter we launched sovereign ESG ratings targeting the right financial sector, and early interest is encouraging as our focus on the risk is an unmet need in the marketplace. During the quarter, we experienced recovery in many of our transactional businesses that were negatively impacted by the pandemic, including travel, international auto and claims. This was offset in part by continued weakness in our workers compensation business, as carriers are adjusting to new regulation within the industry as well as tougher compares on the storm-related revenue versus last year's ice storms in Texas. In our many discussions with our customers, we continually hear the same message, the insurance industry is healthy and focused on to become more digital, more efficient and more automated. While insurers are experiencing increasing costs related to inflation, rates are hardening reflecting these inflationary factors. This should lead to faster premium growth. In addition, rising interest rates are helping the investment portfolios of our customers driving better profitability. All that said, cost efficiency continues to be a big focus of our customers has they work to be quicker, more automated and drive savings. The growth of our data sets has been a strategic focus as we work to further advance our mission to help our customers better slug risk. To that end, we've been expanding the data encouraging of our commercial property database, and now have over 15.4 million properties up from 12.2 just a year ago, goes to become a combination of onsite surveys, virtual technologies, third-party data sources, and our ability to accurately model key characteristics using the data we have to expand and update our databases more frequently. Separately, we've added 10 new data contributors into our core statistical databases for ratemaking in the first quarter. On [indiscernible] this quarter has been wonderful. We successfully hosted hybrid customer events, with many in person sessions. In February, we held our signature Elevate Conference, and in March, we held our Insurance Fraud Management Conference, both of which successful. Across the two events we had almost 600 attendees in person and another 900 plus through virtual sessions. It was great to be in person with customers again. During the quarter we acquired Opta, Canada's leading provider of property intelligence and innovative technology solutions, the acquisition further expands their footprint in the Canadian market, it supports optic and reshaping risk management with valuable business intelligence. As the only organization in Canada that regular gathers and validates data through ongoing research often is widely considered the industry standard for valuations, property risk intelligence and loss control services. This transaction offers Verisk immediate expansion into Canada with the leading provider of underwriting data and analytics to carriers and provides opportunity for product harmonization across the Opta and Verisk portfolio. We're excited to welcome the Opta team to the Verisk family. Finally, I want to take a minute to add to the comments that we made around operational efficiency. Within the insurance segment, we have engaged in a detailed study across all our costs throughout our business units. We have identified areas of expenses to be eliminated without impacting future growth opportunities. Such opportunities exist in real estate, technology infrastructure, increased use of our low-cost talent locations for open positions, improved sourcing and procurement, product optimization, and we work diligently to realize these cost savings in a timely and efficient manner. Now, let me turn the call over to interim CFO, David Grover, for the financial review.\nDavid Grover: Thanks Mark. For the first quarter of 2022, on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenues grew 6.8% to $776 million. Net income attributable to Verisk increased 200% to $506 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share attributable to Verisk increased 204% to $3.13. Our GAAP results include the impact of a $380 million after tax gain on the sale of our environmental health and safety business. Moving to our organic constant currency results adjusted for non-operating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release. We are pleased with our operating results led by continued and consistent growth in our subscription revenues. In the first quarter, organic constant currency revenues grew 5.3% driven by continued strength in our insurance segment and sequential improvement within our energy segment. Our subscription revenues increased 6.2%, while transactional revenues increased a more modest 1.3%. Adjusting for $3 million in prior year revenues associated with our energy business in Russia, organic constant currency revenues would have grown 5.7%. Consolidated OCC adjusted EBITDA was 4.1% in the first quarter, adjusting for expenses related to the suspension of commercial operations in Russia, as well as district higher professional fees. Consolidated OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 6.9%. Total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic revenues and adjusted EBITDA was 46.3%. This level of margin includes the impact of the suspension of Russian operations, approximately 70 basis points of headwind from strategic recent acquisitions, a higher level of professional fees and the return of certain COVID-related costs back into the business. It also includes approximately 90 basis points of headwind from our ongoing technological transformation, including our cloud transition costs, which we absorbed into our cost structure. Finally, this margin also reflected a beneficial timing difference related to executive compensation, which will reverse over the remainder of 2022. On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. In the first quarter, insurance segment revenues increased 6.1% We saw healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, Claims Analytics Solutions, Extreme Event Solutions, Life Insurance Solutions and International Specialty Business Solutions. Subscription revenues increased 7.2%, while transactional revenues were up 1.3%. Certain of our transactional businesses experienced recovery in the quarter including international travel insurance solutions and international auto claim solutions. But this was offset by a slower storm season versus last year's Texas ice storms and continued softness in workers compensation. Adjusted EBITDA grew 5.5% in the first quarter, while margins declined 240 basis points to 51.5%. These margins reflect a heavier burden from our corporate costs that were previously allocated to businesses that have been disposed. The impact of recently acquired businesses, higher cloud expenses and the return of travel expense back into the business. This level of margin also includes continued investments in our high growth areas like Life Insurance and Marketing Solutions. Energy and specialized markets revenues grew 1.9% in the first quarter normalizing for the impact of suspended operations in Russia, energy revenue growth was 4.3%, a solid acceleration from the fourth quarter. The end-market continues to be volatile but has benefited from higher commodity prices. Our customers are in a much stronger financial position than they were just two years ago. Our subscription revenues increased 4.8% when adjusted for the Russian impact as we are capitalizing on the increased appetite for advanced analytics. During the quarter, we delivered double-digit growth in energy transition and chemicals research coupled with modest growth in our core research subscriptions. We continue to benefit from strong adoption of our Lens platforms through upsell of existing customers and the adoption of new logo says customers are seeing the value over integrated cloud-based data analytic environment. This is evidenced by material increases in contract size for multi-year contracts that include Lens. We also had another successful renewal cycle in the first quarter of 2022, resulting in our fourth consecutive quarter of mid-to-high single digit ACV growth. Transactional revenues increased 1.5% but growth was constrained by resources as we actively are managing to take on only the highest value consulting work. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 4.9% in the first quarter and margins contracted to 130 basis points to 33.1%. This margin includes $1.4 million in incremental expense related to the suspension of operations in Russia. Normalizing for the Russian impact, adjusted EBITDA growth would have been 5.3%. In addition to the Russia expense, this margin level reflects higher cloud expenses and the return of travel expenses back into the business. It also reflected continued investment in Lens as we further build out capabilities to garner maximum value for the platform including Lens power, energy transition, chemicals, and metals and mining. Looking to the remainder of 2022, the loss of Russian revenues and the adjusted EBITDA will impact each quarter by approximately $4 million per quarter. Financial services were included in our reported numbers but not within our organic constant currency figures. We close the sale of VFS to TransUnion on April 8. Our reported effective tax rate was 17.2% compared to 22.5% in the prior year quarter, the quarterly tax rate benefited by over 500 basis points from certain non-recurring adjustments relating to the sale of 3E. Looking ahead to the remainder of 2022, we still expect the tax rates to be between 20% and 22% in each of the next three quarters, there will likely be some quarterly variability related to the face of employee stock option exercises. Adjusted net income increased 7% to $217 million and diluted adjusted EPS increased 9% to $1.34 for the first quarter of 2022. These increases reflected organic growth in the business contributions from acquisitions, a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count. Net cash provided by operating activities was $400 million in the quarter, down 11% from the prior year period, reflecting timing differences for certain of our collections, and the impact of the 3E disposition which closed in the middle of March. Capital expenditures were $60 million for the quarter up 1.4% versus last year, reflecting increases in capitalized software development, offset in part by savings on third-party hardware and software as we move to the cloud. We continue to expect our capital expenditures to be approximately $280 million to $310 million. This supports our plans to increase our software investments through the acceleration of our pace of development in Lens and extending software development into core underwriting where we believe there's a similar opportunity for platform enhancement. Related to CapEx we now expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization should be within the range of $210 million to $230 million and intangible amortization to be approximately $170 million. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to ethics variability, the timing of purchases, the completion of projects, and future M&A activity. During the first quarter, we returned $621 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, as our strong cash flow allows us to invest behind our highest growth and highest return initiatives while also returning capital to shareholders consistently. We continue to expect to deploy after tax proceeds from the sale of our 3E and various financial businesses for share repurchases in addition to our normal pace of quarterly repurchases, which are generally executed through an ASR program. And now I'll turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments.\nLee Shavel: Thanks, Dave. In summary, our businesses are strong, and we are making important progress executing on our strategic and operational initiatives, including the separation of the energy business and our improvement in margins. As we evaluate options for the energy business, we will continue to focus on pursuing the most value creating path for our shareholders and all the various stakeholders. We are confident that the transformation of our portfolio and active cost management, we can return to growth in line with our long-term objectives, and deliver OCC adjusted EBITDA growth ahead of revenue growth in 2022 and beyond. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nAlex Kramm: Yes. Hey, good morning, everyone. So thanks for some of the clarification on the base for the margin upside. I think there's been some confusion. Maybe just and I think you raised to that a little bit. So maybe I didn't catch us fully. But can you just talk -- remind us of the cadence to get to that 300 to 500 basis point improvement? I think you made a comment about 2023 that you may see some benefits. And then maybe related to that, on 2024. We talked about 300 to 500. Is that really something you see realized in 2024 for the full year or is it something that you would achieve by the end of the year and it's really a 2025 event? So maybe a little bit more of a cadence will be helpful. Thank you.\nLee Shavel: Yes. Thank you, Alex. So yes, I think you have -- took the comments accurately, in terms of the base rate. And as we indicated, 2022 is going to be noisy. There are a lot of effects in what we are working towards and I think remain confident in is that going into 2023, we will have achieved run rate expenses that demonstrate progress in 2023 on a full year basis. And as we then look to 2024, our expectation is that 2024 on a full year basis will represent a achievement of that 300 to 500 basis point improvements. And so I think your question Alex went to is that something that you're anticipating exiting 2024 with? No, I think that we believe that achieving that our objective for 2024 as a whole is, is what we are targeting and we remain confident with.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, Please ask your question.\nGreg Parrish: Hey, it\u2019s Greg Parrish on for Tony, thanks for taking our question. And all the best to Scott. Want to stick with the margin that 300 to 500 basis points of expansion, you talked today about doing a deep dive with a review of the cost structure to come up with that number. Does this incorporate all the opportunities you found, I think some of them, like closing down a data centers probably would have happened anyway. And I mean, the backdrop of why I'm asking is a shareholder thinks, there's potentially a lot more out there. So I don't know if there's a way you can frame the delta here. Thanks.\nLee Shavel: Sure, Greg. Thank you. And let me start off, I will ask Mark to supplement my comments. But we have looked comprehensively at all of the suggestions that we have received from shareholders. We have examined those. We have drilled into them. And we've had conversations with the business. And there is naturally supporting this a substantial amount of opportunity that we are going to be pursuing over the next several years. And I think it's important to understand that that 300 to 500 basis points reflects not just the quantum of the cost savings, but also the opportunities for other investment within the business that we think drives stronger growth rates, good returns on those types of investments from an internal and from an external perspective. And so I think to answer your question, we do see opportunities from a cost savings standpoint that go beyond that. But we are also making certain that we are utilizing, as I've described before, the opportunity for investments and near-term in projects that may have a lower margin, but represent good growth, good return and operating leverage over time. So hopefully that gives you a sense of both the scope, the quantum that we are looking at and how it relates to our overall management of the business for growth and return objectives. Mark is there anything that you would want to add to that?\nMark Anquillare: No, Lee. I think it was well said I just will highlight that. We have gone across every account every division. And we've gotten very deep into this. And I think the theme here is a combination of how can we be more effective? How can we be more efficient and that's across a lot of different categories, as well as what products may need to be rethought. But I will emphasize, we want to make sure that we continue to invest in the future because we're looking to grow and continue to grow as we have an organic growth is key to all this. So it's a delicate balancing act. But I think we've been making very good progress here and we're confident.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to focus on the insurance OCC growth of 6%. So the industry background is pretty robust. We talked about strength in several businesses. Obviously, there are some one-time headwinds as well. But I was just wondering like the organic growth of six continues to stay behind or underperform the longer-term expectation despite a pretty strong demand environment. So how should we think about this growth going forward, as some of these one off items come off? Can we get back to 7% plus growth in '22.? And then just maybe mid to long-term as you streamline the business and as you highlight it focusing on more efficient growth. Can you see an improvement to that group profile over the midterm? Thanks.\nLee Shavel: So Ashish thank you for the question. I'm going to start off by making a high-level comment with regard to our subscription revenue versus non-subscription revenue and insurance and then turn it over to Mark to give some compositional color around that. But to your question, in Dave's comments, we highlighted that for insurance in the first quarter, we achieved 7.2%, organic constant currency revenue growth in our subscription revenue. And the weaker part of the business is, was in our non-subscription revenue. And that was a function of within our Medicare set aside some caution with regard to regulatory changes, hangover from the pandemic, pressured some of that transactional revenue. In addition, we continue to see lower auto purchasing activity. And then, finally, we had a tougher compare due to the Texas ice storms in the prior year period. So I think not stepping away from the fact that the 6% was below that overall target, in the most important component of the largest component, the subscription revenue growth, we think was very solid, and we have some near term transactional revenue. That was really the primary driver of that lower growth rate. But Mark, press within the businesses, you can give some context around the strength on the subscription side and any of the other transactional elements.\nMark Anquillare: Yes, Lee. I go back to -- we're just under 7% in \u201921 from an insurance perspective, as we look forward, I think the 7.2 is a good indication of the strength of the business. I can provide a little color on the ups and downs as some of the non-subs type of revenue. One, storms last year, Texas storms provided a little bit of a headwind in '21, obviously working against that comp in \u201822. Two, there still seems to be a quietness, at least in volumes as a result of the pandemic. And we see that in two places. One, just people aren't shopping for auto insurance, car insurance quite as frequent as they once did. I think they're probably content with at least the rates they have now. As inflation hits, and rates start to rise, people will again begin to shop. And the world of workers comp claims is just generally down. In your home, it's just not as many workers comp claims, we've seen probably drop of maybe around 20%. And there's been some regulatory changes that have paused some of the activity with insurers to how they're going to approach those claims. So those are the specifics with regard to non-subs or non-subscriptions. But what I like to emphasize is the subscription side of things, whether it's from our underwriting core line services, the claims analytics business, which is the fraud finding business exception on, and again, with extreme events, very strong. So I was pleased with first quarter. And as is the norm, we typically have growth and we have strength as the year progresses with insurance. So thank you.\nLee Shavel: And Ashish, thanks for that mark. And Ashish, I want to also come back and address your question on the longer term growth trajectory. And certainly, within our existing businesses, we see a constructive environment and good demand. But one area that I'll be focused on and this comes out, I think some of my past experience, as well as conversations with customers, is that the insurance industry as a whole continues to look for opportunities to improve their efficiency to take substantial costs out of their operations, to improve the digital experience with their customers. And I think our ability from where we sit to act as their technology partner in more of a utility role, where we can find solutions for the industry is a tremendous opportunity for us to think more broadly about what we can do, because if we are creating value for the industry, we're creating value for our clients. And I think that will naturally drive value for our shareholders.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi. I just wanted to talk about that margin expansion. So you saying the base now is 50 to 51? Going up 300 to 500 basis points that's 53 to 56 by '24. Does that include energy or does that kind of 53% to 56% margin assume energy is not part of the business. And then if you can make a comment on if the tax rate for the various business meaning x energy will be much different than the businesses today.\nLee Shavel: Yes. Thank you, Andrew. So let me first confirm that that 300 to 500 basis points half of the 50% to 51% assumes that we have separated energy. And so what we are trying to do is provide and reference, as we did in the original statement, what the consolidated insurance focused business looks like from a margin standpoint. So it explicitly assumes that we have separated energy within that context. And with regard to tax rate, I think we are still sorting through that as we look at the complexity of the legal entities that we utilize on a global basis. And we have tried to utilize some of the legal efficiencies within those tax jurisdictions. I don't think at this point, we're anticipating a dramatic change in the tax, but I just want to maintain the fact that we are as part of our exercise, trying to get a more precise read on what the tax implications are.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your lines open, please ask your questions.\nGreg Peters: Good morning. So I'm going to focus on Slide 16, of your investor presentation, which is the capital expenditures slide. And I noted the comments regarding guidance around CapEx. So just trying to understand the pieces here in what you're showing us on Slide 16. And specifically, how much of the CapEx expense, over this history relates to non-insurance related businesses. And when you set this target of getting to mid-single digit level over time, I'm trying to flip that with the guidance that you have and CapEx for this year, because it certainly doesn't seem to match. So any additional perspective on CapEx would be helpful. Thank you.\nLee Shavel: Yes. Thank you, Greg. I appreciate the question. I know this has been a focus for investors. And so the way I would describe it, and on page 16, it's important to understand for 2021, that does include VFS, 3E and Wood MacKenzie. And I would note that if we were looking at this on a segment basis, the various financial services and Wood MacKenzie particularly as a function of the Lens investment that we have made, as well as product enhancements that we were making at Verisk Financial Services, we're operating at a higher CapEx as a percentage of revenue relative to our average. And so if we are looking at an insurance on focused entity, while there will continue to be investment opportunities, probably most notably with what we're describing as our four lines reimagine that we believe will deliver similar types of benefits to the Lens platform that we did with Wood MacKenzie, that those areas of investment will continue to be important. But overall across the insurance, that would have been and we expect would be below the average rate that we have been operating at over the past three to five years.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nJeff Meuler: I guess just want to revisit the structural revenue growth answer. And let me present it this way. You've invested a lot in several new areas, non-U.S. marketing wise there's been more CapEx you're talking about the underwriting software platform and tech opportunities in general, not sure to what extent as you do the deep dive on the business. There's incremental pricing or go-to-market opportunities. That sounds like a lot of growth drivers to me. I guess, are those back selling for maturing growth drivers? Are they incremental, I don't know if you're just not wanting to commit to a new target or if you want to show us the growth first? But if you just help me understand if there's offsets to what sounds like a lot of growth drivers? Thank you.\nLee Shavel: Yes. Thanks, Jeff. Look, I appreciate the perspective and I think that we would agree there are a lot of growth opportunities within the business as we are sorting out the separation of the two businesses. Part of that exercise is looking at the overall insurance business and evaluating where there are growth, where there are opportunities to invest, where there are opportunities to deinvest. At this point, given that, I think it's early stage in making that assessment. And we're not prepared to change the guidance that we have. I think we've demonstrated on the subscription revenue that we have been able to achieve within insurance that 7% growth, there are transactional revenues that we still are expecting to show recovery. But as we proceed through the separation, my objective would be to give a more thoughtful and fulsome description of how we think about growth going forward as we are thinking about this as an insurance focus entity. I take the point, there are a lot of growth opportunities, we're going to be making investments. But at this stage, we haven't reached the point where we're ready to make a change in that long-term guidance. We believe 7% organic constant currency or higher growth for the insurance business is a very solid respectable target with operating leverage that should drive EBITDA ahead of that. We've made our point in terms of our EBITDA expect expectations. And hopefully, we'll continue to refine that as we think about where we want to focus where we want to invest, and what we think the growth opportunities are.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nHeather Balsky: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Just two things. On the margin outlook, I'd love additional color. The first is in terms of the 300 to 500 basis points, I guess what gets you to the low end versus the high end of the range? I'd love to better understand that. And second part is, are there any, I guess, one-time costs? Or how should we think about one-time cost as you execute on this plan? Thank you.\nLee Shavel: Thank you, Heather. So I appreciate the question on the low end versus the high-end. I think there are two primary dimensions that will influence that. One is simply the quantum of opportunity that we identify and we want to identify as much opportunity as we can that doesn't impact the overall growth level of the business. And so that's, we are certainly pushing to achieve as much of that margin improvement as we have laid out as possible. The other side of that is, what is the level of investment that we think is necessary to support, expand the overall growth and achieve good returns on that. That is the tension point, as I've described before, to many of you to many of the investors, margin is a dynamic element that you have to understand in terms of what is -- what margin expansion is being generated on a pre-investment basis. And then what do you consume in order to support and expand growth and returns on beyond that. And so particularly, as we are going through an environment with higher inflationary costs, with high competition for our talent. We are evaluating those impacts which I would describe as environmental that we have to take into account that may influence where we end up in terms of that range. But the primary business tension will be the quantum of cost savings, that are not growth impacting as well as our deliberate decision on what we're going to -- where we are going to invest, and what the OpEx impact of that will be on our overall margins. But the primary objective is, as I mentioned in my comments, that growth and returns are the fundamental foundation for value creation for shareholders.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to focus on all the recent tuck-in acquisitions that you've made. It looks like you spent over 600 million or so on acquiring a bunch of these assets. I was just hoping you would help us identify some of the key areas and perhaps what the total M&A contribution for the year should be. You gave us some help on kind of the margin impact, but just from a revenue perspective, what does that add.\nLee Shavel: Manav, thank you for the question. And since as you observed those have been predominantly not exclusively in the insurance sector. I'm going to ask Mark to talk about the nature of those tuck-in acquisitions, what we expect to achieve from a business standpoint. And then, Stacey will either now or in our follow up calls provide context around the acquisition impact. Mark, can I turn it over to you to talk through some of the recent insurance acquisitions?\nMark Anquillare: Sure. So let me -- two themes that I think you'll spot is, one, we continue to focus on trying to globally grow. So we'd have this wonderful franchise in the United States. And we've tried to take and extend that into other areas. So a) optic provides us with an underwriting base and foundation in Canada, doing many of the same things that [Ferris] [ph] does in United States around the ability to understand the value of a property, how much it should be insured, the property characteristics, so very nice synergies, very much aligned with what we do. And it takes us into Canada. We have a strong claims presence from a repair cost estimating perspective, but limited underwriting. So I hope that's kind of very strategic in that regard. The other international element to this is, we bought a business called ACTINEO, which represents a claims business around auto in Germany. So as we try to extend and expand, we've had some wonderful growth and some great synergies in the U.K. market. And this takes us into Germany, but also provides us an opportunity in solution set that along with an earlier acquisition called Validus that helps us also potentially get into Spain, and back into the U.K. in this product area. So again, international expansion, the focus. Other theme is really around marketing. And we've experienced a lot of customers very interested in trying to understand it and penetrate the customers, they are trying to segment, the customers they are trying to identify and bring on board. We have some wonderful tools to help them quote that business and identify and select that risk. So think about some shopping for homeowners insurance or auto insurance. [Indiscernible] is give us visibility as to who's literally out there shopping for insurance. It is an ID -- a lead ID that kind of shares this industry standard that yes, I'm out there. I've been on these websites. And to the extent that now I have information about that person. We are taking a lot of our underwriting where we've been focused on the asset, meaning the house or the car and trying to extend it into the people and the person in the individual gaining insurance. And we feel that personal side of underwriting and marketing is a very large market opportunity and we're naturally there already. So hopefully that provides a little bit of strategic context like.\nLee Shavel: Thank you, Mark. And one thing I want to add, before Stacey will address the contribution elements, Manav is adding one thing that we have been pleased with is the shift that we have made from more of a portfolio orientation from an acquisition standpoint, to a focus on business unit driven acquisitions is that we have been able to identify where we can have an impact on the business, we have focused on an improved and more intensive integration process. And so with acquisitions like FAST, Jornaya and Sequel for instance, we have been able to demonstrate improved performance against our expectations and really help accelerate a lot of good technologies that the insurance industry values, but we can really help accelerate their adoption by the industry.\nStacey Brodbar: And Manav just for your aware, we break out the contributions from acquisition-related revenue versus disposition in the footnote tables there is a non-GAAP reconciliations in our press release. During the quarter, it was about 20 million on an annualized basis. I think the best way to think about the recent tuck-in acquisitions you're referring to are roughly $100 million in incremental annualized revenue, but you'll just have to phase in the timing for when we close those acquisition. Next question?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nJeff Silber: Thanks so much. I'm apologizing for going back to a margin question and I just want to focus on the insurance segment. I know you said this year is going to be noisy, I completely understand it. But if we look at the first quarter, your insurance segment, margins went down by about 240 basis points. I know there were a number of items in there. Is that the kind of run rate we should use for the rest of the year in terms of the year-over-year decline which should be expected in this segment?\nLee Shavel: Yes. So Jeff, thanks for that. Couple of things. One, I think that what's important to understand on that decline, is that the primary contributor to that is the reallocation of expenses to the insurance and the energy sector. And so and if we achieve that separation with energy, that will be a further allocation. That's what gets you to that 50% to 51% level. Now, there are going to be effects within that quarter that influence if, for instance, we have the discrete professional costs. And we mentioned in that quarter, there was a benefit from some compensation elements that will reverse. But I think that primary impact of the reallocation of the expenses is a good starting point for understanding kind of what our normal run rate expenses will be over the course of the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Going back to your margin expansion target. Can you elaborate on your strategies for balancing cost takeout with growth investments was not the star of the business of growth capital? And related to that, what are your targets for the amount of growth investments spend over this time horizon through 2024 in which areas will future growth investments focus on?\nLee Shavel: Yes. Thank you, George. I appreciate the question. And I'll start by saying, first, from a process standpoint, obviously, we are in -- the business is operating on a real-time basis, we are making investments. And so on those, we are maintaining what we believe was the right investment approach going into 2022. And so within our budget, and so those are the types of investments that you want to maintain. We will look as we go into 2023, where the trade-offs are from a growth standpoint, relative to the expense savings. And this is actually kind of the typical year-end discussion that Scott and Mark and I would have to evaluate what is the level of investment that we believe is advisable in the business to sustain to expand the growth opportunity? What is the margin impact? What are the returns on for all of those, and we look at those options across all of the businesses and then determine what we think is the best and the most supportive. And so as -- we are near-term focused on achieving the cost savings, identifying, implementing those over the course of 2022. And then as we proceed and think about where we want to focus our investment on an ongoing basis within that business. We will look at those trade-offs. There is not a monolithic across the business perspective on this is what we are going to invest in growth because almost by necessity, it needs to be a project-by-project and business-by-business determination and that we evaluate through our budget and our long range planning. So that's probably the best answer that I can give you. But we are always trying to, one, prioritize growth in returns while achieving the margin expansion objectives that we've outlined.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffery from Truist. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hi, good morning. Appreciate being here. I wanted to ask a question about the cloud investment and the cloud transition. Lee, it seems like there will be some longer-term expenses associated with that that you contemplate in your sort of steady state insurance margins. I assume there are some go-to-market product development NPI benefits, though. Two, can you just talk about the specific ROI that you expect from your cloud transition efforts?\nLee Shavel: Sure. Thank you, Andrew. So the first point that I want to make is that as we detailed in our last call, from an economic standpoint, we are achieving a benefit from our transition to cloud, meaning that our investments in that cloud migration have generated OpEx savings and CapEx savings across the portfolio that we have made. And it's important to understand that you have to look at both dimensions of that to see the economic value. But it does entail naturally an effective transition of what were formerly CapEx expenses into OpEx expenses in terms of our cloud-based expenses. And so, firstly, that investment is generating an economic value, and is generating a high double-digit plus return on the capital that we invested within that. And I say that on the basis of having looked at the projects of where we've made those investments and then what we've achieved from an OpEx and CapEx savings standpoint. So we do believe that it is contributing both economic value and returns. Your broader question, as I understand it is to understand the benefits from a business standpoint. And we do believe that the migration of those data sets into the cloud of the applications into the cloud, facilitate more coordination and integration of the analytics that are able to draw from that consolidated data set. And in a way, the Lens experience that we've had is a demonstration of that. First, and probably most immediately, in terms of the ease with which our customers can access data, utilize data, integrate into their processes, improve their efficiency, because we are sourcing from multiple systems or from legacy systems. And much of what we want to accomplish in our core lines reimagined moves in that direction as well, process efficiency first, but we're also improving the environment where we can associate data sets more and more effectively. But that is, I think a more of a second stage achievement, we're focused first on the economic value that we can achieve the process improvements for our clients, and then ultimately, the improved analytical opportunity. There's certainly may be overlap. But generally, that's the process. And to-date, I would say on that data benefit, that is still largely an unrealized in certain areas, I think we've achieved it. But in terms of the broader opportunity, I think there's still much more for us to do. And it ties into I think, this broader infrastructure or utility opportunity that we see for the industry as a whole as that data becomes consolidated in a more consistent architecture. It facilitates broader industry process improvements.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Your lines open. Please ask your question.\nFaiza Alwy: Yes. Hi. Thank you and good morning. Lee, I wanted to ask a few follow up. Maybe follow up to George's question. Are you able to [indiscernible] and talk about, the specific cost savings. So maybe how much of your cost savings are related to real estate? How much is related to cost? How much is related to sort of employees and other locations. And maybe if you could talk about the operating leverage that you expect in the business? And lastly, you've made a few acquisitions that have impacted margins and interiors as you think about your longer term growth rate. Do you need to make more acquisitions and whether the potential margin impact of those future acquisitions is included in your long-term margin target? Thank you.\nLee Shavel: Yes. So Faiza thanks that's a lot of questions to throw at me. But we'll try to knock them down one by one. So at this point, the dollar detail as we are developing this as we are anticipating what we can achieve over the course of 2022, we aren't at the stage where we are ready to provide $1 breakdown on the expense. With regard to your question on operating leverage, operating leverage is really the key element that I focus on, and I am -- we do embrace the fact that this opportunity to rethink our cost base fundamentally improves our operating leverage. We've always been focused on businesses that have solid operating leverage. And as we drive strong organic growth into the business that magnifies the EBITDA growth, and that naturally produces margin expansion offset by our level of investment. The last question or element of the question related to the impact of M&A. And there our focus is on generating growth and returns. I think embedded in your question is, do we rely on acquisitions to maintain our growth rate? I think the short answer is no, we do look for businesses that we can create value from that are higher growth and represent opportunities for us to accelerate and to generate returns. But we believe that our internal opportunities to grow and as we've demonstrated in a variety of areas, including with our Lightspeed products and within our claims business, with a number of the products that we've added there, within our Extreme Events Solutions, businesses, those have all been strongly performing growth businesses for us. Looking ahead, we obviously can't anticipate the acquisitions that may become available to us. Our acquisitions are typically for smaller, higher growth businesses that do have lower margins. And if we do see acquisitions that we think are value creating, we will pursue those, and they may have a negative margin impact. In fact, they're probably likely to have a negative margin impact that would be outside of our overall objectives here, but they're fundamentally focused on value creation through our ability to accelerate and drive both growth in returns. So our analysis is based on the business as it is right now that we can achieve that against that insurance focus, consolidated business, but we aren't making any assumptions in terms of what our future acquisitions are. Those have to be opportunistic and based upon our discipline.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nHans Hoffman: Hi, this is Hans Hoffman filling in for Hamza. Can you just walk us through your pricing model? And, how much is price running today? And maybe any changes relative to history on how you price? I know you guys have talked about value-based pricing in the past?\nLee Shavel: Yes. Hans, let me ask Mark to provide a high-level view, we obviously have hundreds of products with different pricing dimensions. So again, it's not a monolithic business. But Mark perhaps you can offer some perspectives on how we think about value-based pricing model?\nMark Anquillare: Yes, super. So first of all, naturally, the way we kind of align our value add to our customers needs is typically tied to some element, how big they are, which is usually in the form of premium. So it doesn't necessarily tie year-after-year the premium, but we try to think it up to how they're using basically our core products, or our claims analytics products to the extent you think about some of the solutions on the repair cost estimating side, it's just the number of claims. So I think what we've typically tried to do is set up a process by which we kind of size the overall relationship based upon premium or claims are. And then inside of that, we are trying to create a holistic solution. So we are trying to bumble solutions together. So we provide a holistic solution set to them. And I think the opportunity there is that one, they have the ability to bundle the products, they get kind of a value price. And we try to include some increase or inflation in years two and three, usually there is a three year contracts, and they kind of come renew and year four, sometimes they are five year contracts. But I hope that gives you a little bit of color. 85% of the revenue is subscription based typically it's in these three-year contracts. And I think the relationship strong. So we're always able to add new solutions or maybe they want to add a different subsidiary to the mix and that gives us continued upselling opportunities inside what is a very big existing customer base.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. Thanks so much. I want me to go back to the CapEx slide on 16. Lee is there anyway to segregate kind of how much it sits within energy versus insurance. And to the extent something happens with the energy business, should we expect that to go down? And then, you further transition in the cloud journey? Does it internally develop software start to scale down as well? Or is that going to be a structural part to that, I know, the CapEx over time, kind of declined, but how should we think about kind of cloud versus internally developed software?\nLee Shavel: Yes. Thank you, Kevin. So the first comment is, as we are kind of looking at this separation, I would just kind of leave it at right now. The investment on the energy side relative to revenue would be above that average, driven by that level of Lens investment in 2021 and 2022. And so we would expect that there would be an improvement on that. But we want to look at that separation, before we evaluate changing that guidance, which we still adhere to. The second part of your question is, one, yes, we are seeing that CapEx savings as you can see on that slide, but that internally developed software will continue to be an important component of the way that we invest to deliver value to our clients. It is creating platforms for the data, it is creating software automation solutions for clients. And that will continue to be an important component for the way that we either improve efficiency or make better decisions within our business as a whole. Our business is becoming more software intensive. And we think that's a good thing because of the value that we can create for them. One from a process standpoint, but also recognize that in a lot of the software businesses that we have and have acquired are essentially networks of participants in the insurance ecosystem. Our Sequel business or Specialty Business Solutions, is probably the best example of that. And that creates opportunities for us to utilize that data to create analytics and to provide new functionality that supports the ecosystem. And so that's why it's so important in a way with that software, we are able to recreate in other markets of the network effect that we have enjoyed historically within our domestic business. And I would also note, when you look at our acquisitions, Fast, sequel, Jornaya, they are more software intensive and are associated with that higher growth rate. So that will be an ongoing an important component for us.\nLee Shavel: So with that, I think that is our final question. Thank you for your time today. Thanks again to Scott for all of his contributions and we look forward to the ongoing dialogue with all of you as we proceed. Have a good day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

            "content": "Thanks Mark. For the first quarter of 2022, on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenues grew 6.8% to $776 million. Net income attributable to Verisk increased 200% to $506 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share attributable to Verisk increased 204% to $3.13. Our GAAP results include the impact of a $380 million after tax gain on the sale of our environmental health and safety business. Moving to our organic constant currency results adjusted for non-operating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release. We are pleased with our operating results led by continued and consistent growth in our subscription revenues. In the first quarter, organic constant currency revenues grew 5.3% driven by continued strength in our insurance segment and sequential improvement within our energy segment. Our subscription revenues increased 6.2%, while transactional revenues increased a more modest 1.3%. Adjusting for $3 million in prior year revenues associated with our energy business in Russia, organic constant currency revenues would have grown 5.7%. Consolidated OCC adjusted EBITDA was 4.1% in the first quarter, adjusting for expenses related to the suspension of commercial operations in Russia, as well as district higher professional fees. Consolidated OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 6.9%. Total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic revenues and adjusted EBITDA was 46.3%. This level of margin includes the impact of the suspension of Russian operations, approximately 70 basis points of headwind from strategic recent acquisitions, a higher level of professional fees and the return of certain COVID-related costs back into the business. It also includes approximately 90 basis points of headwind from our ongoing technological transformation, including our cloud transition costs, which we absorbed into our cost structure. Finally, this margin also reflected a beneficial timing difference related to executive compensation, which will reverse over the remainder of 2022. On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. In the first quarter, insurance segment revenues increased 6.1% We saw healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, Claims Analytics Solutions, Extreme Event Solutions, Life Insurance Solutions and International Specialty Business Solutions. Subscription revenues increased 7.2%, while transactional revenues were up 1.3%. Certain of our transactional businesses experienced recovery in the quarter including international travel insurance solutions and international auto claim solutions. But this was offset by a slower storm season versus last year's Texas ice storms and continued softness in workers compensation. Adjusted EBITDA grew 5.5% in the first quarter, while margins declined 240 basis points to 51.5%. These margins reflect a heavier burden from our corporate costs that were previously allocated to businesses that have been disposed. The impact of recently acquired businesses, higher cloud expenses and the return of travel expense back into the business. This level of margin also includes continued investments in our high growth areas like Life Insurance and Marketing Solutions. Energy and specialized markets revenues grew 1.9% in the first quarter normalizing for the impact of suspended operations in Russia, energy revenue growth was 4.3%, a solid acceleration from the fourth quarter. The end-market continues to be volatile but has benefited from higher commodity prices. Our customers are in a much stronger financial position than they were just two years ago. Our subscription revenues increased 4.8% when adjusted for the Russian impact as we are capitalizing on the increased appetite for advanced analytics. During the quarter, we delivered double-digit growth in energy transition and chemicals research coupled with modest growth in our core research subscriptions. We continue to benefit from strong adoption of our Lens platforms through upsell of existing customers and the adoption of new logo says customers are seeing the value over integrated cloud-based data analytic environment. This is evidenced by material increases in contract size for multi-year contracts that include Lens. We also had another successful renewal cycle in the first quarter of 2022, resulting in our fourth consecutive quarter of mid-to-high single digit ACV growth. Transactional revenues increased 1.5% but growth was constrained by resources as we actively are managing to take on only the highest value consulting work. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 4.9% in the first quarter and margins contracted to 130 basis points to 33.1%. This margin includes $1.4 million in incremental expense related to the suspension of operations in Russia. Normalizing for the Russian impact, adjusted EBITDA growth would have been 5.3%. In addition to the Russia expense, this margin level reflects higher cloud expenses and the return of travel expenses back into the business. It also reflected continued investment in Lens as we further build out capabilities to garner maximum value for the platform including Lens power, energy transition, chemicals, and metals and mining. Looking to the remainder of 2022, the loss of Russian revenues and the adjusted EBITDA will impact each quarter by approximately $4 million per quarter. Financial services were included in our reported numbers but not within our organic constant currency figures. We close the sale of VFS to TransUnion on April 8. Our reported effective tax rate was 17.2% compared to 22.5% in the prior year quarter, the quarterly tax rate benefited by over 500 basis points from certain non-recurring adjustments relating to the sale of 3E. Looking ahead to the remainder of 2022, we still expect the tax rates to be between 20% and 22% in each of the next three quarters, there will likely be some quarterly variability related to the face of employee stock option exercises. Adjusted net income increased 7% to $217 million and diluted adjusted EPS increased 9% to $1.34 for the first quarter of 2022. These increases reflected organic growth in the business contributions from acquisitions, a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count. Net cash provided by operating activities was $400 million in the quarter, down 11% from the prior year period, reflecting timing differences for certain of our collections, and the impact of the 3E disposition which closed in the middle of March. Capital expenditures were $60 million for the quarter up 1.4% versus last year, reflecting increases in capitalized software development, offset in part by savings on third-party hardware and software as we move to the cloud. We continue to expect our capital expenditures to be approximately $280 million to $310 million. This supports our plans to increase our software investments through the acceleration of our pace of development in Lens and extending software development into core underwriting where we believe there's a similar opportunity for platform enhancement. Related to CapEx we now expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization should be within the range of $210 million to $230 million and intangible amortization to be approximately $170 million. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to ethics variability, the timing of purchases, the completion of projects, and future M&A activity. During the first quarter, we returned $621 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, as our strong cash flow allows us to invest behind our highest growth and highest return initiatives while also returning capital to shareholders consistently. We continue to expect to deploy after tax proceeds from the sale of our 3E and various financial businesses for share repurchases in addition to our normal pace of quarterly repurchases, which are generally executed through an ASR program. And now I'll turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments."

            "name": "Lee Shavel",
            "content": "Thanks, Scott, and Good day everyone. On behalf of the entire Verisk team, Scott, let me thank you for your dedication and service to Verisk. We wish you all the very best in your well-deserved retirement. It has been a privilege to work with you and learn from you over the past five years and I'm fortunate to have your ongoing support and counsel. I'm pleased to share that Verisk delivered solid first quarter results. First quarter organic constant currency revenue grew 5.3% and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA grew 4.1%. Adjusted for the impact of the suspension of our commercial operations in Russia and higher discrete professional fees, organic constant currency revenue grew 5.7% and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA grew 6.9% We delivered solid growth across the insurance segment with the fastest growth reported in Marketing Solutions, International Specialty Business Solutions, Life Insurance, Extreme Events Solutions and Claims Analytics. We also had solid contributions from our industry standard solutions in underwriting. Within energy we continued to see improving results across both subscriptions and consulting with the strongest growth in the energy transition, chemicals and metals and mining. We have experienced softness in certain of our transactional businesses, including workers compensation, which is experiencing continued weakness as carriers are adjusting to new regulation within the industry. In addition, our property estimating solutions had weaker transactional growth related to a slower storm season versus last year's ice storms in Texas. Finally, the auto underwriting business continues to deal with a lower level of shopping activity. Our results also included headwinds from the suspension of commercial operations in Russia, increased cloud costs, higher discrete professional fees in the quarter, and the partial normalization of travel and entertainment in the post-pandemic environment. We will provide more details on the financial review section of the call. In preparation for officially stepping into the role as CEO over the last 75 days, we have visited our offices in London, Boston, Lehi, Utah, and of course Jersey City to meet with the employees and leadership teams of all our business units. Many of these individuals are longtime colleagues, and I'm excited to build on these relationships going forward. In addition, I've had the opportunity to meet with more than a dozen of our most significant customers, some of whom I've interacted with throughout my tenure here. I've long known the valued role we play as a technology partner to our customers, and I'm more energized than ever about the extraordinary opportunity we have to expand the breadth and the depth of those relationships. Our value proposition is very clear. Verisk strategically invest in data and technology at scale in order to deliver economic value to our customers through operational efficiencies and better decision-making across the industries we serve. In insurance our customers look to us to help them better select risk and facilitate the automation of legacy processes to improve efficiencies and underwriting and claims. They also turn to Verisk for support with the digitization of their customer experience. And to enable the use of new datasets and platforms for expanded product lines. The development of our Touchstone platform and Extreme Events Solutions, the Lightspeed product suite and underwriting and the development of our life business are tangible examples of what we have delivered to clients. And in energy understanding the complex impacts of the energy transition and the geopolitical events continuing to unfold in Ukraine on the global energy economy remain a primary customer focus. There is strong demand for improved data delivery and analytics and we continue to deliver on that demand for our customers through our Lens platform. In fact, the first quarter was our fourth consecutive quarter of mid-to-high single-digit ACB growth helped by new multiyear contracts with material upsell for customers that are adopting Lens as they recognize the value of this new platform delivers. In both insurance and energy, we benefit from the growing demand for data analytics from our customers, along with their increased ability to ingest and utilize our rapidly growing datasets and technologies to make better decisions and drive operational efficiency. We create lift from these growth engines through the industry scale at which we can deliver greater value per dollar invested than our clients will be able to individually. Growth and returns on invested capital have been and will continue to be the primary driver of value creation for our shareholders over the long-term, and my highest priority as CEO will be to continue to deliver on both. We are well positioned in industries with massive opportunities that will require investment in focus in areas where we can maximize value for our customers. It also requires delivering value for our employees and when we rely for their talent, commitment and effort. We operate in a highly competitive market for talent and must be sure that Verisk remains a very attractive destination for the best and brightest. Moving from our long-term value creation strategy to our near-term focus on the activities we described to drive enhance shareholder value. I wanted to provide an update on both our progress towards being an insurance focused data analytics solutions provider and our commitment to achieving margin expansion. We are making steady progress on the separation of the energy business. We are actively engaged in a detailed planning and modeling exercise of the financial, legal, tax and operational costs associated with separating the business. This analysis will inform valuation and the transaction structure that we intend to pursue subject to market conditions and shareholder value considerations. Our timing expectations remain unchanged. On our EBITDA improvement objectives as Mark will describe in greater detail those still early we have identified several areas of organic cost efficiencies at the operating and corporate level to drive margin expansion. These opportunities include the consolidation of certain real estate locations, as leases come due, or to the extent sudden lease opportunities are available. The increased usage of our global talent optimization locations for new hires and more efficient technology investment, including the closure of our on-premise data centers. We will also reduce corporate overhead after we complete the transition services agreements associated with the sale of 3d and Verisk Financial Services. As we previously announced in mid-March, the company continues moving towards the goal of being a global insurance focused data analytics solutions provider. We expect to deliver 300 to 500 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion and the consolidated remaining insurance focused business by 2024 against a baseline of 50% to 51%, normalized adjusted EBITDA margins, now the 55% adjusted EBITDA margin that our insurance segment delivered in 2021. Indeed, 55% does not represent a normalized run rate for the insurance business as it does not account for a number of offsets, including first corporate overhead costs allocated to other businesses of approximately 200 basis points. Second, the impact of three strategic insurance related acquisitions made over the last two quarters, approximately 80 basis points. And finally, the normalization for incremental cloud transition, and post-pandemic travel and entertainment expenses, for a combined approximately 170 basis points. In addition, investments in new financial and human capital systems will provide greater efficiency opportunities when fully implemented but will pressure margins in the near-term as well inflationary and competitive compensation pressures, but these effects are all embedded in the 300 to 500 basis point target. We should note, the 2022 is likely to be quite noisy due to the impact of portfolio changes and implementation costs, as well as the impact of other environmental issues. As such, we expect the margin expansion to be most visible beginning in 2023 as we move past the timing impacts of the portfolio changes in implementation. Based on our work to-date, we are very confident in our ability to achieve our stated target for EBITDA expansion by 2024 as we originally disclosed. Before turning it over to Mark, let me provide a quick update on the CFO search. We continue to make progress and are prioritizing public companies CFOs with operational efficiency experience. In the meantime, David Grover, Verisk's Controller and Chief Accounting Officer has been acting as Interim Chief Financial Officer and is well suited for this job. I'll now turn it over to Mark for some more color on the insurance business. Thanks, Dave. In summary, our businesses are strong, and we are making important progress executing on our strategic and operational initiatives, including the separation of the energy business and our improvement in margins. As we evaluate options for the energy business, we will continue to focus on pursuing the most value creating path for our shareholders and all the various stakeholders. We are confident that the transformation of our portfolio and active cost management, we can return to growth in line with our long-term objectives, and deliver OCC adjusted EBITDA growth ahead of revenue growth in 2022 and beyond. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions. Yes. Thank you, Alex. So yes, I think you have -- took the comments accurately, in terms of the base rate. And as we indicated, 2022 is going to be noisy. There are a lot of effects in what we are working towards and I think remain confident in is that going into 2023, we will have achieved run rate expenses that demonstrate progress in 2023 on a full year basis. And as we then look to 2024, our expectation is that 2024 on a full year basis will represent a achievement of that 300 to 500 basis point improvements. And so I think your question Alex went to is that something that you're anticipating exiting 2024 with? No, I think that we believe that achieving that our objective for 2024 as a whole is, is what we are targeting and we remain confident with. Sure, Greg. Thank you. And let me start off, I will ask Mark to supplement my comments. But we have looked comprehensively at all of the suggestions that we have received from shareholders. We have examined those. We have drilled into them. And we've had conversations with the business. And there is naturally supporting this a substantial amount of opportunity that we are going to be pursuing over the next several years. And I think it's important to understand that that 300 to 500 basis points reflects not just the quantum of the cost savings, but also the opportunities for other investment within the business that we think drives stronger growth rates, good returns on those types of investments from an internal and from an external perspective. And so I think to answer your question, we do see opportunities from a cost savings standpoint that go beyond that. But we are also making certain that we are utilizing, as I've described before, the opportunity for investments and near-term in projects that may have a lower margin, but represent good growth, good return and operating leverage over time. So hopefully that gives you a sense of both the scope, the quantum that we are looking at and how it relates to our overall management of the business for growth and return objectives. Mark is there anything that you would want to add to that? So Ashish thank you for the question. I'm going to start off by making a high-level comment with regard to our subscription revenue versus non-subscription revenue and insurance and then turn it over to Mark to give some compositional color around that. But to your question, in Dave's comments, we highlighted that for insurance in the first quarter, we achieved 7.2%, organic constant currency revenue growth in our subscription revenue. And the weaker part of the business is, was in our non-subscription revenue. And that was a function of within our Medicare set aside some caution with regard to regulatory changes, hangover from the pandemic, pressured some of that transactional revenue. In addition, we continue to see lower auto purchasing activity. And then, finally, we had a tougher compare due to the Texas ice storms in the prior year period. So I think not stepping away from the fact that the 6% was below that overall target, in the most important component of the largest component, the subscription revenue growth, we think was very solid, and we have some near term transactional revenue. That was really the primary driver of that lower growth rate. But Mark, press within the businesses, you can give some context around the strength on the subscription side and any of the other transactional elements. And Ashish, thanks for that mark. And Ashish, I want to also come back and address your question on the longer term growth trajectory. And certainly, within our existing businesses, we see a constructive environment and good demand. But one area that I'll be focused on and this comes out, I think some of my past experience, as well as conversations with customers, is that the insurance industry as a whole continues to look for opportunities to improve their efficiency to take substantial costs out of their operations, to improve the digital experience with their customers. And I think our ability from where we sit to act as their technology partner in more of a utility role, where we can find solutions for the industry is a tremendous opportunity for us to think more broadly about what we can do, because if we are creating value for the industry, we're creating value for our clients. And I think that will naturally drive value for our shareholders. Yes. Thank you, Andrew. So let me first confirm that that 300 to 500 basis points half of the 50% to 51% assumes that we have separated energy. And so what we are trying to do is provide and reference, as we did in the original statement, what the consolidated insurance focused business looks like from a margin standpoint. So it explicitly assumes that we have separated energy within that context. And with regard to tax rate, I think we are still sorting through that as we look at the complexity of the legal entities that we utilize on a global basis. And we have tried to utilize some of the legal efficiencies within those tax jurisdictions. I don't think at this point, we're anticipating a dramatic change in the tax, but I just want to maintain the fact that we are as part of our exercise, trying to get a more precise read on what the tax implications are. Yes. Thank you, Greg. I appreciate the question. I know this has been a focus for investors. And so the way I would describe it, and on page 16, it's important to understand for 2021, that does include VFS, 3E and Wood MacKenzie. And I would note that if we were looking at this on a segment basis, the various financial services and Wood MacKenzie particularly as a function of the Lens investment that we have made, as well as product enhancements that we were making at Verisk Financial Services, we're operating at a higher CapEx as a percentage of revenue relative to our average. And so if we are looking at an insurance on focused entity, while there will continue to be investment opportunities, probably most notably with what we're describing as our four lines reimagine that we believe will deliver similar types of benefits to the Lens platform that we did with Wood MacKenzie, that those areas of investment will continue to be important. But overall across the insurance, that would have been and we expect would be below the average rate that we have been operating at over the past three to five years. Yes. Thanks, Jeff. Look, I appreciate the perspective and I think that we would agree there are a lot of growth opportunities within the business as we are sorting out the separation of the two businesses. Part of that exercise is looking at the overall insurance business and evaluating where there are growth, where there are opportunities to invest, where there are opportunities to deinvest. At this point, given that, I think it's early stage in making that assessment. And we're not prepared to change the guidance that we have. I think we've demonstrated on the subscription revenue that we have been able to achieve within insurance that 7% growth, there are transactional revenues that we still are expecting to show recovery. But as we proceed through the separation, my objective would be to give a more thoughtful and fulsome description of how we think about growth going forward as we are thinking about this as an insurance focus entity. I take the point, there are a lot of growth opportunities, we're going to be making investments. But at this stage, we haven't reached the point where we're ready to make a change in that long-term guidance. We believe 7% organic constant currency or higher growth for the insurance business is a very solid respectable target with operating leverage that should drive EBITDA ahead of that. We've made our point in terms of our EBITDA expect expectations. And hopefully, we'll continue to refine that as we think about where we want to focus where we want to invest, and what we think the growth opportunities are. Thank you, Heather. So I appreciate the question on the low end versus the high-end. I think there are two primary dimensions that will influence that. One is simply the quantum of opportunity that we identify and we want to identify as much opportunity as we can that doesn't impact the overall growth level of the business. And so that's, we are certainly pushing to achieve as much of that margin improvement as we have laid out as possible. The other side of that is, what is the level of investment that we think is necessary to support, expand the overall growth and achieve good returns on that. That is the tension point, as I've described before, to many of you to many of the investors, margin is a dynamic element that you have to understand in terms of what is -- what margin expansion is being generated on a pre-investment basis. And then what do you consume in order to support and expand growth and returns on beyond that. And so particularly, as we are going through an environment with higher inflationary costs, with high competition for our talent. We are evaluating those impacts which I would describe as environmental that we have to take into account that may influence where we end up in terms of that range. But the primary business tension will be the quantum of cost savings, that are not growth impacting as well as our deliberate decision on what we're going to -- where we are going to invest, and what the OpEx impact of that will be on our overall margins. But the primary objective is, as I mentioned in my comments, that growth and returns are the fundamental foundation for value creation for shareholders. Manav, thank you for the question. And since as you observed those have been predominantly not exclusively in the insurance sector. I'm going to ask Mark to talk about the nature of those tuck-in acquisitions, what we expect to achieve from a business standpoint. And then, Stacey will either now or in our follow up calls provide context around the acquisition impact. Mark, can I turn it over to you to talk through some of the recent insurance acquisitions? Thank you, Mark. And one thing I want to add, before Stacey will address the contribution elements, Manav is adding one thing that we have been pleased with is the shift that we have made from more of a portfolio orientation from an acquisition standpoint, to a focus on business unit driven acquisitions is that we have been able to identify where we can have an impact on the business, we have focused on an improved and more intensive integration process. And so with acquisitions like FAST, Jornaya and Sequel for instance, we have been able to demonstrate improved performance against our expectations and really help accelerate a lot of good technologies that the insurance industry values, but we can really help accelerate their adoption by the industry. Yes. So Jeff, thanks for that. Couple of things. One, I think that what's important to understand on that decline, is that the primary contributor to that is the reallocation of expenses to the insurance and the energy sector. And so and if we achieve that separation with energy, that will be a further allocation. That's what gets you to that 50% to 51% level. Now, there are going to be effects within that quarter that influence if, for instance, we have the discrete professional costs. And we mentioned in that quarter, there was a benefit from some compensation elements that will reverse. But I think that primary impact of the reallocation of the expenses is a good starting point for understanding kind of what our normal run rate expenses will be over the course of the year. Yes. Thank you, George. I appreciate the question. And I'll start by saying, first, from a process standpoint, obviously, we are in -- the business is operating on a real-time basis, we are making investments. And so on those, we are maintaining what we believe was the right investment approach going into 2022. And so within our budget, and so those are the types of investments that you want to maintain. We will look as we go into 2023, where the trade-offs are from a growth standpoint, relative to the expense savings. And this is actually kind of the typical year-end discussion that Scott and Mark and I would have to evaluate what is the level of investment that we believe is advisable in the business to sustain to expand the growth opportunity? What is the margin impact? What are the returns on for all of those, and we look at those options across all of the businesses and then determine what we think is the best and the most supportive. And so as -- we are near-term focused on achieving the cost savings, identifying, implementing those over the course of 2022. And then as we proceed and think about where we want to focus our investment on an ongoing basis within that business. We will look at those trade-offs. There is not a monolithic across the business perspective on this is what we are going to invest in growth because almost by necessity, it needs to be a project-by-project and business-by-business determination and that we evaluate through our budget and our long range planning. So that's probably the best answer that I can give you. But we are always trying to, one, prioritize growth in returns while achieving the margin expansion objectives that we've outlined. Sure. Thank you, Andrew. So the first point that I want to make is that as we detailed in our last call, from an economic standpoint, we are achieving a benefit from our transition to cloud, meaning that our investments in that cloud migration have generated OpEx savings and CapEx savings across the portfolio that we have made. And it's important to understand that you have to look at both dimensions of that to see the economic value. But it does entail naturally an effective transition of what were formerly CapEx expenses into OpEx expenses in terms of our cloud-based expenses. And so, firstly, that investment is generating an economic value, and is generating a high double-digit plus return on the capital that we invested within that. And I say that on the basis of having looked at the projects of where we've made those investments and then what we've achieved from an OpEx and CapEx savings standpoint. So we do believe that it is contributing both economic value and returns. Your broader question, as I understand it is to understand the benefits from a business standpoint. And we do believe that the migration of those data sets into the cloud of the applications into the cloud, facilitate more coordination and integration of the analytics that are able to draw from that consolidated data set. And in a way, the Lens experience that we've had is a demonstration of that. First, and probably most immediately, in terms of the ease with which our customers can access data, utilize data, integrate into their processes, improve their efficiency, because we are sourcing from multiple systems or from legacy systems. And much of what we want to accomplish in our core lines reimagined moves in that direction as well, process efficiency first, but we're also improving the environment where we can associate data sets more and more effectively. But that is, I think a more of a second stage achievement, we're focused first on the economic value that we can achieve the process improvements for our clients, and then ultimately, the improved analytical opportunity. There's certainly may be overlap. But generally, that's the process. And to-date, I would say on that data benefit, that is still largely an unrealized in certain areas, I think we've achieved it. But in terms of the broader opportunity, I think there's still much more for us to do. And it ties into I think, this broader infrastructure or utility opportunity that we see for the industry as a whole as that data becomes consolidated in a more consistent architecture. It facilitates broader industry process improvements. Yes. So Faiza thanks that's a lot of questions to throw at me. But we'll try to knock them down one by one. So at this point, the dollar detail as we are developing this as we are anticipating what we can achieve over the course of 2022, we aren't at the stage where we are ready to provide $1 breakdown on the expense. With regard to your question on operating leverage, operating leverage is really the key element that I focus on, and I am -- we do embrace the fact that this opportunity to rethink our cost base fundamentally improves our operating leverage. We've always been focused on businesses that have solid operating leverage. And as we drive strong organic growth into the business that magnifies the EBITDA growth, and that naturally produces margin expansion offset by our level of investment. The last question or element of the question related to the impact of M&A. And there our focus is on generating growth and returns. I think embedded in your question is, do we rely on acquisitions to maintain our growth rate? I think the short answer is no, we do look for businesses that we can create value from that are higher growth and represent opportunities for us to accelerate and to generate returns. But we believe that our internal opportunities to grow and as we've demonstrated in a variety of areas, including with our Lightspeed products and within our claims business, with a number of the products that we've added there, within our Extreme Events Solutions, businesses, those have all been strongly performing growth businesses for us. Looking ahead, we obviously can't anticipate the acquisitions that may become available to us. Our acquisitions are typically for smaller, higher growth businesses that do have lower margins. And if we do see acquisitions that we think are value creating, we will pursue those, and they may have a negative margin impact. In fact, they're probably likely to have a negative margin impact that would be outside of our overall objectives here, but they're fundamentally focused on value creation through our ability to accelerate and drive both growth in returns. So our analysis is based on the business as it is right now that we can achieve that against that insurance focus, consolidated business, but we aren't making any assumptions in terms of what our future acquisitions are. Those have to be opportunistic and based upon our discipline. Yes. Hans, let me ask Mark to provide a high-level view, we obviously have hundreds of products with different pricing dimensions. So again, it's not a monolithic business. But Mark perhaps you can offer some perspectives on how we think about value-based pricing model? Yes. Thank you, Kevin. So the first comment is, as we are kind of looking at this separation, I would just kind of leave it at right now. The investment on the energy side relative to revenue would be above that average, driven by that level of Lens investment in 2021 and 2022. And so we would expect that there would be an improvement on that. But we want to look at that separation, before we evaluate changing that guidance, which we still adhere to. The second part of your question is, one, yes, we are seeing that CapEx savings as you can see on that slide, but that internally developed software will continue to be an important component of the way that we invest to deliver value to our clients. It is creating platforms for the data, it is creating software automation solutions for clients. And that will continue to be an important component for the way that we either improve efficiency or make better decisions within our business as a whole. Our business is becoming more software intensive. And we think that's a good thing because of the value that we can create for them. One from a process standpoint, but also recognize that in a lot of the software businesses that we have and have acquired are essentially networks of participants in the insurance ecosystem. Our Sequel business or Specialty Business Solutions, is probably the best example of that. And that creates opportunities for us to utilize that data to create analytics and to provide new functionality that supports the ecosystem. And so that's why it's so important in a way with that software, we are able to recreate in other markets of the network effect that we have enjoyed historically within our domestic business. And I would also note, when you look at our acquisitions, Fast, sequel, Jornaya, they are more software intensive and are associated with that higher growth rate. So that will be an ongoing an important component for us. So with that, I think that is our final question. Thank you for your time today. Thanks again to Scott for all of his contributions and we look forward to the ongoing dialogue with all of you as we proceed. Have a good day."

The past 21 years at Verisk had been an incredible and rewarding journey. It's been my absolute privilege to serve as Chairman and CEO during such a transformative time for our company. I'm incredibly proud of the growth that we delivered and the value that we created for customers, employees and shareholders. And we always deliver this value by acting with the highest level of integrity. Our company's success has always been a team effort. To that end I'm delighted we have such a deep bench of talent, including our incoming CEO. Lee Shavel and incoming President, Mark Anquillare, who I know will drive continued growth for our company and Verisk towards becoming a global insurance focused data analytics solution provider. I look forward to seeing the work that all Verisk teammates will do to drive innovation and growth or long-term success. As this is my final earnings call, I also wanted to take a moment to thank all the shareholders and analysts that have covered Verisk for your effort and your support over the years. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Lee."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Mark Anquillare",
            "content": "Thanks, Lee. Before I begin, I also want to take a moment to thank Scott for all that he has contributed to Verisk. The legacy that you're leaving is rooted in the way our teams innovate, and always deliver for our customers. I wish you the very best in your retirement. It has been a pleasure to partner with you for all these years. And I'm excited to build on the strong foundation of success as we move to the next chapter of Verisk story. I'm pleased to share that the insurance segment delivered another solid quarter. Across insurance we're seeing strong results from both commercial and personal lines and seeing contributions to growth from our newly acquired businesses like Marketing and Life Insurance Solutions. Within our core, underwriting and Claims Solutions, growth is being driven by strong renewal cycles with existing customers, as well as from the addition of new customers and expanded use cases for Claim Solutions. Within marketing, we're seeing strong growth driven by continued adoption from T&C carriers using our solutions to optimize lead acquisition programs, build more intelligent marketing, segmentation and monitor portfolios for right timed outreach, and for improved customer retention. We're excited about the opportunity head as we combine Jornaya with our newly acquired in future business to further enhance these capabilities by synergizing products and offerings. Our Life Insurance Solutions continue to help our life and annuity customers along with their digital transformation. All the while delivering very strong growth for Verisk with the addition of new customers as well as expansion of relationships with existing customers. Life insurance recognize the benefits of a module and flexible software solutions and are standardizing on fast platform. Within stream events, we are seeing strong growth in our core Touchdown platform with the signing of new customers as well as extension of multiyear deals with existing customers. In addition, the catastrophe bond market continued to be strong, with Verisk participating in more than half of the deals placed in the quarter. Our sustainability business also had a very strong quarter as demand for ESG and resilience global risk indices in both the corporate and financial sector whose strong double digits. In the quarter we launched sovereign ESG ratings targeting the right financial sector, and early interest is encouraging as our focus on the risk is an unmet need in the marketplace. During the quarter, we experienced recovery in many of our transactional businesses that were negatively impacted by the pandemic, including travel, international auto and claims. This was offset in part by continued weakness in our workers compensation business, as carriers are adjusting to new regulation within the industry as well as tougher compares on the storm-related revenue versus last year's ice storms in Texas. In our many discussions with our customers, we continually hear the same message, the insurance industry is healthy and focused on to become more digital, more efficient and more automated. While insurers are experiencing increasing costs related to inflation, rates are hardening reflecting these inflationary factors. This should lead to faster premium growth. In addition, rising interest rates are helping the investment portfolios of our customers driving better profitability. All that said, cost efficiency continues to be a big focus of our customers has they work to be quicker, more automated and drive savings. The growth of our data sets has been a strategic focus as we work to further advance our mission to help our customers better slug risk. To that end, we've been expanding the data encouraging of our commercial property database, and now have over 15.4 million properties up from 12.2 just a year ago, goes to become a combination of onsite surveys, virtual technologies, third-party data sources, and our ability to accurately model key characteristics using the data we have to expand and update our databases more frequently. Separately, we've added 10 new data contributors into our core statistical databases for ratemaking in the first quarter. On [indiscernible] this quarter has been wonderful. We successfully hosted hybrid customer events, with many in person sessions. In February, we held our signature Elevate Conference, and in March, we held our Insurance Fraud Management Conference, both of which successful. Across the two events we had almost 600 attendees in person and another 900 plus through virtual sessions. It was great to be in person with customers again. During the quarter we acquired Opta, Canada's leading provider of property intelligence and innovative technology solutions, the acquisition further expands their footprint in the Canadian market, it supports optic and reshaping risk management with valuable business intelligence. As the only organization in Canada that regular gathers and validates data through ongoing research often is widely considered the industry standard for valuations, property risk intelligence and loss control services. This transaction offers Verisk immediate expansion into Canada with the leading provider of underwriting data and analytics to carriers and provides opportunity for product harmonization across the Opta and Verisk portfolio. We're excited to welcome the Opta team to the Verisk family. Finally, I want to take a minute to add to the comments that we made around operational efficiency. Within the insurance segment, we have engaged in a detailed study across all our costs throughout our business units. We have identified areas of expenses to be eliminated without impacting future growth opportunities. Such opportunities exist in real estate, technology infrastructure, increased use of our low-cost talent locations for open positions, improved sourcing and procurement, product optimization, and we work diligently to realize these cost savings in a timely and efficient manner. Now, let me turn the call over to interim CFO, David Grover, for the financial review. No, Lee. I think it was well said I just will highlight that. We have gone across every account every division. And we've gotten very deep into this. And I think the theme here is a combination of how can we be more effective? How can we be more efficient and that's across a lot of different categories, as well as what products may need to be rethought. But I will emphasize, we want to make sure that we continue to invest in the future because we're looking to grow and continue to grow as we have an organic growth is key to all this. So it's a delicate balancing act. But I think we've been making very good progress here and we're confident. Yes, Lee. I go back to -- we're just under 7% in '21 from an insurance perspective, as we look forward, I think the 7.2 is a good indication of the strength of the business. I can provide a little color on the ups and downs as some of the non-subs type of revenue. One, storms last year, Texas storms provided a little bit of a headwind in '21, obviously working against that comp in \u201822. Two, there still seems to be a quietness, at least in volumes as a result of the pandemic. And we see that in two places. One, just people aren't shopping for auto insurance, car insurance quite as frequent as they once did. I think they're probably content with at least the rates they have now. As inflation hits, and rates start to rise, people will again begin to shop. And the world of workers comp claims is just generally down. In your home, it's just not as many workers comp claims, we've seen probably drop of maybe around 20%. And there's been some regulatory changes that have paused some of the activity with insurers to how they're going to approach those claims. So those are the specifics with regard to non-subs or non-subscriptions. But what I like to emphasize is the subscription side of things, whether it's from our underwriting core line services, the claims analytics business, which is the fraud finding business exception on, and again, with extreme events, very strong. So I was pleased with first quarter. And as is the norm, we typically have growth and we have strength as the year progresses with insurance. So thank you. Sure. So let me -- two themes that I think you'll spot is, one, we continue to focus on trying to globally grow. So we'd have this wonderful franchise in the United States. And we've tried to take and extend that into other areas. So a) optic provides us with an underwriting base and foundation in Canada, doing many of the same things that [Ferris] [ph] does in United States around the ability to understand the value of a property, how much it should be insured, the property characteristics, so very nice synergies, very much aligned with what we do. And it takes us into Canada. We have a strong claims presence from a repair cost estimating perspective, but limited underwriting. So I hope that's kind of very strategic in that regard. The other international element to this is, we bought a business called ACTINEO, which represents a claims business around auto in Germany. So as we try to extend and expand, we've had some wonderful growth and some great synergies in the U.K. market. And this takes us into Germany, but also provides us an opportunity in solution set that along with an earlier acquisition called Validus that helps us also potentially get into Spain, and back into the U.K. in this product area. So again, international expansion, the focus. Other theme is really around marketing. And we've experienced a lot of customers very interested in trying to understand it and penetrate the customers, they are trying to segment, the customers they are trying to identify and bring on board. We have some wonderful tools to help them quote that business and identify and select that risk. So think about some shopping for homeowners insurance or auto insurance. [Indiscernible] is give us visibility as to who's literally out there shopping for insurance. It is an ID -- a lead ID that kind of shares this industry standard that yes, I'm out there. I've been on these websites. And to the extent that now I have information about that person. We are taking a lot of our underwriting where we've been focused on the asset, meaning the house or the car and trying to extend it into the people and the person in the individual gaining insurance. And we feel that personal side of underwriting and marketing is a very large market opportunity and we're naturally there already. So hopefully that provides a little bit of strategic context like. Yes, super. So first of all, naturally, the way we kind of align our value add to our customers needs is typically tied to some element, how big they are, which is usually in the form of premium. So it doesn't necessarily tie year-after-year the premium, but we try to think it up to how they're using basically our core products, or our claims analytics products to the extent you think about some of the solutions on the repair cost estimating side, it's just the number of claims. So I think what we've typically tried to do is set up a process by which we kind of size the overall relationship based upon premium or claims are. And then inside of that, we are trying to create a holistic solution. So we are trying to bumble solutions together. So we provide a holistic solution set to them. And I think the opportunity there is that one, they have the ability to bundle the products, they get kind of a value price. And we try to include some increase or inflation in years two and three, usually there is a three year contracts, and they kind of come renew and year four, sometimes they are five year contracts. But I hope that gives you a little bit of color. 85% of the revenue is subscription based typically it's in these three-year contracts. And I think the relationship strong. So we're always able to add new solutions or maybe they want to add a different subsidiary to the mix and that gives us continued upselling opportunities inside what is a very big existing customer base."

Currently, all participants are in listen-only mode. After today's prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, where we will limit participants to one question so that we can allow everyone to ask a question. We will have further instructions for you at that time. For opening remarks and introduction, I would now like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.\nStacey Brodbar: Thank you, operator and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. On the call today are Lee Shavel, Verisk's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Elizabeth Mann, Chief Financial Officer. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as our traditional quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-K can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. As set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance, including those related to our financial guidance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Finally, I'd also like to remind everyone that the financial results for recent dispositions are included in our consolidated and GAAP results but are excluded from all organic constant currency growth figures. A reconciliation of reported and historic non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call is provided in our 8-K and today's earnings presentation posted on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. However, we are not able to provide a reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable expected GAAP results because of the unreasonably effort and high unpredictability of estimating certain items that are excluded from projected non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, including, for example, tax consequences, acquisition-related costs, gains and losses from dispositions and other non-recurring expenses, the effect of which may be significant. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Lee Shavel.\nLee Shavel: Thank you, Stacey. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in this morning's call. I am pleased to be here today to recap what was an exceptional year for Verisk, marked by strategic, organizational and cultural change matched with outstanding financial performance and value creation for clients and shareholders alike. Elizabeth will provide the financial detail but in summary, we delivered 8.7% organic constant currency revenue growth in 2023, the strongest performance on record since our initial public offering back in 2009. And we exceeded the expectations we set at Investor Day in March. We combine this with double-digit organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth and 150 basis points of margin expansion on an Insurance-only basis, achieving the low end of the initial margin improvement goal of 300 basis points one year earlier than our original target of 2024. And we have plans in place to build on that in 2024 and beyond. Despite the separation of our non-Insurance business, we still grew free cash flow 6% to over $800 million and above our 2022 level on an unadjusted basis. Over the past two years, we demonstrated capital discipline by returning over $4 billion in proceeds from recent dispositions, to shareholders through share repurchases reducing our share base by about 10%. This also served to substantially improve our capital efficiency, and boost our returns on invested capital.  And while our strong 2023 revenue growth was exceptional, the long-term opportunity of addressing our clients' most pressing needs, gives me confidence in our strategy to drive consistent and predictable growth in 2024 and beyond. The insurance industry backdrop in which we are operating, is relatively comparable to 2023. Insurance carriers continue to deal, with cyclical challenges on profitability resulting from higher losses and the lagging effects of inflation, by restricting new business in profit-challenged markets. The most recent AM Best data shows losses for the first nine months of 2023 were $32.2 billion, a further deterioration from the $24.5 billion in net losses recorded through the first six months of the year and tracking way ahead of the pace of losses in 2022. This caused AM Best to downgrade their outlook for the homeowners line from stable to negative, while also maintaining their negative outlook on personal auto. To some extent, profitability challenges in the industry were the result of higher catastrophe-related losses. Our own PCS data, points out that 2023 was the highest year on record for frequency of catastrophe activity, with 74 events. While 2023, did not have a major tropical hurricane make US landfall, wind and severe convective storms were dominant and the major source of events in the year. That said, the fourth quarter of 2023 was a relatively quiet period with only seven events, and was lower than the fourth quarter of 2022, which experienced 13 events. On the more positive end, carriers are having success raising rates and driving premium growth and are taking the very early steps in certain lines to unwind restrictions on writing new business, as they achieve rate adequacy. In fact, net written premium growth increased 10.8% for the first nine months of 2023. More structurally, the insurance industry continues to be challenged by the rapid pace of technological change including, digitalization and cloud migration. This is being compounded by the fact, that the industry also faces technological debt and aging legacy systems. In addition, the industry continues to experience growing regulatory focus on issues of data privacy, fairness and climate risk. Our business model and strategy are designed to address our customers' most pressing needs, both from a cyclical and structural perspective. We invest on behalf of the industry, applying our industry knowledge and technical expertise at scale, to deliver value to our clients at a lower cost of investment and ownership than any one participant can achieve individually. As we work with our clients on a more integrated basis, the opportunities to develop new solutions expands. We are focused on the three key priorities, we articulated back at Investor Day namely, delivering consistent and predictable top line growth, driving operating efficiency and profitability and ensuring disciplined capital allocation. Let me spend a few minutes on how we plan to go after each in 2024 and beyond. Our first priority is delivering consistent and predictable growth, through strategic dialogue with clients in innovation. Throughout 2023, we made substantial progress on our initiative to elevate the strategic dialogue with our clients, and to become their strategic data analytic and technology partner. During the year, I met with over three dozen client CEOs and senior leaders representing over half of the US property and casualty insurance industry direct written premium to discuss how we could better support their objectives. Three primary themes came up repeatedly. How can you accelerate and expand the delivery of data and analytics to our organization? How can Verisk augment the capabilities of our colleagues to improve their ability to manage the amount of information they receive? And finally, how can Verisk help better connect the ecosystems we operate in to improve our efficiency. On the acceleration point, we are intensively addressing this opportunity across our businesses, but perhaps most significantly in our Core Lines Reimagine project to reengineer how we deliver our core data sets and analytics to meet the rapidly evolving ingestion demands of our clients. Prospectively, we see the application of low no-code and micro services technology that we have successfully deployed in the life insurance industry, having material significance to the property and casualty segment and have been working with clients on testing applications. On augmentation, we have already been applying generative AI technology through our Discovery Navigator solution to dramatically accelerate the summarization of large and complex medical files in our casualty business. Prospectively, we have been developing and working with clients to refine several augmented underwriting applications. On connectivity, we have been investing in our Xactware platform to support the integration of more ecosystem and partners. Last week, I attended our Elevate Conference in Salt Lake City, which had record attendance from our insurance contractor, adjuster clients, and over 30 ecosystem partners. Both clients and partners expressed enthusiasm for our delivery of improved connectivity and efficiency, demonstrating the network potential of this business. Finally, on connectivity, we were thrilled at last week's announcement of Marsh's expansion of its digital trading initiative on the Verisk Whitespace platform. This builds on a successful pilot in 2023, which traded over $400 million in premium and is a gratifying endorsement by a world-leading insurance broker that should draw more participation onto a data-first platform that will drive greater efficiency for the market. With expansion across its UK specialty and international placement business, Marsh anticipates that over 90% of all client premium in that segment will flow through the platform by the end of 2024. Our strategic conversations are also helping to drive more informed innovation. In our conversations with clients, we repeatedly hear about the increasing regulatory focus and reporting requirements on fairness and unfair discrimination. To address this need during the fourth quarter, we launched FairCheck, a solution designed to address issues of fairness and discrimination in the underwriting process. FairCheck helps insurers test their personal lines' models and variables to respond to regulatory change and to evaluate and mitigate the potential for unfairly discriminatory outcomes. This solution is an extension of the work we did internally to assess Verisk's own personal auto rating model, to determine whether there were unfair pricing outcomes regarding race. We recently signed a national property and casualty carrier to be our first customer. Internally during 2023, we worked with an outside consultant to sharpen our go-to-market strategy and are implementing the first steps of this changed approach in 2024. This includes an investment behind sales effectiveness, incorporating a change to the composition of incentives to be more in line with industry best practices. In addition, we have identified pricing and packaging opportunities within property estimating solutions and extreme event solutions. And we will be bringing them to market throughout this year. Our second priority from Investor Day is driving operating efficiency and profitability. We remain committed to driving operating efficiency and margin expansion over time. We are leaning into our global talent optimization initiative, tapping into the talent-rich and low-cost markets like Krakow Poland and Hyderabad India. We have recently expanded our real estate footprint in both markets to support our growth. Additionally, we should continue to achieve savings as we modernize and optimize our technology infrastructure across all our legacy systems, including our internal financial and human capital ERP upgrade, which is underway and which should start delivering early efficiency benefits in 2025 with the full impact to be achieved in two to three years. As we look out, we see opportunity in improving our operational efficiency by careful reviews of our workflow and processes. We will continue to deploy our Lean Six Sigma program to drive additional savings and continue to focus on our organizational structure and efficiency. And finally, our third priority is disciplined capital allocation. Disciplined capital allocation underscores all our decision-making at Verisk. We invest our strong free cash flow into value-creating opportunities that support growth with attractive returns. Excess capital is returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In 2023, our return on invested capital was approximately 26% with incremental returns on capital at approximately 19%, as continue to invest our capital at high internal rates of return. We are excited about the many opportunities we have to invest across our business in emerging technologies, including generative AI, low no-code applications and international expansion. We also are investing behind upgrades and re-platforming of our core solutions, some of which have been underinvested and need modernization to support future innovation. The most notable example is our Core Lines Reimagine project. As we highlighted before, we are about one-third of the way through this project from an investment perspective and we are engaging our clients as we plan for customer-facing modules launching in 2024. While there is still much work to be done, we are already driving returns through strong contract renewals with our largest customers, as they recognize the value of the program. We are also investing in modernizing our property estimating solutions platform to advance our strategic goal of creating a more open ecosystem that is resilient, redundant and available for all stakeholders. We are simplifying partner integration and developing new services to enable deeper workflow integration, richer solutions and better client services. This initiative should increase our agility and create a more dynamic work environment for both our clients and our development teams. We are also excited about the opportunities to continue to create incremental value in our insurance related acquisitions. For example, in claims, we are driving growth and synergies in our three recent acquisitions in Germany, where we have a leading market position in the bodily injury space and are adding services and technology offerings in the auto and property spaces through the acquisitions of ACTINEO, Krug and Rocket respectively. These acquisitions enable us to deliver solutions and add value to our German customers across the entire claims life cycle. Before we close, I want to address the recent leadership announcements naming three new business leaders to the Verisk Senior Operating Committee. Rob Newbold was named President, Extreme Events taking over the reins from Bill Churney who retired at the end of the year. And Doug Caccese and Saurabh Khemka, who are recently named Co-Presidents of Underwriting Solutions replacing Neil Spector who has moved into a strategic advisory role. All three leaders are evidence of our deeply talented management bench and focused leadership development and succession planning process. I want to thank both Bill and Neil for their many contributions to Verisk and to me personally as I stepped into the role of CEO. And while we will miss them, they have left their business in the very capable hands of talented, experienced and energized leaders. 2023 was a demonstration of Verisk's evolving culture. We delivered strong financial success, while absorbing organizational and leadership change. And I am excited about having the fresh perspective and energy of these three leaders as we move into 2024. With that, I'll hand it over to Elizabeth to review our financial results.\nElizabeth Mann : Thanks Lee, and good day to everyone on the call. I am pleased to share that Verisk delivered a solid fourth quarter capping off an outstanding 2023. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, fourth quarter revenue was $677 million, up 7.4% versus the prior year, reflecting solid growth in underwriting and more modest growth in claims. Income from continuing operations was $182 million, down 15.5% versus the prior year, while diluted GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.25, down 8.8% versus the prior year. The year-over-year decline in both measures were primarily due to a $19 million litigation reserve expense related to our former Financial Services segment that was previously sold, alongside a one-time tax benefit of $30 million, or $0.19 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022. Additionally, elevated depreciation and amortization expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023, resulting from the completion and implementation of certain large internally developed software projects during the year, also contributed to the decrease. These factors were partially offset by strong revenue growth, lower net interest expense and the benefit from our accelerated share repurchase program. Moving to our organic constant currency results. Adjusted for non-operating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, our operating results demonstrated solid growth for most of our businesses. In the fourth quarter, OCC revenues grew 6% with growth of 7.3% in underwriting, and 2.8% in claims. Normalizing for the $5.6 million in storm-related revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022, total OCC revenue growth would have been 6.9% and claims OCC revenue growth would have been 6.0%. As expected and as we highlighted in prior quarters, some of the environmental trends recorded elevated growth earlier in the year began to normalize in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we did begin to overlap tougher comparisons in many of our businesses. That said, 2023 was a record year for Verisk, with total OCC revenue growth of 8.7%, driven by strong growth of 8.5% in underwriting and 9.3% in claims. Growth for the full year was broad-based with almost all businesses delivering better-than-expected results. Throughout 2023, our increased focus on the Insurance business and our energized organization, capitalized on three key industry and environmental trends to amplify our growth. These trends included, the pricing environment, resulting from the hard insurance market, the high transaction activity, driven by elevated shopping activity for auto insurance and the active US weather patterns that Lee highlighted. Our subscription revenues, which comprise 80% of our total revenue in the quarter, grew 7.3% on an OCC basis during the fourth quarter, with growth in almost all our subscription-based solutions. The drivers of growth we experienced in the quarter were consistent with trends we saw throughout 2023. More specifically during the quarter, we experienced the continued benefit on certain of our revenues from the stronger net premium growth in 2021, which is currently reflected in some of our contract pricing. In anti-fraud, we saw underlying strength in the business with growth augmented by the continued benefit from the conversion to subscription from previously transactional customers through our claims essential bundle. That said, we have started to anniversary the benefit we experienced from these conversions and are expecting the benefit from this transition to continue to moderate in 2024. These strengths were offset in part by continued weakness within Verisk Marketing Solutions and a more normalized level of attrition across the business, including some reduction in the level of contractor activity, due to the weather and some pressure within our Insurtech customer segment. Our transactional revenues, representing 20% of total revenue in the fourth quarter, increased a modest 0.8% on an OCC basis, reflecting a tough comparison versus the prior year, which included revenues associated with Hurricane Ian. Adjusting for the storm impact, transactional revenue growth would have been 4.1%. During the quarter, we continued to see strong results from our auto solutions, driven by healthy consumer shopping activity and the final quarter of benefit from the large nonrate action deal we signed for 2023. We have begun to overlap the positive inflection in shopping behavior from last year and are expecting growth to moderate in 2024. Our transactional revenue growth also benefited from double-digit growth within life insurance solutions, as we are seeing strong customer demand for incremental services. And within our extreme events business, we saw better-than-expected transactional growth driven by securitizations. Moving now to our adjusted EBITDA results. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 6.5% in the fourth quarter, while total adjusted EBITDA, margin which includes both organic and inorganic results was 53.4%, up 70 basis points from the reported results in the prior year. The fourth quarter margin rate reflects the positive impact of sales leverage, cost discipline and foreign currency changes. This was offset in part by margin pressure from higher incentive compensation, acquisitions and organic investments for future growth. 2023 was a year of tremendous growth and efficiency for Verisk as evidenced by total OCC adjusted EBITDA growth of 11.5%, while total adjusted EBITDA margin was 53.5%, up 150 basis points from the prior year. This margin rate reflects core operating leverage from the strong revenue growth and cost discipline across the organization. As Lee discussed earlier, delivering operational efficiency and profitability remains a key priority for us as we move forward into 2024 and beyond. We have confidence we can continue to make further progress, while also balancing investments to support future growth. Continuing down the income statement, net interest expense was $28 million for the fourth quarter compared to $41 million in the prior year. The current level of net interest expense reflects lower year-over-year debt balances as well as higher interest on cash balances. Depreciation and amortization of fixed assets was $68 million for the quarter, an increase of 57%. The increase was primarily driven by an additional $23 million of expense related to the timing of certain large internally developed software projects that were completed and placed into service during the year. On taxes our reported effective tax rate was 24.9% compared to 9.9% in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year increase in the tax rate is related to the one-time tax benefit of $30 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and a $19 million litigation reserve taken in the fourth quarter 2023 that we mentioned earlier. Adjusted net income decreased 9.3% to $204 million and diluted adjusted EPS decreased 2.1% to $1.40 for the fourth quarter. These changes reflect the negative impact from the one-time tax benefit in the prior year quarter and higher depreciation and amortization expenses, partially offset by solid revenue and EBITDA growth lower net interest expense and a lower average share count. The share count reflects the impact of the additional $250 million of share repurchases executed in the fourth quarter as well as the final settlement of our $2.5 billion accelerated share repurchase plan that we entered into in March. From a cash flow perspective, on a reported basis net cash from operating activities increased 1.4% to $252 million, while free cash flow increased 15.8% to $196 million. It is important to note that the prior year cash flow figures still include the results of our previously divested Energy business. So, these growth figures understate the full cash flow growth potential of our Insurance-only business. On dividends and repurchases, during 2023, we returned $3 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends and repurchases. We are pleased to share that the Board has approved a $0.05 or 15% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.39 per share. In addition our Board has also authorized an additional $1 billion in share repurchases, bringing our total authorization to $1.6 billion. On guidance, we are pleased to deliver our expectations for 2024 with growth and margins in line with our Investor Day target and they build upon the exceptional performance we delivered in 2023. More specifically, we expect consolidated revenue for 2024, to be in the range of $2.84 billion to $2.9 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.54 billion to $1.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin in the 54% to 55% range. This margin reflects strong cost discipline, while also funding incremental investment opportunities that we expect to drive future growth. These opportunities include investing in our sales force to drive greater sales effectiveness, expanding internationally through acquisitions and building our capabilities with new advanced technologies including Generative AI. Walking further down the P&L, we expect depreciation and amortization of fixed assets in the range of $210 million to $240 million and amortization of intangibles of approximately $75 million. Both items are subject to the timing of completion of projects and foreign currency changes. We expect our tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%. This all culminates in adjusted earnings, in the range of $6.30 to $6.60 per share. We also expect capital expenditures to be between $240 million and $260 million as we continue to invest organically to drive future growth. A complete list of all guidance measures can be found in the earnings slide deck, which has been posted to the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. And now, I will turn the call back over to Lee, for some closing comments.\nLee Shavel: Thanks, Elizabeth. In summary, we're excited about the opportunity that lies ahead. Our motivating purpose is to partner with our clients in building resilience for individuals, communities and businesses globally. The combination of our focused business model, deep customer relationships and strategy to deliver value for clients through improved decision-making and operational efficiency is a formula that will also deliver value to our shareholders through growth and returns. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk, given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. With that, I'll ask the operator, to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nFaiza Alwy: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thank you. So I wanted to talk about the revenue guide. Liz, you mentioned a few puts and takes and we've been talking all of last year about some of the one-time impacts that you noted are normalizing. So maybe you give us a bit more perspective specifically how you're thinking about transaction growth and what some of the puts and takes there are? Thank you.\nElizabeth Mann: [Technical Difficulty] takes. But zooming back on the full year, we really think there were three drivers of strength in 2023. The first was the pricing environment in the hard insurance market. The second was the transactional rebound and particularly the activity in the auto shopping space. And the third was the elevated weather activity which as you heard 2023 was a record-breaking year for cat events even though there was a single large hurricane driving it. When we think about making assumptions for a future year, we think in general that first -- that hard insurance market does persist into 2024. But for the other factors for transactional activity, we would expect that to normalize somewhat. And for the weather, we can never forecast mother nature. So we assume a more normalized level of weather activity.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: It's Wahid Amin [ph] on for Heather. Thanks for taking our questions. Just wanted to comment a little bit more on the pricing environment for 2023. You said it was quite elevated. Can you comment on how that is going into 2024?\nLee Shavel: Yes. So, thanks. This is Lee. So first let me distinguish I think from a pricing standpoint first, as we indicated in our comments and as Elizabeth just described, the overall premium growth market has continued to be strong as insurers have been able to secure some rate approvals. We think there's more progress in that regard. So I want to differentiate that pricing environment, which has been constructive. And from our perspective that is a partial benefit. It represents approximately 20% to 25% of our revenue base is tied to prior two-year premium growth. And so that provides some level of support. But I think the more meaningful element of our pricing is our ability to deliver value to our clients. We're doing that probably most significantly in the investment that we're making in our Core Lines Reimagine project, where early renewals from clients that have seen what we are doing, what we are creating, how we are improving, their experience, their efficiency has demonstrated that value. And we have been able to realize stronger pricing momentum than we had originally anticipated which we feel good about as we continue to deliver more functionality through that platform. And I would say, further I think we through the go-to-market review that we have done, we have identified some areas to identify how we can capture more value that we are delivering to our clients from pricing structures that align to identifying and identifying that value that we're creating for our clients.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi. First, I just want to say how much I appreciate Slide 7, the revenue mix, very helpful. My question is about Verisk auto underwriting revenues, which I think is all non-subs. Just please verify that. How did this ad market do in the fourth quarter? And what's the assumption for 2024 within a guide?\nElizabeth Mann: Thanks, Andrew and thanks for the feedback on the slide. We're always listening to you guys. On the auto underwriting revenues, it is largely transactional but not 100%. There is some subscription revenues in there. And the shopping activity was \u2013 in Q4, it tapered down from Q3 but it is still elevated relative to historical levels. I think for third-party data that J.D. Power data encapsulates that. I think we are assuming that it will continue tapering down to more historic levels. Even at where it is we're now lapping the benefit of the strong environment. But maybe for more on that environment I'll turn it over to Doug Caccese\nDoug Caccese: Sure. Thanks, Elizabeth and thanks, Andrew for the question. Just I'll echo what you had said Elizabeth. As we look at our internal data and also external shopping data we see a slight slowdown in Q4 from the shopping activity. And when you look at it month-over-month you see a slight slowdown from October, November, December. So we are seeing that slowdown happen. We expect that slowdown to continue. But in 2024, we expect still elevated levels of shopping activity. The pivot on this is also that we'll focus on our non-rate action campaigns which actually allow us to go and help carriers bring in premium immediately that's leaking out of the book while they're waiting for rate to earn in so it helps in that way.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra from RBC. Please go ahead. \nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to focus on the subscription growth. There were three headwinds that were called out. I was just wondering how should we think about the Marketing Solutions some of the attrition and contracted activity and insurance deck as we go through 2024? Thanks.\nElizabeth Mann: Yes. On the marketing side as we've called out in the year -- carriers and being challenged and still trying to achieve profitable growth has not yet turned on their marketing spend. We are starting to see that tide turn and some of them are returning to profitability. The marketing engines haven't been turned on quite yet, but you're starting to see green shoots in that environment. I would say we're assuming that it will start to return to more normalized levels in the second half of this year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please go ahead. \nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, This is Brendan on for Manav. I just want to ask [Technical Difficulty] the new product pipeline. Any benefits from that this year? What's kind of -- what's planned for this year? And then also you talked about some incremental investments as well with AI Gen AI. So anything related to that?\nLee Shavel: Sure. Thank you, Brendan. And I'm going to repeat the question because you came through a little choppy there. So I think the question was how do we feel about a new product pipeline areas of investment? And so I would say, we're really excited about a number of the new products and developments that we are -- that we have been working on. In particular, I think, certainly a lot of the focus has been around generative AI and its application. And we've been exploring its application across a variety of our businesses. I'm going to isolate for a second on our claims business where we have deployed some generative AI, applications and are also looking at developing other applications. I'm going to ask my colleague Maroun Mourad to talk a little bit about what we're doing in that area as an example of what we have been looking to do more broadly.\nMaroun Mourad: Thank you, Lee and thank you Manav for the question. So building on our 2023 momentum let me just highlight our strong levels of client engagement and ecosystem partner-driven innovations and co-creation that led to the productization of a couple of solutions. In the casualty bodily injury space we have deployed a traditional AI methods as well as generative AI technologies in the data extraction and medical file summary space in conjunction with the deep domain expertise of our legal as well as medical staff in order to continue delivering value to our customers in that space and also in the property estimation space. We have also deployed the Gen AI and other AI methods in order to continue delivering automation in the estimation product process. We've talked in the past about XactXpert as a solution to continue driving productivity, speed as well as accuracy which is very important for our customers to connect adjusters, contractors as well as insurers.\nLee Shavel: And I'd add to that, Brendan. I want to give you a taste of what we're doing on that front. But as many of you know, we've been really thrilled about the success that we've had with our fast businesses application of low and no-code technology to the Life Insurance business. We believe and have begun to engage with clients on how that can be potentially applied to the P&C area. So I think that's a broad opportunity. And then we also as a more insurance-focused entity have been able to try to integrate more of our data sets in our extreme events business and our specialty business solutions area, tying together some of the functions in the excess and specialty market and the reinsurance markets as well as tying together some of our claims data and our underwriting data. And so as we have now fully migrated to the cloud, our ability to facilitate those types of integrations are particularly attractive. So a lot of the great stuff that we have underway that should support future growth for the company.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird. Please go ahead.\nJeff Meuler: Yeah. Thank you. I know a lot of factors contribute to the consistent growth. But I just would love your perspective on the procyclicality of bookings or innovation sell-through, especially when it's discrete upsell. And I guess, what I'm wondering is as the -- as you start to see the move towards premium adequacy, would you expect to see bookings pick up with that? And maybe can call out a few areas, I'd imagine marketing is one, but any other areas where there may be pent-up demand as the environment gets healthier from a profitability perspective? Thank you.\nLee Shavel: Sure, Jeff. It's a complex question, and so I think we're trying to get our handle on it. I'm going to kind of isolate on as we see premium adequacy improve and the procyclicality dimension of the business. I should probably start by saying, or by saying, as I think many of our investors and analysts understand we don't have a high degree of economic sensitivity. And so, there is muted sensitivity to cyclical effects. We tend to be more influenced as you've observed by weather events or activities in the ILS market and so those tend to have a more pronounced element to it. I do think that, there is some procyclicality elements that as the business -- as the insurance industry is doing well and we've seen premium growth that, that does encourage more investment in technology and renovation that accelerates our ability to deploy some of the technologies that we have invested in. And that is a positive tailwind in that scenario. However, I want to isolate that to insurance cyclicality. So that as their profitability grows and that may be separate and unconnected to just broader economic cyclicality, which is relatively muted. So hopefully that, I think, addresses kind of the core of your question, Jeff.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nGreg Parrish: This is Greg Parrish on for Toni. Thanks for taking our question. Why don't you just talk about margin? You talked about what sounded like expansion of some of the ongoing efficiency initiatives that you have. Is the benefit from those within the ongoing 25 to 75 basis points in your framework and balanced by investment? Or do you skew a little bit higher over the next two to three years as you work through those initiatives? How do we think about that? Thanks.\nElizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks for the question. We are continually focused on efficiency here at Verisk and looking at the next levers that we can pull. We do think in the long-term that being efficient in our core business will enable us to fund some of the investments we've been talking about, all while delivering operating leverage in the business. So, beyond 2024 is a long way out, and we'll come back and give impact on that in future years as we get closer. But that's the general concept of delivering efficiency in order to fund some investments and still have an expansion.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJeff Silber: Thanks so much. I want to continue on the margin discussion, and I'm sorry, if I'm misspeaking here. But I'm looking at your Investor Day slide last March, where you were guiding for 54% to 50% -- 56%, excuse me, adjusted EBITDA margins in 2024, and then another 25 to 75 basis points increase in 2025. Today you're talking about 54% to 55% in 2024. I'm just wondering what's changed since then? And should we still expect the margin expansion in 2025 that you had guided to last year? Thanks.\nElizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks for the question, Jeff. Yes, you're right. Our range now as a one-year guidance and a 1-point range is a tightening from what we have said at Investor Day, which at that time it was two years out and a 2-point range. And I'll remind you that, that Investor Day range the 54% to 56% itself was a tightening of what had been our three-year margin target, which was a 3-point range of 53% to 56%. So, our trajectory over the past three years has been to increase margins by 150 basis points in 2022, another 150 basis points in 2023. And then, currently the midpoint of this guide would represent another 100 basis points on top of that. So we are balancing that margin expansion and the trajectory of margin expansion with investments in growth. The differential between the current midpoint of our guide and the midpoint at Investor Day is entirely encompassed by the three incremental investments that I highlighted that were not yet in the cards at the time of Investor Day. Those are the investments in our sales force that Lee discussed, the international expansion with our M&A that has taken place since Investor Day, and then the investments in generative AI to drive new products. So, we think we're delivering on all of our client-facing investments those -- the three ones being the ones that are particularly new since Investor Day. We're doing that while still delivering 100 basis points of margin expansion. And so, we think that balance is an attractive package. If you compound this and this margin expansion on top of what we already delivered in 2023, you come out ahead of those targets that we had in March.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hi. Good morning. Appreciate you taking the question. I'll echo Andrew's comments on slide 7, super helpful. And my question goes specifically to that graphic. Lee and Elizabeth, when you look at the different solutions here, maybe you could call out a couple about what you're the most excited and perhaps where you think you have the ability to drive faster growth whether that's on the claims side, or the underwriting side, it sounds like you have some pricing initiatives. Obviously life and rest of world is pretty exciting if somewhat small. But are there a couple of areas where you think -- if we look at this chart say three to five years from now where the contribution of certain solutions have significantly changed?\nLee Shavel: Yeah. Thank you, Andrew. I'm going to answer your question in a way that I think gives you some insight in terms of where we see value creation opportunity. I think first off, all of our businesses are clearly generating strong organic growth delivering value to the industry. They're at different scale levels. And so I'll reiterate that, for instance, in our forms rules and loss cost area where we focused our core lines reimagine area that's a broad area where we are creating value. And I'm going to ask Saurabh Khemka who leads that effort in that business to talk a bit about how we're creating value there. It's probably our most scaled opportunity where we can find incremental value and capture that value. Underneath the businesses as a whole and this will hearken back to Investor Day, we see opportunities to build network value. We've talked about it within the themes ecosystem where we're adding partners, which creates value for all of our market participants but particularly our insurance clients. And I'll also note that with our specialty business solutions, while 3% of our total 2023 revenue contribution represents connectivity and a network impact particularly with the Marsh announcement that allows us to build value in that network expansion. And I think that holds true in a variety of areas, property estimating solutions in forms rules and loss costs. But let me give Saurabh an opportunity to talk a little bit about where we are adding value to our clients in a variety of ways with the core lines reimagine project.\nSaurabh Khemka: Sure. Thanks Lee, and good morning. So, overall, we feel really good about where we are with the reimagine program and the progress the team has made. And as the program naturally moves towards client deliverables in 2024, our customers will see additional value from benefits of our modernization of our internal systems, which will allow them to have faster access to our analytics, new analytics and insights like our executive industry insights that will be brought into the buy lines of business will provide benchmark analytics to our customers, new innovation around our forms management platform, which will make it easier for our customers to manage and track changes to our core programs, and finally continued migration of our contents to the new platform. We are really encouraged by the client feedback around these innovations and our customers are excited to see these come to fruition.\nLee Shavel: And I'll cap it off by saying another dimension of incremental growth is the ability to move some of our traditional products into more of a SaaS type of environment. And there in our extreme events business, the migration to more of a SaaS model, we believe opens up opportunity to deliver more value to that segment of our clients as well. But thanks for the question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSurinder Thind: Thank you. In terms of just the go-to-market strategy the investment in the sales force at this point, can you provide a little bit more color in terms of are there like changes in compensation structure or headcount thing that you're looking for? How should we think about that part of the equation?\nLee Shavel: Yes. Thank you, Surinder. So there are a number of elements and I really have to complement the organization for its receptivity, to outside perspectives, on what we could be doing better. We looked at it across all of our businesses. And certainly, compensation structure was an area of focus. And there, I think we -- there were two things. One, we looked at where market levels were both from a level and from a composition standpoint, so that our sales team felt as though they were being fairly treated, create a good opportunity and aligning our interest with the customer. And we believe that that will improve our retention and make certain that they are focused on the opportunities that generate the most value for us. We also spent time looking at pricing, relative to value and where we feel as though we're delivering demonstrable value to our clients, and how we can be more responsive to structuring our pricing in a way that aligns, with our clients' perception of value and what their needs are. So, I would just identify those as two of the primary functions. I would add, somewhat outside of this, we have also been working to make certain that our sales effort is well tied into our senior-level strategic dialogue, so that as we have driven a stronger level of dialogue, we are communicating effectively internally to capitalize on opportunities for sales on existing products that our clients may not be aware of, or we find higher support because of the value proposition at a senior level within the organization. And so, that's an area where we expect that we'll be able to do a better job as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. Please go ahead. \nQ \u2013 Andrew Nicholas: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the higher-growth businesses, a different way. I think back in the Investor Day, you talked about those potentially representing 20% of your business in 2025. Is there a way to kind of comment on that trajectory, and how those faster-growth businesses performed in 2023, specifically?\nElizabeth Mann: Yes. This is Elizabeth. Yes, I can comment on that. They continue to be on the path and on the trajectory to achieve that goal. They've achieved strong results in 2023. And the largest change in our growth mix in 2023 versus kind of the algorithm laid out at Investor Day, has been the overperformance of the core businesses.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Russell Quelch from Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead. \nQ \u2013 Russell Quelch: Yes. Appreciate, you having me on. I also appreciate the strategy you've been making in improving and growing the business. But I want to look at the free cash flow yield. It's still at the low end of the peer group. And Elizabeth did mention in her remarks, I think a focus on growing free cash flow. So maybe you could expand on this a little bit, and how much we should expect free cash flow to grow in 2024 and beyond.\nElizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks for the question, Russell. We'll have to look with you at that stat on free cash flow yield because we think the Insurance business has very strong free cash flow. Again, looking at it maybe as a percent of revenue may understate the strength of it. So, we think it's been growing. I mean, a demonstration of the growth in the Q4 number, which has grown over the prior year, even though the prior year numbers still include the energy business. So we are excited about the free cash flow generation of the business. We don't give guidance on it, but conceptually it should continue to grow roughly in line with our bottom line. And I think the purest demonstration, we can give of that confidence has been the commitment on the dividend increase.\nLee Shavel: Yes. And Russell the one thing I would add is I think that if you start with free cash flow given accounting differences over time should even out. And so it should approximate our overall EBITDA growth rate assuming that the CapEx is growing commensurate with that. I do think in 2024, we're seeing slightly higher CapEx growth, because of what we see as a number of opportunities within the business. Part of that relates to the generative AI opportunity. And so we may have periods of higher level of CapEx investment that may bring the overall free cash flow growth down. But over the long-term we see that very -- should be very commensurate with our overall adjusted EBITDA growth.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nSeth Weber : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Lee, I've heard a couple of times you talked about pricing opportunities. I think you called out extreme events and property estimating. I'm just trying to maybe get some more details on that. Do you think that will impact 2024? Or is that a longer-term kind of play here? And is this just sort of the first couple of areas where you're finding these new opportunities and we should expect more of that kind of going forward? Or any way you can help frame this pricing opportunity? Thank you.\nLee Shavel: Yes. Seth, thanks for the question. It's difficult to kind of isolate it, because it occurs across our business. I would say that certainly that those pricing improvements that I've referred to in terms of new contract renewals are factored into our 2024 guidance from an overall revenue growth perspective. So, in that regard, we're beginning to see some of that influence that our near-term expectations. But I do believe that it is a source of growth for us longer-term. And it's not a really very different than what we described as our general operating model, which is that we believe that we can create much broader value for the industry, by investing in this data and technology and capturing that particularly as we add value to our existing clients is largely value-driven pricing. And so that supports the -- that longer-term 6% to 8% growth target that we are working to achieve on a predictable and consistent basis.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst : Hi. Good morning. This is Sid on for Greg. I wanted to focus on Slide 18 of your investor deck and when you talk about your capital management philosophy. And just moving forward curious, how we should view repurchases following in your capital management framework versus acquisitions, or internal investments, et cetera?\nElizabeth Mann : Yes. Thanks for the question, Sid. As we highlight there, our capital management philosophy really focuses on our returns on invested capital. We will look to invest in the business. Our CapEx range that we've given you for the year shows the organic investment in the business. On the M&A side, we are active in the market. And we will continue to evaluate opportunities and what we see out there for strong businesses which bring something additive to the Verisk business. And those two things should be generating returns well above our cost of capital. And we assess that and continue to track it. As we highlighted in the script, our incremental returns on invested capital this year were approximately 19%. To the extent, we don't find opportunities there, we will continue to return capital to shareholders, as you've seen us do pretty consistently in the past.\nLee Shavel: And Greg, one thing that I would add and I want to thank all of our investors who participated in the year-end investor survey that was conducted. We thought it was important to get feedback after the first three quarters and following Investor Day. And specific to your point and Elizabeth's comments Greg, one very clear priority from the investors that we surveyed was a preference for internal investment kind of recognizing our ability to leverage that and generate very high returns. And so, we appreciate that input. We share the view that that's very additive to our business and will clearly be a priority for us.\nOperator: Your final question today comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to dive a little bit deeper into some of the transaction revenue trends you're seeing. Adjusting for storm comps, transaction revenue growth was 4% on an organic constant currency basis in 4Q. Directionally in 2024, how do you expect transaction revenue growth to trend from that 4% normalized for storm comps considering trends like auto rate shopping behavior and the conversion of transaction revenue to subscription revenue? What are some of the puts and takes that gets you higher or lower than 4% transaction revenue growth this year?\nElizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks for the question, George. You're right. The transaction revenue is -- well, first of all it's coming off a full year of very strong transactional growth, double digit I think for the prior four quarters. So we are sort of lapping that period. The biggest driver in that elevated strength a big piece of it was the auto shopping activity that we've talked about before and the weather trends actually being another element of that transactional growth. That was actually offset by some headwinds in our anti-fraud business, as they converted transactional customers to subscription customers. So looking forward, I think we expect those trends to normalize. Again, we're not assuming elevated weather activity. The auto shopping trends will begin to normalize.\nOperator: We thank you for participating on the call today. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

            "name": "Doug Caccese",
            "content": "Sure. Thanks, Elizabeth and thanks, Andrew for the question. Just I'll echo what you had said Elizabeth. As we look at our internal data and also external shopping data we see a slight slowdown in Q4 from the shopping activity. And when you look at it month-over-month you see a slight slowdown from October, November, December. So we are seeing that slowdown happen. We expect that slowdown to continue. But in 2024, we expect still elevated levels of shopping activity. The pivot on this is also that we'll focus on our non-rate action campaigns which actually allow us to go and help carriers bring in premium immediately that's leaking out of the book while they're waiting for rate to earn in so it helps in that way."

            "name": "Elizabeth Mann",
            "content": "Thanks Lee, and good day to everyone on the call. I am pleased to share that Verisk delivered a solid fourth quarter capping off an outstanding 2023. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, fourth quarter revenue was $677 million, up 7.4% versus the prior year, reflecting solid growth in underwriting and more modest growth in claims. Income from continuing operations was $182 million, down 15.5% versus the prior year, while diluted GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.25, down 8.8% versus the prior year. The year-over-year decline in both measures were primarily due to a $19 million litigation reserve expense related to our former Financial Services segment that was previously sold, alongside a one-time tax benefit of $30 million, or $0.19 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022. Additionally, elevated depreciation and amortization expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023, resulting from the completion and implementation of certain large internally developed software projects during the year, also contributed to the decrease. These factors were partially offset by strong revenue growth, lower net interest expense and the benefit from our accelerated share repurchase program. Moving to our organic constant currency results. Adjusted for non-operating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, our operating results demonstrated solid growth for most of our businesses. In the fourth quarter, OCC revenues grew 6% with growth of 7.3% in underwriting, and 2.8% in claims. Normalizing for the $5.6 million in storm-related revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022, total OCC revenue growth would have been 6.9% and claims OCC revenue growth would have been 6.0%. As expected and as we highlighted in prior quarters, some of the environmental trends recorded elevated growth earlier in the year began to normalize in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we did begin to overlap tougher comparisons in many of our businesses. That said, 2023 was a record year for Verisk, with total OCC revenue growth of 8.7%, driven by strong growth of 8.5% in underwriting and 9.3% in claims. Growth for the full year was broad-based with almost all businesses delivering better-than-expected results. Throughout 2023, our increased focus on the Insurance business and our energized organization, capitalized on three key industry and environmental trends to amplify our growth. These trends included, the pricing environment, resulting from the hard insurance market, the high transaction activity, driven by elevated shopping activity for auto insurance and the active US weather patterns that Lee highlighted. Our subscription revenues, which comprise 80% of our total revenue in the quarter, grew 7.3% on an OCC basis during the fourth quarter, with growth in almost all our subscription-based solutions. The drivers of growth we experienced in the quarter were consistent with trends we saw throughout 2023. More specifically during the quarter, we experienced the continued benefit on certain of our revenues from the stronger net premium growth in 2021, which is currently reflected in some of our contract pricing. In anti-fraud, we saw underlying strength in the business with growth augmented by the continued benefit from the conversion to subscription from previously transactional customers through our claims essential bundle. That said, we have started to anniversary the benefit we experienced from these conversions and are expecting the benefit from this transition to continue to moderate in 2024. These strengths were offset in part by continued weakness within Verisk Marketing Solutions and a more normalized level of attrition across the business, including some reduction in the level of contractor activity, due to the weather and some pressure within our Insurtech customer segment. Our transactional revenues, representing 20% of total revenue in the fourth quarter, increased a modest 0.8% on an OCC basis, reflecting a tough comparison versus the prior year, which included revenues associated with Hurricane Ian. Adjusting for the storm impact, transactional revenue growth would have been 4.1%. During the quarter, we continued to see strong results from our auto solutions, driven by healthy consumer shopping activity and the final quarter of benefit from the large nonrate action deal we signed for 2023. We have begun to overlap the positive inflection in shopping behavior from last year and are expecting growth to moderate in 2024. Our transactional revenue growth also benefited from double-digit growth within life insurance solutions, as we are seeing strong customer demand for incremental services. And within our extreme events business, we saw better-than-expected transactional growth driven by securitizations. Moving now to our adjusted EBITDA results. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 6.5% in the fourth quarter, while total adjusted EBITDA, margin which includes both organic and inorganic results was 53.4%, up 70 basis points from the reported results in the prior year. The fourth quarter margin rate reflects the positive impact of sales leverage, cost discipline and foreign currency changes. This was offset in part by margin pressure from higher incentive compensation, acquisitions and organic investments for future growth. 2023 was a year of tremendous growth and efficiency for Verisk as evidenced by total OCC adjusted EBITDA growth of 11.5%, while total adjusted EBITDA margin was 53.5%, up 150 basis points from the prior year. This margin rate reflects core operating leverage from the strong revenue growth and cost discipline across the organization. As Lee discussed earlier, delivering operational efficiency and profitability remains a key priority for us as we move forward into 2024 and beyond. We have confidence we can continue to make further progress, while also balancing investments to support future growth. Continuing down the income statement, net interest expense was $28 million for the fourth quarter compared to $41 million in the prior year. The current level of net interest expense reflects lower year-over-year debt balances as well as higher interest on cash balances. Depreciation and amortization of fixed assets was $68 million for the quarter, an increase of 57%. The increase was primarily driven by an additional $23 million of expense related to the timing of certain large internally developed software projects that were completed and placed into service during the year. On taxes our reported effective tax rate was 24.9% compared to 9.9% in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year increase in the tax rate is related to the one-time tax benefit of $30 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and a $19 million litigation reserve taken in the fourth quarter 2023 that we mentioned earlier. Adjusted net income decreased 9.3% to $204 million and diluted adjusted EPS decreased 2.1% to $1.40 for the fourth quarter. These changes reflect the negative impact from the one-time tax benefit in the prior year quarter and higher depreciation and amortization expenses, partially offset by solid revenue and EBITDA growth lower net interest expense and a lower average share count. The share count reflects the impact of the additional $250 million of share repurchases executed in the fourth quarter as well as the final settlement of our $2.5 billion accelerated share repurchase plan that we entered into in March. From a cash flow perspective, on a reported basis net cash from operating activities increased 1.4% to $252 million, while free cash flow increased 15.8% to $196 million. It is important to note that the prior year cash flow figures still include the results of our previously divested Energy business. So, these growth figures understate the full cash flow growth potential of our Insurance-only business. On dividends and repurchases, during 2023, we returned $3 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends and repurchases. We are pleased to share that the Board has approved a $0.05 or 15% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.39 per share. In addition our Board has also authorized an additional $1 billion in share repurchases, bringing our total authorization to $1.6 billion. On guidance, we are pleased to deliver our expectations for 2024 with growth and margins in line with our Investor Day target and they build upon the exceptional performance we delivered in 2023. More specifically, we expect consolidated revenue for 2024, to be in the range of $2.84 billion to $2.9 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.54 billion to $1.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin in the 54% to 55% range. This margin reflects strong cost discipline, while also funding incremental investment opportunities that we expect to drive future growth. These opportunities include investing in our sales force to drive greater sales effectiveness, expanding internationally through acquisitions and building our capabilities with new advanced technologies including Generative AI. Walking further down the P&L, we expect depreciation and amortization of fixed assets in the range of $210 million to $240 million and amortization of intangibles of approximately $75 million. Both items are subject to the timing of completion of projects and foreign currency changes. We expect our tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%. This all culminates in adjusted earnings, in the range of $6.30 to $6.60 per share. We also expect capital expenditures to be between $240 million and $260 million as we continue to invest organically to drive future growth. A complete list of all guidance measures can be found in the earnings slide deck, which has been posted to the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. And now, I will turn the call back over to Lee, for some closing comments. [Technical Difficulty] takes. But zooming back on the full year, we really think there were three drivers of strength in 2023. The first was the pricing environment in the hard insurance market. The second was the transactional rebound and particularly the activity in the auto shopping space. And the third was the elevated weather activity which as you heard 2023 was a record-breaking year for cat events even though there was a single large hurricane driving it. When we think about making assumptions for a future year, we think in general that first -- that hard insurance market does persist into 2024. But for the other factors for transactional activity, we would expect that to normalize somewhat. And for the weather, we can never forecast mother nature. So we assume a more normalized level of weather activity. Thanks, Andrew and thanks for the feedback on the slide. We're always listening to you guys. On the auto underwriting revenues, it is largely transactional but not 100%. There is some subscription revenues in there. And the shopping activity was \u2013 in Q4, it tapered down from Q3 but it is still elevated relative to historical levels. I think for third-party data that J.D. Power data encapsulates that. I think we are assuming that it will continue tapering down to more historic levels. Even at where it is we're now lapping the benefit of the strong environment. But maybe for more on that environment I'll turn it over to Doug Caccese Yes. On the marketing side as we've called out in the year -- carriers and being challenged and still trying to achieve profitable growth has not yet turned on their marketing spend. We are starting to see that tide turn and some of them are returning to profitability. The marketing engines haven't been turned on quite yet, but you're starting to see green shoots in that environment. I would say we're assuming that it will start to return to more normalized levels in the second half of this year. Yes. Thanks for the question. We are continually focused on efficiency here at Verisk and looking at the next levers that we can pull. We do think in the long-term that being efficient in our core business will enable us to fund some of the investments we've been talking about, all while delivering operating leverage in the business. So, beyond 2024 is a long way out, and we'll come back and give impact on that in future years as we get closer. But that's the general concept of delivering efficiency in order to fund some investments and still have an expansion. Yes. Thanks for the question, Jeff. Yes, you're right. Our range now as a one-year guidance and a 1-point range is a tightening from what we have said at Investor Day, which at that time it was two years out and a 2-point range. And I'll remind you that, that Investor Day range the 54% to 56% itself was a tightening of what had been our three-year margin target, which was a 3-point range of 53% to 56%. So, our trajectory over the past three years has been to increase margins by 150 basis points in 2022, another 150 basis points in 2023. And then, currently the midpoint of this guide would represent another 100 basis points on top of that. So we are balancing that margin expansion and the trajectory of margin expansion with investments in growth. The differential between the current midpoint of our guide and the midpoint at Investor Day is entirely encompassed by the three incremental investments that I highlighted that were not yet in the cards at the time of Investor Day. Those are the investments in our sales force that Lee discussed, the international expansion with our M&A that has taken place since Investor Day, and then the investments in generative AI to drive new products. So, we think we're delivering on all of our client-facing investments those -- the three ones being the ones that are particularly new since Investor Day. We're doing that while still delivering 100 basis points of margin expansion. And so, we think that balance is an attractive package. If you compound this and this margin expansion on top of what we already delivered in 2023, you come out ahead of those targets that we had in March. Yes. This is Elizabeth. Yes, I can comment on that. They continue to be on the path and on the trajectory to achieve that goal. They've achieved strong results in 2023. And the largest change in our growth mix in 2023 versus kind of the algorithm laid out at Investor Day, has been the overperformance of the core businesses. Yes. Thanks for the question, Russell. We'll have to look with you at that stat on free cash flow yield because we think the Insurance business has very strong free cash flow. Again, looking at it maybe as a percent of revenue may understate the strength of it. So, we think it's been growing. I mean, a demonstration of the growth in the Q4 number, which has grown over the prior year, even though the prior year numbers still include the energy business. So we are excited about the free cash flow generation of the business. We don't give guidance on it, but conceptually it should continue to grow roughly in line with our bottom line. And I think the purest demonstration, we can give of that confidence has been the commitment on the dividend increase. Yes. Thanks for the question, Sid. As we highlight there, our capital management philosophy really focuses on our returns on invested capital. We will look to invest in the business. Our CapEx range that we've given you for the year shows the organic investment in the business. On the M&A side, we are active in the market.

            "name": "Lee Shavel",
            "content": "Thank you, Stacey. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in this morning's call. I am pleased to be here today to recap what was an exceptional year for Verisk, marked by strategic, organizational and cultural change matched with outstanding financial performance and value creation for clients and shareholders alike. Elizabeth will provide the financial detail but in summary, we delivered 8.7% organic constant currency revenue growth in 2023, the strongest performance on record since our initial public offering back in 2009. And we exceeded the expectations we set at Investor Day in March. We combine this with double-digit organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth and 150 basis points of margin expansion on an Insurance-only basis, achieving the low end of the initial margin improvement goal of 300 basis points one year earlier than our original target of 2024. And we have plans in place to build on that in 2024 and beyond. Despite the separation of our non-Insurance business, we still grew free cash flow 6% to over $800 million and above our 2022 level on an unadjusted basis. Over the past two years, we demonstrated capital discipline by returning over $4 billion in proceeds from recent dispositions, to shareholders through share repurchases reducing our share base by about 10%. This also served to substantially improve our capital efficiency, and boost our returns on invested capital.  And while our strong 2023 revenue growth was exceptional, the long-term opportunity of addressing our clients' most pressing needs, gives me confidence in our strategy to drive consistent and predictable growth in 2024 and beyond. The insurance industry backdrop in which we are operating, is relatively comparable to 2023. Insurance carriers continue to deal, with cyclical challenges on profitability resulting from higher losses and the lagging effects of inflation, by restricting new business in profit-challenged markets. The most recent AM Best data shows losses for the first nine months of 2023 were $32.2 billion, a further deterioration from the $24.5 billion in net losses recorded through the first six months of the year and tracking way ahead of the pace of losses in 2022. This caused AM Best to downgrade their outlook for the homeowners line from stable to negative, while also maintaining their negative outlook on personal auto. To some extent, profitability challenges in the industry were the result of higher catastrophe-related losses. Our own PCS data, points out that 2023 was the highest year on record for frequency of catastrophe activity, with 74 events. While 2023, did not have a major tropical hurricane make US landfall, wind and severe convective storms were dominant and the major source of events in the year. That said, the fourth quarter of 2023 was a relatively quiet period with only seven events, and was lower than the fourth quarter of 2022, which experienced 13 events. On the more positive end, carriers are having success raising rates and driving premium growth and are taking the very early steps in certain lines to unwind restrictions on writing new business, as they achieve rate adequacy. In fact, net written premium growth increased 10.8% for the first nine months of 2023. More structurally, the insurance industry continues to be challenged by the rapid pace of technological change including, digitalization and cloud migration. This is being compounded by the fact, that the industry also faces technological debt and aging legacy systems. In addition, the industry continues to experience growing regulatory focus on issues of data privacy, fairness and climate risk. Our business model and strategy are designed to address our customers' most pressing needs, both from a cyclical and structural perspective. We invest on behalf of the industry, applying our industry knowledge and technical expertise at scale, to deliver value to our clients at a lower cost of investment and ownership than any one participant can achieve individually. As we work with our clients on a more integrated basis, the opportunities to develop new solutions expands. We are focused on the three key priorities, we articulated back at Investor Day namely, delivering consistent and predictable top line growth, driving operating efficiency and profitability and ensuring disciplined capital allocation. Let me spend a few minutes on how we plan to go after each in 2024 and beyond. Our first priority is delivering consistent and predictable growth, through strategic dialogue with clients in innovation. Throughout 2023, we made substantial progress on our initiative to elevate the strategic dialogue with our clients, and to become their strategic data analytic and technology partner. During the year, I met with over three dozen client CEOs and senior leaders representing over half of the US property and casualty insurance industry direct written premium to discuss how we could better support their objectives. Three primary themes came up repeatedly. How can you accelerate and expand the delivery of data and analytics to our organization? How can Verisk augment the capabilities of our colleagues to improve their ability to manage the amount of information they receive? And finally, how can Verisk help better connect the ecosystems we operate in to improve our efficiency. On the acceleration point, we are intensively addressing this opportunity across our businesses, but perhaps most significantly in our Core Lines Reimagine project to reengineer how we deliver our core data sets and analytics to meet the rapidly evolving ingestion demands of our clients. Prospectively, we see the application of low no-code and micro services technology that we have successfully deployed in the life insurance industry, having material significance to the property and casualty segment and have been working with clients on testing applications. On augmentation, we have already been applying generative AI technology through our Discovery Navigator solution to dramatically accelerate the summarization of large and complex medical files in our casualty business. Prospectively, we have been developing and working with clients to refine several augmented underwriting applications. On connectivity, we have been investing in our Xactware platform to support the integration of more ecosystem and partners. Last week, I attended our Elevate Conference in Salt Lake City, which had record attendance from our insurance contractor, adjuster clients, and over 30 ecosystem partners. Both clients and partners expressed enthusiasm for our delivery of improved connectivity and efficiency, demonstrating the network potential of this business. Finally, on connectivity, we were thrilled at last week's announcement of Marsh's expansion of its digital trading initiative on the Verisk Whitespace platform. This builds on a successful pilot in 2023, which traded over $400 million in premium and is a gratifying endorsement by a world-leading insurance broker that should draw more participation onto a data-first platform that will drive greater efficiency for the market. With expansion across its UK specialty and international placement business, Marsh anticipates that over 90% of all client premium in that segment will flow through the platform by the end of 2024. Our strategic conversations are also helping to drive more informed innovation. In our conversations with clients, we repeatedly hear about the increasing regulatory focus and reporting requirements on fairness and unfair discrimination. To address this need during the fourth quarter, we launched FairCheck, a solution designed to address issues of fairness and discrimination in the underwriting process. FairCheck helps insurers test their personal lines' models and variables to respond to regulatory change and to evaluate and mitigate the potential for unfairly discriminatory outcomes. This solution is an extension of the work we did internally to assess Verisk's own personal auto rating model, to determine whether there were unfair pricing outcomes regarding race. We recently signed a national property and casualty carrier to be our first customer. Internally during 2023, we worked with an outside consultant to sharpen our go-to-market strategy and are implementing the first steps of this changed approach in 2024. This includes an investment behind sales effectiveness, incorporating a change to the composition of incentives to be more in line with industry best practices. In addition, we have identified pricing and packaging opportunities within property estimating solutions and extreme event solutions. And we will be bringing them to market throughout this year. Our second priority from Investor Day is driving operating efficiency and profitability. We remain committed to driving operating efficiency and margin expansion over time. We are leaning into our global talent optimization initiative, tapping into the talent-rich and low-cost markets like Krakow Poland and Hyderabad India. We have recently expanded our real estate footprint in both markets to support our growth. Additionally, we should continue to achieve savings as we modernize and optimize our technology infrastructure across all our legacy systems, including our internal financial and human capital ERP upgrade, which is underway and which should start delivering early efficiency benefits in 2025 with the full impact to be achieved in two to three years. As we look out, we see opportunity in improving our operational efficiency by careful reviews of our workflow and processes. We will continue to deploy our Lean Six Sigma program to drive additional savings and continue to focus on our organizational structure and efficiency. And finally, our third priority is disciplined capital allocation. Disciplined capital allocation underscores all our decision-making at Verisk. We invest our strong free cash flow into value-creating opportunities that support growth with attractive returns. Excess capital is returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In 2023, our return on invested capital was approximately 26% with incremental returns on capital at approximately 19%, as continue to invest our capital at high internal rates of return. We are excited about the many opportunities we have to invest across our business in emerging technologies, including generative AI, low no-code applications and international expansion. We also are investing behind upgrades and re-platforming of our core solutions, some of which have been underinvested and need modernization to support future innovation. The most notable example is our Core Lines Reimagine project. As we highlighted before, we are about one-third of the way through this project from an investment perspective and we are engaging our clients as we plan for customer-facing modules launching in 2024. While there is still much work to be done, we are already driving returns through strong contract renewals with our largest customers, as they recognize the value of the program. We are also investing in modernizing our property estimating solutions platform to advance our strategic goal of creating a more open ecosystem that is resilient, redundant and available for all stakeholders. We are simplifying partner integration and developing new services to enable deeper workflow integration, richer solutions and better client services. This initiative should increase our agility and create a more dynamic work environment for both our clients and our development teams. We are also excited about the opportunities to continue to create incremental value in our insurance related acquisitions. For example, in claims, we are driving growth and synergies in our three recent acquisitions in Germany, where we have a leading market position in the bodily injury space and are adding services and technology offerings in the auto and property spaces through the acquisitions of ACTINEO, Krug and Rocket respectively. These acquisitions enable us to deliver solutions and add value to our German customers across the entire claims life cycle. Before we close, I want to address the recent leadership announcements naming three new business leaders to the Verisk Senior Operating Committee. Rob Newbold was named President, Extreme Events taking over the reins from Bill Churney who retired at the end of the year. And Doug Caccese and Saurabh Khemka, who are recently named Co-Presidents of Underwriting Solutions replacing Neil Spector who has moved into a strategic advisory role. All three leaders are evidence of our deeply talented management bench and focused leadership development and succession planning process. I want to thank both Bill and Neil for their many contributions to Verisk and to me personally as I stepped into the role of CEO. And while we will miss them, they have left their business in the very capable hands of talented, experienced and energized leaders. 2023 was a demonstration of Verisk's evolving culture. We delivered strong financial success, while absorbing organizational and leadership change. And I am excited about having the fresh perspective and energy of these three leaders as we move into 2024. With that, I'll hand it over to Elizabeth to review our financial results. Thanks, Elizabeth. In summary, we're excited about the opportunity that lies ahead. Our motivating purpose is to partner with our clients in building resilience for individuals, communities and businesses globally. The combination of our focused business model, deep customer relationships and strategy to deliver value for clients through improved decision-making and operational efficiency is a formula that will also deliver value to our shareholders through growth and returns. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk, given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. With that, I'll ask the operator, to open the line for questions. Yes. So, thanks. This is Lee. So first let me distinguish I think from a pricing standpoint first, as we indicated in our comments and as Elizabeth just described, the overall premium growth market has continued to be strong as insurers have been able to secure some rate approvals. We think there's more progress in that regard. So I want to differentiate that pricing environment, which has been constructive. And from our perspective that is a partial benefit. It represents approximately 20% to 25% of our revenue base is tied to prior two-year premium growth. And so that provides some level of support. But I think the more meaningful element of our pricing is our ability to deliver value to our clients. We're doing that probably most significantly in the investment that we're making in our Core Lines Reimagine project, where early renewals from clients that have seen what we are doing, what we are creating, how we are improving, their experience, their efficiency has demonstrated that value. And we have been able to realize stronger pricing momentum than we had originally anticipated which we feel good about as we continue to deliver more functionality through that platform. And I would say, further I think we through the go-to-market review that we have done, we have identified some areas to identify how we can capture more value that we are delivering to our clients from pricing structures that align to identifying and identifying that value that we're creating for our clients. Sure. Thank you, Brendan. And I'm going to repeat the question because you came through a little choppy there. So I think the question was how do we feel about a new product pipeline areas of investment? And so I would say, we're really excited about a number of the new products and developments that we are -- that we have been working on. In particular, I think, certainly a lot of the focus has been around generative AI and its application. And we've been exploring its application across a variety of our businesses. I'm going to isolate for a second on our claims business where we have deployed some generative AI, applications and are also looking at developing other applications. I'm going to ask my colleague Maroun Mourad to talk a little bit about what we're doing in that area as an example of what we have been looking to do more broadly. And I'd add to that, Brendan. I want to give you a taste of what we're doing on that front. But as many of you know, we've been really thrilled about the success that we've had with our fast businesses application of low and no-code technology to the Life Insurance business. We believe and have begun to engage with clients on how that can be potentially applied to the P&C area. So I think that's a broad opportunity. And then we also as a more insurance-focused entity have been able to try to integrate more of our data sets in our extreme events business and our specialty business solutions area, tying together some of the functions in the excess and specialty market and the reinsurance markets as well as tying together some of our claims data and our underwriting data. And so as we have now fully migrated to the cloud, our ability to facilitate those types of integrations are particularly attractive. So a lot of the great stuff that we have underway that should support future growth for the company. Sure, Jeff. It's a complex question, and so I think we're trying to get our handle on it. I'm going to kind of isolate on as we see premium adequacy improve and the procyclicality dimension of the business. I should probably start by saying, or by saying, as I think many of our investors and analysts understand we don't have a high degree of economic sensitivity. And so, there is muted sensitivity to cyclical effects. We tend to be more influenced as you've observed by weather events or activities in the ILS market and so those tend to have a more pronounced element to it. I do think that, there is some procyclicality elements that as the business -- as the insurance industry is doing well and we've seen premium growth that, that does encourage more investment in technology and renovation that accelerates our ability to deploy some of the technologies that we have invested in. And that is a positive tailwind in that scenario. However, I want to isolate that to insurance cyclicality. So that as their profitability grows and that may be separate and unconnected to just broader economic cyclicality, which is relatively muted. So hopefully that, I think, addresses kind of the core of your question, Jeff. Yeah. Thank you, Andrew. I'm going to answer your question in a way that I think gives you some insight in terms of where we see value creation opportunity. I think first off, all of our businesses are clearly generating strong organic growth delivering value to the industry. They're at different scale levels. And so I'll reiterate that, for instance, in our forms rules and loss cost area where we focused our core lines reimagine area that's a broad area where we are creating value. And I'm going to ask Saurabh Khemka who leads that effort in that business to talk a bit about how we're creating value there. It's probably our most scaled opportunity where we can find incremental value and capture that value. Underneath the businesses as a whole and this will hearken back to Investor Day, we see opportunities to build network value. We've talked about it within the themes ecosystem where we're adding partners, which creates value for all of our market participants but particularly our insurance clients. And I'll also note that with our specialty business solutions, while 3% of our total 2023 revenue contribution represents connectivity and a network impact particularly with the Marsh announcement that allows us to build value in that network expansion. And I think that holds true in a variety of areas, property estimating solutions in forms rules and loss costs. But let me give Saurabh an opportunity to talk a little bit about where we are adding value to our clients in a variety of ways with the core lines reimagine project. And I'll cap it off by saying another dimension of incremental growth is the ability to move some of our traditional products into more of a SaaS type of environment. And there in our extreme events business, the migration to more of a SaaS model, we believe opens up opportunity to deliver more value to that segment of our clients as well. But thanks for the question. Yes. Thank you, Surinder. So there are a number of elements and I really have to complement the organization for its receptivity, to outside perspectives, on what we could be doing better. We looked at it across all of our businesses. And certainly, compensation structure was an area of focus. And there, I think we -- there were two things. One, we looked at where market levels were both from a level and from a composition standpoint, so that our sales team felt as though they were being fairly treated, create a good opportunity and aligning our interest with the customer. And we believe that that will improve our retention and make certain that they are focused on the opportunities that generate the most value for us. We also spent time looking at pricing, relative to value and where we feel as though we're delivering demonstrable value to our clients, and how we can be more responsive to structuring our pricing in a way that aligns, with our clients' perception of value and what their needs are. So, I would just identify those as two of the primary functions. I would add, somewhat outside of this, we have also been working to make certain that our sales effort is well tied into our senior-level strategic dialogue, so that as we have driven a stronger level of dialogue, we are communicating effectively internally to capitalize on opportunities for sales on existing products that our clients may not be aware of, or we find higher support because of the value proposition at a senior level within the organization. And so, that's an area where we expect that we'll be able to do a better job as well. Yes. And Russell the one thing I would add is I think that if you start with free cash flow given accounting differences over time should even out. And so it should approximate our overall EBITDA growth rate assuming that the CapEx is growing commensurate with that. I do think in 2024, we're seeing slightly higher CapEx growth, because of what we see as a number of opportunities within the business. Part of that relates to the generative AI opportunity. And so we may have periods of higher level of CapEx investment that may bring the overall free cash flow growth down. But over the long-term we see that very -- should be very commensurate with our overall adjusted EBITDA growth. Yes. Seth, thanks for the question. It's difficult to kind of isolate it, because it occurs across our business. I would say that certainly that those pricing improvements that I've referred to in terms of new contract renewals are factored into our 2024 guidance from an overall revenue growth perspective. So, in that regard, we're beginning to see some of that influence that our near-term expectations. But I do believe that it is a source of growth for us longer-term. And it's not a really very different than what we described as our general operating model, which is that we believe that we can create much broader value for the industry, by investing in this data and technology and capturing that particularly as we add value to our existing clients is largely value-driven pricing. And so that supports the -- that longer-term 6% to 8% growth target that we are working to achieve on a predictable and consistent basis. And Greg, one thing that I would add and I want to thank all of our investors who participated in the year-end investor survey that was conducted. We thought it was important to get feedback after the first three quarters and following Investor Day. And specific to your point and Elizabeth's comments Greg, one very clear priority from the investors that we surveyed was a preference for internal investment kind of recognizing our ability to leverage that and generate very high returns. And so, we appreciate that input. We share the view that that's very additive to our business and will clearly be a priority for us."

Currently, all participants are in listen-only mode. After today's prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, where we will limit participants to one question so that we can allow everyone to ask a question. We will have further instructions for you at that time. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.\nStacey Brodbar: Thank you, Sheryl, and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our third quarter 2023 financial results. On the call today are Lee Shavel, Verisk's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Elizabeth Mann, Chief Financial Officer. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as our traditional quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. As set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance, including those related to our financial guidance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Finally, I'd also like to remind everyone that the financial results for recent dispositions are included in our consolidated and GAAP results but are excluded from all organic constant currency growth figures. A reconciliation of reported and historic non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call is provided in our 8-K and today's earnings presentation posted on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. However, we are not able to provide a reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable expected GAAP results because of the unreasonably high effort and unpredictability of estimating certain items that are excluded from projected non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, including, for example, tax consequences, acquisition-related costs, gains and loss from dispositions and other non-recurring expenses, the effect of which may be significant. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Lee Shavel.\nLee Shavel: Good morning, and thank you for participating in our third quarter earnings call. I am pleased to be here today to update you on the progress our team at Verisk is making on driving strategy and translating it into strong growth and value creation for our clients and shareholders alike. Elizabeth will provide the financial detail. But in summary, we delivered another strong quarter of results marked by solid organic revenue growth across most of our businesses, healthy margin expansion, and double-digit profit growth. We have confidence in our ability to deliver on both our 2023 guidance and the longer-term objectives we communicated back in March at Investor Day. The industry environment within which we are operating is marked by some deep challenges. Insurance carriers are dealing with the cross currents of inflation and higher losses, which are both negatively impacting industry profitability. In fact, A.M. Best data for the first six months of 2023 points to a $24.5 billion net underwriting loss for the U.S. Property and Casualty Insurance industry, running well ahead of the pace of the full-year 2022, which experienced net underwriting losses of $26.9 billion. A.M. Best notes that personal lines specifically homeowners is the primary driver of these declines. In reaction to this backdrop, carriers are exiting markets in key catastrophe prone states, dropping certain lines of unprofitable business and laying off portions of their workforce. Carriers are also raising rates to attempt to cover rising inflation and losses, driving net written premium growth up 9.7% for the first six months of 2023. In response to this environment, Verisk is partnering closely with our clients to address their most pressing concerns, including high value solutions that can deliver high return on investment for our clients. And we are including our clients earlier in the innovation process to ensure we are delivering the right solutions with simple implementations, improving the success rate and pace of uptake of new solutions. One of the key tenets of our strategy is to elevate the strategic dialogue with our clients and to become their trusted data and analytic and technology partner. During the third quarter, we engaged with clients on several occasions and at a variety of venues including the Verisk Insurance Conference in London. This year, we've combined several Verisk events to make it easier for clients to explore the many ways we can add value and increase the efficiency of their operations. In London, for example, we combined events focused on underwriting, claims, specialty insurance and extreme event modeling into a singular client-centric experience featuring Verisk solutions. I delivered one of two keynote presentations and the entire Verisk Senior Operating Committee was in attendance demonstrating our commitment to our customers at all levels. A solutions gallery featured Verisk solutions as well as the solutions of our ecosystem partners, and we held 35 concurrent educational sessions. We wrapped up with a CEO dinner with attendees that represented carriers, brokers, and managing general agents had a group discussion around common challenges faced by the entire insurance value chain. Enterprise-wide risk management is top of mind for many in London, as our clients are managing extremely large and complex portfolios of risk spanning multiple classes of business and insurance markets all over the world. To address this pressing need, we recently introduced Enterprise Exposure Manager. This solution is a joint development effort between specialty business solutions and extreme events to bring to the market a cloud-native and scalable solution that enables insurers and reinsurers to make more informed business decisions by offering a comprehensive view of risks that exist across large property portfolios. As we engage with our customers at these events and in the many one-on-one meetings we have hosted throughout the year, there were a few consistent themes that we hear in these conversations. First is Digital Transformation, which represents a massive opportunity for the global insurance market. Our clients aspire to modernize their platforms, improve systems integrations, lower expenses, and improve operational efficiency, and we are partnering with them on this journey. Verisk is introducing solutions that drive operational efficiency for some of their most people and paper intensive processes. For example, within our casualty business, we recently launched Discovery Navigator and are seeing solid early success. Discovery Navigator combines artificial intelligence and machine learning, Verisk's contributory data and years of clinical and legal expertise to immediately identify and extract key medical data points from unstructured records, which are part of bodily injury claims. Depending on the complexity of the case, the number of medical pages involved in a bodily injury claim can range from hundreds to thousands. Verisk has automated the organization, review, and summary, of these complex unstructured documents, allowing insurers to adjust, negotiate, and settle more claims in less time. Discovery Navigator easily integrates into our customers workflows through API or online options and delivers up to a 90% time savings and 95% accuracy for an average 10x ROI for clients. Additionally, Discovery Navigator is a widely versatile tool that is driving innovation and can be used in combination with other Verisk solutions like Liability Navigator, delivering workflow automation, decision support and overall efficiency for clients. The need for deeper data insights is also something we hear regularly from customers. Inflation trends during the past year have underscored the need for accurate, up-to-date and granular data insights to inform underwriting, risk management, reinsurance and claims decisions. No company is better positioned to meet this need than Verisk with our comprehensive and proprietary data assets. For example, our Verisk property estimating solutions are designed to meet these challenges head on with a comprehensive set of tools based on timely proprietary data, enabling our customers to write the most accurate estimates possible on their first attempt. This reduces the risk of over and underpayments while improving cycle times. Key to this process is XactXpert, our recently introduced rules engine that assists estimators in avoiding unwarranted costs in their estimates. We also enable our customer's quality assurance teams that evaluate the data from the entire process, ensuring that the claim payment will be correct the first time. Finally, generative AI remains a frequent topic with clients both its transformative potential and the risk that it brings. We believe gen AI can deliver efficiency within Verisk and in client-facing solutions starting first in our underwriting and life businesses where we are actively exploring new product development as well as enhancements to existing solutions. We are increasing our investment and leaning into generative AI as our clients recognize that by partnering with Verisk, they can invest in this -- we can invest in this advanced technology on behalf of the industry more efficiently than any one customer can do on their own. We also intend to do so while maintaining our focus on fairness and value-centric governance. On the theme of investment, I want to provide a progress report and update on our core lines reimagine project. We are about one-third of the way complete in what is likely a five-year journey to modernize our forms, rules, and loss costs and related solutions. We've made progress modernizing our internal processes like our ratemaking operation to enable and efficiently scale innovations in current and new solutions. We are expanding our industry-leading contributory database by adding new data contributors and by increasing the quality of our collected data. And we are working on enhancing the recency of our data in our analytics. On the customer-facing side, we are in-market with new proprietary analytics and workflow tools. For example, we have launched executive and client insight reports designed for the senior leadership of our clients across two of the largest lines of insurance, namely homeowners and business owners with plans to expand into other large lines over time. Just this month, we also launched our Legislative Monitoring application in the new platform for select clients. This new cloud-native application transforms what was previously a document based paper trail for tracking thousands of insurance related, legal, regulatory and legislative developments into a data driven, modern, digital monitoring and efficiency tool with an improved customer interface. Legislative Monitoring is the first of a series of new features that will be launched over the next several years on the platform. Overall, customer feedback on the reimagine project has been quite positive, including on the custom analytics and Legislative Monitoring application I mentioned before, and there is excitement for future advances within core lines. This excitement is driving more constructive, value driven conversations with our clients as we partner with them along their digital transformation journey. We are making these investments to deliver increased value for our clients through enhanced underwriting accuracy and efficiency. With that, I'll hand it over to Elizabeth to review our financial results.\nElizabeth Mann: Thanks, Lee, and good day to everyone on the call. I am pleased to share that Verisk delivered strong third quarter financial results. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue was $678 million, up 11% versus the prior year, and income from continuing operations was $187 million, up 13% versus the prior year, reflecting strong growth across both underwriting and claims. Diluted GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.29, up 23% versus the prior year. This quarter's reported results included a $19 million litigation reserve expense associated with an indemnification for an ongoing inquiry related to our former Financial Services segment, which was sold in April 2022. Moving to our organic constant currency results adjusted for non-operating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, our operating results demonstrated strong and broad-based growth from most of our businesses, aided by some in-period transactional benefits. In the third quarter, OCC revenues grew 9.4%, with growth of 8.3% in underwriting and 12.2% in claims. Our subscription revenues, which comprised 80% of our total revenue in the quarter, grew 9.3% on an OCC basis, with growth in almost all our subscription-based solutions. More specifically on the drivers of growth in subscription revenues during the quarter, we experienced the continued benefit on certain of our revenues from the stronger net premium growth in 2021, which is currently reflected in some of our contract pricing as well as a lower level of attrition and consolidation across the industry. Within property estimating solutions, our efforts to expand the ecosystem and drive new innovations like XactXpert are paying dividends through higher levels of customer retention for our contractor customers. In anti-fraud, we saw underlying strength in the business with growth augmented by the continued benefit from the conversion to subscription from previously transactional customers through our claims essentials bundle. And finally, within extreme events solutions, we are benefiting from strong renewals and new customer wins. Our transactional revenues representing 20% of total revenue in the third quarter grew 10.2% on an OCC basis. The largest contributor to growth was again from our auto solutions, driven by better than expected shopping activity by consumers and the continued benefit from the large non-rate action deal with a national insurer that we previously communicated. Our trends track consistently with the recent J.D. Power data, which pointed to a 12% increase in shopping activity for auto insurance in the third quarter as customers continue to respond to rate increases. That said we will begin to anniversary the elevated shopping activity in the fourth quarter, so we are expecting that growth to moderate. In addition to gains in auto, our transactional revenue growth also benefited from double-digit growth from life insurance solutions as we are seeing strong customer demand for incremental services. And within our property estimating solutions business, we saw strong transactional growth generated by our expanded set of distribution partners within our ecosystem and from elevated weather events, although not to the level of a large scale catastrophe. In fact, according to Verisk's PCS data, the third quarter of 2023 had 73 days out of 92 that included a PCS event in the U.S. And 2023 is on track to become a new high for catastrophe frequency likely to bypass 2021, which was the highest year on record to-date. Moving now to our adjusted EBITDA results. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 11.8% in the third quarter, while total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results was 54%, up 70 basis points from the reported results in the prior year. This margin rate reflects core operating leverage from the strong revenue growth and cost discipline across the organization. As we've said in the past, the margin rate in any given quarter can be influenced by revenue mix and timing of spending. So we think it's best to look at our margins on a trailing 12-month basis, which in the third quarter were 53.3%, up 150 basis points over last year's level. Continuing down the income statement, net interest expense was $29 million for the third quarter, compared to $34 million in the prior year. The current level of net interest expense reflects lower year-over-year debt balances as we paid down our revolving credit facility as well as higher interest on cash balances. Our reported effective tax rate was 25% compared to 24.2% in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year change in the tax rate is related to the $19 million litigation reserve expense that we mentioned earlier, partially offset by higher stock compensation benefits in this quarter versus the prior year's period. Going forward, we expect the tax rate for the full-year 2023 to be near the high end of the originally guided range of 23% to 25%. Adjusted net income increased 17% to $221 million, and diluted adjusted EPS increased 27% to $1.52 for the third quarter 2023. These changes reflect organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions, and a lower average share count. The share count reflects the impact of our $2.5 billion accelerated share repurchase plan that we entered into in March, as well as an additional $50 million worth of share repurchase that we completed in the third quarter. Regarding the share count, you can see that while our weighted average diluted shares outstanding declined 7.7% year-over-year, it was essentially flat sequentially. From a cash flow perspective, on a reported basis, net cash from operating activities decreased 11% to $250 million, while free cash declined 9% to $196 million. The decline in both cash flow metrics is a function of the fact that prior year cash flow metrics include the results from previously divested businesses as well as a favorable cash tax impact in the prior year from the sale of our environmental, health and safety business. Adjusted for these items, both cash flow metrics increased year-over-year during the third quarter. We are very pleased with robust year-to-date performance. Our guidance for 2023 remains unchanged. We now expect revenue to be towards the high end of our range of $2.63 billion to $2.66 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is still expected to be between $1.39 billion to $1.43 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the 53% to 54% range and adjusted EPS in the range of $5.50 to $5.70. A complete listing of all guidance measures can be found in the earnings slide deck, which has been posted to the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. We do want to remind you that the fourth quarter of 2022 included $6 million in revenue associated with Hurricane Ian as well as a tax benefit associated with the divestiture of Wood Mackenzie. And now, I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments.\nLee Shavel: Thanks, Elizabeth. In summary, we are excited about our business momentum and the opportunity ahead. Our motivating purpose is to partner with our clients in building resilience for individuals, communities, and businesses globally. The combination of our focused business model, deep customer relationships, and strategy to deliver value for clients through improved decision making and operational efficiency is a formula that will also deliver value to our shareholders through growth and returns. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk, given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing with insurance marketing budgets, especially in the current rate and inflation environment and if you're seeing any sort of a pullback from insurance carriers?\nLee Shavel: Yes. Thank you, George. I appreciate the question. So the short answer is yes. I think the dynamic that we're observing is that because of the loss environment and the frustrations that the insurers or the carriers generally have had in getting rate increases to compensate them for the increased risk and the increased replacement costs driven by replacement. Right now they are focused on achieving profitability off of their existing books and that has resulted in a lower level of advertising by the carriers as they are kind of working with their existing book. We have seen, as Elizabeth described, a lot of shopping activity, but that is consumer driven and is a response to the higher rates that almost everyone is experiencing right now. The consequences of that for us is that in our Verisk marketing solutions business, we have seen declines within that business because of lower overall advertising spend by the carriers as a function of this environment.\nStacey Brodbar: Next question, please.\nOperator: Line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays Capital. Your line is now open.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. I guess I'll just ask the question around the guidance that was maintained. I mean, this quarter came in, I think above at least our expectations and probably yours. Correct me if I'm wrong there, but if the subscription growth stays steady like it usually does, are you implying that the transaction piece could see some material declines? Just would love any help with just trying to bridge that.\nElizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks very much, Manav. On the guidance, we're very proud of our results year-to-date. We've given full-year guidance in order to bring additional transparency and for folks to see how the business is going. We did update that mid-year after seeing significant shifts in the environment. But our full-year guidance does imply revenue growth of approximately 8% to 9% on a reported basis that's above our long-term targets. As we look at the fourth quarter, no specific comments on the fourth quarter other than what I highlighted, which is to remind that the growth comparisons do get tougher in the fourth quarter due to the storm revenue and the tax benefit there.\nOperator: Line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is now open.\nAlex Kramm: Yes. Hey, good morning, everyone. Just Lee, you keep on talking about the strategic dialogue you have with customers at a high level. It sounds like some of this stuff is resonating. I guess I'm curious, are you actually measuring success in any way yet or is this too early? I mean, should we be looking for larger, I don't know, outsourcing deals or maybe again specifically like any revenues that you're tracking that you can already talk about?\nLee Shavel: Thank you, Alex. I'm happy to address that. I think we have seen a clear benefit in a variety of areas. So one and first is that engaging at that strategic dialogue and I probably have had over a dozen client CEO meetings and one thing that we focus on in that is understanding their broader enterprise challenges within this environment. And there's also a focus on what is Verisk doing for us and where are their areas that we are helping others that we can help them. And specifically, in a number of those conversations, we've identified products -- existing products that we have that can be particularly helpful in this environment. And I would say are what we have done to help carriers analyze their existing rate adequacy and where there may be opportunities to improve their rates in their auto book or in other parts of their business. And that's opened up some channels that before where our bottoms up approach may have run into an obstacle within the organization. But when given the opportunity to describe the strategic benefit, the financial benefit, we're getting more top down support. And I've seen that take place in a number of clients. So I think that's one. The second is in understanding areas, emerging areas where they are facing either challenges or interest in new technologies, an opportunity to guide what we are doing in some of our projects like core lines, reimagine, what we're doing in generative AI, to tailor them to what we know has strategic resonance for those clients has been helpful. And so I think as we have been investing in a number of generative AI applications that has been specifically helped by getting insight and buy in from those levels. I had one dinner with the CEO said, look, Lee, we could spend tens of millions of dollars on generative AI, and I'm not sure what we'll be able to generate out of it. But if you can develop a pilot and we can benefit from that. We would be happy to test that pilot as soon as you have it ready. And I think that's a great example of where we're able to substantiate that strategic dialogue and translate it into targeted product development at a faster rate than we would have before. I think those are certainly benefits that we'll hope to begin to deliver additional growth for us in 2024 supporting our core business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James. Your line is now open, Greg.\nGreg Peters: Great. Good morning, everyone. I will focus my question on Slide 6 of your investor deck where you breakout subscription and non-subscription growth. And I guess I'm going to come at the non-subscription piece where you callout auto underwriting, property estimating, and life insurance. And clearly, you're doing really well this year. But we're also dealing with some really unusual profitability challenges inside auto and property. Would you expect that the non-subscription organic growth rate would inversely correlate with sort of the underwriting cycle for your carrier partners, or am I missing something?\nElizabeth Mann: Well, let me thanks -- thanks for the question, Greg. Let me take a crack at that. I think it's a little bit hard to draw that conclusion. The transactional revenue is a combination of a couple of different areas. We've highlighted the main ones that contributed to the growth. The auto underwriting, the shopping activity has driven that, the property estimating solutions has a transactional component related to weather activity and then life on the incremental services. So I'm not sure I would point it directly to an inverse correlation to the underwriting environment.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. Your line is now open, Andrew.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Thank you. Good morning. Appreciate you taking the question. Elizabeth, could you give us an update on the state of two markets? One, Florida, just an update on liquidations, and how that's impacting your outlook for the fourth quarter. And also California, I know there's been I think Lee referred to in your prepared remarks, some disruption in, especially homeowners, underwriting in California and some challenges that carriers are facing raising rates. Just wondering if there are any updates in either of those areas as it pertains to the guidance and maybe the longer-term outlook too.\nLee Shavel: Yes. Hey, Andrew, this is Lee. I know you directed that to Elizabeth, but we have Neil Spector who runs our underwriting business for us, and I think he's been closest to that. So let me give him an opportunity to give you a read from what we're seeing in those markets.\nNeil Spector: Sure. Thanks. Well, first, I'm sure you've seen the news that several large national carriers have kind of withdrawn writing new business in both those markets due to the challenges. However, in Florida specifically, we haven't seen any additional liquidations and there's been no reduction in the ratings of the carriers that are there. So there's still availability in that market of carriers. And you may have seen recently a press release we put out in the last quarter showing how citizens, which is the state run insurer is leveraging some of our aerial imagery data to help with evaluation of properties in Florida. So that's really stable as far as between the last time we reported. And now California, there's certainly challenges both in the amount of time it takes to get rates approved and also in what tools you're allowed to use in Florida as far as pricing goes and those continue although the regulators in California are seriously looking at the potential to use more tools in the future to help with challenges like wildfire.\nLee Shavel: And I would add to that, Andrew, and I think that gives a great kind of current sense of where things are. Neil and I were in Washington, D.C. last week meeting with a number of the trade associations just to understand how we can be helpful to the industry from a data perspective. And one thing that was very clear is that the Florida and California are both very engaged with the industry to understand what steps could be taken to improve the health of those markets. I think they understand the risk and the challenges. They obviously face some political pressure, but we've been encouraged by their openness to discussing how they can improve the market dynamic for the carriers within each of those markets. And that's an intense level of dialogue that could ameliorate some of kind of the early pressures that we saw.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. You may now go ahead.\nJeff Meuler: Yes. Thanks. I'd imagine we're at the time of year where you're starting to send invoices on 2024 pricing. So can you just talk through how you're thinking about it relative to the historical context, just given the cross currents of still elevated inflation, but maybe it's coming down the P&C insurance, industry profitability challenges and then just not sure how things like core lines play into that pricing realization versus discrete upsell. Thank you.\nElizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks, Jeff, for the question. Obviously, we're looking at it. It's still early in the cycle, and I'm not in a position to quote any numbers or any thoughts on 2024. The data on 2022, while it's still being finalized, it does show net written premium growth still in an elevated level around the eight -- slightly north of 8% that has tapered from the 2021 growth, but still relatively high on a historical basis. I think Lee pointed to both that environment, but also the fact that it is a function of the challenges and the desire to move towards profitability that our carriers, our customers are seeing. And so we are balancing those two things as we go into the rate -- the pricing cycle for next year.\nLee Shavel: I think those are the two core elements. One, the impact of premium growth, which as we indicated, remains strong, as well as the value that we are creating, particularly in core lines where we've increased the number of data sets, we've increased the ability of our clients to utilize that data. And so we certainly look to capture the value that we're creating for our clients there and all of those factor into our pricing considerations.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Russell Quelch with Redburn. Your line is now open.\nLee Shavel: Russell, are you there?\nOperator: Russell, your line is now open.\nLee Shavel: Moving to the next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. You may now go ahead.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you. Lee, I was hoping you could talk about the M&A pipeline. Any areas of particular interest, maybe technology, just given you highlighted the digital transformation theme earlier. Just wanted to ask about sort of how -- what would be interesting and how you're seeing levels of assets right now. Thanks.\nLee Shavel: Thanks, Toni. So the first thing that I would say is, hopefully is as evident by kind of what we have been doing has been a primary focus on our internal operations and what we can accomplish with the core business. And we're particularly focused on the growth objectives that we've set, the margin objectives that we've set. And we feel it's important coming after -- coming off of Investor Day that we are focused on demonstrating what the core franchise is able to deliver. So in that regard, we are not looking at any substantial large acquisitions that would be transformative. We obviously are entirely focused on insurance right now. And so that's the orientation. We do maintain active engagement on smaller mid-size opportunities; generally sub $100 million, where we feel there may be a high quality product that has gotten initial traction with the industry and where we can add substantial value by accelerating its adoption. In many cases, our clients feel more comfortable adopting a product when they know that they have the strength and the stability and our capabilities behind it, or we can enhance that product by improving the data set, improving the efficiency or the technology that's driving it. And we've had success with that in a number of areas, probably most notably our acquisition of FAST on the life side, which has been a textbook case of where we can add value in those areas. We continue to be excited about the marketing opportunity, even though as we mentioned in our earlier comments, the advertising environment has been a headwind for that. But we see broader appetite for those and we'll look to across all of our businesses to see where there might be a technology or a product or a data set that is relevant. So I wouldn't say that there is anything in particular, we really are aware of it across all of our businesses, and we want to make certain that we don't miss an opportunity to enhance one of our businesses if there is something that is truly additive.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi, Elizabeth, you pointed to the high end of the 2023 guidance range now being expected. Was that just for revenues or for other figures as well? And then, when I look at the high end for the 2023 revenue guide, I get an implied revenue growth for the fourth quarter of plus 4%, of course, that would be as reported. Could you help us with the counterpart the OCC revenue growth implied in the fourth quarter?\nElizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks for the question, Andrew. That comment about the high end was specific and confined to revenues and did not apply to the other line items. And I'm not here to comment on the fourth quarter in specific, other than the points I made about the year-over-year comps.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nJeff Silber: Thanks so much. I'm going to ask a question about 2024, but not a numbers question. I'm just curious, compared to a year ago, what areas of your business are you feeling more confident about it as we head into the next year? And conversely, what areas might be a bit more concerning for you than they were a year ago? Thanks.\nLee Shavel: Thank you, Jeff. It's an interesting question, and I would start off by saying that first, at a high level, I feel as though the strategic engagement that we've had has created broader opportunities for us to advance in a number of businesses by more effectively communicating the value to their enterprises. So I think that's certainly something that we feel strongly about. We -- in addition, feel confident about the core lines reimagine investment that we have made and our ability to deliver greater value to our clients over the next several years and to participate in that. I think that we are also seeing in the property market and the focus around profitability and opportunity to serve our clients more broadly. I think the other thing that we would look at this year that we have benefited from is some higher level of transactional activity, particularly in the auto side with high levels of shopping that have contributed to our growth rate that may not be sustained into 2024. Similarly, on the property side, some higher levels of activity there that have contributed to strong growth. I think overall, we're really pleased with the growth that we generated in 2023. We had some tailwinds. We aren't providing guidance on 2024 at this point. We have to step back and assess where we are, and we'll do that in the first quarter. But I think strategically and from a -- from an investment standpoint, we're excited about where we're investing core lines, generative AI, investments that we're making in broadening our ecosystem and integrating other partners that add value to our customers. And we'll continue to work to offset and mitigate any of the transactional benefits that we've had in 2023.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to ask a modeling one, not specific to fourth quarter 2023 necessarily. Just wanted to ask the last half decade has been a little bit of a crazy one. I think that's speaking to it lightly, a lot of moving parts where the business sits today. Is there any -- how would you kind of describe the seasonality of transaction revenue? Is there a --if we're talking about 2025/2026, is there like a typical cadence that we should expect on the non-subscription line given the makeup of the underlying businesses that comprise that? Thank you.\nElizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks for the question, Andrew. The biggest component of the transaction revenue that has some seasonality to it, there's two that come to mind. One is the weather, the weather-related seasonality in property estimating solutions that on a long-term historical basis tends to occasionally get a boost in the third quarter as a function of Atlantic hurricanes last year in 2022 that happened to hit in October and fell in the fourth quarter. The other element that you saw last quarter, the securitization market can sometimes that hits in the second quarter primarily. That's a relatively small part in our business. The other elements of transactional revenue don't necessarily have a seasonal pattern to them, the life insurance services, the auto, underwriting product is more a function of their own markets.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nHeather Balsky: Hey, thank you for taking my question. I was hoping you could update us on your expense program where you are today. Are there any other areas that you're identifying in terms of opportunity as we move forward? Thanks.\nElizabeth Mann: Yes, Heather, thanks for the question. Our expense program, as we highlighted in the past, I think we said sort of over 90% of the benefit is experienced in 2023. So I think of those original set of actions, we think they've largely been action that are expressing themselves in the margin expansion that you're seeing today. There is continued focus on cost efficiency at Verisk. And so we're looking in the future for opportunities based on our global talent outsourcing program and based well on investments in internal efficiency that will play out over time like the ERP program that we've talked about.\nLee Shavel: Yes. And Heather, I would say, look, we're very focused on the margin objectives that we set at Investor Day and I think we had a very good start and what we have delivered and have been realizing the benefits of that. But it's a continuous process for us and we're always going to look for where we can achieve greater efficiencies throughout the business. Elizabeth mentioned several, but as we have been able to make the business a more integrated business focused on insurance, I think we've identified some areas where we can improve both effectiveness and efficiency in the organization and we'll expect to be pursuing those in 2024 to continue that momentum.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weber with Wells Fargo Securities. Seth, your line is open.\nSeth Weber: Thanks. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. I was interested in your comment in the prepared remarks about incremental business on the life side. I'm wondering if you could just unpack that a little bit and talk about customer appetite for more cross-selling and taking more solutions here in this environment. Thank you.\nLee Shavel: Yes. So, Seth, thank you for the question. And I'm going to ask Neil to talk about where we see incremental opportunities within the life space. I think it's not only clients, but also thinking about kind of the nature of their technology, that low-code, no-code approach and its applicability more broadly here in the industry.\nNeil Spector: Yes. Thanks, Lee. So our solution in life is a low-code, no-code software platform that helps a life insurer from the policy administration distribution claims from a full lifecycle. And what we've seen is even in the current environment, there is a huge need in the life industry to modernize technology. They're behind P&C as far as modernization of systems. And as Lee pointed out, because our system is a low-code, no-code, we have the opportunity to potentially lower the operating costs of deployed lines of business on our platform pretty substantially versus legacy solutions. So there's a strong incentive for life insurers to move on to these more flexible and lower cost operating environments. We've also seen a huge need from our customers in support of their transformation and that has driven some of our service or transactional revenue for our existing customers because of their desire to have us support their implementation efforts.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nSurinder Thind: Thank you. Lee, could you please discuss maybe the performance in the international business, maybe what's driving growth there and how that kind of differs from the U.S. and maybe even some product plans or how you expect to kind of further offering out there.\nLee Shavel: Yes. Thank you, Surinder. I'm going to appreciate that. We've been pleased with the international growth rates across the organization. I would put them into three categories. We first have our specialty business solutions, which is predominantly London-based addressing the Lloyd's or the excess and surplus market there. They continued to have success in delivering workflow and automation efficiencies through the software platform that they are -- have built and are integrating other components to. We think that's delivers a lot of value to the participants in that market, so that's been additive to our overall growth rate. On the underwriting side, we have a life, health, and travel business that has performed well, particularly coming off of the resurgence of global travel post the pandemic. Since then, it's kind of normalized, but we continue to see opportunities for that to grow. And I'm going to actually turn to Maroun Mourad, who has had several businesses internationally on the claim side to give you a sense of our experience there as well.\nMaroun Mourad: Thank you, Lee. Thank you, Surinder for the question. As I may have mentioned in previous calls, we had made a decision within the international claims business to reorganize the units splitting the UK and Europe about a year ago to drive more focus and growth. And that approach and the execution of the strategy has paid dividend. I'll talk about the UK first, which is growing with speed and focus under the leadership of Chris Sawford and his team innovating on existing property, bodily injury and auto, or motor as we call it across upon solutions. And more recently, there's been a focus on the anti-fraud space within the UK. On the European side, under the leadership of Samer Abou-Jaoud\u00e9 and his team, we had entered the bodily injury market through Germany a couple of years ago through the acquisition of ACTINEO as a matter of fact, I was just in Cologne where we hosted a market event attended by over 70 customers who showed greater support for the bodily injury solutions and product offering, as well as an appetite to engage more frequently with Verisk to on the motor side, where we have a few months back made the Krug acquisition on the motor side and that integration is proceeding well and delivering on plan. And last but not least, we have our Mavera acquisition in Scandinavia based out of Sweden that delivers technology solutions for the bodily injury space. And finally, from an operating model perspective, we are leveraging our position in multiple territories with single finance, human resources, marketing, legal, as well as technology platforms.\nLee Shavel: And Surinder, just to kind of put it in context, the international revenues represent about 17% of our total, as you probably would see in the investor presentation. And I think the characteristic is that this is an opportunity for us to penetrate new markets. It is diverse, as you can hear from a lot of the businesses. So we have a number of growth factors and I would end by saying a focus also on elevating our dialogue to articulate the strategic value to international institutions is part of our strategy as well. So we're happy with the progress that we're making. We continue to see that as a substantial growth opportunity for us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC. Your line is now open.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. Lee you mentioned gen AI a couple of times, so -- and you highlighted improving existing product as well as launching new products using gen AI. My question there was how should we think about the monetization of gen AI? Wondering if you could give some anecdotal example of some products that are coming to the market. How should we think about monetization? Will that be offered as free or will you be charging more for gen AI? And the third last would be the timeline. How should we think about timeline for some of these product launches? Thanks.\nLee Shavel: Yes. Well, thank you, Ashish. So let me give you a couple of responses to that. So first, I have to say, generative AI is something that is certainly relatively new and so there is a developing aspect to this technology and its application. And so there will be dimensions of this that we're still in the process of piloting and testing. But let me refer you back to the comments that I made around Discovery Navigator and what we are doing in the casualty space where we are already utilizing AI, including some generative AI elements in that solution. And so generative AI is a component kind of similar to traditional AI or machine learning that is a tool to help our clients gather data, consolidate and interpret and then utilize data. So as it relates to Discovery Navigator, there are some generative AI elements that are included in that, that we are in the process of monitoring by demonstrating the substantial ROIs by improving the speed with which they can gather that data from a workers' comp claim through all of those medical records. So that's in flight we have other dimensions of that in certain businesses. The second example I would give is in utilizing generative AI from a coding perspective to improve efficiency is something that we have been exploring and testing and we think there are internal efficiencies for us in adapting some of that technology. And then, finally, what is on the horizon that I referenced in speaking to our client engagement and their enthusiasm for us to developing a product is something that would be a co-pilot in an underwriting context that utilizes our data sets, our experience in supporting from an actuarial standpoint from a rating standpoint, the underwriting process that is specifically targeted to a line of business. And that is something that is on more of the front end that we are testing and developing. In the first instance, that's something that we are monetizing with Discovery Navigator in the second instance, that's something that we hope to begin to deploy so that we can achieve efficiency in our overall coding. And in the third instance that's going to be something that hopefully we develop a product. There's been a strong appetite and interest from our clients. And so if we can deliver something that would be something we would hope to begin to monetize in the 2024/2025 timeframe based upon what our product development is. So a range of that, but it's a component of and an additional tool to a lot of the data and analytics work that we do.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your final question comes from the line of Russell Quelch with Redburn. Russell, your line is open.\nRussell Quelch: Yes. Thanks for circling back around and sorry for the technology issues. I was wondering if you would provide us with the growth rate for the extreme events solutions revenues in Q3 and year-to-date. And you made some brief comments in your prepared remarks, Elizabeth, but can you expand on what trends you saw there in Q3 and maybe what you're seeing so far in Q4, and wondering what you've assumed for your -- in your full-year guidance for Q4 in this business area?\nElizabeth Mann: Yes. Hey Russell, glad you're able to join us. Sorry, we don't provide specific disclosure on the extreme events business and certainly not quarterly. So sorry I can't comment on that.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.",

            "name": "Lee Shavel",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for participating in our third quarter earnings call. I am pleased to be here today to update you on the progress our team at Verisk is making on driving strategy and translating it into strong growth and value creation for our clients and shareholders alike. Elizabeth will provide the financial detail. But in summary, we delivered another strong quarter of results marked by solid organic revenue growth across most of our businesses, healthy margin expansion, and double-digit profit growth. We have confidence in our ability to deliver on both our 2023 guidance and the longer-term objectives we communicated back in March at Investor Day. The industry environment within which we are operating is marked by some deep challenges. Insurance carriers are dealing with the cross currents of inflation and higher losses, which are both negatively impacting industry profitability. In fact, A.M. Best data for the first six months of 2023 points to a $24.5 billion net underwriting loss for the U.S. Property and Casualty Insurance industry, running well ahead of the pace of the full-year 2022, which experienced net underwriting losses of $26.9 billion. A.M. Best notes that personal lines specifically homeowners is the primary driver of these declines. In reaction to this backdrop, carriers are exiting markets in key catastrophe prone states, dropping certain lines of unprofitable business and laying off portions of their workforce. Carriers are also raising rates to attempt to cover rising inflation and losses, driving net written premium growth up 9.7% for the first six months of 2023. In response to this environment, Verisk is partnering closely with our clients to address their most pressing concerns, including high value solutions that can deliver high return on investment for our clients. And we are including our clients earlier in the innovation process to ensure we are delivering the right solutions with simple implementations, improving the success rate and pace of uptake of new solutions. One of the key tenets of our strategy is to elevate the strategic dialogue with our clients and to become their trusted data and analytic and technology partner. During the third quarter, we engaged with clients on several occasions and at a variety of venues including the Verisk Insurance Conference in London. This year, we've combined several Verisk events to make it easier for clients to explore the many ways we can add value and increase the efficiency of their operations. In London, for example, we combined events focused on underwriting, claims, specialty insurance and extreme event modeling into a singular client-centric experience featuring Verisk solutions. I delivered one of two keynote presentations and the entire Verisk Senior Operating Committee was in attendance demonstrating our commitment to our customers at all levels. A solutions gallery featured Verisk solutions as well as the solutions of our ecosystem partners, and we held 35 concurrent educational sessions. We wrapped up with a CEO dinner with attendees that represented carriers, brokers, and managing general agents had a group discussion around common challenges faced by the entire insurance value chain. Enterprise-wide risk management is top of mind for many in London, as our clients are managing extremely large and complex portfolios of risk spanning multiple classes of business and insurance markets all over the world. To address this pressing need, we recently introduced Enterprise Exposure Manager. This solution is a joint development effort between specialty business solutions and extreme events to bring to the market a cloud-native and scalable solution that enables insurers and reinsurers to make more informed business decisions by offering a comprehensive view of risks that exist across large property portfolios. As we engage with our customers at these events and in the many one-on-one meetings we have hosted throughout the year, there were a few consistent themes that we hear in these conversations. First is Digital Transformation, which represents a massive opportunity for the global insurance market. Our clients aspire to modernize their platforms, improve systems integrations, lower expenses, and improve operational efficiency, and we are partnering with them on this journey. Verisk is introducing solutions that drive operational efficiency for some of their most people and paper intensive processes. For example, within our casualty business, we recently launched Discovery Navigator and are seeing solid early success. Discovery Navigator combines artificial intelligence and machine learning, Verisk's contributory data and years of clinical and legal expertise to immediately identify and extract key medical data points from unstructured records, which are part of bodily injury claims. Depending on the complexity of the case, the number of medical pages involved in a bodily injury claim can range from hundreds to thousands. Verisk has automated the organization, review, and summary, of these complex unstructured documents, allowing insurers to adjust, negotiate, and settle more claims in less time. Discovery Navigator easily integrates into our customers workflows through API or online options and delivers up to a 90% time savings and 95% accuracy for an average 10x ROI for clients. Additionally, Discovery Navigator is a widely versatile tool that is driving innovation and can be used in combination with other Verisk solutions like Liability Navigator, delivering workflow automation, decision support and overall efficiency for clients. The need for deeper data insights is also something we hear regularly from customers. Inflation trends during the past year have underscored the need for accurate, up-to-date and granular data insights to inform underwriting, risk management, reinsurance and claims decisions. No company is better positioned to meet this need than Verisk with our comprehensive and proprietary data assets. For example, our Verisk property estimating solutions are designed to meet these challenges head on with a comprehensive set of tools based on timely proprietary data, enabling our customers to write the most accurate estimates possible on their first attempt. This reduces the risk of over and underpayments while improving cycle times. Key to this process is XactXpert, our recently introduced rules engine that assists estimators in avoiding unwarranted costs in their estimates. We also enable our customer's quality assurance teams that evaluate the data from the entire process, ensuring that the claim payment will be correct the first time. Finally, generative AI remains a frequent topic with clients both its transformative potential and the risk that it brings. We believe gen AI can deliver efficiency within Verisk and in client-facing solutions starting first in our underwriting and life businesses where we are actively exploring new product development as well as enhancements to existing solutions. We are increasing our investment and leaning into generative AI as our clients recognize that by partnering with Verisk, they can invest in this -- we can invest in this advanced technology on behalf of the industry more efficiently than any one customer can do on their own. We also intend to do so while maintaining our focus on fairness and value-centric governance. On the theme of investment, I want to provide a progress report and update on our core lines reimagine project. We are about one-third of the way complete in what is likely a five-year journey to modernize our forms, rules, and loss costs and related solutions. We've made progress modernizing our internal processes like our ratemaking operation to enable and efficiently scale innovations in current and new solutions. We are expanding our industry-leading contributory database by adding new data contributors and by increasing the quality of our collected data. And we are working on enhancing the recency of our data in our analytics. On the customer-facing side, we are in-market with new proprietary analytics and workflow tools. For example, we have launched executive and client insight reports designed for the senior leadership of our clients across two of the largest lines of insurance, namely homeowners and business owners with plans to expand into other large lines over time. Just this month, we also launched our Legislative Monitoring application in the new platform for select clients. This new cloud-native application transforms what was previously a document based paper trail for tracking thousands of insurance related, legal, regulatory and legislative developments into a data driven, modern, digital monitoring and efficiency tool with an improved customer interface. Legislative Monitoring is the first of a series of new features that will be launched over the next several years on the platform. Overall, customer feedback on the reimagine project has been quite positive, including on the custom analytics and Legislative Monitoring application I mentioned before, and there is excitement for future advances within core lines. This excitement is driving more constructive, value driven conversations with our clients as we partner with them along their digital transformation journey. We are making these investments to deliver increased value for our clients through enhanced underwriting accuracy and efficiency. With that, I'll hand it over to Elizabeth to review our financial results. Thanks, Elizabeth. In summary, we are excited about our business momentum and the opportunity ahead. Our motivating purpose is to partner with our clients in building resilience for individuals, communities, and businesses globally. The combination of our focused business model, deep customer relationships, and strategy to deliver value for clients through improved decision making and operational efficiency is a formula that will also deliver value to our shareholders through growth and returns. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk, given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions. Yes. Thank you, George. I appreciate the question. So the short answer is yes. I think the dynamic that we're observing is that because of the loss environment and the frustrations that the insurers or the carriers generally have had in getting rate increases to compensate them for the increased risk and the increased replacement costs driven by replacement. Right now they are focused on achieving profitability off of their existing books and that has resulted in a lower level of advertising by the carriers as they are kind of working with their existing book. We have seen, as Elizabeth described, a lot of shopping activity, but that is consumer driven and is a response to the higher rates that almost everyone is experiencing right now. The consequences of that for us is that in our Verisk marketing solutions business, we have seen declines within that business because of lower overall advertising spend by the carriers as a function of this environment. Thank you, Alex. I'm happy to address that. I think we have seen a clear benefit in a variety of areas. So one and first is that engaging at that strategic dialogue and I probably have had over a dozen client CEO meetings and one thing that we focus on in that is understanding their broader enterprise challenges within this environment. And there's also a focus on what is Verisk doing for us and where are their areas that we are helping others that we can help them. And specifically, in a number of those conversations, we've identified products -- existing products that we have that can be particularly helpful in this environment. And I would say are what we have done to help carriers analyze their existing rate adequacy and where there may be opportunities to improve their rates in their auto book or in other parts of their business. And that's opened up some channels that before where our bottoms up approach may have run into an obstacle within the organization. But when given the opportunity to describe the strategic benefit, the financial benefit, we're getting more top down support. And I've seen that take place in a number of clients. So I think that's one. The second is in understanding areas, emerging areas where they are facing either challenges or interest in new technologies, an opportunity to guide what we are doing in some of our projects like core lines, reimagine, what we're doing in generative AI, to tailor them to what we know has strategic resonance for those clients has been helpful. And so I think as we have been investing in a number of generative AI applications that has been specifically helped by getting insight and buy in from those levels. I had one dinner with the CEO said, look, Lee, we could spend tens of millions of dollars on generative AI, and I'm not sure what we'll be able to generate out of it. But if you can develop a pilot and we can benefit from that. We would be happy to test that pilot as soon as you have it ready. And I think that's a great example of where we're able to substantiate that strategic dialogue and translate it into targeted product development at a faster rate than we would have before. I think those are certainly benefits that we'll hope to begin to deliver additional growth for us in 2024 supporting our core business. Yes. Hey, Andrew, this is Lee. I know you directed that to Elizabeth, but we have Neil Spector who runs our underwriting business for us, and I think he's been closest to that. So let me give him an opportunity to give you a read from what we're seeing in those markets. And I would add to that, Andrew, and I think that gives a great kind of current sense of where things are. Neil and I were in Washington, D.C. last week meeting with a number of the trade associations just to understand how we can be helpful to the industry from a data perspective. And one thing that was very clear is that the Florida and California are both very engaged with the industry to understand what steps could be taken to improve the health of those markets. I think they understand the risk and the challenges. They obviously face some political pressure, but we've been encouraged by their openness to discussing how they can improve the market dynamic for the carriers within each of those markets. And that's an intense level of dialogue that could ameliorate some of kind of the early pressures that we saw. I think those are the two core elements. One, the impact of premium growth, which as we indicated, remains strong, as well as the value that we are creating, particularly in core lines where we've increased the number of data sets, we've increased the ability of our clients to utilize that data. And so we certainly look to capture the value that we're creating for our clients there and all of those factor into our pricing considerations. Russell, are you there? Moving to the next question. Thanks, Toni. So the first thing that I would say is, hopefully is as evident by kind of what we have been doing has been a primary focus on our internal operations and what we can accomplish with the core business. And we're particularly focused on the growth objectives that we've set, the margin objectives that we've set. And we feel it's important coming after -- coming off of Investor Day that we are focused on demonstrating what the core franchise is able to deliver. So in that regard, we are not looking at any substantial large acquisitions that would be transformative. We obviously are entirely focused on insurance right now. And so that's the orientation. We do maintain active engagement on smaller mid-size opportunities; generally sub $100 million, where we feel there may be a high quality product that has gotten initial traction with the industry and where we can add substantial value by accelerating its adoption. In many cases, our clients feel more comfortable adopting a product when they know that they have the strength and the stability and our capabilities behind it, or we can enhance that product by improving the data set, improving the efficiency or the technology that's driving it. And we've had success with that in a number of areas, probably most notably our acquisition of FAST on the life side, which has been a textbook case of where we can add value in those areas. We continue to be excited about the marketing opportunity, even though as we mentioned in our earlier comments, the advertising environment has been a headwind for that. But we see broader appetite for those and we'll look to across all of our businesses to see where there might be a technology or a product or a data set that is relevant. So I wouldn't say that there is anything in particular, we really are aware of it across all of our businesses, and we want to make certain that we don't miss an opportunity to enhance one of our businesses if there is something that is truly additive. Thank you, Jeff. It's an interesting question, and I would start off by saying that first, at a high level, I feel as though the strategic engagement that we've had has created broader opportunities for us to advance in a number of businesses by more effectively communicating the value to their enterprises. So I think that's certainly something that we feel strongly about. We -- in addition, feel confident about the core lines reimagine investment that we have made and our ability to deliver greater value to our clients over the next several years and to participate in that. I think that we are also seeing in the property market and the focus around profitability and opportunity to serve our clients more broadly. I think the other thing that we would look at this year that we have benefited from is some higher level of transactional activity, particularly in the auto side with high levels of shopping that have contributed to our growth rate that may not be sustained into 2024. Similarly, on the property side, some higher levels of activity there that have contributed to strong growth. I think overall, we're really pleased with the growth that we generated in 2023. We had some tailwinds. We aren't providing guidance on 2024 at this point. We have to step back and assess where we are, and we'll do that in the first quarter. But I think strategically and from a -- from an investment standpoint, we're excited about where we're investing core lines, generative AI, investments that we're making in broadening our ecosystem and integrating other partners that add value to our customers. And we'll continue to work to offset and mitigate any of the transactional benefits that we've had in 2023. Yes. And Heather, I would say, look, we're very focused on the margin objectives that we set at Investor Day and I think we had a very good start and what we have delivered and have been realizing the benefits of that. But it's a continuous process for us and we're always going to look for where we can achieve greater efficiencies throughout the business. Elizabeth mentioned several, but as we have been able to make the business a more integrated business focused on insurance, I think we've identified some areas where we can improve both effectiveness and efficiency in the organization and we'll expect to be pursuing those in 2024 to continue that momentum. Yes. So, Seth, thank you for the question. And I'm going to ask Neil to talk about where we see incremental opportunities within the life space. I think it's not only clients, but also thinking about kind of the nature of their technology, that low-code, no-code approach and its applicability more broadly here in the industry. Yes. Thank you, Surinder. I'm going to appreciate that. We've been pleased with the international growth rates across the organization. I would put them into three categories. We first have our specialty business solutions, which is predominantly London-based addressing the Lloyd's or the excess and surplus market there. They continued to have success in delivering workflow and automation efficiencies through the software platform that they are -- have built and are integrating other components to. We think that's delivers a lot of value to the participants in that market, so that's been additive to our overall growth rate. On the underwriting side, we have a life, health, and travel business that has performed well, particularly coming off of the resurgence of global travel post the pandemic. Since then, it's kind of normalized, but we continue to see opportunities for that to grow. And I'm going to actually turn to Maroun Mourad, who has had several businesses internationally on the claim side to give you a sense of our experience there as well. And Surinder, just to kind of put it in context, the international revenues represent about 17% of our total, as you probably would see in the investor presentation. And I think the characteristic is that this is an opportunity for us to penetrate new markets. It is diverse, as you can hear from a lot of the businesses. So we have a number of growth factors and I would end by saying a focus also on elevating our dialogue to articulate the strategic value to international institutions is part of our strategy as well. So we're happy with the progress that we're making. We continue to see that as a substantial growth opportunity for us. Yes. Well, thank you, Ashish. So let me give you a couple of responses to that. So first, I have to say, generative AI is something that is certainly relatively new and so there is a developing aspect to this technology and its application. And so there will be dimensions of this that we're still in the process of piloting and testing. But let me refer you back to the comments that I made around Discovery Navigator and what we are doing in the casualty space where we are already utilizing AI, including some generative AI elements in that solution. And so generative AI is a component kind of similar to traditional AI or machine learning that is a tool to help our clients gather data, consolidate and interpret and then utilize data. So as it relates to Discovery Navigator, there are some generative AI elements that are included in that, that we are in the process of monitoring by demonstrating the substantial ROIs by improving the speed with which they can gather that data from a workers' comp claim through all of those medical records. So that's in flight we have other dimensions of that in certain businesses. The second example I would give is in utilizing generative AI from a coding perspective to improve efficiency is something that we have been exploring and testing and we think there are internal efficiencies for us in adapting some of that technology. And then, finally, what is on the horizon that I referenced in speaking to our client engagement and their enthusiasm for us to developing a product is something that would be a co-pilot in an underwriting context that utilizes our data sets, our experience in supporting from an actuarial standpoint from a rating standpoint, the underwriting process that is specifically targeted to a line of business. And that is something that is on more of the front end that we are testing and developing. In the first instance, that's something that we are monetizing with Discovery Navigator in the second instance, that's something that we hope to begin to deploy so that we can achieve efficiency in our overall coding. And in the third instance that's going to be something that hopefully we develop a product. There's been a strong appetite and interest from our clients. And so if we can deliver something that would be something we would hope to begin to monetize in the 2024/2025 timeframe based upon what our product development is. So a range of that, but it's a component of and an additional tool to a lot of the data and analytics work that we do."

            "name": "Elizabeth Mann",
            "content": "Thanks, Lee, and good day to everyone on the call. I am pleased to share that Verisk delivered strong third quarter financial results. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue was $678 million, up 11% versus the prior year, and income from continuing operations was $187 million, up 13% versus the prior year, reflecting strong growth across both underwriting and claims. Diluted GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.29, up 23% versus the prior year. This quarter's reported results included a $19 million litigation reserve expense associated with an indemnification for an ongoing inquiry related to our former Financial Services segment, which was sold in April 2022. Moving to our organic constant currency results adjusted for non-operating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, our operating results demonstrated strong and broad-based growth from most of our businesses, aided by some in-period transactional benefits. In the third quarter, OCC revenues grew 9.4%, with growth of 8.3% in underwriting and 12.2% in claims. Our subscription revenues, which comprised 80% of our total revenue in the quarter, grew 9.3% on an OCC basis, with growth in almost all our subscription-based solutions. More specifically on the drivers of growth in subscription revenues during the quarter, we experienced the continued benefit on certain of our revenues from the stronger net premium growth in 2021, which is currently reflected in some of our contract pricing as well as a lower level of attrition and consolidation across the industry. Within property estimating solutions, our efforts to expand the ecosystem and drive new innovations like XactXpert are paying dividends through higher levels of customer retention for our contractor customers. In anti-fraud, we saw underlying strength in the business with growth augmented by the continued benefit from the conversion to subscription from previously transactional customers through our claims essentials bundle. And finally, within extreme events solutions, we are benefiting from strong renewals and new customer wins. Our transactional revenues representing 20% of total revenue in the third quarter grew 10.2% on an OCC basis. The largest contributor to growth was again from our auto solutions, driven by better than expected shopping activity by consumers and the continued benefit from the large non-rate action deal with a national insurer that we previously communicated. Our trends track consistently with the recent J.D. Power data, which pointed to a 12% increase in shopping activity for auto insurance in the third quarter as customers continue to respond to rate increases. That said we will begin to anniversary the elevated shopping activity in the fourth quarter, so we are expecting that growth to moderate. In addition to gains in auto, our transactional revenue growth also benefited from double-digit growth from life insurance solutions as we are seeing strong customer demand for incremental services. And within our property estimating solutions business, we saw strong transactional growth generated by our expanded set of distribution partners within our ecosystem and from elevated weather events, although not to the level of a large scale catastrophe. In fact, according to Verisk's PCS data, the third quarter of 2023 had 73 days out of 92 that included a PCS event in the U.S. And 2023 is on track to become a new high for catastrophe frequency likely to bypass 2021, which was the highest year on record to-date. Moving now to our adjusted EBITDA results. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 11.8% in the third quarter, while total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results was 54%, up 70 basis points from the reported results in the prior year. This margin rate reflects core operating leverage from the strong revenue growth and cost discipline across the organization. As we've said in the past, the margin rate in any given quarter can be influenced by revenue mix and timing of spending. So we think it's best to look at our margins on a trailing 12-month basis, which in the third quarter were 53.3%, up 150 basis points over last year's level. Continuing down the income statement, net interest expense was $29 million for the third quarter, compared to $34 million in the prior year. The current level of net interest expense reflects lower year-over-year debt balances as we paid down our revolving credit facility as well as higher interest on cash balances. Our reported effective tax rate was 25% compared to 24.2% in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year change in the tax rate is related to the $19 million litigation reserve expense that we mentioned earlier, partially offset by higher stock compensation benefits in this quarter versus the prior year's period. Going forward, we expect the tax rate for the full-year 2023 to be near the high end of the originally guided range of 23% to 25%. Adjusted net income increased 17% to $221 million, and diluted adjusted EPS increased 27% to $1.52 for the third quarter 2023. These changes reflect organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions, and a lower average share count. The share count reflects the impact of our $2.5 billion accelerated share repurchase plan that we entered into in March, as well as an additional $50 million worth of share repurchase that we completed in the third quarter. Regarding the share count, you can see that while our weighted average diluted shares outstanding declined 7.7% year-over-year, it was essentially flat sequentially. From a cash flow perspective, on a reported basis, net cash from operating activities decreased 11% to $250 million, while free cash declined 9% to $196 million. The decline in both cash flow metrics is a function of the fact that prior year cash flow metrics include the results from previously divested businesses as well as a favorable cash tax impact in the prior year from the sale of our environmental, health and safety business. Adjusted for these items, both cash flow metrics increased year-over-year during the third quarter. We are very pleased with robust year-to-date performance. Our guidance for 2023 remains unchanged. We now expect revenue to be towards the high end of our range of $2.63 billion to $2.66 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is still expected to be between $1.39 billion to $1.43 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the 53% to 54% range and adjusted EPS in the range of $5.50 to $5.70. A complete listing of all guidance measures can be found in the earnings slide deck, which has been posted to the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. We do want to remind you that the fourth quarter of 2022 included $6 million in revenue associated with Hurricane Ian as well as a tax benefit associated with the divestiture of Wood Mackenzie. And now, I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments. Yes. Thanks very much, Manav. On the guidance, we're very proud of our results year-to-date. We've given full-year guidance in order to bring additional transparency and for folks to see how the business is going. We did update that mid-year after seeing significant shifts in the environment. But our full-year guidance does imply revenue growth of approximately 8% to 9% on a reported basis that's above our long-term targets. As we look at the fourth quarter, no specific comments on the fourth quarter other than what I highlighted, which is to remind that the growth comparisons do get tougher in the fourth quarter due to the storm revenue and the tax benefit there. Well, let me thanks -- thanks for the question, Greg. Let me take a crack at that. I think it's a little bit hard to draw that conclusion. The transactional revenue is a combination of a couple of different areas. We've highlighted the main ones that contributed to the growth. The auto underwriting, the shopping activity has driven that, the property estimating solutions has a transactional component related to weather activity and then life on the incremental services. So I'm not sure I would point it directly to an inverse correlation to the underwriting environment. Yes. Thanks, Jeff, for the question. Obviously, we're looking at it. It's still early in the cycle, and I'm not in a position to quote any numbers or any thoughts on 2024. The data on 2022, while it's still being finalized, it does show net written premium growth still in an elevated level around the eight -- slightly north of 8% that has tapered from the 2021 growth, but still relatively high on a historical basis. I think Lee pointed to both that environment, but also the fact that it is a function of the challenges and the desire to move towards profitability that our carriers, our customers are seeing. And so we are balancing those two things as we go into the rate -- the pricing cycle for next year. Yes. Thanks for the question, Andrew. That comment about the high end was specific and confined to revenues and did not apply to the other line items. And I'm not here to comment on the fourth quarter in specific, other than the points I made about the year-over-year comps. Yes. Thanks for the question, Andrew. The biggest component of the transaction revenue that has some seasonality to it, there's two that come to mind. One is the weather, the weather-related seasonality in property estimating solutions that on a long-term historical basis tends to occasionally get a boost in the third quarter as a function of Atlantic hurricanes last year in 2022 that happened to hit in October and fell in the fourth quarter. The other element that you saw last quarter, the securitization market can sometimes that hits in the second quarter primarily. That's a relatively small part in our business. The other elements of transactional revenue don't necessarily have a seasonal pattern to them, the life insurance services, the auto, underwriting product is more a function of their own markets. Yes, Heather, thanks for the question. Our expense program, as we highlighted in the past, I think we said sort of over 90% of the benefit is experienced in 2023. So I think of those original set of actions, we think they've largely been action that are expressing themselves in the margin expansion that you're seeing today. There is continued focus on cost efficiency at Verisk. And so we're looking in the future for opportunities based on our global talent outsourcing program and based well on investments in internal efficiency that will play out over time like the ERP program that we've talked about. Yes. Hey Russell, glad you're able to join us. Sorry, we don't provide specific disclosure on the extreme events business and certainly not quarterly. So sorry I can't comment on that."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Neil Spector",
            "content": "Sure. Thanks. Well, first, I'm sure you've seen the news that several large national carriers have kind of withdrawn writing new business in both those markets due to the challenges. However, in Florida specifically, we haven't seen any additional liquidations and there's been no reduction in the ratings of the carriers that are there. So there's still availability in that market of carriers. And you may have seen recently a press release we put out in the last quarter showing how citizens, which is the state run insurer is leveraging some of our aerial imagery data to help with evaluation of properties in Florida. So that's really stable as far as between the last time we reported. And now California, there's certainly challenges both in the amount of time it takes to get rates approved and also in what tools you're allowed to use in Florida as far as pricing goes and those continue although the regulators in California are seriously looking at the potential to use more tools in the future to help with challenges like wildfire. Yes. Thanks, Lee. So our solution in life is a low-code, no-code software platform that helps a life insurer from the policy administration distribution claims from a full lifecycle. And what we've seen is even in the current environment, there is a huge need in the life industry to modernize technology. They're behind P&C as far as modernization of systems. And as Lee pointed out, because our system is a low-code, no-code, we have the opportunity to potentially lower the operating costs of deployed lines of business on our platform pretty substantially versus legacy solutions. So there's a strong incentive for life insurers to move on to these more flexible and lower cost operating environments. We've also seen a huge need from our customers in support of their transformation and that has driven some of our service or transactional revenue for our existing customers because of their desire to have us support their implementation efforts."

This call is being recorded, and currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After today\u2019s prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session where we will limit participants to one question so that we can allow everyone time to ask a question. We will have further instructions for you at that time. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk\u2019s Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.\nStacey Brodbar: Thank you, Abby, and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our second quarter 2023 financial results. On the call today are Lee Shavel, Verisk\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; and Elizabeth Mann, Chief Financial Officer. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as our traditional quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. As set forth in more detail in today\u2019s earnings release, I will remind everyone today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk\u2019s future performance, including those related to our financial guidance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Finally, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that the financial results for recent dispositions are included in our consolidated and GAAP results but are excluded from all organic constant currency growth figures. A reconciliation of reported and historic non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call is provided in our 8-K and today\u2019s earnings presentation posted on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. However, we are not able to provide a reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable expected GAAP results because of the unreasonable effort and high unpredictability of estimating certain items that are excluded from projected non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, including, for example, tax consequences, acquisition-related costs, gain/loss from dispositions and other non-recurring expenses, the effect of which may be significant. And now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Lee Shavel.\nLee Shavel: Thanks, Stacey. Good morning and thank you for participating in today\u2019s call. I am excited to be with you today to provide an update on how our strategy, focus and results-oriented culture is translating into strong financial performance for Verisk. I will leave the details of the financial results to Elizabeth. But in summary, Verisk delivered continued business momentum in the second quarter, underscored by strong organic revenue growth and solid margin expansion, translating into double-digit profit growth. We are driving these results by focusing on our client\u2019s most pressing needs as they deal with an environment marked by elevated underwriting losses, including those from catastrophes and high levels of inflation, leading to pressure on profitability. We have elevated the conversation and directed our sales focus to the solutions in our portfolio best suited to solve those challenges. Our byproduct of the tough operating environment is a hardening of the insurance market as carriers are taking rate actions to help drive improved profitability, leading to stronger net written premium growth. Rate takes time to work through, so we expect this environment to persist into 2024. The cross currents of elevated underwriting losses and increasing pricing in the insurance industry has become a hot topic across the press with headlines about trouble spots like Florida and California. Specific to Florida, since our last update, there has been little change as we have not seen any additional liquidations, though uncertainty remains. We continue to watch the market carefully, particularly as we head into the Atlantic hurricane season. We are also keeping a keen eye out for new financial stability ratings for the Florida market, which we expect in the next few weeks and could identify further deterioration in the market. Recent legislative reforms in the property market are expected to have a positive impact, but it may take some time for that to materialize. In California, current regulation restricts insurers from using catastrophe models and ratemaking, but the Department of Insurance is exploring a change to that policy. To that end, Verisk recently testified in front of the California State Assembly, joint hearing, insurance and emergency management as the expert on catastrophe models and how their use can help insurers assess risk from low frequency, high severity events like wildfires, ultimately benefiting the residents and businesses in the state. This is a great example of our enhanced industry engagement as we leverage our expertise to benefit all the players in the insurance ecosystem, including carriers and regulators and build resilience for consumers and businesses. As I discussed at Investor Day and on prior calls, a key pillar in our strategy is elevating and strengthening the strategic dialogue with our clients. To that end, I had the opportunity in the second quarter to visit with many of our clients in the U.S. to understand their focus and explore how we can better support their objectives. These conversations generated several initiatives for expanded dialogue with C-suite support to accelerate opportunities on technology and data initiatives, particularly regarding inflationary impacts. During a visit to Europe, I encountered similar opportunities with our clients there, as well as exceptional energy and focus at Verisk offices in London, Malaga, Cracow and Cologne. The message that we hear is very similar across industry participants, large and small, U.S. and international. We welcome Verisk\u2019s expertise in partnership to drive more automation, lower our investment cost and improve efficiency. Given our mission-critical data, deep customer relationships and engagement and scale, no one is better positioned to meet this need than Verisk. A key extension of our conversations with our clients is our innovation agenda. We are listening to our customers and designing solutions to meet their most pressing needs. For example, we recently launched a new solution for carriers, contractors and adjusters within our property estimating solutions called XactXpert. XactXpert is a no-code, low-code cloud-based rules engine designed to streamline the insurance restoration and claims estimation process. XactXpert targets the key challenges our clients face, including inaccurate and incomplete information and claims estimates, high compliance needs, pressure to reduce cycle times, revisions, loss adjustment expenses and a need for more digital and simplified processes for a changing workforce demographic. Further, it empowers carriers, contractors and adjusters to customize organizational estimating behaviors, delivering quick, accurate claims estimation by reducing manual input errors and driving consistency, accuracy and efficiency throughout the claims estimating process. We are seeing strong interest from our customers for this newly launched solution. In our anti-fraud solutions, we recently launched Image Forensics, an AI tool designed to detect fraud in digital images submitted as part of the claims settlement process. Image used in claims processing has grown exponentially with more and more images being submitted directly by the claimant. In fact, just since mid-2020, photo estimates for auto claim settlement have doubled and while virtual claims processing is driving industry efficiency and customer satisfaction, it has also exposed insurers to an increasing source of fraud from activities like reusing prior loss images using Internet images or digital or document manipulation. We are leveraging the depth and breadth of our customer\u2019s relationships in building a contributory image database, combining it with images sourced from Verisk\u2019s property estimating solutions databases to provide images in match reports and indications if an image was used in a prior loss. Image Forensics is also a great example of how our innovation engine is now actively associating data sets that were previously siloed into powerful new tools for our customers as this tool combines data from anti-fraud with data from property estimating solutions. I know that generative AI has been top of mind for many. At Verisk, we have been using artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision and natural language processing in many of our solutions for some time. For example, our Mozart Forms Composer uses machine learning and natural language processing to help insurers organize, track, edit and analyze insurance policy forms with greater consistency, efficiency and speed. This tool employs advanced technology to digitize a historically document-driven process and addresses a major pain point for our clients, managing the complex and growing problem of analyzing policy language across multiple lines and states, while enhancing their ability to customize policy language more quickly. With regard to generative AI, we are currently testing private versions of generative AI and are making an index of possible use cases focused on both customer-facing solutions and internal efficiency opportunities. We are working in partnership with our customers and state regulators to ensure that we are approaching this innovative technology with a focus on ethical use in fairness. Finally, I would like to formally welcome Samantha Vaughan to Verisk as our Chief Privacy Officer. Data governance and stewardship have always been a key focus for Verisk and Vaughan will lead the oversight and enhancement of our policies to protect the data entrusted to Verisk and will help ensure the integrity of Verisk\u2019s data practices, regulation and compliance. In addition to the focus and dedicated privacy leadership, our new privacy officer expands on the thought leadership Verisk is providing across the insurance industry. As technology and data capabilities expand, the privacy risks expand as well. Concerns about AI, data risk management and security, all have a key nexus in privacy and we are glad to be joining the best-in-class companies that articulate a values-based approach to the privacy office.  With that, I will hand it over to Elizabeth to review our financial results.\nElizabeth Mann: Thanks, Lee, and good morning to everyone on the call. I am pleased to share that Verisk delivered strong second quarter financial results. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue was $675 million, up 10% versus the prior year and income from continuing operations was $204 million, up 18% versus the prior year, reflecting strong growth across both underwriting and claims. Diluted GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.35, up 9% versus the prior year. Moving to our organic constant currency results adjusted for non-operating items, as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, our operating results demonstrated strong and broad-based growth from most of our businesses, aided by some in-period transactional benefits. In the second quarter, OCC revenues grew 9.8% and with growth of 9.3% in underwriting and 11.2% in claims. This quarter\u2019s result was boosted by certain transactional revenues that we do not expect to repeat in the back half of the year. Our subscription revenues, which comprised 79% of our total revenue in the quarter, grew 9.1% on an OCC basis. We saw contributions across nearly all of our subscription offerings. More specifically on the drivers of growth in subscription revenues, during the quarter, we experienced the continued benefit on certain of our revenues from the stronger net prem -- net written premium growth in 2021, which is currently reflected in some of our contract pricing. In anti-fraud, we are driving accelerated growth from the successful conversion to subscription from previously transactional customers through our claims essential bundle. And in property estimating solutions, we continue to benefit from strong contractor subscription growth as contractors are realizing the value of being part of the Verisk network, particularly with the active weather patterns we are undergoing. In fact, according to Verisk\u2019s Property Claim Services, PCS, in 70-plus years of history, this was the most active first half of the year on record from a weather event perspective, dominated by hail, wind and thunderstorms. Finally, liquidations and consolidation across the industry was lower than historic average during the quarter, but we continue to anticipate some normalization in the second half of the year. Our transactional revenues representing 21% of total revenue in the second quarter, grew 12.4% on an OCC basis. The largest contributor to growth for the second consecutive quarter was from our auto solutions, driven by increased rate shopping by consumers and the continuation of a large non-rate action deal with a national insurer that we told you about last quarter. Our trends are reflective of those noted by recent J.D. Power data, which pointed to a 13% increase in shopping activity for auto insurance in the second quarter as consumers react to rate increases. However, J.D. Power also noted that carrier switching increased a much more modest 4%, which may suggest a potential slowing of the market going forward.  In addition to gains in auto, our transactional revenue growth also benefited from double-digit growth from life insurance solutions as we are seeing strong customer demand for incremental services. And within our extreme events business, we saw a very strong transactional growth related to securitization, as the second quarter marked a record for new issuance in the catastrophe bond market. I will remind you that the catastrophe bond market is seasonal and we do not expect this level of activity to continue in the second half of 2023. These transactional results also included some one-time benefits, including overage charges on specific large underwriting contracts that renewed in the quarter.  Moving now to our adjusted EBITDA results. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 12.6% in the second quarter, reflecting core operating leverage on the strong revenue growth and the impact of certain cost reduction actions we have taken in connection with our margin expansion objectives. Total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results was 54.1%, up 160 basis points from the reported results in the prior year. On a pro forma basis for all divestitures, the second quarter margin expanded 140 basis points from margins of 52.7% in Q2 2022. The margin rate in any given quarter can be influenced by the revenue mix, leading to a seasonal pattern in our margins. As such, we think it\u2019s helpful to look at our margins on a trailing 12-month basis [Technical Difficulty] within the second quarter were 53.1% on a trailing 12-month basis, up 140 basis points over the prior period.  The year-over-year change in the second quarter margin reflects the impact of certain one-time expenses in the prior year quarter, as well as strong cost and operational discipline and the impact of our cost reduction program. This was offset in part by higher levels of performance-based compensation, including commissions related to our stronger year-to-date performance, as well as a decrease in our pension credit, negative margin impact from recent acquisitions and higher T&E expenses. Reflecting on our ongoing cost reduction plans, we continue to run the margin targets that we articulated in our 2023 guidance and at Investor Day in mid-March. Continuing down the income statement. Net interest expense was $31.6 million for the second quarter, compared to $31.9 million in the prior year. With the divestitures now behind us, the proceeds from the sales directed to our $2.5 billion accelerated share repurchase plan and the long-term capital structure now in place, we now expect this current level of net interest expense to be at a similar quarterly run rate for the remainder of the year. On taxes, our reported effective tax rate was 23.8%, compared to 19.2% in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year change in the tax rate is related to lower stock compensation benefits in this quarter versus the prior year\u2019s period. Going forward, we still expect the tax rate for the remainder of the year to be in the originally guided range of 23% to 25%. Adjusted net income increased 8.5% to $219.8 million and diluted adjusted EPS increased 18.9% to $1.51 for the second quarter 2023. These changes reflect organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions and a lower average share count, offset in part by a higher tax rate. With regard to the share count, we received the vast majority of the shares from the $2.5 billion accelerated share repurchase plan when we entered into the plan back in March, and while we did not make any repurchases in the second quarter, we do have the ability to repurchase some additional shares outside of the ASR, and we may do so in the future. From a cash flow perspective, net cash from operating activities increased 48% to $193 million due to strong operations and a decrease in cash taxes paid. The decrease in taxes paid is primarily related to the non-recurring gain on the three disposition in the prior year quarter. Though there was also a one-time cash tax payment of $17 million paid in the second quarter of 2023 related to the energy divestiture. I will remind you that the prior year cash flow metrics include the results from previously divested businesses. Turning to guidance. Given our strong half -- strong first half performance, as well as the contribution from recent acquisitions, we are increasing our financial outlook for 2023. We have posted a summary of all guidance measures in the earnings deck on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. Specifically, for 2023, we now expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $2.63 billion to $2.66 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.39 billion to $1.43 billion. We continue to expect adjusted EBITDA margins to be in the range of 53% to 54%. Walking further down the P&L, we still expect fixed asset D&A to be between $175 million and $195 million, and intangible amortization to be approximately $70 million. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to currency variability, the timing of purchases, the completion of projects and future M&A activity.  Regarding capital expenditures, we now expect CapEx to be between $220 million and $240 million, reflecting increases associated with recent acquisitions, as well as our continued focus on investing organically behind our highest return on investment opportunities. These include a modernization of our forms, rules and loss costs, a migration of our extreme events platform to a cloud-native architecture and further investments across our growth businesses. We are also investing in an upgrade of our financial and human capital system that will enable future efficiencies once implemented. As previously communicated, we expect the tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%, bringing adjusted earnings per share to a range of $5.50 to $5.70. And now I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments.\nLee Shavel: Thanks, Elizabeth. In summary, we are excited about the opportunity ahead and our ability to focus all our attention, talent and resources on the global insurance industry. Verisk is best positioned to capitalize on the opportunity because of our scale and expertise. Our motivating purpose is to work together with our clients in building resilience for individuals, communities and businesses globally. The combination of our focused business model, deep customer relationships and strategy to deliver value for clients through improved decision-making and operational efficiency is a formula that we are confident will also deliver value to our shareholders through growth and returns. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. And with that, I will ask the Operator to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nHeather Balsky: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the outlook for the back half on sales. I know that both this quarter and last quarter, you ring fenced some items that, you articulated were potentially one-time. But it seems like guidance implies at the high end 7.5% revenue growth versus you did 10% organic sales in the first half. Is it those items tapering off, do you have a different outlook for the environment? Could it really helpful to reconcile how you did in the first half and your expectation for the back half?\nElizabeth Mann: Yes. Heather, thanks for the question. We have been very happy in the first half that we have been kind of firing on all cylinders. We have a diversified business within the insurance space and we have called out a number of different environmental or industry factors where the revenue growth in the first half may not be sustained into the second half. And so for those -- just to reiterate them, I think, there\u2019s no fewer than six different factors that have contributed to the strength in the first half. To go through those, there has been low attrition and consolidation in the industry, which has the potential to renormalize in the second half of the year and in the future. Second, the level of auto shopping activity driving transactional volume in our auto insurance business, they moderate. Third, the level of weather activity has been elevated in the first half, although no specific catastrophe events and also related to weather is the fact that there was obviously a large hurricane in the fourth quarter of last year. So that will create a difficult comp in the fourth quarter. Fourth on the list of reasons for strength. In our anti-fraud business, we have been driving strong growth by converting transactional customers to subscription in our claims essential bundle. We will start to lap that benefit, which started roughly this time last year. Fifth, we talked about the securitizations and the strength of the ILS market, which was elevated in the second quarter and we don\u2019t expect that to continue. And then, lastly, we had called out various technical items like billing catch-ups or overages and the extra business day in the quarter. All of those have been contributing to the 9.8% and revenue growth, which has been above our long-term sustainable 6% to 8% target and may not continue in the second half.\nLee Shavel: And Heather, if I can put a wrapper around the detail that Elizabeth provided, you asked the question initially in terms of a sales dynamic in the second half. And as Elizabeth was describing, these really aren\u2019t sales-related elements, they are more environmental factors that contributed to a strong first half that we think are likely to moderate in the second half where we can\u2019t have confidence that they will continue to reoccur. So there\u2019s nothing that we see that this is predominantly sales driven. It is more environmental.\nHeather Balsky: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nGeorge Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Just a follow-up on the prior question. As you think about the normalization of trends in the external environment, acknowledging that the internal execution has been relatively stable and strong. When would you expect that normalization? How would you expect the subscription and transaction revenue performance to normalize in the coming quarters? Thank you.\nLee Shavel: Yeah. So, George, thanks for the question. I mean, I will start off by saying that I think implicit if you go through all of those details that Elizabeth has gone through, it\u2019s difficult to predict what that is going to happen. I think the sense is, there is probably some reversion to mean in the ILS market. We had a strong second quarter. It\u2019s not -- typically, you see that from quarter-to-quarter, but it\u2019s difficult to predict. The shopping activity is one where we are seeing some early trends, but that\u2019s going to depend upon macroeconomic factors. So I don\u2019t think that, given the nature of that and its particular strength on the transactional side, we are in a position to estimate or predict when that\u2019s likely to moderate or simply taking a more conservative point of view around the impact in the second half.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Andrew Steinerman with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi. I was hoping to revisit kind of an older question about net written premiums. I know it has less of effect on Verisk pricing, but it\u2019s still part of the Verisk pricing. And looking back to 2021 and 2022, those were strong growth years for net written premiums for the U.S. P&C Insurance industry and I just wanted to get a sense with the two-year lag that I think is typical for a contract. How much is that helping this year\u2019s organic revenue growth?\nElizabeth Mann: Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. It is helping this year\u2019s revenue growth and we are looking back to 2021 on our 2023 contract. I think we have previously called out that was a 9.6% net written premium growth across the industry. And as I called out, the factors of strength in our subscription growth that and the strength in our forms, rules and loss cost business has probably been the largest contributor to our subscription growth.\nLee Shavel: And Andrew, to add a little bit of context around that. As Elizabeth described, it has been a benefit, but there are also, I think, the impact of inflation is clearly driving some of that net written premium. We are also seeing the benefit of a hardening market within the insurance as a whole. But the other element is, because of inflation, our costs are going up, that gives us a little bit more scope on the pricing side and we are also continuing to add value to those products, which particularly in this environment with insurance industry focused on improving their efficiency. We have been able in a number of areas to deliver substantial value on that front given those pressures and that -- those elements are probably a larger factor than the pure net written premium. I think we estimate that the portion of our revenues that has some exposure to that is in the 15% to 20% type of range.\nAndrew Steinerman: Perfect. Thanks, Lee. Thanks, Elizabeth.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks so much. I am going to ask a question that\u2019s sort of a compilation of the prior three. When you think about the sort of abnormal items or one-time items that have been benefiting. I think most of those seem to impact the non-subscription business. A couple of them seem to apply to subscription. But I guess when you think about the non -- the traditional like subscription business, is it the pricing or is it the low attrition, like, what\u2019s happening the biggest impact and maybe if you think about the net written premium growth in 2022 versus 2021, how should we be thinking about that with regard to pricing in 2024? Thanks.\nElizabeth Mann: Thanks, Toni. Yeah. So on the subscription growth side, I would call out kind of the top three drivers to the strong subscription growth. The first is across the forms, rules and loss cost business, and that includes both the pricing dynamic that we talked about, as well as the low historical industry liquidations or consolidation. The second biggest factor -- the second biggest contributor to growth in subscriptions has been the anti-fraud business, particularly with the transition from the previously transactional customers to the claims essential bundle that has been adding to subscription growth. And then third, on the property, estimating solutions, subscription growth has been strong this quarter, driven by continued contractor usage and as well as insurance carrier usage, given the weather events. So those have been the main drivers of subscription growth. It is broad-based. It is not just a pricing dynamic. I think that\u2019s fair to say. Moving to your question about net written premium and 2022, the Verisk review of the 2022 net written premiums is not yet published, but the A.M. Best data came out recently. It showed 8.4% of net written premium growth across the U.S. P&C industry. That\u2019s in line with the preliminary Verisk data that we have quoted previously. So that is a positive tailwind. On the other hand, as Lee highlighted, some of the challenges on inflation and profitability, the A.M. Best data also shows a 15% increase in losses with overall combined ratios above 100%. So that points to the challenges facing the carriers, and the difficulty and profitability for which many of our solutions and products are designed to help them address.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. I just had a question on the margins. I know you reiterated the number. I was just hoping you could give us an update on how much of the long-term kind of cost actions have been taken, as you did last quarter. And I was just curious, the talk on gen AI and then I think you had CapEx going up as well. Is that -- I mean, if you have to spend more on that, does that change your perhaps range of margin outcomes thinking a couple of years out?\nElizabeth Mann: Yeah. Thanks, Manav, for the question. A couple of comments on the margins. I think as we have highlighted before, I think, we said that about 90% of the cost actions would be seen within the run rate in 2023, so we are largely working through that. I think that as we look -- we have called out previously some of the investments kind of on the business side, maybe just to give some color for the quarter, the M&A has been probably a 40-basis-point headwind for the quarter from recent acquisitions. The investments that we are doing in the business on the cloud side, as well as the ERP investments and the renormalization of T&E, all add up to about 90-basis-point headwind for the quarter. And then finally, as a non-operating item, the pension has been a 50-basis-point headwind for the quarter. Going forward in terms of investment in technology, look, we continue -- our margin targets continue to support as they have been already our investments in technology. To the extent, as Lee highlighted, we are in early days on reviewing some of the opportunities with our clients and some new opportunities opened up with gen AI. So to the extent we learn more, we will come back to you on that in the future.\nLee Shavel: Yeah. And I would just add, I think, on a lot of those investment opportunities, they are more CapEx driven than OpEx driven at this point. And we have given you our targets that we are very focused on achieving, while at the same time, continuing to maintain the necessary investment, both in OpEx and CapEx to make certain that we are delivering on our top priority, which is organic growth in the business.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Greg Peters with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nGreg Peters: Good morning, Lee, Elizabeth and Stacey. I am going to focus my question on the transactional revenue component. And I am curious if there is a reporting lag and some of your transactional revenue. For example, you called out the benefit from auto in the second quarter yet. We are seeing some of the large auto insurance companies really cut back in their marketing expenses in their second quarter results. And would it be appropriate for us to match property transactional revenue with either PCS events and/or hurricane activity, because you called that out in one of your answers? Thank you.\nLee Shavel: So, Greg, thanks for the question. I will take kind of the first half. And I would say, first, we have a lot of complex factors in the overall financial reported results. The marketing dimension is being reflected in weaker performance in our Verisk Marketing Solutions and so I think we are experiencing that. The shopping activity, however, does generate some offsetting revenue as people are exploring potential rate opportunities that are out there. On the homeowners, I think there are so many different products that react in different ways to the dynamics. It\u2019s hard to tie them to a single metric. And I would also just make a comment that, the activity in auto is really being driven right now by consumer activity rather than carrier activity at this point. So, hopefully, it\u2019s not a -- probably a satisfying answer, but it\u2019s very difficult to tie the performance -- the financial performance in a broad sense to kind of specific leading indicators on the auto side, it\u2019s just too many factors going on.\nGreg Peters: Understand. It\u2019s intrigued [ph] question. Thanks for the time.\nLee Shavel: Thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist. Your line is open.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hi. Good morning, everybody. Appreciate you taking the question. Lee, I continue to be intrigued by some of the conversations around moving up into the C-suite and perhaps sort of expanding the scope of your relationships with some of the carriers given relatively low sort of share of net written premium. Can you just talk about a little bit how you think that will affect the long-term trajectory of your revenue growth and if that\u2019s still a benefit sort of yet to come over the next several years?\nLee Shavel: Yeah. Thank you very much for the question, Andrew. And it has been something that I have emphasized across the enterprise. And we have really been pleasantly surprised at the receptivity that we have had at that level where I don\u2019t think we had really prosecuted that dialogue as effectively or in a coordinated fashion as we probably should have. And this -- in the past two weeks, I have had conversations at the CEO level with three executives of our -- of large clients or partners of ours, actually four over the past three weeks. And in one instance, it was very clear, the CEO was focused on the impact of climate change on their business model over the long-term and they asked us to come in and give a broader perspective on what we see in terms of the impact of the longer term model and how we see that potentially impacting their underwriting decisions within geographies. So tying together some of our underwriting benchmark and analysis with our longer term weather trends. That\u2019s an opportunity for us to tie together some of our data sets and analytics. In another conversation, there was a focus around some of the regulatory challenges on rate approval. So it was an opportunity for us to deliver some of our expertise around non-rate actions to enable the carriers to realize some lift on the rate side. And in the third instance, there was a recognition that the client was facing some technology and process challenges as they were trying to move their organization forward where we could lend some technical support in building and helping them build technology that meets their client needs more effectively. And in each of those, I think, it opened up opportunities for us to tie our data sets together to deliver an integrated product. And the other dynamic is that, I think, when you have that support at the C-suite rather than us pushing product up within the organization, you have a mandate that motivates and energizes that client if we can demonstrate real value. And I think we are really just at the early stages of that as we find opportunities to address these broader needs that then can be expanded to new industry solutions across the -- across all of our client sets. So at this stage, I think, what you are seeing in our performance is some beneficial environment, the focus within certain of our businesses, energy released by some of our organizational changes, but I think we are still at a very early stage in expanding and opening a more strategic relationship and partnership with our clients.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Very thorough. Thanks.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJeff Silber: Thank you so much. Elizabeth, I think, you called out about a half a dozen items that you think may not recur in the second half of the year. I know it may be difficult to quantify the impact on that. But is it possible to quantify the impact those items had either in the first half of the year or maybe just the past quarter?\nElizabeth Mann: Thanks for the question, Jeff. Yeah. We haven\u2019t quantified kind of the components of each of these. I would say two things. As I have listed out factors on contributing to subscription and transactional growth. Those have been in order of magnitude to help you size them up. And the other point, we have a rough rule of thumb of calling out kind of one-time events that are -- that contribute more than 1% to revenue growth, none of these single factors hit that threshold.\nLee Shavel: And I would say\u2026\nJeff Silber: Okay.\nLee Shavel: \u2026you can certainly see some of the outperformance relative to our long-term targets and so some significant portion of that delta reflects those one-time elements, otherwise, they would be part of our normal operating cost. So I think it gives you some kind of sense of the scale of the impact of some of these.\nJeff Silber: Okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks so much.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is open.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to circle back on marketing solutions. I think you called out in the prepared remarks or in the slide deck that you continue to see some pressure there and new customer acquisition spend is low amongst the carriers. Any signs of moderation there, it does seem like, in general, they continue to pull back. I think the expectation previously was that was going to improve in the second half. Just wondering what kind of the latest temperature check is there and what\u2019s kind of baked into guidance in terms of a recovery?\nLee Shavel: Yeah. And -- thank you, Andrew. I think you are reading the situation correctly. The carriers are pulling back on marketing expense, largely driven by uncertainty around whether they can underwrite profitably within certain markets or product lines and that is having an effect -- it had an effect for us in the first half and based upon what we are seeing, we do expect that effect to continue in the second half for that business. It\u2019s a small part of our business. But I want to come back and emphasize that there\u2019s clearly shopping appetite. As consumers naturally are seeing higher rates, there is a desire to find a more competitive alternative to what they have currently and so that latent energy is there. I think we expect over time that as the regulators approve some of the rate increases and we are seeing some positive signs on that as we alluded to in some of our earlier comments that, that will give us a greater opportunity to support our carriers and our clients with that marketing analysis. But one thing I want to emphasize that longer term, the demand from our clients were sophisticated analytics around how are they -- who is looking to shop for insurance in an online context, what are they looking for, how can we deliver the right product at the right time is something that they are strategically committed to and we see a broad and growing opportunity to continue to serve that, notwithstanding some of the marketing headwinds that we are experiencing in the industry.\nAndrew Nicholas: Understood. Thanks, Lee.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.\nAlex Kramm: Yes. Hey. Good morning, everyone. I maybe scrutinizing the guidance change a little bit too much, but just a quick question about the margin. When I look at the change in guidance on before in revenue and on EBITDA, it seems like the incremental margins you are implying here are at the midpoint in the low 40s and even at the high end only 50%. So, again, this may be just like some of the, like, a number thing, but I am just wondering why the incremental margins on the outperformance would be lower than your overall margins? Is it performance-based payments, is it incremental investing or is it just the mix of business?\nElizabeth Mann: Yeah. Thanks, Alex. Good question. One is they are each ranges, so there is some range there. But I would say, in general, there\u2019s a couple of different things. One is the M&A, the incremental M&A that\u2019s been added since we gave guidance. Obviously, as we have talked about the pattern where our recent acquisitions typically have lower margins than our existing business. Some of it -- yeah, there\u2019s a little bit of business mix across the full year. There is -- there are incentive-based payments based on the strong performance in the year-to-date. And in general, there\u2019s some seasonality in our margins. But finally, also there is -- as we talked about before, there\u2019s investment over the course of the year as we look to balance efficient operation with also our goals for long-term sustainable growth.\nAlex Kramm: Fair enough. Thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Russell Quelch with Redburn. Your line is open.\nRussell Quelch: Hi. [Technical Difficulty]\nLee Shavel: I am sorry. Operator, we can -- it\u2019s not legible or we are not able to hear what the analysts are saying.\nOperator: Sir, yes, we have a very garbled connection. If you could try reconnecting and rejoining the queue, please?\nRussell Quelch: Sure. Is that better now?\nOperator: It is. Thank you.\nRussell Quelch: Thank you. Apologies for that and thank you for having me on. So the question was, could you give us the H1 revenue numbers for the marketing business, the ES [ph] business and the life insurance and the international businesses so we can assess you versus the numbers that you gave at the Investor Day earlier in this year. And also, I wondered if you might consider increasing disclosure going forward so we can better assess the growth in the business, now it\u2019s solely an insurance business? Thank you.\nElizabeth Mann: Thanks for the question, Russell. Yeah. We don\u2019t give that level of disclosure at the moment on our businesses. The Investor Day was to give a long-term -- a sense of our long-term overall portfolio and was more disclosure than we have ever given in the past. So we will take your feedback on that and consider it.\nRussell Quelch: Okay. It was worth a try. And then just a quick follow-up on the revenue to CapEx. I appreciate that\u2019s higher than most of your peers and I heard you talk earlier about incremental investment from a CapEx perspective for AI. I wondered if you would be willing to take that revenue to CapEx ratio over 10% if you were to see a great opportunity to invest in AI opportunities in the next couple of years?\nElizabeth Mann: So thanks for the question. In terms of CapEx as a percent of revenue, again, we have talked about it, that\u2019s not a metric that we target. What we target is strong returns on invested capital for our capital deployment. But if you are benchmarking against our peers, there\u2019s two things that you have to keep in mind in terms of CapEx as a percent of revenue. One is our very high margins, which would make the CapEx as a percent of revenue skewed and maybe we should look at CapEx as a percent of EBITDA or free cash flow. The second point is that our R&D is very low, just given the way that we classify items. And so you should look at CapEx plus R&D, and on that basis, you would get to a more normalized level. As to kind of where we would take it, I think at Investor Day, I pointed to a similar range of sort of high single digits area and we continue to assess what the opportunity is and what\u2019s the best way to create value for shareholders.\nRussell Quelch: Okay. Good stuff. Thanks for that and apologies for the connection issues.\nElizabeth Mann: Thanks, Russell.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Ashish Sabadra with RBC. Your line is open.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to drill down further on the new product innovation. Lee, you mentioned several new products that were launched in the quarter that are gaining traction with customers. I was wondering how do you track those KPIs internally and is there anything that you can share externally on how we can track the success that you are having with this new Verisk initiative and the new product innovation over the near-term, but also over the next three years to five years? Thanks.\nLee Shavel: Yeah. Thank you, Ashish. I think given the scale of these and that they are deeply embedded, this is something where I think we will continue to describe anecdotally our success and what we -- our traction with clients around these. But it\u2019s at a level of detail, and certainly, at this stage, isn\u2019t a significant financial impact and so we won\u2019t be providing specific items around that. But I think they reflect a few of a larger portfolio of investments that we make across the business that over time we expect can be contributors to perhaps tie it to other innovations that we have made are LightSpeed suite of products is an example of where we identified a need, we developed an application and now that has been a significant contributor to growth as we have been able to help our clients grow their or improve their ability to deliver a bindable quote on an accelerated basis. So there are throughout the organization, a large portfolio of these opportunities. It\u2019s not limited to the two or three that I have described and so it\u2019s probably an overwhelming level of detail to kind of share all of that with you. But it\u2019s a fundamental part of our process of finding ways to add value for all of our clients.\nAshish Sabadra: Okay. That\u2019s great color. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our next question from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nStephanie Moore: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your strategy within Europe for your international business, maybe you could touch on how organic growth is trending, also your thoughts on any kind of acquisitions or that could help you kind of further gain critical mass going forward? Thank you.\nLee Shavel: Yeah. Thank you, Stephanie. And the international opportunity for us is one that we pursue in -- with a couple of approaches. And I will start with kind of the natural inclination to see if we can build off of the product sets that we have in the U.S. So there are a variety of underwriting products, for instance, in our participation product, our core lines forms, rules and loss cost businesses, where international buyers see interest in that data and that information and so we have been able to penetrate that market in delivering that product set. We also have claims products that we have developed specific to those international markets. So that is the first stage of our international approach. In addition, as you can imagine, we have made a number of acquisitions in international markets that represent the -- our ability to deliver similar services that we can add value to either by providing additional capital, leveraging our network of relationships, adding technology expertise or improving the efficiency that accelerates the penetration of that marketplace. And then the third element is to be able to tie those together in order to create more composite value or to create a stronger ecosystem. And there, I would point to our specialty business solutions that is a combination and an integration of our original Sequel acquisition with acquisitions like Whitespace, Ignite, Rulebook and most recently Morning Data that is serving the non-standard market or the London market with a broadening and increasingly integrated sets of products that allows us to serve the insurance industry more effectively. So though each of those are elements that we are pursuing in that international dimension. In a broad sense, we have generally been experiencing double-digit growth rates for our international business as a whole, reflecting contributions from all of those. In some cases, we have a life and health travel that has been growing at a high rate as the global travel industry has recovered post-COVID, that\u2019s beginning to normalize and we have other businesses that are automating or augmenting traditional functions in the claims side. Those are some of the businesses that we recently acquired in Germany and in Sweden. And we continue to have success in the U.K. in serving both the general insurance market, as well as the London non-standard excess and surplus market. So there are a lot of elements, but we generally view the international markets as areas where we can bring our expertise and we can augment existing InsurTech players that are effectively serving the industry there.\nStephanie Moore: Great. I appreciate all the color.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nFaiza Alwy: Yes. Hi. Thank you and good morning. So I wanted to talk about the sales growth acceleration. You cited basically environmental factors that have accelerated your growth. But you have also talked about innovation, better dialogue and partnership with your customers. So it seems like the financial impact of that represents more upside over time, but curious how you think about the return on the innovation and some of the cultural things that you are doing. Is that something that you think accelerates that growth by allowing for pricing, improving retention, cross-selling, et cetera.? Has your thinking evolved just over the last few months since you gave your long-term outlook?\nLee Shavel: Yeah. So, Faiza, thanks. There\u2019s a lot rolled up in that question. So I am going to take -- give it the best crack I can here. I think the essence of your question is, as we have come about a year from our exits from the non-insurance businesses and we have described our ambitions for what we can do more broadly with the industry as our culture has evolved, becoming more focused around insurance, do we remain confident that the growth opportunity that we described at Investor Day remains in place? And I think the short answer is yes. We have been really happy with the level of engagement from our clients. I have been very happy with the feeling I have had within the organization of our configuration as an insurance-focused entity. I think that we are putting more energy into looking at how we can tie our data sets and our products together to serve the industry more broadly. And I think that\u2019s also improved the energy around innovating for the industry and we have been focused on how do we do that not only from a bottoms-up standpoint with ideas from our employee base, which are often at the closest to the products and how we add value to those for the benefit of our clients and our ability to realize the commercial benefit, as well as now integrating, I think, stronger input from the top down to make certain that in those conversations with our clients when we have identified an opportunity to address their needs by tying things together that we are productizing that and we are delivering something not just for that client, but something that we can roll out to the industry as a whole. At the core, our economic value proposition is driven by an ability to invest in and develop a solution or an analytic that can serve not just one client, but the industry as a whole, and so our ability to generate to rapidly monetize strong return on that investment and serving as an effective utility for the industry is quite powerful. And so I think everything that we have seen so far is a validation of what our thesis was. And I think we are also reassured that our investors are seeing the results. At an early stage, there\u2019s a lot to build upon and so we are hopeful we will be able to continue to execute against that dynamic.\nFaiza Alwy: Great. Thanks, Lee. Appreciate it.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s call. We thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Lee Shavel",
            "content": "Thanks, Stacey. Good morning and thank you for participating in today's call. I am excited to be with you today to provide an update on how our strategy, focus and results-oriented culture is translating into strong financial performance for Verisk. I will leave the details of the financial results to Elizabeth. But in summary, Verisk delivered continued business momentum in the second quarter, underscored by strong organic revenue growth and solid margin expansion, translating into double-digit profit growth. We are driving these results by focusing on our client's most pressing needs as they deal with an environment marked by elevated underwriting losses, including those from catastrophes and high levels of inflation, leading to pressure on profitability. We have elevated the conversation and directed our sales focus to the solutions in our portfolio best suited to solve those challenges. Our byproduct of the tough operating environment is a hardening of the insurance market as carriers are taking rate actions to help drive improved profitability, leading to stronger net written premium growth. Rate takes time to work through, so we expect this environment to persist into 2024. The cross currents of elevated underwriting losses and increasing pricing in the insurance industry has become a hot topic across the press with headlines about trouble spots like Florida and California. Specific to Florida, since our last update, there has been little change as we have not seen any additional liquidations, though uncertainty remains. We continue to watch the market carefully, particularly as we head into the Atlantic hurricane season. We are also keeping a keen eye out for new financial stability ratings for the Florida market, which we expect in the next few weeks and could identify further deterioration in the market. Recent legislative reforms in the property market are expected to have a positive impact, but it may take some time for that to materialize. In California, current regulation restricts insurers from using catastrophe models and ratemaking, but the Department of Insurance is exploring a change to that policy. To that end, Verisk recently testified in front of the California State Assembly, joint hearing, insurance and emergency management as the expert on catastrophe models and how their use can help insurers assess risk from low frequency, high severity events like wildfires, ultimately benefiting the residents and businesses in the state. This is a great example of our enhanced industry engagement as we leverage our expertise to benefit all the players in the insurance ecosystem, including carriers and regulators and build resilience for consumers and businesses. As I discussed at Investor Day and on prior calls, a key pillar in our strategy is elevating and strengthening the strategic dialogue with our clients. To that end, I had the opportunity in the second quarter to visit with many of our clients in the U.S. to understand their focus and explore how we can better support their objectives. These conversations generated several initiatives for expanded dialogue with C-suite support to accelerate opportunities on technology and data initiatives, particularly regarding inflationary impacts. During a visit to Europe, I encountered similar opportunities with our clients there, as well as exceptional energy and focus at Verisk offices in London, Malaga, Cracow and Cologne. The message that we hear is very similar across industry participants, large and small, U.S. and international. We welcome Verisk's expertise in partnership to drive more automation, lower our investment cost and improve efficiency. Given our mission-critical data, deep customer relationships and engagement and scale, no one is better positioned to meet this need than Verisk. A key extension of our conversations with our clients is our innovation agenda. We are listening to our customers and designing solutions to meet their most pressing needs. For example, we recently launched a new solution for carriers, contractors and adjusters within our property estimating solutions called XactXpert. XactXpert is a no-code, low-code cloud-based rules engine designed to streamline the insurance restoration and claims estimation process. XactXpert targets the key challenges our clients face, including inaccurate and incomplete information and claims estimates, high compliance needs, pressure to reduce cycle times, revisions, loss adjustment expenses and a need for more digital and simplified processes for a changing workforce demographic. Further, it empowers carriers, contractors and adjusters to customize organizational estimating behaviors, delivering quick, accurate claims estimation by reducing manual input errors and driving consistency, accuracy and efficiency throughout the claims estimating process. We are seeing strong interest from our customers for this newly launched solution. In our anti-fraud solutions, we recently launched Image Forensics, an AI tool designed to detect fraud in digital images submitted as part of the claims settlement process. Image used in claims processing has grown exponentially with more and more images being submitted directly by the claimant. In fact, just since mid-2020, photo estimates for auto claim settlement have doubled and while virtual claims processing is driving industry efficiency and customer satisfaction, it has also exposed insurers to an increasing source of fraud from activities like reusing prior loss images using Internet images or digital or document manipulation. We are leveraging the depth and breadth of our customer's relationships in building a contributory image database, combining it with images sourced from Verisk's property estimating solutions databases to provide images in match reports and indications if an image was used in a prior loss. Image Forensics is also a great example of how our innovation engine is now actively associating data sets that were previously siloed into powerful new tools for our customers as this tool combines data from anti-fraud with data from property estimating solutions. I know that generative AI has been top of mind for many. At Verisk, we have been using artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision and natural language processing in many of our solutions for some time. For example, our Mozart Forms Composer uses machine learning and natural language processing to help insurers organize, track, edit and analyze insurance policy forms with greater consistency, efficiency and speed. This tool employs advanced technology to digitize a historically document-driven process and addresses a major pain point for our clients, managing the complex and growing problem of analyzing policy language across multiple lines and states, while enhancing their ability to customize policy language more quickly. With regard to generative AI, we are currently testing private versions of generative AI and are making an index of possible use cases focused on both customer-facing solutions and internal efficiency opportunities. We are working in partnership with our customers and state regulators to ensure that we are approaching this innovative technology with a focus on ethical use in fairness. Finally, I would like to formally welcome Samantha Vaughan to Verisk as our Chief Privacy Officer. Data governance and stewardship have always been a key focus for Verisk and Vaughan will lead the oversight and enhancement of our policies to protect the data entrusted to Verisk and will help ensure the integrity of Verisk's data practices, regulation and compliance. In addition to the focus and dedicated privacy leadership, our new privacy officer expands on the thought leadership Verisk is providing across the insurance industry. As technology and data capabilities expand, the privacy risks expand as well. Concerns about AI, data risk management and security, all have a key nexus in privacy and we are glad to be joining the best-in-class companies that articulate a values-based approach to the privacy office.  With that, I will hand it over to Elizabeth to review our financial results. Thanks, Elizabeth. In summary, we are excited about the opportunity ahead and our ability to focus all our attention, talent and resources on the global insurance industry. Verisk is best positioned to capitalize on the opportunity because of our scale and expertise. Our motivating purpose is to work together with our clients in building resilience for individuals, communities and businesses globally. The combination of our focused business model, deep customer relationships and strategy to deliver value for clients through improved decision-making and operational efficiency is a formula that we are confident will also deliver value to our shareholders through growth and returns. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. And with that, I will ask the Operator to open the line for questions. And Heather, if I can put a wrapper around the detail that Elizabeth provided, you asked the question initially in terms of a sales dynamic in the second half. And as Elizabeth was describing, these really aren't sales-related elements, they are more environmental factors that contributed to a strong first half that we think are likely to moderate in the second half where we can't have confidence that they will continue to reoccur. So there's nothing that we see that this is predominantly sales driven. It is more environmental. Yeah. So, George, thanks for the question. I mean, I will start off by saying that I think implicit if you go through all of those details that Elizabeth has gone through, it's difficult to predict what that is going to happen. I think the sense is, there is probably some reversion to mean in the ILS market. We had a strong second quarter. It's not -- typically, you see that from quarter-to-quarter, but it's difficult to predict. The shopping activity is one where we are seeing some early trends, but that's going to depend upon macroeconomic factors. So I don't think that, given the nature of that and its particular strength on the transactional side, we are in a position to estimate or predict when that's likely to moderate or simply taking a more conservative point of view around the impact in the second half. And Andrew, to add a little bit of context around that. As Elizabeth described, it has been a benefit, but there are also, I think, the impact of inflation is clearly driving some of that net written premium. We are also seeing the benefit of a hardening market within the insurance as a whole. But the other element is, because of inflation, our costs are going up, that gives us a little bit more scope on the pricing side and we are also continuing to add value to those products, which particularly in this environment with insurance industry focused on improving their efficiency. We have been able in a number of areas to deliver substantial value on that front given those pressures and that -- those elements are probably a larger factor than the pure net written premium. I think we estimate that the portion of our revenues that has some exposure to that is in the 15% to 20% type of range. Yeah. And I would just add, I think, on a lot of those investment opportunities, they are more CapEx driven than OpEx driven at this point. And we have given you our targets that we are very focused on achieving, while at the same time, continuing to maintain the necessary investment, both in OpEx and CapEx to make certain that we are delivering on our top priority, which is organic growth in the business. So, Greg, thanks for the question. I will take kind of the first half. And I would say, first, we have a lot of complex factors in the overall financial reported results. The marketing dimension is being reflected in weaker performance in our Verisk Marketing Solutions and so I think we are experiencing that. The shopping activity, however, does generate some offsetting revenue as people are exploring potential rate opportunities that are out there. On the homeowners, I think there are so many different products that react in different ways to the dynamics. It's hard to tie them to a single metric. And I would also just make a comment that, the activity in auto is really being driven right now by consumer activity rather than carrier activity at this point. So, hopefully, it's not a -- probably a satisfying answer, but it's very difficult to tie the performance -- the financial performance in a broad sense to kind of specific leading indicators on the auto side, it's just too many factors going on. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you very much for the question, Andrew. And it has been something that I have emphasized across the enterprise. And we have really been pleasantly surprised at the receptivity that we have had at that level where I don't think we had really prosecuted that dialogue as effectively or in a coordinated fashion as we probably should have. And this -- in the past two weeks, I have had conversations at the CEO level with three executives of our -- of large clients or partners of ours, actually four over the past three weeks. And in one instance, it was very clear, the CEO was focused on the impact of climate change on their business model over the long-term and they asked us to come in and give a broader perspective on what we see in terms of the impact of the longer term model and how we see that potentially impacting their underwriting decisions within geographies. So tying together some of our underwriting benchmark and analysis with our longer term weather trends. That's an opportunity for us to tie together some of our data sets and analytics. In another conversation, there was a focus around some of the regulatory challenges on rate approval. So it was an opportunity for us to deliver some of our expertise around non-rate actions to enable the carriers to realize some lift on the rate side. And in the third instance, there was a recognition that the client was facing some technology and process challenges as they were trying to move their organization forward where we could lend some technical support in building and helping them build technology that meets their client needs more effectively. And in each of those, I think, it opened up opportunities for us to tie our data sets together to deliver an integrated product. And the other dynamic is that, I think, when you have that support at the C-suite rather than us pushing product up within the organization, you have a mandate that motivates and energizes that client if we can demonstrate real value. And I think we are really just at the early stages of that as we find opportunities to address these broader needs that then can be expanded to new industry solutions across the -- across all of our client sets. So at this stage, I think, what you are seeing in our performance is some beneficial environment, the focus within certain of our businesses, energy released by some of our organizational changes, but I think we are still at a very early stage in expanding and opening a more strategic relationship and partnership with our clients. And I would say... ...you can certainly see some of the outperformance relative to our long-term targets and so some significant portion of that delta reflects those one-time elements, otherwise, they would be part of our normal operating cost. So I think it gives you some kind of sense of the scale of the impact of some of these. Yeah. And -- thank you, Andrew. I think you are reading the situation correctly. The carriers are pulling back on marketing expense, largely driven by uncertainty around whether they can underwrite profitably within certain markets or product lines and that is having an effect -- it had an effect for us in the first half and based upon what we are seeing, we do expect that effect to continue in the second half for that business. It's a small part of our business. But I want to come back and emphasize that there's clearly shopping appetite. As consumers naturally are seeing higher rates, there is a desire to find a more competitive alternative to what they have currently and so that latent energy is there. I think we expect over time that as the regulators approve some of the rate increases and we are seeing some positive signs on that as we alluded to in some of our earlier comments that, that will give us a greater opportunity to support our carriers and our clients with that marketing analysis. But one thing I want to emphasize that longer term, the demand from our clients were sophisticated analytics around how are they -- who is looking to shop for insurance in an online context, what are they looking for, how can we deliver the right product at the right time is something that they are strategically committed to and we see a broad and growing opportunity to continue to serve that, notwithstanding some of the marketing headwinds that we are experiencing in the industry. I am sorry. Operator, we can -- it's not legible or we are not able to hear what the analysts are saying. Yeah. Thank you, Ashish. I think given the scale of these and that they are deeply embedded, this is something where I think we will continue to describe anecdotally our success and what we -- our traction with clients around these. But it's at a level of detail, and certainly, at this stage, isn't a significant financial impact and so we won't be providing specific items around that. But I think they reflect a few of a larger portfolio of investments that we make across the business that over time we expect can be contributors to perhaps tie it to other innovations that we have made are LightSpeed suite of products is an example of where we identified a need, we developed an application and now that has been a significant contributor to growth as we have been able to help our clients grow their or improve their ability to deliver a bindable quote on an accelerated basis. So there are throughout the organization, a large portfolio of these opportunities. It's not limited to the two or three that I have described and so it's probably an overwhelming level of detail to kind of share all of that with you. But it's a fundamental part of our process of finding ways to add value for all of our clients. Yeah. Thank you, Stephanie. And the international opportunity for us is one that we pursue in -- with a couple of approaches. And I will start with kind of the natural inclination to see if we can build off of the product sets that we have in the U.S. So there are a variety of underwriting products, for instance, in our participation product, our core lines forms, rules and loss cost businesses, where international buyers see interest in that data and that information and so we have been able to penetrate that market in delivering that product set. We also have claims products that we have developed specific to those international markets. So that is the first stage of our international approach. In addition, as you can imagine, we have made a number of acquisitions in international markets that represent the -- our ability to deliver similar services that we can add value to either by providing additional capital, leveraging our network of relationships, adding technology expertise or improving the efficiency that accelerates the penetration of that marketplace. And then the third element is to be able to tie those together in order to create more composite value or to create a stronger ecosystem. And there, I would point to our specialty business solutions that is a combination and an integration of our original Sequel acquisition with acquisitions like Whitespace, Ignite, Rulebook and most recently Morning Data that is serving the non-standard market or the London market with a broadening and increasingly integrated sets of products that allows us to serve the insurance industry more effectively. So though each of those are elements that we are pursuing in that international dimension. In a broad sense, we have generally been experiencing double-digit growth rates for our international business as a whole, reflecting contributions from all of those.

Those are some of the businesses that we recently acquired in Germany and in Sweden. And we continue to have success in the U.K. in serving both the general insurance market, as well as the London non-standard excess and surplus market. So there are a lot of elements, but we generally view the international markets as areas where we can bring our expertise and we can augment existing InsurTech players that are effectively serving the industry there. Yeah. So, Faiza, thanks. There's a lot rolled up in that question. So I am going to take -- give it the best crack I can here. I think the essence of your question is, as we have come about a year from our exits from the non-insurance businesses and we have described our ambitions for what we can do more broadly with the industry as our culture has evolved, becoming more focused around insurance, do we remain confident that the growth opportunity that we described at Investor Day remains in place?

            "name": "Elizabeth Mann",
            "content": "Thanks, Lee, and good morning to everyone on the call. I am pleased to share that Verisk delivered strong second quarter financial results. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue was $675 million, up 10% versus the prior year and income from continuing operations was $204 million, up 18% versus the prior year, reflecting strong growth across both underwriting and claims. Diluted GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.35, up 9% versus the prior year. Moving to our organic constant currency results adjusted for non-operating items, as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, our operating results demonstrated strong and broad-based growth from most of our businesses, aided by some in-period transactional benefits. In the second quarter, OCC revenues grew 9.8% and with growth of 9.3% in underwriting and 11.2% in claims. This quarter's result was boosted by certain transactional revenues that we do not expect to repeat in the back half of the year. Our subscription revenues, which comprised 79% of our total revenue in the quarter, grew 9.1% on an OCC basis. We saw contributions across nearly all of our subscription offerings. More specifically on the drivers of growth in subscription revenues, during the quarter, we experienced the continued benefit on certain of our revenues from the stronger net prem -- net written premium growth in 2021, which is currently reflected in some of our contract pricing. In anti-fraud, we are driving accelerated growth from the successful conversion to subscription from previously transactional customers through our claims essential bundle. And in property estimating solutions, we continue to benefit from strong contractor subscription growth as contractors are realizing the value of being part of the Verisk network, particularly with the active weather patterns we are undergoing. In fact, according to Verisk's Property Claim Services, PCS, in 70-plus years of history, this was the most active first half of the year on record from a weather event perspective, dominated by hail, wind and thunderstorms. Finally, liquidations and consolidation across the industry was lower than historic average during the quarter, but we continue to anticipate some normalization in the second half of the year. Our transactional revenues representing 21% of total revenue in the second quarter, grew 12.4% on an OCC basis. The largest contributor to growth for the second consecutive quarter was from our auto solutions, driven by increased rate shopping by consumers and the continuation of a large non-rate action deal with a national insurer that we told you about last quarter. Our trends are reflective of those noted by recent J.D. Power data, which pointed to a 13% increase in shopping activity for auto insurance in the second quarter as consumers react to rate increases. However, J.D. Power also noted that carrier switching increased a much more modest 4%, which may suggest a potential slowing of the market going forward.  In addition to gains in auto, our transactional revenue growth also benefited from double-digit growth from life insurance solutions as we are seeing strong customer demand for incremental services. And within our extreme events business, we saw a very strong transactional growth related to securitization, as the second quarter marked a record for new issuance in the catastrophe bond market. I will remind you that the catastrophe bond market is seasonal and we do not expect this level of activity to continue in the second half of 2023. These transactional results also included some one-time benefits, including overage charges on specific large underwriting contracts that renewed in the quarter.  Moving now to our adjusted EBITDA results. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 12.6% in the second quarter, reflecting core operating leverage on the strong revenue growth and the impact of certain cost reduction actions we have taken in connection with our margin expansion objectives. Total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results was 54.1%, up 160 basis points from the reported results in the prior year. On a pro forma basis for all divestitures, the second quarter margin expanded 140 basis points from margins of 52.7% in Q2 2022. The margin rate in any given quarter can be influenced by the revenue mix, leading to a seasonal pattern in our margins. As such, we think it's helpful to look at our margins on a trailing 12-month basis [Technical Difficulty] within the second quarter were 53.1% on a trailing 12-month basis, up 140 basis points over the prior period.  The year-over-year change in the second quarter margin reflects the impact of certain one-time expenses in the prior year quarter, as well as strong cost and operational discipline and the impact of our cost reduction program. This was offset in part by higher levels of performance-based compensation, including commissions related to our stronger year-to-date performance, as well as a decrease in our pension credit, negative margin impact from recent acquisitions and higher T&E expenses. Reflecting on our ongoing cost reduction plans, we continue to run the margin targets that we articulated in our 2023 guidance and at Investor Day in mid-March. Continuing down the income statement. Net interest expense was $31.6 million for the second quarter, compared to $31.9 million in the prior year. With the divestitures now behind us, the proceeds from the sales directed to our $2.5 billion accelerated share repurchase plan and the long-term capital structure now in place, we now expect this current level of net interest expense to be at a similar quarterly run rate for the remainder of the year. On taxes, our reported effective tax rate was 23.8%, compared to 19.2% in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year change in the tax rate is related to lower stock compensation benefits in this quarter versus the prior year's period. Going forward, we still expect the tax rate for the remainder of the year to be in the originally guided range of 23% to 25%. Adjusted net income increased 8.5% to $219.8 million and diluted adjusted EPS increased 18.9% to $1.51 for the second quarter 2023. These changes reflect organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions and a lower average share count, offset in part by a higher tax rate. With regard to the share count, we received the vast majority of the shares from the $2.5 billion accelerated share repurchase plan when we entered into the plan back in March, and while we did not make any repurchases in the second quarter, we do have the ability to repurchase some additional shares outside of the ASR, and we may do so in the future. From a cash flow perspective, net cash from operating activities increased 48% to $193 million due to strong operations and a decrease in cash taxes paid. The decrease in taxes paid is primarily related to the non-recurring gain on the three disposition in the prior year quarter. Though there was also a one-time cash tax payment of $17 million paid in the second quarter of 2023 related to the energy divestiture. I will remind you that the prior year cash flow metrics include the results from previously divested businesses. Turning to guidance. Given our strong half -- strong first half performance, as well as the contribution from recent acquisitions, we are increasing our financial outlook for 2023. We have posted a summary of all guidance measures in the earnings deck on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. Specifically, for 2023, we now expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $2.63 billion to $2.66 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.39 billion to $1.43 billion. We continue to expect adjusted EBITDA margins to be in the range of 53% to 54%. Walking further down the P&L, we still expect fixed asset D&A to be between $175 million and $195 million, and intangible amortization to be approximately $70 million. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to currency variability, the timing of purchases, the completion of projects and future M&A activity.  Regarding capital expenditures, we now expect CapEx to be between $220 million and $240 million, reflecting increases associated with recent acquisitions, as well as our continued focus on investing organically behind our highest return on investment opportunities. These include a modernization of our forms, rules and loss costs, a migration of our extreme events platform to a cloud-native architecture and further investments across our growth businesses. We are also investing in an upgrade of our financial and human capital system that will enable future efficiencies once implemented. As previously communicated, we expect the tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%, bringing adjusted earnings per share to a range of $5.50 to $5.70. And now I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments. Yes. Heather, thanks for the question. We have been very happy in the first half that we have been kind of firing on all cylinders. We have a diversified business within the insurance space and we have called out a number of different environmental or industry factors where the revenue growth in the first half may not be sustained into the second half. And so for those -- just to reiterate them, I think, there's no fewer than six different factors that have contributed to the strength in the first half. To go through those, there has been low attrition and consolidation in the industry, which has the potential to renormalize in the second half of the year and in the future. Second, the level of auto shopping activity driving transactional volume in our auto insurance business, they moderate. Third, the level of weather activity has been elevated in the first half, although no specific catastrophe events and also related to weather is the fact that there was obviously a large hurricane in the fourth quarter of last year. So that will create a difficult comp in the fourth quarter. Fourth on the list of reasons for strength. In our anti-fraud business, we have been driving strong growth by converting transactional customers to subscription in our claims essential bundle. We will start to lap that benefit, which started roughly this time last year. Fifth, we talked about the securitizations and the strength of the ILS market, which was elevated in the second quarter and we don't expect that to continue. And then, lastly, we had called out various technical items like billing catch-ups or overages and the extra business day in the quarter. All of those have been contributing to the 9.8% and revenue growth, which has been above our long-term sustainable 6% to 8% target and may not continue in the second half. Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. It is helping this year's revenue growth and we are looking back to 2021 on our 2023 contract. I think we have previously called out that was a 9.6% net written premium growth across the industry. And as I called out, the factors of strength in our subscription growth that and the strength in our forms, rules and loss cost business has probably been the largest contributor to our subscription growth. Thanks, Toni. Yeah. So on the subscription growth side, I would call out kind of the top three drivers to the strong subscription growth. The first is across the forms, rules and loss cost business, and that includes both the pricing dynamic that we talked about, as well as the low historical industry liquidations or consolidation. The second biggest factor -- the second biggest contributor to growth in subscriptions has been the anti-fraud business, particularly with the transition from the previously transactional customers to the claims essential bundle that has been adding to subscription growth. And then third, on the property, estimating solutions, subscription growth has been strong this quarter, driven by continued contractor usage and as well as insurance carrier usage, given the weather events. So those have been the main drivers of subscription growth. It is broad-based. It is not just a pricing dynamic. I think that's fair to say. Moving to your question about net written premium and 2022, the Verisk review of the 2022 net written premiums is not yet published, but the A.M. Best data came out recently. It showed 8.4% of net written premium growth across the U.S. P&C industry. That's in line with the preliminary Verisk data that we have quoted previously. So that is a positive tailwind. On the other hand, as Lee highlighted, some of the challenges on inflation and profitability, the A.M. Best data also shows a 15% increase in losses with overall combined ratios above 100%. So that points to the challenges facing the carriers, and the difficulty and profitability for which many of our solutions and products are designed to help them address. Yeah. Thanks, Manav, for the question. A couple of comments on the margins. I think as we have highlighted before, I think, we said that about 90% of the cost actions would be seen within the run rate in 2023, so we are largely working through that. I think that as we look -- we have called out previously some of the investments kind of on the business side, maybe just to give some color for the quarter, the M&A has been probably a 40-basis-point headwind for the quarter from recent acquisitions. The investments that we are doing in the business on the cloud side, as well as the ERP investments and the renormalization of T&E, all add up to about 90-basis-point headwind for the quarter. And then finally, as a non-operating item, the pension has been a 50-basis-point headwind for the quarter. Going forward in terms of investment in technology, look, we continue -- our margin targets continue to support as they have been already our investments in technology. To the extent, as Lee highlighted, we are in early days on reviewing some of the opportunities with our clients and some new opportunities opened up with gen AI. So to the extent we learn more, we will come back to you on that in the future. Thanks for the question, Jeff. Yeah. We haven't quantified kind of the components of each of these. I would say two things. As I have listed out factors on contributing to subscription and transactional growth. Those have been in order of magnitude to help you size them up. And the other point, we have a rough rule of thumb of calling out kind of one-time events that are -- that contribute more than 1% to revenue growth, none of these single factors hit that threshold. Yeah. Thanks, Alex. Good question. One is they are each ranges, so there is some range there. But I would say, in general, there's a couple of different things. One is the M&A, the incremental M&A that's been added since we gave guidance. Obviously, as we have talked about the pattern where our recent acquisitions typically have lower margins than our existing business. Some of it -- yeah, there's a little bit of business mix across the full year. There is -- there are incentive-based payments based on the strong performance in the year-to-date. And in general, there's some seasonality in our margins. But finally, also there is -- as we talked about before, there's investment over the course of the year as we look to balance efficient operation with also our goals for long-term sustainable growth. Thanks for the question, Russell. Yeah. We don't give that level of disclosure at the moment on our businesses. The Investor Day was to give a long-term -- a sense of our long-term overall portfolio and was more disclosure than we have ever given in the past. So we will take your feedback on that and consider it. So thanks for the question. In terms of CapEx as a percent of revenue, again, we have talked about it, that's not a metric that we target. What we target is strong returns on invested capital for our capital deployment. But if you are benchmarking against our peers, there's two things that you have to keep in mind in terms of CapEx as a percent of revenue. One is our very high margins, which would make the CapEx as a percent of revenue skewed and maybe we should look at CapEx as a percent of EBITDA or free cash flow. The second point is that our R&D is very low, just given the way that we classify items. And so you should look at CapEx plus R&D, and on that basis, you would get to a more normalized level. As to kind of where we would take it, I think at Investor Day, I pointed to a similar range of sort of high single digits area and we continue to assess what the opportunity is and what's the best way to create value for shareholders. Thanks, Russell."

For opening remarks and introductions, I would now like to turn the call over to Verisk Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.\nStacey Brodbar : Thank you, Mandeep, and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our first quarter 2023 financial results. On the call today are Lee Shavel, Verisk's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Elizabeth Mann, Chief Financial Officer. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as our traditional quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. As set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance, including those related to our financial guidance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that the financial results for recent dispositions are included in our consolidated and GAAP results but are excluded from all organic constant currency growth figures. A reconciliation of reported and historic non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call is provided in our 8-K and today's earnings presentation posted on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com.  However, we are not able to provide a reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable expected GAAP results because of the unreasonable effort and high unpredictability of estimating certain items that are excluded from projected non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, including, for example, tax consequences, acquisition-related costs, gain/loss from dispositions and other nonrecurring expenses, the effect of which may be significant. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee Shavel.\nLee Shavel : Thanks, Stacey. Good morning, and thank you for participating in today's call. At our Investor Day in mid-March, we detailed the benefits of being an insurance-focused business and our comprehensive strategy to drive consistent, predictable growth at Verisk. Our first quarter results demonstrate the sharpened focus and results-oriented operating plan at Verisk. We are operating on a more integrated basis across the company and have been more engaged with our clients, as I'll describe in greater detail. I will leave it to Elizabeth to walk through the details of the financials. But in summary, we delivered very strong organic revenue growth combined with solid margin expansion yielding double-digit profit growth. The growth was broad-based with most businesses contributing to the result, and we have strong business momentum. We delivered this performance despite a macroeconomic environment marked by high inflation, interest rate volatility and market anxiety. Specific to the insurance industry, our customers are coming off a year marked by elevated underwriting losses and pressure on profitability. In fact, the U.S. property casualty insurers experienced a $27 billion net underwriting loss in 2022, the largest loss since 2011, according to industry data collected by Verisk and the American Property Casualty Insurance Association. Moreover, profitability was under pressure as reflected in deteriorating combined ratios at 103% in 2022 versus almost 100% in 2021. One consequence of this tough loss in profitability environment in 2022 has been a hardening insurance market where rate increases are driving faster net written premium growth in the first quarter reports of many major insurers. Verisk is partnering with the industry to help them reduce costs, better select and price risk, root out fraud and overall operate more efficiently, given the macro environment. One problem area has been the state of Florida. As we have discussed in prior calls, the insurance crisis in Florida is being driven by a litigious environment, further complicated by extreme event vulnerability. The combined impact is pushing insurers into insolvency. The state legislature has passed reforms to address the crisis, and there are currently efforts be negotiated to bring increased oversight to the state's insurance market. That said, the risk for more liquidations remains. And we continue to monitor both the primary and reinsurance markets closely while leaning in with our customers to help them adapt to new legislation, to better select and price risk in the state and to identify the systemic bad actors in the market. A second area of challenge has been auto underwriting as insurers pulled back on writing new policies as they awaited regulatory approval for rate increases. Rate actions have started to roll through. And in the first quarter, we saw a rebound in policyholder shopping activity in response to higher rates, driving strong transactional revenue growth for Verisk this quarter. That said, we have yet to see behavior change on the part of the underwriters as they are still cautious about spending on marketing and underwriting new policies. We continue to expect that improvement in the back half of the year. One key pillar in our strategy that we discussed at Investor Day is being a more client-centric organization and the importance of strengthening the strategic dialogue with our clients and intensifying our industry engagement. To that end, I've been leading the organization with direct client engagement through full relationship reviews at several of our largest clients where we've been able to identify how we can best serve them and integrate new solutions to meet their specific objectives. I've also hosted our first CEO roundtable, where we brought together the leaders of our clients to discuss the issues that are foremost in their minds and where we can leverage our centrality and expertise to help address these issues. This has been followed by a client Chief Information Officer roundtable, where we brought our technology leadership headed by our CIO, Nick Daffan; and Chief Data Officer, Eric Schneider, to discuss technology and analytics trends that are on the minds of insurance industry CIOs. In particular, generative AI was a hot topic. And we discussed how we can help the industry develop safe, ethical and effective use cases and guide policy. Our clients are recognizing the early benefits of change and focus at Verisk and have provided great feedback. A recent quote from an important client stated, I can't remember a meeting with this degree of transparent dialogue where I felt like Verisk was listening. Our recent NPS scores also reflect this change in perception. Verisk conducts customer relationship surveys twice a year. And our recent NPS scores in the first quarter of 2023 were 47, up 4 points versus this time last year. Further, so far this year, we have hosted 3 in-person client events. At all our events, clients can engage with our solutions and hear directly from those clients who use the products in the market and learn how effective they are in helping solve industry challenges. More specifically, in February, our claims business hosted 2 events, including Elevate, our signature event for claims and restoration professionals, which provided educational and networking sessions for over 600 industry professionals. We also hosted almost 300 industry participants at IFM, an industry-wide event targeting the latest issues and advances in fraud management. In the U.S. alone, insurance fraud is estimated to cost the industry $300 billion annually, impacting industry profitability, and Verisk is uniquely positioned to help the industry. We host this event in partnership with the National Insurance Crime Bureau. Both events included expert panel discussions featuring our clients and partners, leading academics and thought leaders in the industry covering top-of-mind issues. In April, we hosted the inaugural Verisk Insurance Conference and hosted almost 600 clients for a 4-day multitrack conference designed to deliver a combination of product and thought leadership-focused content to key extreme events, life and underwriting decision-makers in insurance and reinsurance. This comprehensive event, which combined 3 previously separate events, enabled us to educate our clients and prospects about Verisk's end-to-end capabilities while continuing to provide them with valuable content applicable to their specific role in organization. It raised the awareness of the breadth and depth of solutions we offer to solve the industry's biggest challenges and really highlighted the benefits of the integrated Verisk approach. We saw a great response to this event with almost half of the extreme events professionals attending underwriting sessions and 40% of the underwriting attendees joining an extreme event session. A recent notable competitive contract win in our Extreme Events business is a great example of the benefits of being more focused and more integrated across Verisk. We recently signed a large multiyear contract expansion with a global insurer for extreme events platform, Touchstone. This client, who is already a subscriber to our property underwriting data solutions, will partner with Verisk in a workflow that will directly integrate those data solutions into the Touchstone platform. This partnership not only allows the client to obtain an enhanced view of their catastrophe loss potential based on various data with minimal operational friction, but it also gives Verisk the opportunity to market the feasibility of the same solution to a broader range of market participants. What struck me at both our claims and underwriting events after dozens of client conversations was the genuine enthusiasm our clients have for our ability to help them address industry issues with our scale and centrality. A commonly expressed sentiment is Verisk has a unique perspective, and we know you can help us. This is a tremendous privilege for us, and we are more mindful of our responsibility to create value for our clients and stakeholders. We are particularly excited about the opportunity it represents to find new channels for growth. On the technological transformation front, we recently achieved a major milestone as we have successfully sunset our mainframe. The scope and complexity of this project was massive. And our technology teams worked tirelessly to shut down a 40 year old mainframe in just 5 years. I want to thank my colleagues for their hard work and dedication to modernizing our legacy technology footprint. This move allowed us to modernize our operations and provide a better experience for our customers. Equally importantly, it enables Verisk to allocate more of our technology resources towards innovation to drive future growth. Finally, I wanted to share that we recently published our 2022 corporate social responsibility report. This year's report offers a view of our ESG journey and our work to help build global resilience for individuals, communities and businesses. We continue to pursue sustainability and growth through the lens of a responsible ESG framework. On the environmental front, this year, we established a Climate Advisory Council to glean strategic guidance on climate change and receive climate-related feedback on our forthcoming solutions. Moreover, Verisk's sustainability team is currently working with an independent consultant to help the company complete a report, meeting the expectations set forth by the task force on climate-related financial disclosures. As part of the exercise, we are conducting analysis assessing the impact of climate change, both on Verisk's direct operations and across key elements of its value chain and developing a realistic pathway to support science-based targets and a commitment to net zero targets. The team is also engaging with internal stakeholders regarding Verisk's current risk assessment activities and framework for identifying climate-related opportunities. We expect to publish the report in late 2023. Regarding governance, over the last 12 months, Verisk took steps to enhance our governance at the Board level, including making changes to provide for the annual election of directors and separating the role of Chair and CEO. We also took steps to refresh our Board, welcoming 4 new independent directors, who bring fresh perspectives and valuable skill and experience sets. As of the 2023 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, 4 directors, namely Annell Bay, Chris Foskett, Constantine Iordanou and David Wright will be retiring from the Board. I would like to express my gratitude to each of these directors for their leadership and guidance, which have been invaluable to Verisk's journey and transformation. These changes will bring our Board to a total of 10 members, 90% of whom are independent and 60% are gender or racially diverse. With that, I'll hand it over to Elizabeth to review our financial results.\nElizabeth Mann : Thanks, Lee, and good day to everyone on the call. Before I start with the first quarter results, I have a few reminders for everyone. First, all consolidated and GAAP numbers are negatively impacted by dispositions of 3E and Verisk Financial Services. This will be the final quarter of this year-over-year comparison. Second, as it was in the prior quarter, Wood Mackenzie is accounted for as discontinued operations on our income statement, and results are not included in continuing operations for either period. Third, all cash flow metrics include the results of all 3 disposed businesses in the prior year figures. Turning to the financial results. I am pleased to share that we delivered a strong first quarter. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue was $652 million, up 1% versus the prior year, reflecting growth in Insurance, offset by the impact of the VFS and 3E disposition. Income from continuing operations was $194 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share attributable to Verisk was $1.27. Moving to our organic constant currency results. Adjusted for nonoperating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, we are pleased with our operating results, which demonstrated strong core underlying performance across most of our businesses, aided by some in-period onetime benefits. In the first quarter, OCC revenues grew 9.8% with growth of 9.1% in underwriting and rating and 11.4% in claims. This quarter's results was boosted by certain transactional revenues that we do not expect to repeat for the remainder of 2023. Our subscription revenues, which comprised 80% of total revenue in the quarter, grew 8.7% on an OCC basis. We saw broad-based growth across most of our businesses with strength in core underwriting, property estimating solutions, extreme events, antitrust, life insurance solutions and many of our international businesses. Specific to our core line services, we are experiencing a benefit on certain of our revenues from the stronger net premium growth in 2021, which is currently reflecting in our contract pricing. Working against this is a modest negative impact from the 7 liquidations in Florida that occurred over the last 12 months and which we discussed earlier. We do expect the impact from liquidations overall to become more pronounced as we move throughout the year. Our transactional revenues, representing 20% of total revenue in the first quarter, grew 14.4% on an OCC basis. The largest contributor to growth was from a strong rebound in our auto businesses driven by increased rate shopping and the signing of a large nonrate action deal with national insurer. Additionally, we experienced double-digit growth from life insurance solutions as we are seeing strong customer demand for incremental services. Our travel solutions are benefiting from a post-COVID rebound, particularly in markets like Australia and New Zealand. And our property estimating solutions experienced continued storm benefit in the quarter. These transactional results did include some onetime benefits, including overage charges on specific large underwriting contracts that renewed in the quarter and catch-up billing for certain claims customers. Finally, the casualty workers' compensation business delivered growth in the quarter but continues to remain below pre-COVID level and is recovering at a pace slower than we had originally expected. On the auto underwriting side, we did see solid growth in transaction volume this quarter versus declines last year as rate increases are now driving shopping behavior by policyholders. However, as Lee mentioned earlier, carriers continue to be cautious and have pulled back on marketing spend to attract new customers as they measure the impact of rate increases on profitability. To that end and given the transactional nature of this business, we are cautiously optimistic about the outlook for auto as we move throughout the year. Moving now to our adjusted EBITDA results. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 15.7% in the first quarter, reflecting core operating leverage on the strong revenue growth and the impact of certain cost reduction actions we have taken in connection with our margin expansion objective. Total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results, was 52.2%, up 480 basis points from the reported results in the prior year. On a pro forma basis for all divestitures, the first quarter margin expanded 320 basis points from margins of 49% in Q1 of '22. This reflects the impact of certain onetime expenses in the prior year quarter as well as strong cost and operational discipline and the impact of our cost reduction program. This level of margin also does include several headwinds, which in total represent about 150 basis points and include a decrease in our pension credit, pressures from recent acquisitions and higher T&E expenses, offset by foreign currency realized gains in the quarter. Reflecting on our ongoing cost reduction plan, we continue to have confidence in our ability to deliver on the margin targets that we articulated in our 2023 guidance and at Investor Day in mid-March. During the quarter, we also took actions to put in place a permanent capital structure for the new Verisk as well as actively manage the balance sheet to take advantage of the $3.1 billion in proceeds we received from the closing of the Wood Mackenzie transaction. To that end, in February 23, we paid down $1.4 billion in debt that was outstanding on our revolver. On March 3, we issued $500 million of 10-year senior notes at a rate of 5.75%, bringing our total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter to $2.85 billion. We then entered a $2.5 billion accelerated share repurchase plan and received an initial delivery of 10.7 million shares in the quarter. We expect to receive the final shares when the program is completed in the fourth quarter. The net result of these actions in the quarter was net interest expense of $26.4 million for the first quarter compared to $31.3 million in the prior year. Included in this number was $7.4 million in interest income that we earned on the proceeds of the Wood Mackenzie transaction, which we do not expect to continue as the proceeds are now fully deployed. Having now completed all these transactions, we now expect net interest expense for 2023 to be slightly below the full year 2022 level. On taxes, our reported effective tax rate was 27.1% compared to 17.4% in the prior year quarter. This higher tax rate included a onetime tax charge of $15.2 million associated with the structuring of the energy sale, which closed in the quarter, offset in part by higher stock compensation benefit versus the prior year period. Going forward, we expect the tax rate for the remainder of the year to be in the originally guided range of 23% to 25%. Adjusted net income increased 9.4% to $196.4 million, and diluted adjusted EPS increased 16.2% to $1.29 for the first quarter of 2023. These changes reflect organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions and a lower average share count, offset in part by higher tax rate. We are very pleased with the robust performance in the first quarter. But given that it is still early in the year, our transactional revenues are inherently less predictable. At this time, we are maintaining our outlook for 2023. While the first quarter showed strong operating momentum, based on what we see today, we have not changed our expectations for the balance of the year. To that end, our full year 2023 guidance is unchanged. And now I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments.\nLee Shavel : In summary, we're excited about the opportunity ahead and our ability to focus all our attention, talent and resources on the global insurance industry. Verisk is best positioned to capitalize on the opportunity because of our scale, centrality and expertise. Our motivating purpose is to work together with our clients in building resilience for individuals, communities and businesses globally. The combination of our focused business model, unique market position and strategy to deliver value for clients through improved decision-making and operational efficiency is the formula that will also deliver value to our shareholders through predictable growth and returns. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank.\nFaiza Alwy : I wanted to ask about -- I understand that the transactional revenues you cited, there may be certain onetime items. But on the subscription revenues, you cited increased growth in premium pricing. And it sounds like that should continue. So maybe talk about some of the offsets. I know you mentioned Florida, but if you can further dimensionalize that for us, that would be really helpful.\nElizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks. Happy to. I'll highlight a couple of the drivers of the subscription growth, which was broad-based and some of the potential later in the year. So on the -- the largest driver of the subscription growth was in our forms [indiscernible] business. This was the biggest contributor to the growth, just given the size of it within overall Verisk. And the growth was driven across the contract. Probably about 20% to 25% of our contracts in the business overall are tied to premium growth. We are seeing an environment with strong premium growth with over 9% -- nearly 10% net written premium growth in 2021, which is driving some of those contracts. In addition, we're delivering additional value to our customers and new products, as we highlighted at the Investor Day. So we are partnering with them in this environment. Finally, in that business, in this quarter in particular, there were lower levels of attrition, liquidation or consolidation in the industry than we might typically, something that we're monitoring in the balance of the year. In addition to that business, other contributors to subscription growth, our property estimating solutions business had a strong quarter, somewhat helped by easier comparisons in the last year and some continued storm benefits there. And our anti-fraud business in the claims business is also driving strong growth. That is fueled significantly by conversions to claims essentials, which is a subscription product for third-party administrators and self-insured. That transition from transactional to subscription product started in the back half of last year. So we're still in kind of that overlapping growth period. And finally, extreme events and life, our life solutions business also had strong subscription growth. So collectively, strong contributions across the portfolio.\nLee Shavel: And Faiza, if I would add, I think the other dimension that you were looking for is what might not be sustained given that strong growth in the first quarter. And so there are a couple of things that I would point to. One is that we -- in subscription growth, we have some property estimating solution subscriptions that come on associated with the storms in the fourth quarter. And sometimes those persist. It's hard to predict how long that those will persist. So that's a factor. In addition, as we indicated, the Florida situation and potential further insolvencies would impact that. And then as Elizabeth described, part of the conversion of the -- in the anti-fraud to our claims essentials package, it generates some growth in 2022 and in the early part of 2023. I think we will lap some of that exceptional growth, and that will probably serve as a bit of an offset in the later part of 2023.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JP Morgan.\nAndrew Steinerman: I would just like a little more detail about those certain transactional revenues that were elevated in the first quarter, like which product lines? And what are you assuming for the balance of the year for those same transactional pieces?\nElizabeth Mann: Yes. Happy to cover that. Maybe like the subscription, I'll go through sort of in order of magnitude of the impact to the transactional growth. So the biggest single driver in the underwriting and ratings portion of the business was the recovery in the auto space. There were really 2 elements to this. First was we referenced the nonrate actions deal with a major insurer. And that's a unique opportunity for auto insurers to look across their portfolio and see actions that they can take beyond rate increases. The second element, though, is the overall rebound in shopping behavior, which picked up quite suddenly in the quarter. We've seen industry data that supports it. The J.D. Power data shows a strong increase in auto insurance shopping this quarter. So those 2 factors contributed to our transactional growth. In addition, the -- our life business, which is both a subscription business but has a services implementation component which contributed on the transaction side. In the property estimating solutions, there was -- there continue to be carryover as well as some localized storm activities, the wind storms and tornadoes and some ice storms that you've seen that had a component of an impact. And then there were a couple onetime elements, including some overage charges on contracts in underwriting and rating, billing catch-up in the claims business. There also -- there happened to be an extra business day in the quarter, which will come out in the third quarter. So those were the main elements across the transaction growth.\nAndrew Steinerman: Right. And Elizabeth, I also said, how are you assuming these transactional pieces are guided for, for the balance of the year?\nElizabeth Mann: Yes. So that's encapsulated in our 2023 guidance, which is unchanged.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James.\nGreg Peters : Lee, in your comments, you spoke about the client outreach initiatives, and I think you highlighted a Net Promoter Score of 47, which as far as insurance industry standards is nothing to sneeze at. Can you maybe give us an idea of how you're thinking about improving that score? Is that part of your approach and strategy is you convene all of these panels and meetings with your clients and provide us some perspective on how you're thinking about that, please?\nLee Shavel: Thanks for the question, Greg. So certainly, we view the Net Promoter Score as one gauge of our client satisfaction and enthusiasm for what we do. I wouldn't say that we are targeting our client outreach primarily to drive an increase in NPS. We're hopeful that, that will be a consequence, but our primary purpose is to elevate our dialogue [indiscernible] with our clients, which, as I indicated, I think there's a very strong appetite for because they recognize that with the data sets that we have and our centrality, we have the ability to solve problems for the industry. And the only way that we can identify those as industry issues is by moving and strengthening that dialogue at the top. And I think it does put us in a position where we are beyond addressing their tactical needs in underwriting claims, extreme events modeling, we have the ability to solve bigger problems by tying some of those data sets together. We talked about the integration of our property data into the Touchstone platform, which is an example of how, as part of that higher-level dialogue, we were able to find solutions. So we are looking for ways to integrate more data sets and bring new data sets in to satisfy and delight our clients. And I certainly hope that we'll be able to see an increase in our NPS overtime. But where the rubber will meet the road is going to be in sustained revenue growth and the development of new products that we can then monetize across the industry.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra from RBC.\nAshish Sabadra : I just wanted to drill down further, Lee, on your comments around some of the macro challenges, insurance-specific challenges, but also better client interaction and some of the things that you mentioned in response to the prior question around new data sets. So my question here was how is that helping build the sales pipeline? Have you seen any elongation in the sales pipeline? Can you talk about the bookings and the traction you're seeing? And how should we think about the contribution from these upsell, cross-sell into the existing customer base accelerate as we go through the year?\nLee Shavel: Thank you. Thank you, Ashish. It's a great question. And I would start by saying through a lot of this client interaction, you have a very clear sense of what is on the minds of senior leaderships at underwriters and reinsurers. And I would start off by saying probably inflation and the impact of inflation on the insurance industry as they evaluate potential losses, insurance to value, placement costs, pricing is first and foremost. And to give you an example of how that manifested itself in our world at our Verisk Insurance Conference, which we were tying a lot of these topics together, our session on tracking inflation costs across a variety of aspects of insurance was a standing room-only event in a pretty large room of people spilling out into the hallways outside. So anything that we can do to provide more insight on the impact of inflation and how that's going to influence replacement costs and insurance to value is an important element of that. Similarly, social inflation and the impact of rising legal costs, time involved in resolving those is very much on the front of their minds associated with regulatory changes. We've seen some regulatory changes in Florida to try to limit some of that exposure. So our engagement on both helping understand that dynamic, how to manage that effectively in settlement discussions and also working towards some regulatory solutions and legislative solutions that address that is important. Topics of climate change and broader global risks that is factoring into our extreme events business is critical. We've had -- that has helped drive pipeline for some of our longer-term climate-oriented models as well as understanding how social, political and environmental risk through our Verisk Maplecroft subsidiary interacts with those risks is also an important topic as insurers are confronting a broader sense of the risk. So those are a few examples of what I would describe as the issues that are top of mind and that we have seen drive, I think, very solid activity on the sales front. I'd also mention that in light of that and in light of kind of the questions around the sales cycle that we have seen in other places, we have always dealt with relatively long sales cycle. And I think our -- the industry, the insurance industry has generally been less volatile. We have not seen any changes in our sales cycle and the impact. So we recognize that, that has been a greater challenge for some of our peers in this market environment. But to date, we've [indiscernible] our sales teams, we have not seen that be an impact as of yet.\nAshish Sabadra : That's great, and congrats on such a strong momentum in the business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley.\nToni Kaplan : Lee, thanks for your comments on generative AI. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about it in terms of your broader strategy and how you view the opportunities and risks. And then, Elizabeth, thanks for sharing the pieces on the subscription and transactional nonrecurring items, but I'm not sure I caught the quantification of how much the quarter benefited from the onetime items.\nLee Shavel: So Toni, on generative AI, I'll say at the start, our first approach is understanding it, understanding it in the context of the potential use cases within insurance, listening to how our clients are perceiving it and understanding, on one hand, how this can be an effective tool to be utilized to potentially automate functions [indiscernible] insurance to potentially integrate other data sets into their decision-making. But there is -- there are -- because I think of the breadth of this technology, there are clearly a lot of applications. And we're working to identify those and the opportunity, on the other hand, and I think the driving factor is there are clearly profound risk associated with generative AI in terms of its ability to understand and contextualize the conclusions or the outputs that it's creating. And so our primary focus has been in identifying a policy for us internally and as we think about the industry as a whole to provide scope for protected use cases that allow us to test and evaluate and understand the risks and deal with this on a very disciplined basis where the industry is able to develop this in a safe and nondisruptive manner.\nElizabeth Mann: Toni, to your question on the onetime items, we haven't quantified them. They're not of a magnitude that we would call out in specific. We just wanted to mention as a tailwind.\nToni Kaplan : Congrats again.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Heather Balsky from Bank of America.\nHeather Balsky : I was hoping you could touch on the Florida market and what you mentioned in terms of the potential risk as we move through the year. I think in last quarter, you had, had one additional bankruptcy. Is there anything in particular that you're seeing? Or is it just a cautiousness, given the uncertainty?\nLee Shavel: Thank you, Heather. It's a great opportunity for me to bring Neil Spector, President of our underwriting businesses, into the conversation and through his engagement with clients, particularly on the underwriting side, has probably the best insight on what's happening within Florida. Neil?\nNeil Spector: Thank you. Great question. I would say it's going to take a while for the reforms that are -- that were passed there to have the positive impact on the market. There's still a lot of lawsuits that are pending from prior to that legislation that will flow through. There's also a concern with reinsurance. The renewals will be coming up for the next storm season, and the expectation is that reinsurance costs are going to go up. So just the overall market is still not favorable for insurers down there. And so we need to continue to watch and make sure that we don't have additional liquidations or additional challenges out there. As I've mentioned in the past, it also creates opportunities for new players to enter the market. And so we do see that as well. But it's just a dynamic market that we'll probably see the results of the situation for at least another 12 to 18 months.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays.\nManav Patnaik : Lee, maybe if I can follow up on the technology question and specific to, I guess, the sunsetting of the mainframes, which obviously is a great step, but I think it's one of the first steps, I guess. I just wanted to understand what's left in the tech modernization, what your plans are? And what benefits that might read over, I guess, the next multi-years?\nLee Shavel: Yes. Thank you, Manav. So -- and I appreciate you asked the context in kind of a sequential way. So first, as I indicated, the accomplishment of moving off of that mainframe was a really substantial challenge, particularly for an organization that has been -- has developed over decades, and that technology had been in place for a long time. And so the immediate benefit, as we've talked about in the past, is that we are clearly realizing an economic benefit in terms of our ability to manage data and process data in the cloud. And we have -- there were costs necessary for us to achieve that outcome. But most of those costs have been -- had hit us. We're now experiencing the benefit of that from an economic perspective. But I'll remind everyone that, of course, that this also involves a geographic change in our balance sheet, meaning that what previously would have been depreciation of those hardware and software assets is now moving to an operating expense in terms of cloud expense. So may not be apparent from an EBITDA perspective, but there is real economic benefit from that. Now we will also continue to expect to see our cloud expenses grow as we integrate new data sets as we develop new solutions. So that will be part of our expense base that grows with the revenue opportunities that we see. But the strategic benefit for us that I believe we're really at the early stages of realizing is that through associating data sets that are now in a cloud format, our ability to tie those data sets together, to develop workflow software that is able to integrate that, to deliver that in a micro services context or an EPA context to our clients and integrate into those features expands the scope by which we can create value from those data sets. And to tie it to my earlier comments, as we better understand our clients' needs, it gives us an ability to potentially customize the way that we integrate and deliver those data sets to our clients to meet their specific value objectives. And that's, I think, what we're very excited about. We also -- from a technology standpoint, one other modernization step that we are taking on is an upgrade of our ERP system. That will deliver also efficiencies for us on the accounting, on the HR side. That also improves our ability to understand and accelerate the amount of internal information that we have. So having completed the cloud migration, we're now embarking under Elizabeth's leadership the -- our ERP transformation.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS.\nAlex Kramm : Just wanted to come back to the guidance, which was obviously unchanged. Just trying to understand, since you're new to this first year of giving guidance, what your philosophy really is here going forward? So I know it's the first quarter in, but how should we be thinking about you updating the guidance throughout the year if you're running significantly ahead or below? And then as we think about this year, I know there was a lot said already on this call. But as you talk about the none changed guidance, was it really hey it's too early in the year? Was it anything as maybe a little bit more uncertain, some of the transactional side you mentioned? Or was the first quarter really just in line with what you were expecting all along?\nElizabeth Mann: Thanks, Alex. Yes. We are excited to be giving this new transparency to the market. Our overall philosophy is going to be to give you clarity on what we can expect. We do not intend to sort of update for minor changes or for every kind of mark-to-market on a frequent basis. It's the first quarter of the year, and so it's still early in the year. We will update for material changes as we see things unfold.\nAlex Kramm : Okay. Fair enough.\nElizabeth Mann: And maybe actually, to your question on our views for the balance of the year, I'll repeat what I said in the comments, which is from where -- from what we see today, as we think about the balance of the year, we don't see significant changes in trends versus what we talked to you about when we gave the guidance.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas from William Blair.\nAndrew Nicholas : Second quarter in a row where you've called out antifraud analytics as a growth contributor. And I appreciate some of the insight on your capabilities there at Investor Day. Elizabeth, I think you called out some changes in contract structure in that business. Would you mind unpacking that a bit further? Is that something that's impacting growth in the near term? And then broadly speaking, are there other dynamics to call out within anti-fraud that are contributing to the stronger growth rate?\nElizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks. So that -- in that product, we had -- it is for insurers, but it is also used by third-party administrators and by self-insured. Previously, those customers, the TPAs and the self-insured had been on a more of a transactional business model. They would use the data when something would occur. We have developed a subscription product that is specifically targeted to that customer base and have been moving them to that subscription product. We started that in the middle of last year. As they move from a transactional to a subscription model, you're seeing that shift in that business where transaction revenue may even be declining, but it is being replaced by subscription revenue, which is higher quality and more sustainable.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from Bank of Montreal.\nJeff Silber : You called out your life insurance business a couple of times. I know it's relatively small, but we've been reading about some of the pressure that the life insurance industry is in because of the returns on commercial real estate, maybe some mismatches of assets and liabilities. Are you seeing that with any of your clients either in the life insurance industry or more broadly overall?\nLee Shavel: Yes. Jeff, thank you for the question. I would say, first, recognize that pressure. But that pressure is, in fact, I think, creating the opportunity that we are pursuing in that we are providing through our life solution a completely renovated and fresh platform for our clients to deliver that product, to develop new products on a faster basis and to substantially reduce the costs that they have in originating and managing that product. So at least what we see and part of what is driving the very strong growth, and I heard this directly from clients at our various insurance conference, many of whom are large players in the insurance industry, given that pressure, they are using this as an opportunity to rethink. Some of them have exited the business, and they are reestablishing it on this new platform that we are providing to them.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from Truist Securities.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Julian on for Andrew. Just wanted to touch on the recent acquisition in German market. Is that kind of -- is it fair to say it's an indicative of a little focus on auto? And maybe what other kind of vertical opportunities exist there in that market?\nLee Shavel: Yes. Thank you, Andrew. And I think this is a good opportunity for me to bring in Maroun Mourad, the President of our Claims business. And given kind of the claims dimension of that, he can speak specifically to crew and also how it fits into our broader German strategy given our prior acquisition of ACTINEO.\nMaroun Mourad: Thank you, Andrew. So the [indiscernible] is an auto on-site and remote adjusting that uses automation and digitization as well as invoice and bill review check to enhance the customer experience, provide more speed and drive down growth for our customers. As you know, about 1.5 years ago, we acquired a firm in the [indiscernible] called ACTINEO. That was an extension of our line of business specific solutions outside of the U.S., starting in the U.K. and now expanding into Germany, France and a couple of other markets. So there are synergies with the [indiscernible] acquisition to leverage our existing operational base as well as customer base to provide an additional product or 2 to the German customers. And this will also help us use the [indiscernible] and the German platform as a launching pad to explore growth into the markets in Europe. So it's both a product line expansion as well as the diversification of our suite of solutions offerings in the claims space.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird.\nJeff Meuler : Apologies for the multiparter, but all on the same topic. So on the underwriting and marketing, I guess, just to what extent is there still like a lagged impact from some states that didn't get requested rate actions or just how much better is the performance in the states that did? And then what specifically needs to happen for the marketing to really turn on? I know you're saying in the second half, but is it a customer success channel capacity constraints as they respond to the consumers shopping after they see the higher premiums, and that needs to be alleviated or what needs to happen? And the last is just what exactly is the revenue model like as marketing demand improves, to what extent does it flow through the sub space? Or to what extent is there meaningful incremental transaction revenue?\nLee Shavel: So Jeff, I think you won the award for the most complex [indiscernible] question, which we do appreciate because it is a complicated topic. Let me start off, and then I'm going to ask Neil to jump in and provide more context. So the dynamic of what we're seeing is that right now, in general, is that we are seeing higher rates, and consumers are responding to that. So some of the strength that we're seeing in auto is they are beginning to shop more frequently because of the initial impact of rates. We expect that, that will continue. Some insurers through nonrate actions that they're entitled to have been able to increase prices. So we're getting to see the consumer respond to that, and that's driving volume. Now from the insurers' perspective, however, there still are these concerns about inflation and underwriting in certain geographies that is -- put them in a position where they are not willing to market as aggressively. And so that's why we have not seen the level of marketing activity on the insurer side. So those are the dynamics that we are seeing right now. It's -- we do expect to see more rate increases. That will probably encourage more competition and demand for new products, but the insurers will have to evaluate where they want to write business and what they want to do to attract more. So that's kind of a rough approximation, and I'll let Neil fine-tune that a bit.\nNeil Spector: Yes. So I'll just add. So I think part of your question was the rate increases by various states. And the states approved those rate increases at various times and various levels. And I think what we've seen is that by now, most of the states, the increases are flowing through, but not all states happen at the same time. And then, of course, insurers are raising rates because their costs have significantly gone up. There's a number of drivers to that, which we mentioned some of them: severity, the cost to repair is up dramatically. There was a huge spike in used car prices, and there's a huge increase in medical costs, et cetera. So they're unprofitable. These rate increases will help. And so their desire to write more business is really muted. And so when you think about the marketing function, that is really the growth engine, which insurers go out to grow their business. And that has been paused in a large part due to the unprofitability of the line. So we expect over the next 12 months, that will -- the lines will become more and more profitable as these rate increases go through and that marketing spend will return, although it's questionable as to when. We don't know exactly when. And I think it will return for certain players sooner than others because each insurer handles the situation differently. We do have a subscription model with our overall marketing products. So they are subscription revenues. But the subscriptions are tied overall to usage. And so as the market grows and marketing spend comes back, we expect that to recover, but it is not purely a transactional model.\nLee Shavel: Yes. And specific to this embedded in our comments was part of the transactional strength were some nonrate action programs that were insurers looking to address some of their higher risks within that. As these rate increases begin to flow through, that should diminish, but then it potentially drives other growth within the business. So again, a complex situation, but hopefully, that gives you a little bit more insight.\nJeff Meuler : It does. I think you addressed all 19 parts.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of [Harold] from Jefferies.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is [Harold] on for Stephanie Moore. Just wanted to ask about the percentage of price increases that the company plans to implement with the health in insurance industry like you just talk about, particularly given an uncertain macro backdrop as inflation was at historic levels last year.\nLee Shavel: So Harold, I was -- we lost you there for a little bit. I think that you were just asking the general question around price increases in the context of the environment. Do I have that correct?\nUnidentified Analyst: Correct.\nElizabeth Mann: Yes, happy to comment on it. I mean, first, I want to remind you, we don\u2019t have a single pricing approach. It\u2019s a targeted approach across all of our businesses, and we\u2019ve been pricing items to value. I think I quoted before the net written premium growth in the industry was 9.6% in 2021. That\u2019s the year that drives the growth for many of our customers. About 20% of our revenue is tied to that premium growth in the year prior. So that has been an element.\nLee Shavel: And I would say we are \u2013 in this environment where the business is growing, there are a lot of new issues that we\u2019re working to respond on. With that growth and naturally some of the inflationary costs within the environment, the investments that we have made to improve the value of the product, we believe that it has been a supportive environment for us to capture the value that we are creating in the product through some of the pricing increases across our entire product set.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of George Tong from Goldman.\nGeorge Tong : I wanted to return to the nonsubscription revenue trends. So nonsubscription revenue grew 14% in the quarter driven to a large extent by auto underwriting. How sustainable is the strength in auto underwriting nonsubscription revenues with the trends that you're seeing with rate shopping? What are some of the puts and takes that could cause underwriting in autos to accelerate or decelerate in the coming quarters?\nElizabeth Mann: Yes. Good question, George. Thanks for that. Some of it ties back to the discussion we were just having on the industry and the impact of the rate increases that we're starting to see. So the strong auto insurance shopping behavior that we saw in this quarter was a function of some of the rate increases that have started to push through. To some extent, that is a recovery that we had expected to come later in the year. And so it may just be a pull forward of that recovery. We're waiting to see kind of the interplay of the dynamics that Lee and Neil were talking about in there. The second driver of the auto business, the nonrate actions and our -- enabling our customers to do that, that may taper off as they start to get rate increases, and that may turn into some of that shopping activity. So that's the interplay of those elements we see going forward.\nLee Shavel : Great. Well, thank you, George. I think that was the final question. So I want to thank everyone for participating, and we look forward to continuing the dialogue with all of you. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Lee Shavel",
            "content": "Thanks, Stacey. Good morning, and thank you for participating in today's call. At our Investor Day in mid-March, we detailed the benefits of being an insurance-focused business and our comprehensive strategy to drive consistent, predictable growth at Verisk. Our first quarter results demonstrate the sharpened focus and results-oriented operating plan at Verisk. We are operating on a more integrated basis across the company and have been more engaged with our clients, as I'll describe in greater detail. I will leave it to Elizabeth to walk through the details of the financials. But in summary, we delivered very strong organic revenue growth combined with solid margin expansion yielding double-digit profit growth. The growth was broad-based with most businesses contributing to the result, and we have strong business momentum. We delivered this performance despite a macroeconomic environment marked by high inflation, interest rate volatility and market anxiety. Specific to the insurance industry, our customers are coming off a year marked by elevated underwriting losses and pressure on profitability. In fact, the U.S. property casualty insurers experienced a $27 billion net underwriting loss in 2022, the largest loss since 2011, according to industry data collected by Verisk and the American Property Casualty Insurance Association. Moreover, profitability was under pressure as reflected in deteriorating combined ratios at 103% in 2022 versus almost 100% in 2021. One consequence of this tough loss in profitability environment in 2022 has been a hardening insurance market where rate increases are driving faster net written premium growth in the first quarter reports of many major insurers. Verisk is partnering with the industry to help them reduce costs, better select and price risk, root out fraud and overall operate more efficiently, given the macro environment. One problem area has been the state of Florida. As we have discussed in prior calls, the insurance crisis in Florida is being driven by a litigious environment, further complicated by extreme event vulnerability. The combined impact is pushing insurers into insolvency. The state legislature has passed reforms to address the crisis, and there are currently efforts be negotiated to bring increased oversight to the state's insurance market. That said, the risk for more liquidations remains. And we continue to monitor both the primary and reinsurance markets closely while leaning in with our customers to help them adapt to new legislation, to better select and price risk in the state and to identify the systemic bad actors in the market. A second area of challenge has been auto underwriting as insurers pulled back on writing new policies as they awaited regulatory approval for rate increases. Rate actions have started to roll through. And in the first quarter, we saw a rebound in policyholder shopping activity in response to higher rates, driving strong transactional revenue growth for Verisk this quarter. That said, we have yet to see behavior change on the part of the underwriters as they are still cautious about spending on marketing and underwriting new policies. We continue to expect that improvement in the back half of the year. One key pillar in our strategy that we discussed at Investor Day is being a more client-centric organization and the importance of strengthening the strategic dialogue with our clients and intensifying our industry engagement. To that end, I've been leading the organization with direct client engagement through full relationship reviews at several of our largest clients where we've been able to identify how we can best serve them and integrate new solutions to meet their specific objectives. I've also hosted our first CEO roundtable, where we brought together the leaders of our clients to discuss the issues that are foremost in their minds and where we can leverage our centrality and expertise to help address these issues. This has been followed by a client Chief Information Officer roundtable, where we brought our technology leadership headed by our CIO, Nick Daffan; and Chief Data Officer, Eric Schneider, to discuss technology and analytics trends that are on the minds of insurance industry CIOs. In particular, generative AI was a hot topic. And we discussed how we can help the industry develop safe, ethical and effective use cases and guide policy. Our clients are recognizing the early benefits of change and focus at Verisk and have provided great feedback. A recent quote from an important client stated, I can't remember a meeting with this degree of transparent dialogue where I felt like Verisk was listening. Our recent NPS scores also reflect this change in perception. Verisk conducts customer relationship surveys twice a year. And our recent NPS scores in the first quarter of 2023 were 47, up 4 points versus this time last year. Further, so far this year, we have hosted 3 in-person client events. At all our events, clients can engage with our solutions and hear directly from those clients who use the products in the market and learn how effective they are in helping solve industry challenges. More specifically, in February, our claims business hosted 2 events, including Elevate, our signature event for claims and restoration professionals, which provided educational and networking sessions for over 600 industry professionals. We also hosted almost 300 industry participants at IFM, an industry-wide event targeting the latest issues and advances in fraud management. In the U.S. alone, insurance fraud is estimated to cost the industry $300 billion annually, impacting industry profitability, and Verisk is uniquely positioned to help the industry. We host this event in partnership with the National Insurance Crime Bureau. Both events included expert panel discussions featuring our clients and partners, leading academics and thought leaders in the industry covering top-of-mind issues. In April, we hosted the inaugural Verisk Insurance Conference and hosted almost 600 clients for a 4-day multitrack conference designed to deliver a combination of product and thought leadership-focused content to key extreme events, life and underwriting decision-makers in insurance and reinsurance. This comprehensive event, which combined 3 previously separate events, enabled us to educate our clients and prospects about Verisk's end-to-end capabilities while continuing to provide them with valuable content applicable to their specific role in organization. It raised the awareness of the breadth and depth of solutions we offer to solve the industry's biggest challenges and really highlighted the benefits of the integrated Verisk approach. We saw a great response to this event with almost half of the extreme events professionals attending underwriting sessions and 40% of the underwriting attendees joining an extreme event session. A recent notable competitive contract win in our Extreme Events business is a great example of the benefits of being more focused and more integrated across Verisk. We recently signed a large multiyear contract expansion with a global insurer for extreme events platform, Touchstone. This client, who is already a subscriber to our property underwriting data solutions, will partner with Verisk in a workflow that will directly integrate those data solutions into the Touchstone platform. This partnership not only allows the client to obtain an enhanced view of their catastrophe loss potential based on various data with minimal operational friction, but it also gives Verisk the opportunity to market the feasibility of the same solution to a broader range of market participants. What struck me at both our claims and underwriting events after dozens of client conversations was the genuine enthusiasm our clients have for our ability to help them address industry issues with our scale and centrality. A commonly expressed sentiment is Verisk has a unique perspective, and we know you can help us. This is a tremendous privilege for us, and we are more mindful of our responsibility to create value for our clients and stakeholders. We are particularly excited about the opportunity it represents to find new channels for growth. On the technological transformation front, we recently achieved a major milestone as we have successfully sunset our mainframe. The scope and complexity of this project was massive. And our technology teams worked tirelessly to shut down a 40 year old mainframe in just 5 years. I want to thank my colleagues for their hard work and dedication to modernizing our legacy technology footprint. This move allowed us to modernize our operations and provide a better experience for our customers. Equally importantly, it enables Verisk to allocate more of our technology resources towards innovation to drive future growth. Finally, I wanted to share that we recently published our 2022 corporate social responsibility report. This year's report offers a view of our ESG journey and our work to help build global resilience for individuals, communities and businesses. We continue to pursue sustainability and growth through the lens of a responsible ESG framework. On the environmental front, this year, we established a Climate Advisory Council to glean strategic guidance on climate change and receive climate-related feedback on our forthcoming solutions. Moreover, Verisk's sustainability team is currently working with an independent consultant to help the company complete a report, meeting the expectations set forth by the task force on climate-related financial disclosures. As part of the exercise, we are conducting analysis assessing the impact of climate change, both on Verisk's direct operations and across key elements of its value chain and developing a realistic pathway to support science-based targets and a commitment to net zero targets. The team is also engaging with internal stakeholders regarding Verisk's current risk assessment activities and framework for identifying climate-related opportunities. We expect to publish the report in late 2023. Regarding governance, over the last 12 months, Verisk took steps to enhance our governance at the Board level, including making changes to provide for the annual election of directors and separating the role of Chair and CEO. We also took steps to refresh our Board, welcoming 4 new independent directors, who bring fresh perspectives and valuable skill and experience sets. As of the 2023 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, 4 directors, namely Annell Bay, Chris Foskett, Constantine Iordanou and David Wright will be retiring from the Board. I would like to express my gratitude to each of these directors for their leadership and guidance, which have been invaluable to Verisk's journey and transformation. These changes will bring our Board to a total of 10 members, 90% of whom are independent and 60% are gender or racially diverse. With that, I'll hand it over to Elizabeth to review our financial results. In summary, we're excited about the opportunity ahead and our ability to focus all our attention, talent and resources on the global insurance industry. Verisk is best positioned to capitalize on the opportunity because of our scale, centrality and expertise. Our motivating purpose is to work together with our clients in building resilience for individuals, communities and businesses globally. The combination of our focused business model, unique market position and strategy to deliver value for clients through improved decision-making and operational efficiency is the formula that will also deliver value to our shareholders through predictable growth and returns. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions. And Faiza, if I would add, I think the other dimension that you were looking for is what might not be sustained given that strong growth in the first quarter. And so there are a couple of things that I would point to. One is that we -- in subscription growth, we have some property estimating solution subscriptions that come on associated with the storms in the fourth quarter. And sometimes those persist. It's hard to predict how long that those will persist. So that's a factor. In addition, as we indicated, the Florida situation and potential further insolvencies would impact that. And then as Elizabeth described, part of the conversion of the -- in the anti-fraud to our claims essentials package, it generates some growth in 2022 and in the early part of 2023. I think we will lap some of that exceptional growth, and that will probably serve as a bit of an offset in the later part of 2023. Thanks for the question, Greg. So certainly, we view the Net Promoter Score as one gauge of our client satisfaction and enthusiasm for what we do. I wouldn't say that we are targeting our client outreach primarily to drive an increase in NPS. We're hopeful that, that will be a consequence, but our primary purpose is to elevate our dialogue [indiscernible] with our clients, which, as I indicated, I think there's a very strong appetite for because they recognize that with the data sets that we have and our centrality, we have the ability to solve problems for the industry. And the only way that we can identify those as industry issues is by moving and strengthening that dialogue at the top. And I think it does put us in a position where we are beyond addressing their tactical needs in underwriting claims, extreme events modeling, we have the ability to solve bigger problems by tying some of those data sets together. We talked about the integration of our property data into the Touchstone platform, which is an example of how, as part of that higher-level dialogue, we were able to find solutions. So we are looking for ways to integrate more data sets and bring new data sets in to satisfy and delight our clients. And I certainly hope that we'll be able to see an increase in our NPS overtime. But where the rubber will meet the road is going to be in sustained revenue growth and the development of new products that we can then monetize across the industry. Thank you. Thank you, Ashish. It's a great question. And I would start by saying through a lot of this client interaction, you have a very clear sense of what is on the minds of senior leaderships at underwriters and reinsurers. And I would start off by saying probably inflation and the impact of inflation on the insurance industry as they evaluate potential losses, insurance to value, placement costs, pricing is first and foremost. And to give you an example of how that manifested itself in our world at our Verisk Insurance Conference, which we were tying a lot of these topics together, our session on tracking inflation costs across a variety of aspects of insurance was a standing room-only event in a pretty large room of people spilling out into the hallways outside. So anything that we can do to provide more insight on the impact of inflation and how that's going to influence replacement costs and insurance to value is an important element of that. Similarly, social inflation and the impact of rising legal costs, time involved in resolving those is very much on the front of their minds associated with regulatory changes. We've seen some regulatory changes in Florida to try to limit some of that exposure. So our engagement on both helping understand that dynamic, how to manage that effectively in settlement discussions and also working towards some regulatory solutions and legislative solutions that address that is important. Topics of climate change and broader global risks that is factoring into our extreme events business is critical. We've had -- that has helped drive pipeline for some of our longer-term climate-oriented models as well as understanding how social, political and environmental risk through our Verisk Maplecroft subsidiary interacts with those risks is also an important topic as insurers are confronting a broader sense of the risk. So those are a few examples of what I would describe as the issues that are top of mind and that we have seen drive, I think, very solid activity on the sales front. I'd also mention that in light of that and in light of kind of the questions around the sales cycle that we have seen in other places, we have always dealt with relatively long sales cycle. And I think our -- the industry, the insurance industry has generally been less volatile. We have not seen any changes in our sales cycle and the impact. So we recognize that, that has been a greater challenge for some of our peers in this market environment. But to date, we've [indiscernible] our sales teams, we have not seen that be an impact as of yet. So Toni, on generative AI, I'll say at the start, our first approach is understanding it, understanding it in the context of the potential use cases within insurance, listening to how our clients are perceiving it and understanding, on one hand, how this can be an effective tool to be utilized to potentially automate functions [indiscernible] insurance to potentially integrate other data sets into their decision-making. But there is -- there are -- because I think of the breadth of this technology, there are clearly a lot of applications. And we're working to identify those and the opportunity, on the other hand, and I think the driving factor is there are clearly profound risk associated with generative AI in terms of its ability to understand and contextualize the conclusions or the outputs that it's creating. And so our primary focus has been in identifying a policy for us internally and as we think about the industry as a whole to provide scope for protected use cases that allow us to test and evaluate and understand the risks and deal with this on a very disciplined basis where the industry is able to develop this in a safe and nondisruptive manner. Thank you, Heather. It's a great opportunity for me to bring Neil Spector, President of our underwriting businesses, into the conversation and through his engagement with clients, particularly on the underwriting side, has probably the best insight on what's happening within Florida. Neil? Yes. Thank you, Manav. So -- and I appreciate you asked the context in kind of a sequential way. So first, as I indicated, the accomplishment of moving off of that mainframe was a really substantial challenge, particularly for an organization that has been -- has developed over decades, and that technology had been in place for a long time. And so the immediate benefit, as we've talked about in the past, is that we are clearly realizing an economic benefit in terms of our ability to manage data and process data in the cloud. And we have -- there were costs necessary for us to achieve that outcome. But most of those costs have been -- had hit us. We're now experiencing the benefit of that from an economic perspective. But I'll remind everyone that, of course, that this also involves a geographic change in our balance sheet, meaning that what previously would have been depreciation of those hardware and software assets is now moving to an operating expense in terms of cloud expense. So may not be apparent from an EBITDA perspective, but there is real economic benefit from that. Now we will also continue to expect to see our cloud expenses grow as we integrate new data sets as we develop new solutions. So that will be part of our expense base that grows with the revenue opportunities that we see. But the strategic benefit for us that I believe we're really at the early stages of realizing is that through associating data sets that are now in a cloud format, our ability to tie those data sets together, to develop workflow software that is able to integrate that, to deliver that in a micro services context or an EPA context to our clients and integrate into those features expands the scope by which we can create value from those data sets. And to tie it to my earlier comments, as we better understand our clients' needs, it gives us an ability to potentially customize the way that we integrate and deliver those data sets to our clients to meet their specific value objectives. And that's, I think, what we're very excited about. We also -- from a technology standpoint, one other modernization step that we are taking on is an upgrade of our ERP system. That will deliver also efficiencies for us on the accounting, on the HR side. That also improves our ability to understand and accelerate the amount of internal information that we have. So having completed the cloud migration, we're now embarking under Elizabeth's leadership the -- our ERP transformation. Yes. Jeff, thank you for the question. I would say, first, recognize that pressure. But that pressure is, in fact, I think, creating the opportunity that we are pursuing in that we are providing through our life solution a completely renovated and fresh platform for our clients to deliver that product, to develop new products on a faster basis and to substantially reduce the costs that they have in originating and managing that product. So at least what we see and part of what is driving the very strong growth, and I heard this directly from clients at our various insurance conference, many of whom are large players in the insurance industry, given that pressure, they are using this as an opportunity to rethink. Some of them have exited the business, and they are reestablishing it on this new platform that we are providing to them. Yes. Thank you, Andrew. And I think this is a good opportunity for me to bring in Maroun Mourad, the President of our Claims business. And given kind of the claims dimension of that, he can speak specifically to crew and also how it fits into our broader German strategy given our prior acquisition of ACTINEO. So Jeff, I think you won the award for the most complex [indiscernible] question, which we do appreciate because it is a complicated topic. Let me start off, and then I'm going to ask Neil to jump in and provide more context. So the dynamic of what we're seeing is that right now, in general, is that we are seeing higher rates, and consumers are responding to that. So some of the strength that we're seeing in auto is they are beginning to shop more frequently because of the initial impact of rates. We expect that, that will continue. Some insurers through nonrate actions that they're entitled to have been able to increase prices. So we're getting to see the consumer respond to that, and that's driving volume. Now from the insurers' perspective, however, there still are these concerns about inflation and underwriting in certain geographies that is -- put them in a position where they are not willing to market as aggressively. And so that's why we have not seen the level of marketing activity on the insurer side. So those are the dynamics that we are seeing right now. It's -- we do expect to see more rate increases. That will probably encourage more competition and demand for new products, but the insurers will have to evaluate where they want to write business and what they want to do to attract more. So that's kind of a rough approximation, and I'll let Neil fine-tune that a bit. Yes. And specific to this embedded in our comments was part of the transactional strength were some nonrate action programs that were insurers looking to address some of their higher risks within that. As these rate increases begin to flow through, that should diminish, but then it potentially drives other growth within the business. So again, a complex situation, but hopefully, that gives you a little bit more insight. So Harold, I was -- we lost you there for a little bit. I think that you were just asking the general question around price increases in the context of the environment. Do I have that correct? And I would say we are \u2013 in this environment where the business is growing, there are a lot of new issues that we're working to respond on. With that growth and naturally some of the inflationary costs within the environment, the investments that we have made to improve the value of the product, we believe that it has been a supportive environment for us to capture the value that we are creating in the product through some of the pricing increases across our entire product set. Great. Well, thank you, George. I think that was the final question. So I want to thank everyone for participating, and we look forward to continuing the dialogue with all of you. Have a great day."

            "name": "Elizabeth Mann",
            "content": "Thanks, Lee, and good day to everyone on the call. Before I start with the first quarter results, I have a few reminders for everyone. First, all consolidated and GAAP numbers are negatively impacted by dispositions of 3E and Verisk Financial Services. This will be the final quarter of this year-over-year comparison. Second, as it was in the prior quarter, Wood Mackenzie is accounted for as discontinued operations on our income statement, and results are not included in continuing operations for either period. Third, all cash flow metrics include the results of all 3 disposed businesses in the prior year figures. Turning to the financial results. I am pleased to share that we delivered a strong first quarter. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue was $652 million, up 1% versus the prior year, reflecting growth in Insurance, offset by the impact of the VFS and 3E disposition. Income from continuing operations was $194 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share attributable to Verisk was $1.27. Moving to our organic constant currency results. Adjusted for nonoperating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, we are pleased with our operating results, which demonstrated strong core underlying performance across most of our businesses, aided by some in-period onetime benefits. In the first quarter, OCC revenues grew 9.8% with growth of 9.1% in underwriting and rating and 11.4% in claims. This quarter's results was boosted by certain transactional revenues that we do not expect to repeat for the remainder of 2023. Our subscription revenues, which comprised 80% of total revenue in the quarter, grew 8.7% on an OCC basis. We saw broad-based growth across most of our businesses with strength in core underwriting, property estimating solutions, extreme events, antitrust, life insurance solutions and many of our international businesses. Specific to our core line services, we are experiencing a benefit on certain of our revenues from the stronger net premium growth in 2021, which is currently reflecting in our contract pricing. Working against this is a modest negative impact from the 7 liquidations in Florida that occurred over the last 12 months and which we discussed earlier. We do expect the impact from liquidations overall to become more pronounced as we move throughout the year. Our transactional revenues, representing 20% of total revenue in the first quarter, grew 14.4% on an OCC basis. The largest contributor to growth was from a strong rebound in our auto businesses driven by increased rate shopping and the signing of a large nonrate action deal with national insurer. Additionally, we experienced double-digit growth from life insurance solutions as we are seeing strong customer demand for incremental services. Our travel solutions are benefiting from a post-COVID rebound, particularly in markets like Australia and New Zealand. And our property estimating solutions experienced continued storm benefit in the quarter. These transactional results did include some onetime benefits, including overage charges on specific large underwriting contracts that renewed in the quarter and catch-up billing for certain claims customers. Finally, the casualty workers' compensation business delivered growth in the quarter but continues to remain below pre-COVID level and is recovering at a pace slower than we had originally expected. On the auto underwriting side, we did see solid growth in transaction volume this quarter versus declines last year as rate increases are now driving shopping behavior by policyholders. However, as Lee mentioned earlier, carriers continue to be cautious and have pulled back on marketing spend to attract new customers as they measure the impact of rate increases on profitability. To that end and given the transactional nature of this business, we are cautiously optimistic about the outlook for auto as we move throughout the year. Moving now to our adjusted EBITDA results. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 15.7% in the first quarter, reflecting core operating leverage on the strong revenue growth and the impact of certain cost reduction actions we have taken in connection with our margin expansion objective. Total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results, was 52.2%, up 480 basis points from the reported results in the prior year. On a pro forma basis for all divestitures, the first quarter margin expanded 320 basis points from margins of 49% in Q1 of '22. This reflects the impact of certain onetime expenses in the prior year quarter as well as strong cost and operational discipline and the impact of our cost reduction program. This level of margin also does include several headwinds, which in total represent about 150 basis points and include a decrease in our pension credit, pressures from recent acquisitions and higher T&E expenses, offset by foreign currency realized gains in the quarter. Reflecting on our ongoing cost reduction plan, we continue to have confidence in our ability to deliver on the margin targets that we articulated in our 2023 guidance and at Investor Day in mid-March. During the quarter, we also took actions to put in place a permanent capital structure for the new Verisk as well as actively manage the balance sheet to take advantage of the $3.1 billion in proceeds we received from the closing of the Wood Mackenzie transaction. To that end, in February 23, we paid down $1.4 billion in debt that was outstanding on our revolver. On March 3, we issued $500 million of 10-year senior notes at a rate of 5.75%, bringing our total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter to $2.85 billion. We then entered a $2.5 billion accelerated share repurchase plan and received an initial delivery of 10.7 million shares in the quarter. We expect to receive the final shares when the program is completed in the fourth quarter. The net result of these actions in the quarter was net interest expense of $26.4 million for the first quarter compared to $31.3 million in the prior year. Included in this number was $7.4 million in interest income that we earned on the proceeds of the Wood Mackenzie transaction, which we do not expect to continue as the proceeds are now fully deployed. Having now completed all these transactions, we now expect net interest expense for 2023 to be slightly below the full year 2022 level. On taxes, our reported effective tax rate was 27.1% compared to 17.4% in the prior year quarter. This higher tax rate included a onetime tax charge of $15.2 million associated with the structuring of the energy sale, which closed in the quarter, offset in part by higher stock compensation benefit versus the prior year period. Going forward, we expect the tax rate for the remainder of the year to be in the originally guided range of 23% to 25%. Adjusted net income increased 9.4% to $196.4 million, and diluted adjusted EPS increased 16.2% to $1.29 for the first quarter of 2023. These changes reflect organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions and a lower average share count, offset in part by higher tax rate. We are very pleased with the robust performance in the first quarter. But given that it is still early in the year, our transactional revenues are inherently less predictable. At this time, we are maintaining our outlook for 2023. While the first quarter showed strong operating momentum, based on what we see today, we have not changed our expectations for the balance of the year. To that end, our full year 2023 guidance is unchanged. And now I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments. Yes. Thanks. Happy to. I'll highlight a couple of the drivers of the subscription growth, which was broad-based and some of the potential later in the year. So on the -- the largest driver of the subscription growth was in our forms [indiscernible] business. This was the biggest contributor to the growth, just given the size of it within overall Verisk. And the growth was driven across the contract. Probably about 20% to 25% of our contracts in the business overall are tied to premium growth. We are seeing an environment with strong premium growth with over 9% -- nearly 10% net written premium growth in 2021, which is driving some of those contracts. In addition, we're delivering additional value to our customers and new products, as we highlighted at the Investor Day. So we are partnering with them in this environment. Finally, in that business, in this quarter in particular, there were lower levels of attrition, liquidation or consolidation in the industry than we might typically, something that we're monitoring in the balance of the year. In addition to that business, other contributors to subscription growth, our property estimating solutions business had a strong quarter, somewhat helped by easier comparisons in the last year and some continued storm benefits there. And our anti-fraud business in the claims business is also driving strong growth. That is fueled significantly by conversions to claims essentials, which is a subscription product for third-party administrators and self-insured. That transition from transactional to subscription product started in the back half of last year. So we're still in kind of that overlapping growth period. And finally, extreme events and life, our life solutions business also had strong subscription growth. So collectively, strong contributions across the portfolio. Yes. Happy to cover that. Maybe like the subscription, I'll go through sort of in order of magnitude of the impact to the transactional growth. So the biggest single driver in the underwriting and ratings portion of the business was the recovery in the auto space. There were really 2 elements to this. First was we referenced the nonrate actions deal with a major insurer. And that's a unique opportunity for auto insurers to look across their portfolio and see actions that they can take beyond rate increases. The second element, though, is the overall rebound in shopping behavior, which picked up quite suddenly in the quarter. We've seen industry data that supports it. The J.D. Power data shows a strong increase in auto insurance shopping this quarter. So those 2 factors contributed to our transactional growth. In addition, the -- our life business, which is both a subscription business but has a services implementation component which contributed on the transaction side. In the property estimating solutions, there was -- there continue to be carryover as well as some localized storm activities, the wind storms and tornadoes and some ice storms that you've seen that had a component of an impact. And then there were a couple onetime elements, including some overage charges on contracts in underwriting and rating, billing catch-up in the claims business. There also -- there happened to be an extra business day in the quarter, which will come out in the third quarter. So those were the main elements across the transaction growth. Yes. So that's encapsulated in our 2023 guidance, which is unchanged. Toni, to your question on the onetime items, we haven't quantified them. They're not of a magnitude that we would call out in specific. We just wanted to mention as a tailwind. Thanks, Alex. Yes. We are excited to be giving this new transparency to the market. Our overall philosophy is going to be to give you clarity on what we can expect. We do not intend to sort of update for minor changes or for every kind of mark-to-market on a frequent basis. It's the first quarter of the year, and so it's still early in the year. We will update for material changes as we see things unfold. And maybe actually, to your question on our views for the balance of the year, I'll repeat what I said in the comments, which is from where -- from what we see today, as we think about the balance of the year, we don't see significant changes in trends versus what we talked to you about when we gave the guidance. Yes. Thanks. So that -- in that product, we had -- it is for insurers, but it is also used by third-party administrators and by self-insured. Previously, those customers, the TPAs and the self-insured had been on a more of a transactional business model. They would use the data when something would occur. We have developed a subscription product that is specifically targeted to that customer base and have been moving them to that subscription product. We started that in the middle of last year. As they move from a transactional to a subscription model, you're seeing that shift in that business where transaction revenue may even be declining, but it is being replaced by subscription revenue, which is higher quality and more sustainable. Yes, happy to comment on it. I mean, first, I want to remind you, we don't have a single pricing approach. It's a targeted approach across all of our businesses, and we've been pricing items to value. I think I quoted before the net written premium growth in the industry was 9.6% in 2021. That's the year that drives the growth for many of our customers. About 20% of our revenue is tied to that premium growth in the year prior. So that has been an element. Yes. Good question, George. Thanks for that. Some of it ties back to the discussion we were just having on the industry and the impact of the rate increases that we're starting to see. So the strong auto insurance shopping behavior that we saw in this quarter was a function of some of the rate increases that have started to push through. To some extent, that is a recovery that we had expected to come later in the year. And so it may just be a pull forward of that recovery. We're waiting to see kind of the interplay of the dynamics that Lee and Neil were talking about in there. The second driver of the auto business, the nonrate actions and our -- enabling our customers to do that, that may taper off as they start to get rate increases, and that may turn into some of that shopping activity. So that's the interplay of those elements we see going forward."

            "name": "Neil Spector",
            "content": "Thank you. Great question. I would say it's going to take a while for the reforms that are -- that were passed there to have the positive impact on the market. There's still a lot of lawsuits that are pending from prior to that legislation that will flow through. There's also a concern with reinsurance. The renewals will be coming up for the next storm season, and the expectation is that reinsurance costs are going to go up. So just the overall market is still not favorable for insurers down there. And so we need to continue to watch and make sure that we don't have additional liquidations or additional challenges out there. As I've mentioned in the past, it also creates opportunities for new players to enter the market. And so we do see that as well. But it's just a dynamic market that we'll probably see the results of the situation for at least another 12 to 18 months. Yes. So I'll just add. So I think part of your question was the rate increases by various states. And the states approved those rate increases at various times and various levels. And I think what we've seen is that by now, most of the states, the increases are flowing through, but not all states happen at the same time. And then, of course, insurers are raising rates because their costs have significantly gone up. There's a number of drivers to that, which we mentioned some of them: severity, the cost to repair is up dramatically. There was a huge spike in used car prices, and there's a huge increase in medical costs, et cetera. So they're unprofitable. These rate increases will help. And so their desire to write more business is really muted. And so when you think about the marketing function, that is really the growth engine, which insurers go out to grow their business. And that has been paused in a large part due to the unprofitability of the line. So we expect over the next 12 months, that will -- the lines will become more and more profitable as these rate increases go through and that marketing spend will return, although it's questionable as to when. We don't know exactly when. And I think it will return for certain players sooner than others because each insurer handles the situation differently. We do have a subscription model with our overall marketing products. So they are subscription revenues. But the subscriptions are tied overall to usage. And so as the market grows and marketing spend comes back, we expect that to recover, but it is not purely a transactional model."

We will have further instructions for you at that time. For opening remarks and introductions, I would now turn the call over to Valmet Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.\nStacey Brodbar: Thank you, operator. And good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our third quarter 2024 financial results. On the call today are Lee Shavel, Verisk's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Elizabeth Mann, Chief Financial Officer. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as our traditional quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. As set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance, including those related to our financial guidance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. A reconciliation of reported and historic non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call is provided in our 8-K and today's earnings presentation posted on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. However, we are not able to provide a reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable expected GAAP results because of the unreasonable effort and high unpredictability of estimating certain items that are excluded from projected non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, including, for example, tax consequences, acquisition-related costs, gains and losses from dispositions and other non-recurring expenses, the effect of which may be significant. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Lee Shavel.\nLee Shavel: Thank you, Stacey. Good morning and thank you for participating in today's call. I'm pleased to share that our operating momentum continued as Verisk delivered another quarter of strong financial results, led by our subscription revenue growth of 9.1% with contributions from both underwriting and claims. Transactional revenues were down slightly due to the strong double-digit growth from weather and shopping activity in the prior year as well as the ongoing conversion of transactional revenues into committed subscription contracts. Returning to overall revenue growth, unaffected by contract transitions from last year, organic constant currency revenue growth was 8% on a two-year compound annual growth basis at the high end of our longer-term targets established at Investor Day. Elizabeth will provide much more detail in her financial review, but these results demonstrate the compounding power of our subscription-based business model, driven by the value we create for our clients. I'm confident that 2024 is on track to be another year delivering on the strategy and financial targets we established at Investor Day. There are two fundamental drivers to the strong subscription growth we've been achieving. First is our enhanced go-to-market approach, which elevates and intensifies our strategic dialogue with clients. The second is the strength of our products and solutions built on proprietary data sets and continuously enhanced as we scale innovation and invest on behalf of the industry. On the first lever, with our client engagement, as I engage across the property and casualty insurance industry, we are seeing improving industry-wide financial metrics, helped by continued strong premium growth. Swiss Re now forecasts that 2024 direct written premiums will grow 9.5%. So there will be variability by line. Profitability across the sector is also improving as net industry-wide combined ratios have improved by over 2 points to 99.4, indicating underwriting profits. While catastrophe losses are expected to be elevated for the remainder of the year due to recent hurricanes, the expectation is that insurance and reinsurance industry participants are in a stronger financial position than in prior years and better able to absorb these cat-related losses. Since our last call, I've had the opportunity to participate in several industry events, including the Rendez-Vous de Septembre in Monte Carlo, the CIAB Insurance Leadership Conference, and our own Valmet Insurance Conference in London. At each of these, the opportunities to engage with the highest levels of leadership has enhanced our understanding of our clients enterprise needs, broadened and strengthened our relationships, and opened new doors to opportunities to work with them. What I have heard consistently and we are acting on is a strong desire to see us connect more of our data sets and analytics for enterprise solutions directly and with our partners. We are pursuing several product initiatives between underwriting claims, extreme events, and specialty business solutions to deliver on that very objective. Another reflection of our broader engagement to find, develop, and leverage solutions for the industry is the opportunity I'll have to engage with insurance constituencies as a member of the Federal Advisory Committee on Insurance. With heightened focus on the importance of the insurance industry in the midst of severe weather events, being at the table with industry partners to find ways to improve is an important responsibility for Verisk. I have already participated in discussions on improving community resilience and managing the impact of severe weather events. In addition, we believe the opportunity to serve a broader range of agencies beyond our role in supporting the National Flood Insurance Program and Community Rating System for FEMA and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act program for the Department of Treasury is an important opportunity to support communities and industry. With all client engagements, the follow-up on these opportunities is focused, supported by the enhancements we've made in our client engagement structure and investments in our sales coverage. I believe the strength in our subscription growth reflects in part the progress we are making in elevating our dialogue and relationships, and then capitalizing on the opportunities we create. The second factor driving our subscription revenue growth is the strength of our data and solutions and our ability to innovate through data enhancement and responsibly combining data sets. Let me give you some examples of our progress this quarter. Our most significant initiative to drive more value for our clients is Core Lines Reimagine, which we have discussed with you at length. We continue to advance our progress in delivering proprietary content to clients more digitally, integrating more seamlessly into their workflows, and providing more analytics and insights. To that end, in the third quarter, we had the first release of an initiative we call the Future of Forms. Future of Forms addresses our clients' challenge of understanding and managing through the complexity of major policy updates. The Future of Forms introduces a data visualization for our forms filing with this first release focused on general liability. This new digital experience allows insurers to save time analyzing our content by interacting with our forms filings in an entirely new way. And the early response from our clients has been very positive with specific feedback saying that this new solution is easy to navigate and a significant time saver for their teams. Additionally, as we have previously discussed, we continue to receive interest and inbound inquiries from our clients through the release of our executive insights reports, which leverage our statistical data to provide key trends. In the third quarter, we added to our library of reports by introducing executive insights for personal auto and general liability. We now have executive insights covering five of the six major lines of business, with plans to introduce reports for commercial auto in the first half of 2025. Executive insights not only provides our clients with benchmarking analyses for their book of business, but also provides a deeper look into the broader market. These reports reinforce Verisk's thought leadership position in the industry by providing this granular and unique view of the data in a timely manner. And the new product creates additional fuel for our client engagement teams, serving as a touch point for new C-level conversations and delivers on a consistent request for more insights. As I mentioned earlier, we are also driving value by continuing to enhance our solutions by combining data sets across the Verisk family. To that end, we recently combined Verisk's claims data into Okta's enhanced peril score for the Canadian market. The peril score is powered by predictive analytics and location-specific data to predict severity and the likelihood of claims at a property. The addition of the Verisk claims data has enhanced the model, driving more insightful signals for our clients and leading to reinvigorated sales growth of this solution. Our commitment to driving value and improving efficiency and automation is also a focus within the four walls of Verisk as we innovate around our internal data collection and management processes. We recently launched a new fully mobile application that allows our field representatives to complete engineering assessments and loss cost surveys directly from the field. We expect this initiative to speed up cycle times for surveys, while also including more data validations and further automation of our quality control process. As you might imagine, our continued engagement focuses on issues that are top of mind for our clients and often top of mind for our shareholders as well. Most recently, Hurricanes Beryl, Helene, and Milton have brought renewed attention to climate risks, catastrophe losses, and resilience. Our conversations are focused on the comprehensive suite of solutions we currently offer that help our clients plan for, react, and respond to climate risks. In our extreme events business, we help our clients evaluate and price catastrophe risks by modeling the view of probable outcomes and impacts on their book of business before the events make landfall. Our catastrophe models calculate a view of loss outcomes, incorporating not only the most advanced weather signs, but also detailed understanding of local building codes and construction standards. Investing in mitigation efforts to manage and reduce losses is one of the keys to containing the industry losses from climate change. To that end, Verisk's work in conjunction with FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program helps assess community level efforts to reduce and avoid flood damage to insurable properties. Known as the Community Rating System, this program is based on technical data on flood plain mitigation that is collected and analyzed by Verisk. Through this program, communities can achieve discounts on flood insurance premiums for their property owners, making flood insurance more affordable for the end consumer. And finally, our property estimating solutions and anti-fraud solutions help insurance ecosystem participants respond after the impact of storms. Our solutions power a network that allows carriers, independent adjusters, and restoration contractors to estimate the cost to repair and rebuild storm impacted property in an automated and efficient way while also identifying fraud to make sure that only the valid claims get paid. I'm energized by the opportunity that lies ahead. In my conversations with the leaders of our clients, there is strong appetite to invest in technologies that can drive value in the form of better risk selection, more automation efficiency, and they are turning to Verisk as the trusted partner to help them. Now let me turn the call over to Elizabeth to review our financial results for the third quarter and year-to-date basis.\nElizabeth Mann : Thanks, Lee. And good day to everyone on the call. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, third quarter revenue was $725 million, up 7% versus the prior year, reflecting consistent levels of growth across both underwriting and claims. Income from continuing operations was $220 million, up 17.4% versus the prior year, while diluted GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.54, up 19.4% versus the prior year. The increase in diluted GAAP EPS was driven by strong operating performance, a litigation reserve expense in the prior year period, and a lower effective tax rate. Moving to our organic constant currency results for the third quarter, adjusted for non-operating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release. Our operating results demonstrated consistent growth across both underwriting and claims. OCC revenues grew 6.8%, with growth of 6.5% in underwriting and 7.4% in claims. The solid revenue growth is compounding from the 9.4% OCC revenue growth from the prior year and reflects improvement from the second quarter in both the underwriting and claims businesses, as well as in our total subscription and transactional revenues. Our subscription revenues, which comprised 82% of our total revenue in the quarter, grew 9.1% on an OCC basis during the third quarter, building upon the 9.3% OCC growth we delivered last year. This quarter's growth was broad-based across most of our subscription-based solutions, especially in our largest businesses. In particular, our forms rules and loss costs business led the contribution to subscription growth where our engagement efforts and the enthusiasm around Core Line Reimagine continues to deliver strong outcomes during contract renewal as we are focusing on the value we are creating for our clients, supported by the tailwind of premium growth. In anti-fraud, we experienced strong growth in our claim search and claims essential solutions, primarily driven by the continued success of our pricing and bundling strategy, with a focus on third-party administrators. Growth was also augmented by a strong uptake of some of our newer solutions, including claims coverage identifier and claims scoring. In extreme event solutions, we delivered another quarter of very strong growth. We are hearing from our insurers, reinsurers, and brokers' clients that they value our continuous updates to our models incorporating the most recent data and science, including in our next generation models. This momentum has led to an additional 10 new clients signed in this quarter alone, as our sales teams are capitalizing on the growth of certain client segments, including excess and surplus lines of insurance and managing general agents or MGAs. Finally, this quarter's subscription growth does also reflect the benefit of ongoing conversions to subscription from previously transactional contracts, including the one discrete government contract that we mentioned last quarter, which contributed approximately 60 basis points to the third quarter's subscription revenue growth. Our transactional revenues, representing 18% of total revenue in the quarter, declined 2.5% on an OCC basis. This decline was a function of the strong results reported last year, which benefited from elevated levels of weather auto shopping activity and the non-rate action deal. This decline also reflects the impact of the conversions to subscription from previously transactional revenue. If you normalized for the one discrete contract conversion previously mentioned, transactional revenue growth would have been essentially flat. Partially offsetting the decline, we did experience double-digit growth in international underwriting, including life, health, and travel business. A modest transactional benefit from the storms in our property estimating solutions business and strong transactional growth in our personal lines property solutions as our carrier clients are turning to Verisk data to help them navigate rising premiums in that line of insurance. Moving now to our adjusted EBITDA results, OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 7.2% in the quarter, while total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results, was 55.2%, up 120 basis points from the reported results in the prior year. As we have mentioned previously, the margin rate in any given quarter can be influenced by revenue mix and timing of expenditures. Therefore, we find it useful to examine our margin on a trailing 12 month basis, which stood at 54.6% at the end of the third quarter, up 130 basis points year-over-year. This level of margin expansion highlights the effects of strong revenue growth, ongoing cost discipline, and our global talent optimization initiative, offset in part by continued investment in our finance transformation and higher medical benefit expenses. Additionally, our margins benefited from a foreign exchange translation impact, which helped margins by approximately 60 basis points in the quarter. This FX benefit was not contemplated in our guidance, as we do not forecast or hedge foreign currency. For the full year 2024, we continue to expect our margins to remain in the 54% to 55% range. We remain confident in our ability to achieve our margin expansion targets, while strategically investing in future growth opportunities. Continuing down the income statement, net interest expense was $32 million compared to $29 million in the same period last year. This increase is primarily due to higher interest expenses from the issuance of senior notes in the second quarter at a higher interest rate, leading to an increased run rate expense going forward. Our current leverage remains at 2 times, which is at the lower end of our targeted range of 2 to 3 times adjusted EBITDA. Our reported effective tax rate was 22.9% compared to 25% in the prior year quarter. The prior year quarter's rate was elevated due to one-time items that did not repeat. For the fourth quarter, we believe that our tax rate will be in the previously provided range of 23% to 25%. There could always be some quarterly variability related to employee stock option exercise activity. Adjusted net income increased 7.8% to $239 million, and diluted adjusted EPS increased 9.9% to $1.67 for the quarter. The increase is primarily driven by solid revenue growth, strong margin expansion, a lower effective tax rate, and a lower average share count. This was partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense. From a cash flow perspective, on a reported basis, net cash from operating activities increased 18% to $296 million, while free cash flow increased 23% to $241 million, demonstrating the strong cash flow generation characteristics of our subscription-based business model. We are committed to returning capital to shareholders, and during the quarter, we returned $455 million through repurchases and dividends. This includes our new $400 million accelerated share repurchase program, which was completed in October, and our cash dividend of $0.39 per share, an increase of 15% from 2023. We are pleased with the third quarter and year-to-date performance. Our outlook for 2024 remains unchanged. More specifically, we continue to expect consolidated revenue for 2024 to be in the range of $2.84 billion to $2.9 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.54 billion to $1.6 billion, and adjusted EBITDA margin in the 54% to 55% range. Below the line, we expect fixed asset depreciation to be at the high end of the range as we continue to put new projects into service. Combined with the slightly higher net interest expense due to our refinancing, the net result is that we still expect adjusted earnings in the range of $6.30 to $6.60 per share. A complete listing of all guidance measures can be found in the earnings slide deck, which has been posted to the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. And now I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments.\nLee Shavel : Thanks, Elizabeth. In summary, our strategic priorities are unchanged as we remain focused on delivering consistent and predictable growth while allocating capital to our highest return on investment opportunities and returning excess capital to shareholders. Our focus on heightened strategic engagement with clients has strengthened relationships and fostered new product and business opportunities for the industry where we can invest at scale to drive value for our clients, employees, and shareholders. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.\nToni Kaplan: Just given where we are in the year, I'm trying to think of through the dynamics for 2025. So I think there was 10% net premium growth in the industry in 2023. So the part that's tied to your premiums should be pretty strong. And transactional has pretty easy comps over the next four quarters. And then it seems like extreme events and life and international are going really well. So I guess my question is, is 2025 setting up for an outsized year of growth? Or are there any headwinds that we should be thinking about?\nElizabeth Mann: As we think about 2025, I think you've articulated well the tailwinds that we see in the business, the subscription momentum that we feel and the continued strong premium environment. As we think about potential headwinds that could offset it, we are going into the third year of elevated premium growth. And so, that is a longer cycle that the pricing momentum can feel those challenges. I think another element we are in an environment where the carriers are very focused on their profitability. They're evaluating lines of business and which ones that they are in, as well as kind of evaluating their overall spend. So that is one element of headwind. And then finally, you could start to see a normalization of attrition, which has been a boost for us over the last couple of years. So those are some of the headwinds. Then as an unknown, there is the weather factor. But in general, as we think about it, we do see strong momentum in the business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets.\nAshish Sabadra: Is there a way for us to estimate the tailwinds from the hurricanes Helene and Milton in 4Q, but also the tailwinds for the property estimating solutions going forward.\nElizabeth Mann: As we think about the fourth quarter \u2013 and both Helene and Milton hit in the fourth quarter, Helene was the very end of September, Milton obviously in early October \u2013 it is early to tell and quantify the impact to us. You can look at the estimates of insured losses that have been published. Verisk's estimates, which our extreme events business has published, had insured losses estimated at $6 billion to $11 billion for Helene and $30 billion to $50 billion for Hurricane Milton. As you look at those combined, you could say on average they're similar to Hurricane Ian. But the flow through to us can vary based on the number of assignments, the type of peril, whether it's wind or flood, the overall area covered by the storm. And from what we're seeing, it does take time for the claim to actually be filed as everyone there is focused on getting those communities back on their feet. The other thing I do want to put in context as you think about those \u2013 the impact of those storms in the fourth quarter. You've heard us talk in general across the business about converting contracts from transactional to subscriptions and from customers increasing their usage and committing to higher tiers. And that's happening in this property estimating solutions business as well. We've seen customers increasing their usages and then adapting their subscription contracts to reflect that higher usage. So how that could play out over time could mean less transactional swings on the impact of one single storm proportionally because the customers may be less likely to be in overage. So that transition to subscription has in general been a win-win for our business and you've seen it play out in our subscription growth.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kelsey Zhu with Autonomous.\nKelsey Zhu: It's just on subscription revenues in Q3. I was wondering if you can share a bit more colors on what drove the acceleration of growth. I know you've highlighted a number of segments where you've seen really strong growth and one of them is property estimating solutions. Now I was wondering if that is also impacted by kind of demand around Hurricane Helene and Milton as well.\nElizabeth Mann: As we looked at, you're right, we've seen accelerating subscription growth even sequentially from last quarter. When you really look at it, it isn't any one thing or one area of our business. Obviously, we've now called out and quantified the impact of the contract conversion, but the underlying subscription growth really hits across all of our businesses and the drivers are the ones that we really highlighted in the prepared remarks. It's the two factors, our focus go-to-market and customer client engagement and then the strengths being driven by our product development and innovation. And those two things are supported by the tailwind of premium growth. But in general, what you're seeing is the momentum from new sales from conversions to subscription and from upsizing usage and adding products from Verisk.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies.\nSurinder Thind: As we think about just the current health of the insurance companies and all of the change that's kind of pending, how do we think about this idea that insurance companies are trying to enter this period of much more focused profitability and you hear about \u2013 you see what's going on in Florida, California, some of the topics that we've talked about in the past. How are you guys assessing that? I don't want to call it a headwind, but just that transition that the industry seems to be going under in this part of the cycle.\nLee Shavel: Surinder, thank you very much for the question, particularly value the context and looking at the industry as a whole, which as you know, we spend a lot of time thinking about. From our perspective, I think when you look at the premium growth, you look at the improvements in the combined ratios and overall profitability of the business, and particularly in light of the significant storms and some of the hits that the industry has taken, I think it's a reflection of continued interest in the data and the analytics that we provide to them to make better risk decisions, which will continue to be a driver of opportunity for us because we can gather that information, we can apply analytical methods across \u2013 that can be utilized across the industry. But also to your point in terms of moving into this more focused profitability dimension, our work to identify where we can improve their internal processes by automating more of their functions, integrating data into the workflow has been a very active component of those higher level enterprise discussions that we're having. And it's a conversation that is happening at the chief information officer level and the CEO level or the heads of business that are interested in improving their process. And then a second element of that is how do we integrate external parties that are part of the insurance ecosystem in what they're doing to improve overall efficiency. A great example of that is what we have been doing in London with our white space platform where we are integrating brokers and underwriters to both improve the efficiency of that interaction, but also improving the data quality that the underwriters are utilizing to make to make placement decisions. So I think everything that you're that you are describing encourages continued engagement with us on finding and developing those solutions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank.\nFaiza Alwy: I wanted to ask about the benefits that you've been highlighting from Core Lines Reimagine. I'm curious of where we are in that journey and maybe if you could share with us sort of what percentage of your clients or any metrics you want to share are sort of on that Core Lines Reimagine program. And I think you talked about the new initiative called the Future of Forms. Should we expect that to be sort of a continuing or a similar level of value driver as we look ahead to 2025 and beyond?\nLee Shavel: I'm delighted to talk about that. I'm actually going to ask Saurabh Khemka who leads that business and has been an architect and a driver of that Core Lines Reimagined. And I'll just say that if both qualitatively the feedback and the engagement that we're getting from clients, we referred a little bit of that in terms of the executive insights that we're providing to them, but also the very specific dynamic of our ability to capture the value of that through the repricing of our longer term contracts and what we're hearing. But allow me to have Saurabh give more color in terms of what he's hearing directly from clients there.\nSaurabh Khemka: I think you had asked three things. First, in terms of where we are with the program, we are slightly more than halfway through the program as we think about the investment and where we are in terms of bringing new innovations to the customers. Second, you talked about how do we think about KPIs and how do we think about KPIs internally about the program. One of the things we look at is the number of new insights that we're bringing to market and the number of new insights that customers are benefiting from. So we've talked about the experience index where we've now launched that for five out of the six major lines of business. We'll launch the sixth one next year. The Future of Forms that we talked about, we started with our major general liability update. We expect that to become part of our major updates going forward. So you will see that next year as we bring in new updates to our BOP program. You're going to see that. So that is a continuous innovation that we're going to bring to market. And one thing that I just want to highlight that brings it all together for us as we think about customers and their engagement, we have a new engagement platform at core.verisk.com and we're highlighting that to our customers. And what we're seeing is as we're putting these new content and our existing content on this new platform, the engagement level is multiple times what we had previously. So we're excited that these new innovations are driving usage at our customers, which, as you know, drives the value for us from a core lines perspective.\nLee Shavel: And if I could add in a broader sense, I think that this is a reflection of several things. One, it's improving our ability to utilize the data sets because we've effectively had to pull those data sets out, manipulate them in ways in order to deliver them to our clients more effectively, which facilitates more fluidity analytically in what we can do and coupled with both the strong response that we're getting from clients to the product and our higher level of engagement. It is, I think, a change in the culture in which we're approaching developing our business. And while there are specific targets and product enhancements that we're pursuing, I think that it actually opens up a broader opportunity for us to think about how we utilize those data sets in new ways, serving other constituencies within our clients.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with J.P. Morgan.\nAndrew Steinerman: When you were talking about 2025 headwinds, and I appreciate the business has a lot of momentum, it's just prudent to mention the headwinds as well. One of the things you didn't list there is kind of the continued conversion from non-subs to subs. And we had that dynamic. You were kind enough to help us quantify it this quarter. But do you feel like that's going to be a notable headwind going forward?\nElizabeth Mann: The impact of that one conversion will be felt for approximately a year from the second quarter. So you'll see that. But we were talking about the business in aggregate. That's just a geographic shift from transaction to subscription, which is why I didn't call it out as a headwind overall.\nLee Shavel: I think that is an important distinction. And that's the reason why I pulled back to the overall growth. That adjustment was a specific geographic just shift from transactional to subscription. But that doesn't impact, I think, the longer term, the longer term opportunity for growth that we see in both the transactional and the subscription businesses.\nAndrew Steinerman: Lee, when you said 8% in your prepared remarks, you just meant all in total organic review growth a year ago. It was nine 9.4%. And this quarter was 6.8%. And you just did the two year stack for that. Right?\nLee Shavel: That's exactly right, Andrew.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird.\nJeff Meuler: Can you just give us any sense of, I guess, bookings, trends or quota attainment? The reasons you're citing as the primary drivers of the subs acceleration and momentum sound like better solution sales, not just the industry written premium tailwinds and transaction to subs conversion. But just if you can give us any sense on how bookings are trending.\nElizabeth Mann: Yes, they are trending well. That subscription growth is a function of strength overall, strength in acquiring new customers, strength in selling \u2013 all of the factors we talked about, cross sell and upsell and adding some of our new products and data sets.\nLee Shavel: I would broaden it to say, I think we are \u2013 the sales results have been strong relative to our expectations, given this performance and I think reflective of some of the changes that we made in our go-to-market strategy, focusing some of our territories, changing incentives, making some adjustments there, coupled with the higher level engagement, which is opening up opportunities for us to make a more value driven sale at a senior level. And so, it's a complementary impact of that higher senior level engagement and then more effective follow up and engagement on the sales front.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.\nManav Patnaik: Just a somewhat similar question. But, Elizabeth, I think in your remarks, you mentioned how Core Lines Reimagined, the progress there, was leading to better renewals. You mentioned pricing, but also it sounded like there was a volume component. So I was just hoping for some examples of how and what with that Core Lines Reimagined upgrade like are you \u2013 is the customer buying more of? I understand there's probably a pricing element because it's upgraded, but just some help there just to visualize that would be helpful.\nElizabeth Mann: For Core Lines Reimagined, there isn't exactly a volume component per se. So we're referring more to addition of new data sets, particularly in the underwriting data and analytics solutions business, as well as there's some growth products affiliated with Core Lines Reimagined, things like electronic ratings content and other ratings of the service. So, those are some of the types of additions that clients could be adding.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Nicholas: I wanted to ask on extreme event solutions. Elizabeth, you talked about or cited 10 new customer wins in the quarter in a few of the different customer segments where you're having success. Could you flesh that out a little bit more? Where are those wins coming from? What specifically is driving that increased interest from clients? And then also, like within that, are those competitive takeaways or are those taking advantage of white space on the extreme event front?\nElizabeth Mann: Of those 10 new customers, 9 of them are new to the modeling space entirely. So, I think this this shows and reflects the broader interest of adding more specific modeling information around the climate change and climate impacts that we're seeing. And I called out specifically some of the segments including excess and surplus lines of insurance and the managing general agents, which has been a significant growth area in the insurance industry, and focusing on those areas is something that has driven strength across our business, but the extreme events business has seen that as well. Let me also add my colleague Rob Newbold who runs that business to see if there's anything he'd add to that.\nRob Newbold: I'll just add to the point that, obviously, there have been heightened catastrophe loss activity for the past several years as we've referenced in past calls. Helene and Milton have already been mentioned. And you see an increasing number of market participants looking to better understand and quantify the risk from these events and that's driving interest in extreme event modeling solutions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Alex Kramm with UBS.\nAlex Kramm: Just maybe quickly on the auto shopping trends, I think this was the first quarter where it finally turned from a tailwind to a headwind. So, maybe you can help us a little bit in terms of the potential outlook here, maybe if we stay flat at these current levels how much that would weigh on the growth in the next 12 months or maybe if it's down whatever 10%, 15%, what that would mean for overall growth if you can be that specific.\nElizabeth Mann: You've heard us call out over the past five, six quarters now the strength in the auto shopping activity and more generally the transactional revenue growth in our auto insurance data business. And so, those headwinds are now playing out in the quarter as expected. I'm not sure we can quantify them in the future other than to say that the comps continue to be challenging on the transactional side for the auto business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Jeffrey Silber with BMO Capital Markets.\nJeffrey Silber: You reaffirmed your 2024 revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance, but it applies a pretty wide range for the fourth quarter. Are you being overly conservative or can you at least give us some indication what would be at the top end of the range or the low end of the range in terms of what's driving those assumptions.\nElizabeth Mann: As you know, for our guidance, our intention has always been to provide a full year estimate and not to give kind of quarterly mark-to-market. Obviously, here where we are, there's one quarter left. So, you're inferring that. But I think from everything we see, we are very much in line with that full year range.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Knudsen with Evercore.\nPeter Knudsen: Thank you for the helpful color and the prepared remarks on some of the new initiatives and products Verisk has rolled out and been working on. I'm wondering if you could share some more color specifically on the Discovery Navigator tool, if there are any adoption or utilization metrics you could share, that would be great. And maybe just more generally on any of your Gen AI capabilities. How are those going and what kind of conversations are our clients having with you around those products?\nLee Shavel: On your question, I'm going to ask Maroun Mourad, who has responsibility for our claims business and the Discovery Navigator feature to talk a little bit about how our clients are interacting with that. And then I'll circle back and provide some more color on a number of the Gen AI initiatives that we've been pursuing.\nMaroun Mourad: Within claims, we have been thoughtfully and responsibly deploying Gen AI solutions, both internally to drive productivity and externally to help our clients on their talent augmentation, modernization, as well as productivity journeys. To your specific question around Discovery Navigator and our casualty and bodily injury space, Discovery Navigator is effectively an AI driven automation innovation in the medical data extraction space that helps us extract specific data elements, organize and catalog them, and in addition, provide an executive summary to case files. And the technology has been developed with the help and supervision over a 12 to 14-month period of our highly experienced medical, as well as legal staff within the casualty business. We've also embarked just to add a couple of other notes on an innovation journey in the property estimating space for Gen AI. And a couple of examples there is an adjuster Copilot transcription summary that helps drive efficiency for adjusters, whether they're independent or working for companies as well as a last note summary as well within a claims file.\nLee Shavel: Peter, just to kind of broaden that out, in fact, your timing is great. Last week, we had, within Verisk, a Gen AI day where we pulled together all of our Gen AI practitioners and our data analytics executives to talk about how they are developing in their specific areas, generative AI for their for their tools, so that we can learn from each other, understand what's working and what's not. Some of the some of the products that we talked about was within our fast business, utilizing a feature called Ask Max, which is a an intelligent virtual assistant that helps clients understand how to utilize the fast installations for configuring and for end user processes, which facilitates their effectiveness and deploying that solution. We've talked previously about our underwriting copilot that we are working with a number of clients to develop to pull together data sets and automate functions in the underwriting, particularly in commercial property where we have a lot of data sets. We also have an application for our premium auditing as a service element. There's a lot of complex premium actuarial information. And this AI application helps cut the research time and empowers our customers to make informed decisions by accelerating their ability to retrieve and summarize premium audit documents. We also have an AI knowledge tool for our ISO electronic rating content that provides organized and detailed information about ISO circulars. And then we're also applying this to our Mozart Forms Composer. And you heard SK talk earlier about our Future of Forms. We are also applying an AI solution that will call out and summarize any changes made to ISO forms across versions. So this is just a sample of probably half dozen to a dozen specific applications as we're integrating this technology across our products to again improve the efficiency and productivity of our clients underwriting and claims professionals.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs.\nGeorge Tong: Transactional revenue, tough comps begin to lap in 4Q. Can you discuss what transactional revenue trends in 4Q are incorporated into your guidance? And how much benefit from hurricanes Helene and Milton is actually embedded into the reiterated outlook versus your upside?\nElizabeth Mann: I think we forecast in each year for sort of an average year of storms. I think you heard me talk about some of the puts and takes on Helene and Milton in the fourth quarter. The transactional revenue comps do lap, but of course, if you just look at the growth rate in the prior year, that itself was lapping the Hurricane Ian in the fourth quarter of 2022. The final thing I'll point out on the transactional variability is the contract conversion that we called out this quarter will continue to play out in the fourth quarter and first quarter next year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Haas with Wells Fargo.\nJason Haas: I'm curious if you could walk through again the moving pieces on guidance. It sounds like there's now at least some level of hurricane benefit baked into 4Q. I think I also caught that there was a 60 basis point benefit to margins from FX in 3Q. I'm not sure if you now expect to see something similar in 4Q. And then it sounds like there was an offset from higher interest expenses. I'm sorry if I missed it, but if you could say what interest expense you're expecting for 4Q and then if there's just any other puts and takes that I missed, it would be appreciated if you could walk through this again.\nElizabeth Mann: Our guidance ranges are really for the full year, and so the puts and takes that we're talking about in the quarter are all kind of small relative to that, but happy to walk you through those in order. On the margin, we called out for this quarter the 60 basis point FX benefit, which was not contemplated in the guidance range, nor do we forecast that for the fourth quarter. We feed that to the currency traders, I guess. The interest expense I called out was $32 million this quarter, up from $29 million the year previous. You could think of that as a reasonable run rate. Possibly over time, I suppose the net interest expense would go up as interest rates earned on cash balances could come down. I think those were the various puts and takes that I called out for the full year guidance and that hit the third quarter.\nJason Haas: It sounds like, otherwise to the underlying business, there's no change relative to your prior guidance?\nElizabeth Mann: That's right.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And your next question comes from the line of Russell Quelch with Redburn Atlantic.\nRussell Quelch: I wanted to ask about the international business. I think you called out, if I heard it right, in the pre-scripted remarks, you've seen an increased contribution to growth from the international business in the quarter. Maybe you could be a bit more specific about that, exactly what parts of the international business that's coming from, and if this is an area where you might look for further inorganic opportunities to grow in 2025, now you're at the bottom end of your leverage range and obviously funding rates are coming down.\nLee Shavel: We've seen strength actually in a number of our international businesses. I think we called out the life health and travel business, which continues to expand into new regions and being pulled there by their customers. So that's seen strong growth. Our Okta business in Canada contributed as well to that growth. I think Lee talked about some of the integration of some of the Verisk data sets there. So that's a good example of synergies and strength from the Verisk overall business contributing to one of our international acquisitions. So all of those are factors for good growth and our claims businesses in Germany have been doing well as well. So, yes, that is an area where we will continue to look for potential acquisitions.\nLee Shavel: I would just add also, as we've talked about with our specialty business solutions business, that we continue to see strength and a strong contribution to our overall growth rate from the services that they're providing.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. Therefore, this concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Elizabeth Mann",
            "content": "Thanks, Lee. And good day to everyone on the call. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, third quarter revenue was $725 million, up 7% versus the prior year, reflecting consistent levels of growth across both underwriting and claims. Income from continuing operations was $220 million, up 17.4% versus the prior year, while diluted GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.54, up 19.4% versus the prior year. The increase in diluted GAAP EPS was driven by strong operating performance, a litigation reserve expense in the prior year period, and a lower effective tax rate. Moving to our organic constant currency results for the third quarter, adjusted for non-operating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release. Our operating results demonstrated consistent growth across both underwriting and claims. OCC revenues grew 6.8%, with growth of 6.5% in underwriting and 7.4% in claims. The solid revenue growth is compounding from the 9.4% OCC revenue growth from the prior year and reflects improvement from the second quarter in both the underwriting and claims businesses, as well as in our total subscription and transactional revenues. Our subscription revenues, which comprised 82% of our total revenue in the quarter, grew 9.1% on an OCC basis during the third quarter, building upon the 9.3% OCC growth we delivered last year. This quarter's growth was broad-based across most of our subscription-based solutions, especially in our largest businesses. In particular, our forms rules and loss costs business led the contribution to subscription growth where our engagement efforts and the enthusiasm around Core Line Reimagine continues to deliver strong outcomes during contract renewal as we are focusing on the value we are creating for our clients, supported by the tailwind of premium growth. In anti-fraud, we experienced strong growth in our claim search and claims essential solutions, primarily driven by the continued success of our pricing and bundling strategy, with a focus on third-party administrators. Growth was also augmented by a strong uptake of some of our newer solutions, including claims coverage identifier and claims scoring. In extreme event solutions, we delivered another quarter of very strong growth. We are hearing from our insurers, reinsurers, and brokers' clients that they value our continuous updates to our models incorporating the most recent data and science, including in our next generation models. This momentum has led to an additional 10 new clients signed in this quarter alone, as our sales teams are capitalizing on the growth of certain client segments, including excess and surplus lines of insurance and managing general agents or MGAs. Finally, this quarter's subscription growth does also reflect the benefit of ongoing conversions to subscription from previously transactional contracts, including the one discrete government contract that we mentioned last quarter, which contributed approximately 60 basis points to the third quarter's subscription revenue growth. Our transactional revenues, representing 18% of total revenue in the quarter, declined 2.5% on an OCC basis. This decline was a function of the strong results reported last year, which benefited from elevated levels of weather auto shopping activity and the non-rate action deal. This decline also reflects the impact of the conversions to subscription from previously transactional revenue. If you normalized for the one discrete contract conversion previously mentioned, transactional revenue growth would have been essentially flat. Partially offsetting the decline, we did experience double-digit growth in international underwriting, including life, health, and travel business. A modest transactional benefit from the storms in our property estimating solutions business and strong transactional growth in our personal lines property solutions as our carrier clients are turning to Verisk data to help them navigate rising premiums in that line of insurance. Moving now to our adjusted EBITDA results, OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 7.2% in the quarter, while total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results, was 55.2%, up 120 basis points from the reported results in the prior year. As we have mentioned previously, the margin rate in any given quarter can be influenced by revenue mix and timing of expenditures. Therefore, we find it useful to examine our margin on a trailing 12 month basis, which stood at 54.6% at the end of the third quarter, up 130 basis points year-over-year. This level of margin expansion highlights the effects of strong revenue growth, ongoing cost discipline, and our global talent optimization initiative, offset in part by continued investment in our finance transformation and higher medical benefit expenses. Additionally, our margins benefited from a foreign exchange translation impact, which helped margins by approximately 60 basis points in the quarter. This FX benefit was not contemplated in our guidance, as we do not forecast or hedge foreign currency. For the full year 2024, we continue to expect our margins to remain in the 54% to 55% range. We remain confident in our ability to achieve our margin expansion targets, while strategically investing in future growth opportunities. Continuing down the income statement, net interest expense was $32 million compared to $29 million in the same period last year. This increase is primarily due to higher interest expenses from the issuance of senior notes in the second quarter at a higher interest rate, leading to an increased run rate expense going forward. Our current leverage remains at 2 times, which is at the lower end of our targeted range of 2 to 3 times adjusted EBITDA. Our reported effective tax rate was 22.9% compared to 25% in the prior year quarter. The prior year quarter's rate was elevated due to one-time items that did not repeat. For the fourth quarter, we believe that our tax rate will be in the previously provided range of 23% to 25%. There could always be some quarterly variability related to employee stock option exercise activity. Adjusted net income increased 7.8% to $239 million, and diluted adjusted EPS increased 9.9% to $1.67 for the quarter. The increase is primarily driven by solid revenue growth, strong margin expansion, a lower effective tax rate, and a lower average share count. This was partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense. From a cash flow perspective, on a reported basis, net cash from operating activities increased 18% to $296 million, while free cash flow increased 23% to $241 million, demonstrating the strong cash flow generation characteristics of our subscription-based business model. We are committed to returning capital to shareholders, and during the quarter, we returned $455 million through repurchases and dividends. This includes our new $400 million accelerated share repurchase program, which was completed in October, and our cash dividend of $0.39 per share, an increase of 15% from 2023. We are pleased with the third quarter and year-to-date performance. Our outlook for 2024 remains unchanged. More specifically, we continue to expect consolidated revenue for 2024 to be in the range of $2.84 billion to $2.9 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.54 billion to $1.6 billion, and adjusted EBITDA margin in the 54% to 55% range. Below the line, we expect fixed asset depreciation to be at the high end of the range as we continue to put new projects into service. Combined with the slightly higher net interest expense due to our refinancing, the net result is that we still expect adjusted earnings in the range of $6.30 to $6.60 per share. A complete listing of all guidance measures can be found in the earnings slide deck, which has been posted to the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. And now I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments. As we think about 2025, I think you've articulated well the tailwinds that we see in the business, the subscription momentum that we feel and the continued strong premium environment. As we think about potential headwinds that could offset it, we are going into the third year of elevated premium growth. And so, that is a longer cycle that the pricing momentum can feel those challenges. I think another element we are in an environment where the carriers are very focused on their profitability. They're evaluating lines of business and which ones that they are in, as well as kind of evaluating their overall spend. So that is one element of headwind. And then finally, you could start to see a normalization of attrition, which has been a boost for us over the last couple of years. So those are some of the headwinds. Then as an unknown, there is the weather factor. But in general, as we think about it, we do see strong momentum in the business. As we think about the fourth quarter \u2013 and both Helene and Milton hit in the fourth quarter, Helene was the very end of September, Milton obviously in early October \u2013 it is early to tell and quantify the impact to us. You can look at the estimates of insured losses that have been published. Verisk's estimates, which our extreme events business has published, had insured losses estimated at $6 billion to $11 billion for Helene and $30 billion to $50 billion for Hurricane Milton. As you look at those combined, you could say on average they're similar to Hurricane Ian. But the flow through to us can vary based on the number of assignments, the type of peril, whether it's wind or flood, the overall area covered by the storm. And from what we're seeing, it does take time for the claim to actually be filed as everyone there is focused on getting those communities back on their feet. The other thing I do want to put in context as you think about those \u2013 the impact of those storms in the fourth quarter. You've heard us talk in general across the business about converting contracts from transactional to subscriptions and from customers increasing their usage and committing to higher tiers. And that's happening in this property estimating solutions business as well. We've seen customers increasing their usages and then adapting their subscription contracts to reflect that higher usage. So how that could play out over time could mean less transactional swings on the impact of one single storm proportionally because the customers may be less likely to be in overage. So that transition to subscription has in general been a win-win for our business and you've seen it play out in our subscription growth. As we looked at, you're right, we've seen accelerating subscription growth even sequentially from last quarter. When you really look at it, it isn't any one thing or one area of our business. Obviously, we've now called out and quantified the impact of the contract conversion, but the underlying subscription growth really hits across all of our businesses and the drivers are the ones that we really highlighted in the prepared remarks. It's the two factors, our focus go-to-market and customer client engagement and then the strengths being driven by our product development and innovation. And those two things are supported by the tailwind of premium growth. But in general, what you're seeing is the momentum from new sales from conversions to subscription and from upsizing usage and adding products from Verisk. The impact of that one conversion will be felt for approximately a year from the second quarter. So you'll see that. But we were talking about the business in aggregate. That's just a geographic shift from transaction to subscription, which is why I didn't call it out as a headwind overall. Yes, they are trending well. That subscription growth is a function of strength overall, strength in acquiring new customers, strength in selling \u2013 all of the factors we talked about, cross sell and upsell and adding some of our new products and data sets. For Core Lines Reimagined, there isn't exactly a volume component per se. So we're referring more to addition of new data sets, particularly in the underwriting data and analytics solutions business, as well as there's some growth products affiliated with Core Lines Reimagined, things like electronic ratings content and other ratings of the service. So, those are some of the types of additions that clients could be adding. Of those 10 new customers, 9 of them are new to the modeling space entirely. So, I think this this shows and reflects the broader interest of adding more specific modeling information around the climate change and climate impacts that we're seeing. And I called out specifically some of the segments including excess and surplus lines of insurance and the managing general agents, which has been a significant growth area in the insurance industry, and focusing on those areas is something that has driven strength across our business, but the extreme events business has seen that as well. Let me also add my colleague Rob Newbold who runs that business to see if there's anything he'd add to that. You've heard us call out over the past five, six quarters now the strength in the auto shopping activity and more generally the transactional revenue growth in our auto insurance data business. And so, those headwinds are now playing out in the quarter as expected. I'm not sure we can quantify them in the future other than to say that the comps continue to be challenging on the transactional side for the auto business. As you know, for our guidance, our intention has always been to provide a full year estimate and not to give kind of quarterly mark-to-market. Obviously, here where we are, there's one quarter left. So, you're inferring that. But I think from everything we see, we are very much in line with that full year range. I think we forecast in each year for sort of an average year of storms. I think you heard me talk about some of the puts and takes on Helene and Milton in the fourth quarter. The transactional revenue comps do lap, but of course, if you just look at the growth rate in the prior year, that itself was lapping the Hurricane Ian in the fourth quarter of 2022. The final thing I'll point out on the transactional variability is the contract conversion that we called out this quarter will continue to play out in the fourth quarter and first quarter next year. Our guidance ranges are really for the full year, and so the puts and takes that we're talking about in the quarter are all kind of small relative to that, but happy to walk you through those in order. On the margin, we called out for this quarter the 60 basis point FX benefit, which was not contemplated in the guidance range, nor do we forecast that for the fourth quarter. We feed that to the currency traders, I guess. The interest expense I called out was $32 million this quarter, up from $29 million the year previous. You could think of that as a reasonable run rate. Possibly over time, I suppose the net interest expense would go up as interest rates earned on cash balances could come down. I think those were the various puts and takes that I called out for the full year guidance and that hit the third quarter. That's right."

            "name": "Lee Shavel",
            "content": "Thank you, Stacey. Good morning and thank you for participating in today's call. I'm pleased to share that our operating momentum continued as Verisk delivered another quarter of strong financial results, led by our subscription revenue growth of 9.1% with contributions from both underwriting and claims. Transactional revenues were down slightly due to the strong double-digit growth from weather and shopping activity in the prior year as well as the ongoing conversion of transactional revenues into committed subscription contracts. Returning to overall revenue growth, unaffected by contract transitions from last year, organic constant currency revenue growth was 8% on a two-year compound annual growth basis at the high end of our longer-term targets established at Investor Day. Elizabeth will provide much more detail in her financial review, but these results demonstrate the compounding power of our subscription-based business model, driven by the value we create for our clients. I'm confident that 2024 is on track to be another year delivering on the strategy and financial targets we established at Investor Day. There are two fundamental drivers to the strong subscription growth we've been achieving. First is our enhanced go-to-market approach, which elevates and intensifies our strategic dialogue with clients. The second is the strength of our products and solutions built on proprietary data sets and continuously enhanced as we scale innovation and invest on behalf of the industry. On the first lever, with our client engagement, as I engage across the property and casualty insurance industry, we are seeing improving industry-wide financial metrics, helped by continued strong premium growth. Swiss Re now forecasts that 2024 direct written premiums will grow 9.5%. So there will be variability by line. Profitability across the sector is also improving as net industry-wide combined ratios have improved by over 2 points to 99.4, indicating underwriting profits. While catastrophe losses are expected to be elevated for the remainder of the year due to recent hurricanes, the expectation is that insurance and reinsurance industry participants are in a stronger financial position than in prior years and better able to absorb these cat-related losses. Since our last call, I've had the opportunity to participate in several industry events, including the Rendez-Vous de Septembre in Monte Carlo, the CIAB Insurance Leadership Conference, and our own Valmet Insurance Conference in London. At each of these, the opportunities to engage with the highest levels of leadership has enhanced our understanding of our clients enterprise needs, broadened and strengthened our relationships, and opened new doors to opportunities to work with them. What I have heard consistently and we are acting on is a strong desire to see us connect more of our data sets and analytics for enterprise solutions directly and with our partners. We are pursuing several product initiatives between underwriting claims, extreme events, and specialty business solutions to deliver on that very objective. Another reflection of our broader engagement to find, develop, and leverage solutions for the industry is the opportunity I'll have to engage with insurance constituencies as a member of the Federal Advisory Committee on Insurance. With heightened focus on the importance of the insurance industry in the midst of severe weather events, being at the table with industry partners to find ways to improve is an important responsibility for Verisk. I have already participated in discussions on improving community resilience and managing the impact of severe weather events. In addition, we believe the opportunity to serve a broader range of agencies beyond our role in supporting the National Flood Insurance Program and Community Rating System for FEMA and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act program for the Department of Treasury is an important opportunity to support communities and industry. With all client engagements, the follow-up on these opportunities is focused, supported by the enhancements we've made in our client engagement structure and investments in our sales coverage. I believe the strength in our subscription growth reflects in part the progress we are making in elevating our dialogue and relationships, and then capitalizing on the opportunities we create. The second factor driving our subscription revenue growth is the strength of our data and solutions and our ability to innovate through data enhancement and responsibly combining data sets. Let me give you some examples of our progress this quarter. Our most significant initiative to drive more value for our clients is Core Lines Reimagine, which we have discussed with you at length. We continue to advance our progress in delivering proprietary content to clients more digitally, integrating more seamlessly into their workflows, and providing more analytics and insights. To that end, in the third quarter, we had the first release of an initiative we call the Future of Forms. Future of Forms addresses our clients' challenge of understanding and managing through the complexity of major policy updates. The Future of Forms introduces a data visualization for our forms filing with this first release focused on general liability. This new digital experience allows insurers to save time analyzing our content by interacting with our forms filings in an entirely new way. And the early response from our clients has been very positive with specific feedback saying that this new solution is easy to navigate and a significant time saver for their teams. Additionally, as we have previously discussed, we continue to receive interest and inbound inquiries from our clients through the release of our executive insights reports, which leverage our statistical data to provide key trends. In the third quarter, we added to our library of reports by introducing executive insights for personal auto and general liability. We now have executive insights covering five of the six major lines of business, with plans to introduce reports for commercial auto in the first half of 2025. Executive insights not only provides our clients with benchmarking analyses for their book of business, but also provides a deeper look into the broader market. These reports reinforce Verisk's thought leadership position in the industry by providing this granular and unique view of the data in a timely manner. And the new product creates additional fuel for our client engagement teams, serving as a touch point for new C-level conversations and delivers on a consistent request for more insights. As I mentioned earlier, we are also driving value by continuing to enhance our solutions by combining data sets across the Verisk family. To that end, we recently combined Verisk's claims data into Okta's enhanced peril score for the Canadian market. The peril score is powered by predictive analytics and location-specific data to predict severity and the likelihood of claims at a property. The addition of the Verisk claims data has enhanced the model, driving more insightful signals for our clients and leading to reinvigorated sales growth of this solution. Our commitment to driving value and improving efficiency and automation is also a focus within the four walls of Verisk as we innovate around our internal data collection and management processes. We recently launched a new fully mobile application that allows our field representatives to complete engineering assessments and loss cost surveys directly from the field. We expect this initiative to speed up cycle times for surveys, while also including more data validations and further automation of our quality control process. As you might imagine, our continued engagement focuses on issues that are top of mind for our clients and often top of mind for our shareholders as well. Most recently, Hurricanes Beryl, Helene, and Milton have brought renewed attention to climate risks, catastrophe losses, and resilience. Our conversations are focused on the comprehensive suite of solutions we currently offer that help our clients plan for, react, and respond to climate risks. In our extreme events business, we help our clients evaluate and price catastrophe risks by modeling the view of probable outcomes and impacts on their book of business before the events make landfall. Our catastrophe models calculate a view of loss outcomes, incorporating not only the most advanced weather signs, but also detailed understanding of local building codes and construction standards. Investing in mitigation efforts to manage and reduce losses is one of the keys to containing the industry losses from climate change. To that end, Verisk's work in conjunction with FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program helps assess community level efforts to reduce and avoid flood damage to insurable properties. Known as the Community Rating System, this program is based on technical data on flood plain mitigation that is collected and analyzed by Verisk. Through this program, communities can achieve discounts on flood insurance premiums for their property owners, making flood insurance more affordable for the end consumer. And finally, our property estimating solutions and anti-fraud solutions help insurance ecosystem participants respond after the impact of storms. Our solutions power a network that allows carriers, independent adjusters, and restoration contractors to estimate the cost to repair and rebuild storm impacted property in an automated and efficient way while also identifying fraud to make sure that only the valid claims get paid. I'm energized by the opportunity that lies ahead. In my conversations with the leaders of our clients, there is strong appetite to invest in technologies that can drive value in the form of better risk selection, more automation efficiency, and they are turning to Verisk as the trusted partner to help them. Now let me turn the call over to Elizabeth to review our financial results for the third quarter and year-to-date basis. Thanks, Elizabeth. In summary, our strategic priorities are unchanged as we remain focused on delivering consistent and predictable growth while allocating capital to our highest return on investment opportunities and returning excess capital to shareholders. Our focus on heightened strategic engagement with clients has strengthened relationships and fostered new product and business opportunities for the industry where we can invest at scale to drive value for our clients, employees, and shareholders. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions. Surinder, thank you very much for the question, particularly value the context and looking at the industry as a whole, which as you know, we spend a lot of time thinking about. From our perspective, I think when you look at the premium growth, you look at the improvements in the combined ratios and overall profitability of the business, and particularly in light of the significant storms and some of the hits that the industry has taken, I think it's a reflection of continued interest in the data and the analytics that we provide to them to make better risk decisions, which will continue to be a driver of opportunity for us because we can gather that information, we can apply analytical methods across \u2013 that can be utilized across the industry. But also to your point in terms of moving into this more focused profitability dimension, our work to identify where we can improve their internal processes by automating more of their functions, integrating data into the workflow has been a very active component of those higher level enterprise discussions that we're having. And it's a conversation that is happening at the chief information officer level and the CEO level or the heads of business that are interested in improving their process. And then a second element of that is how do we integrate external parties that are part of the insurance ecosystem in what they're doing to improve overall efficiency. A great example of that is what we have been doing in London with our white space platform where we are integrating brokers and underwriters to both improve the efficiency of that interaction, but also improving the data quality that the underwriters are utilizing to make to make placement decisions. So I think everything that you're that you are describing encourages continued engagement with us on finding and developing those solutions. I'm delighted to talk about that. I'm actually going to ask Saurabh Khemka who leads that business and has been an architect and a driver of that Core Lines Reimagined. And I'll just say that if both qualitatively the feedback and the engagement that we're getting from clients, we referred a little bit of that in terms of the executive insights that we're providing to them, but also the very specific dynamic of our ability to capture the value of that through the repricing of our longer term contracts and what we're hearing. But allow me to have Saurabh give more color in terms of what he's hearing directly from clients there. And if I could add in a broader sense, I think that this is a reflection of several things. One, it's improving our ability to utilize the data sets because we've effectively had to pull those data sets out, manipulate them in ways in order to deliver them to our clients more effectively, which facilitates more fluidity analytically in what we can do and coupled with both the strong response that we're getting from clients to the product and our higher level of engagement. It is, I think, a change in the culture in which we're approaching developing our business. And while there are specific targets and product enhancements that we're pursuing, I think that it actually opens up a broader opportunity for us to think about how we utilize those data sets in new ways, serving other constituencies within our clients. I think that is an important distinction. And that's the reason why I pulled back to the overall growth. That adjustment was a specific geographic just shift from transactional to subscription. But that doesn't impact, I think, the longer term, the longer term opportunity for growth that we see in both the transactional and the subscription businesses. That's exactly right, Andrew. I would broaden it to say, I think we are \u2013 the sales results have been strong relative to our expectations, given this performance and I think reflective of some of the changes that we made in our go-to-market strategy, focusing some of our territories, changing incentives, making some adjustments there, coupled with the higher level engagement, which is opening up opportunities for us to make a more value driven sale at a senior level. And so, it's a complementary impact of that higher senior level engagement and then more effective follow up and engagement on the sales front. On your question, I'm going to ask Maroun Mourad, who has responsibility for our claims business and the Discovery Navigator feature to talk a little bit about how our clients are interacting with that. And then I'll circle back and provide some more color on a number of the Gen AI initiatives that we've been pursuing. Peter, just to kind of broaden that out, in fact, your timing is great. Last week, we had, within Verisk, a Gen AI day where we pulled together all of our Gen AI practitioners and our data analytics executives to talk about how they are developing in their specific areas, generative AI for their for their tools, so that we can learn from each other, understand what's working and what's not. Some of the some of the products that we talked about was within our fast business, utilizing a feature called Ask Max, which is a an intelligent virtual assistant that helps clients understand how to utilize the fast installations for configuring and for end user processes, which facilitates their effectiveness and deploying that solution. We've talked previously about our underwriting copilot that we are working with a number of clients to develop to pull together data sets and automate functions in the underwriting, particularly in commercial property where we have a lot of data sets. We also have an application for our premium auditing as a service element. There's a lot of complex premium actuarial information. And this AI application helps cut the research time and empowers our customers to make informed decisions by accelerating their ability to retrieve and summarize premium audit documents. We also have an AI knowledge tool for our ISO electronic rating content that provides organized and detailed information about ISO circulars. And then we're also applying this to our Mozart Forms Composer. And you heard SK talk earlier about our Future of Forms. We are also applying an AI solution that will call out and summarize any changes made to ISO forms across versions. So this is just a sample of probably half dozen to a dozen specific applications as we're integrating this technology across our products to again improve the efficiency and productivity of our clients underwriting and claims professionals. We've seen strength actually in a number of our international businesses. I think we called out the life health and travel business, which continues to expand into new regions and being pulled there by their customers. So that's seen strong growth. Our Okta business in Canada contributed as well to that growth. I think Lee talked about some of the integration of some of the Verisk data sets there. So that's a good example of synergies and strength from the Verisk overall business contributing to one of our international acquisitions. So all of those are factors for good growth and our claims businesses in Germany have been doing well as well. So, yes, that is an area where we will continue to look for potential acquisitions. I would just add also, as we've talked about with our specialty business solutions business, that we continue to see strength and a strong contribution to our overall growth rate from the services that they're providing."

            "content": "I think you had asked three things. First, in terms of where we are with the program, we are slightly more than halfway through the program as we think about the investment and where we are in terms of bringing new innovations to the customers. Second, you talked about how do we think about KPIs and how do we think about KPIs internally about the program. One of the things we look at is the number of new insights that we're bringing to market and the number of new insights that customers are benefiting from. So we've talked about the experience index where we've now launched that for five out of the six major lines of business. We'll launch the sixth one next year. The Future of Forms that we talked about, we started with our major general liability update. We expect that to become part of our major updates going forward. So you will see that next year as we bring in new updates to our BOP program. You're going to see that. So that is a continuous innovation that we're going to bring to market. And one thing that I just want to highlight that brings it all together for us as we think about customers and their engagement, we have a new engagement platform at core.verisk.com and we're highlighting that to our customers. And what we're seeing is as we're putting these new content and our existing content on this new platform, the engagement level is multiple times what we had previously. So we're excited that these new innovations are driving usage at our customers, which, as you know, drives the value for us from a core lines perspective."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.\nStacey Brodbar: Thank you, operator, and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our second quarter 2024 financial results. On the call today are Lee Shavel, Verisk's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Elizabeth Mann, Chief Financial Officer. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as our traditional quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. As set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance, including those related to our financial guidance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. A reconciliation of reported and historic non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call is provided in our 8-K and today's earnings presentation posted on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. However, we are not able to provide a reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable expected GAAP results because of the unreasonable effort and high unpredictability of estimating certain items that are excluded from projected non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, including, for example, tax consequences, acquisition-related costs, gains and losses from dispositions and other non-recurring expenses, the effect of which may be significant. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee Shavel.\nLee Shavel: Thanks, Stacey. Good morning, and thank you for participating in this morning's call. As we mark the halfway point in 2024, I can confidently say that we are on track to deliver against the strategic, operational and financial goals that we articulated at Investor Day and in our 2024 full year guidance. Elizabeth will provide the detailed financials, but at a high level, Verisk delivered solid organic constant currency revenue growth led most importantly by strong subscription growth of 8.3% that was broad-based across most of our businesses. This was partly offset in the quarter by modest declines in our transactional business, related to historically high volumes in auto shopping and elevated weather-related activity in the prior year quarter, which made for tough comparisons to normalized activity this quarter. We also experienced a drag on our transactional growth from the conversion of transaction-based contracts to subscriptions, which enhances the consistency of our growth going forward. To put this quarter in perspective and minimize the transaction to subscription conversion impact on a two-year compound annual growth rate basis, our total organic constant currency revenue growth has been 8%, at the high-end of our Investor Day revenue growth targets. We are driving subscription growth through strong renewals and improved price realization as our customers recognize the innovation and value-added upgrades we have incorporated into existing solutions. This is something that we've heard repeatedly in our renewal discussions with our largest clients. Our focus on cost discipline and operating efficiency resulted in healthy organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth and strong margin expansion, translating into 15% adjusted EPS growth. We delivered these results while continuing to invest in innovation and technologies that can help our clients improve speed, efficiency and accuracy through deeper insights, improved data and increased automation. Our strategy is unchanged as we focus on building long-term value for the insurance ecosystem while delivering consistent and predictable growth with high returns on capital for shareholders. The industry backdrop in which we are currently operating is one marked by continued strong premium growth as rate increases continue to earn in. In fact, in the first quarter of 2024, industry-wide direct premium growth increased 10%, and Swiss Re's forecast is for 8% growth for the full year. Profitability across the sector has improved, and industry-wide combined ratios have come down, though there is variability by line and geography. Carriers continue to be cautious in an uncertain environment and focused on driving profitability. Specific to the homeowners line of insurance, 2023 was the worst year on record for catastrophic losses with $15.2 billion in losses, and direct combined ratios in 17 states were above the breakeven threshold of 100. This has driven carriers to restrict underwriting in certain markets and in some cases, exit challenging states and lines of business. We are working with our clients and innovating new solutions that target these problem areas, including introducing new roof analytics that leverage aerial imagery and engaging with the respective departments of insurance in Western states to share the updates we have made to our wildfire solutions. In the near term, these market conditions may present some headwinds for our predominantly subscription property business, but in the longer term, we continue to believe it highlights the need for the most accurate information to best price the risk. Technological and regulatory change also continue to challenge the industry structurally. And we continue to partner with clients to help them address the rapid pace of technological change as well as increased regulatory scrutiny on data privacy, fairness, generative AI and climate risk. As another example of our work to support understanding of broad industry challenges, we recently co-authored a paper along with research organization RAND Corporation analyzing the impact of social inflation in insurance casualty claims payments with a focus on better understanding the trends, impact and potential structural factors in growing jury verdicts and trial awards. At the center of our growth strategy is our effort to engage with our clients on a more strategic level. As an example of what I've been hearing recently from clients, I've had conversations with both client CEOs and CIOs about the importance to them of integrating data sets across their enterprise for efficiency and consistency. We are the natural trusted technology partner to help with this data asset convergence as we are best positioned, given our deep data and domain expertise, our position in the industry and our proven track record of aggregating and integrating industry data at scale. These C-suite level and strategic conversations are opening up broader and enterprise-wide opportunities and applications of our data and analytics with the industry and new avenues for growth for Verisk. For example, in casualty, an area of focus for carriers due to the rising claim severity, our Liability Navigator is an analytic solution that objectively assesses bodily injury claims to help carriers improve settlement consistency across claim teams. By integrating our proprietary medical provider fraud data and our Discovery Navigator medical record review technology, we transformed previously unstructured and disparate medical data into actionable insights at the point of decision, thus improving efficiency and accuracy in bodily injury claims outcomes. Also key to our growth strategy is building upon our 50-plus year history in insurance and our competitive advantages and positioning to serve as a network for the insurance industry. To that end, in our specialty business solutions, we are delivering solid double-digit growth as we build out an interconnected ecosystem built upon the white space platform for participants in the London market, including brokers, underwriters and managing general agents. We are continuing to win new clients, adding 15 new clients in the quarter, and placement volumes are growing rapidly as the scale of the platform builds. This network effect is also active across our claims platforms as we continue to add new partners to our claims solutions ecosystem. The ClaimSearch partnership enables insurance technology providers to integrate with the ClaimSearch platform, allowing insurers to select the technology that best fits their individual business needs. Earlier this year, we announced two new collaborations with FRISS and Globlue Technologies, who are integrating with our ClaimSearch platform. This integration will facilitate advanced fraud analysis and detection, including more complex scoring and triaging to improve decision-making. Additionally, it should minimize the manual fraud detection process, saving valuable time and reducing operational costs for our clients. Finally, we continue to focus on innovation as a key pillar of our growth strategy. To that end, earlier this month, we officially launched ISO Experience Index, a new benchmarking tool which is part of our Core Lines Reimagine initiative. The ISO Experience Index is designed to modernize how actuaries in the insurance industry analyze risk patterns by addressing the increasing volatility and scale of loss patterns in the industry and offering a responsive and up-to-date indicator of observed underwriting experience. Experience Index empowers our clients to be more responsive to changing conditions across various geographic markets by offering quarterly releases with more frequent updates compared to traditional loss cost reviews. This enables our customers to make more informed decisions in real time. Experience Index is available for the homeowners line and will be expanded over time to other lines of insurance. Our customers are realizing the value we are delivering through Core Lines Reimagine, and we are benefiting from this investment through better price realization and improved client dialogues. In a recent conversation with the CEO of a national carrier, he expressed appreciation for our quarterly Emerging Issues updates. These reports are just one example of listening to our customers' requests to not only provide data but also deliver more valuable and actionable insights. And with that, let me turn it over to Elizabeth for the detailed financial review.\nElizabeth Mann: Thanks, Lee, and good day to everyone on the call. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, second quarter revenue was $717 million, up 6.2% versus the prior year, reflecting consistent levels of growth across both underwriting and claims. Income from continuing operations was $308 million, up 51% versus the prior year, while diluted GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.15, up 53% versus the prior year. The GAAP figures include a cumulative $102 million net gain associated with retained interest in previously disposed businesses as well as a gain associated with the bond tender transaction we entered in June. The underlying EPS growth reflects strong revenue and profit growth combined with a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count. Moving to our organic constant currency results for the second quarter. Adjusted for non-operating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, our operating results demonstrated consistent growth across both underwriting and claims. OCC revenues grew 6% with growth of 6% in underwriting and 5.8% in claims. This was a slowdown in growth as expected from the first quarter as we overlap the tough comparison to our largest ever transactional revenue dollar quarter in the second quarter of 2023. Our subscription revenues, which comprised 81% of our total revenue in the quarter, grew 8.3% on an OCC basis during the second quarter. We experienced broad-based growth across most of our subscription-based solutions with strong renewals and expanded relationships with existing customers and solid sales of new solutions. Our subscription growth also reflects the benefit of conversion to subscription from previously transactional contracts. In some cases, temporary assignments or pilots are converting into longer-term contracts. In other cases, customers are looking to move away from pricing mechanisms tied to volume and instead opting for fixed pricing to give more visibility in their own cost structures. We are experiencing this trend across underwriting data solutions, anti-fraud solutions, specialty and property estimating solutions. And we expect the impact of these conversions to continue for the remainder of the year. The largest contributor to subscription growth continues to be forms rules and loss costs, where we are benefiting from improved price realization in our renewals as we continue to modernize our platform and deliver more value and insights to our clients through features like Experience Index that Lee spoke about earlier. In anti-fraud, we experienced underlying strong price realization in the business with growth augmented by strong sales of new solutions, including Claims Coverage Identifier and Claims Scoring, our new real-time monitoring tool that uses both rules-based and predictive models to identify and triage suspected fraudulent claims. And within Extreme Event Solutions, we delivered another quarter of high single-digit subscription growth driven by strong multiyear renewals with existing clients as well as the addition of new logos to Verisk. Our transactional revenues, representing 19% of total revenue in the second quarter, declined 3% on an OCC basis, reflecting a tough comparison versus the prior year, a drag on growth from conversion to subscription and the impact of more year-over-year weather-related claims activity. This was offset in part by strong growth contribution from our life insurance business and securitization within our Extreme Events business. Specific to the tough comparisons, last year, transactional revenues increased 12.4% and included benefits from elevated levels of auto shopping activity as well as the large non-rate action deal we had called out. Our revenue associated with auto shopping did continue to grow in this year's second quarter, but not at the level of the trailing 12 months. We expect those tough comparisons in auto to continue for the balance of the year. And with regard to the weather-related claims activity, while frequency of events was up in the second quarter, the severity events and associated claims volume from those events was down year-over-year from record levels in 2023. It is this volume metric that impacts our transactional revenues within property estimating solutions. All that said, we continue to experience a longer-term secular trend of growing weather-related claims across the property sector. And in fact, while 2024 claims volumes are down in the second quarter year-over-year, they are still continuing an upward trend as they are running approximately 20% above the trailing 5-year average. Moving now to our adjusted EBITDA results. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 8.5% in the quarter. While total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results, was 55.4%, up 130 basis points from the reported results in the in the prior year. As we've said the past, margin rate in any given quarter can be influenced by revenue mix and timing of spending. So we think it's useful to look at our margin on a trailing 12-month basis, which, as of June 30, 2024, was 54.3%, up 120 basis points over last year's level. This level of margin expansion reflects the positive impact of sales leverage, cost discipline and our global talent optimization efforts. Our margins also reflect a lower level of headcount growth in the quarter we expect to accelerate hiring in the back half of year to support our growth investments. For the full year 2024, we continue to expect our margins to be in the 54% to 55% range. We remain confident in our ability to meet our margin expansion targets while strategically investing in future growth opportunities. Continuing down the income statement, net interest expense was $29 million for second quarter compared to $32 million in the prior year, reflecting higher interest income on cash balances. During the second quarter, we issued $600 million of senior notes due 2034 and successfully tendered for $400 million of our notes due in 2025. The net effect of these two financing transactions is that the ongoing run rate for net interest expense will be higher in the second half of the year than it was in the first half. That said, we are comfortable with our current leverage, which at 2x is at the low end of our targeted range of 2x to 3x EBITDA. On taxes, our reported effective tax rate was 21.7% compared to 23.8% in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year decrease in the tax rate is primarily due to the timing of certain discrete items that we do not expect to repeat. We believe that our tax rate for the full year 2024 will be at the low end of the 23% to 25% range. There could some quarterly variability related to employee stock option exercise equity. Adjusted net income increased 13% to $249 million, and diluted adjusted EPS increased 15% to $1.74 for the quarter. The increase is primarily driven by solid revenue growth, strong margin expansion, a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count. This was partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense. From a cash flow perspective, on a reported basis, net cash from operating activities increased 10% to $212 million while free cash flow increased 14% to $154 million. This is the first quarter that our cash flow metrics demonstrate the results of our insurance-only business and are reflective of the operating cash flow of the new Verisk. From an M&A perspective, we did not acquire or dispose of any businesses in the quarter. But we did receive $112 million in cash proceeds related to the prior sales of our health care business in 2016 and our specialized markets business in 2022. In both of those cases, we maintained a small structured equity position, which was monetized in this quarter. As of June 30, we had $632 million in cash on our balance sheet, which gives us the financial flexibility to continue self-fund the investment back into the business. We are also committed to returning capital shareholders. During the second quarter, we initiated a $150 million accelerated share repurchase program, which was completed in July. As of June 30, we had $1.3 billion in capacity remaining under our share repurchase authorization. We are pleased with our results for the second quarter and the first half of the year. Our outlook for 2024 remains unchanged. More specifically, we continue to expect consolidated revenue for 2024 to be in the range of $2.84 billion to $2.9 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.54 billion to $1.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin in the 54% to 55% range. Below the line, we expect fixed asset depreciation to be at the high end of the range as we continue to put new projects into service and the tax rate to be at the low end of the range, given certain onetime discrete items for the first half of the year. Combined with the slightly higher net interest expense due to our refinancing, the net result is that we still expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.30 to $6.60. A complete listing all guidance measures can be found in the earnings slide deck, which has been posted to the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. And now I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments.\nLee Shavel: Thanks, Elizabeth. In summary, our execution priorities are unchanged as we remain focused on delivering consistent and predictable growth while allocating capital to our highest return on investment opportunities. Our focus on heightened strategic engagement with clients, both large and small, has strengthened relationships and has fostered new product and business opportunities for the industry where we can invest at scale to drive value for our clients, employees and shareholders. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. Lee, I just wanted to follow up. You talked about the 8% growth on a two-year stack that's above kind of what it used to be. I was just wondering the components of that outperformance. I know you talked about pricing before. I was wondering this transition from transaction to subscription if there was a way to quantify how much that might have helped and just the sustainability of this for the next several years.\nLee Shavel: Good morning. Thank you, Manav, for the question. Yes. I appreciate the focus on the 8% two-year stack growth rate because I think it does give broader context beyond what we experienced in this quarter. And to answer your question, the drivers of that have been, generally speaking, more demand for our products from the industry as they are facing a variety of challenges in - on the underwriting side, on the claims side, the value of what we have been providing to them. But also, and I think this is the element that is the sustainable aspect of it is the success that we've had in increasing our value capture from the investments that we have made across the business. And this is something I referenced in the earlier comments. We are hearing it repeatedly from clients that they recognize the innovations, the investments that we have made, and that's enabling us in this environment to capture more of that value. And we believe that, that is a longer-term trend that will enable us to continue to meet that growth, supplemented by new products and new innovations that we are adding. We continued to see strong growth in our specialty business solutions area, where we've been innovating with our white space platform, which has those very strong network effects. We have continued to see growth in our international businesses, which is a penetration opportunity for us and growth in our life insurance business. So as we said at Investor Day, we have core strength where we are adding value and capturing that value in pricing. And that's supplemented by new penetration opportunities that we believe will sustain that growth over time. And then I'd finally add that the elevated strategic dialogue that we have accomplished with our clients is opening up new opportunities to provide our products on a broader enterprise and global basis to our clients. Recent - last week, I had two CEO-level calls, visits, where we spoke about how we can help improve the consistency of the data and the analytics that they are using across their organizations for some portions that aren't utilizing our data or our analytics. And I think that is a structural and relationship benefit that we've been able to achieve, and we'll see continued support on the growth - in our growth from those aspects. On the trends sub transition, it's happening in a variety of ways. Some of it is structural. Some of it is episodic. I think that it will be a diminishing impact over time. We had some stronger elements that that contributed to dynamic in this quarter and made for some of the more pronounced differentiation between subscription growth and transaction growth.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSurinder Thind: Thank you. Lee, is there any way to characterize the level of transaction activity related to things like weather? I think you guys mentioned auto remains elevated, but just get a better sense of how should we think about that on a go-forward basis or maybe a historical context?\nLee Shavel: Thank you, Surinder. So I think the thing that I would emphasize is that when you look at the second quarter of 2023 and you see the 12.4% growth, this is in the investor presentation on - in - that we had provided on the website. What we're experiencing was a very high level of shopping activity in auto as a function of rising rates within that business. You can look at the commentary of that. It was kind of truly exceptional - an exceptional level of shopping activity that was driving that transaction element. In addition, as you will see in the description around claims business, we were experiencing still a high level of weather-related claims activity that was also driving that business. And so that's really what is contributing to what we're - we are experiencing a relatively tough comparison enhanced by some of the transaction to subscription migrations that are more pronounced in this quarter. As we think about that element on an ongoing basis, I think we generally expect that our transactional growth rates are ones that are generally at our broader growth rates to slightly higher because in many cases, they represent some of our higher-growth businesses that tend to have more of a transactional aspect at the early stage. So with that, I'll ask Elizabeth to add some perspective.\nElizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks, Lee, for characterizing the factors that impact our transaction growth, and you can see the historical trends of it in that earnings presentation that he referenced. I think for mechanical reasons - well, first of all, it is variable over time. It's inherently harder to predict. We don't try predict the weather. But that inherent variability for some of the mechanical factors, for example, the conversion of transactional to subscription, that can have a one year - that effect can persist for a full year after a subscription locks in. So I just want to - we do expect tough comparisons for the balance of the year on that transactional revenue side.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks so much. And I sort of wanted to continue on this conversion topic. So I guess over the years, there have been some times that I can remember moving some revenue streams to subscription from transaction. And over time, I think that, that makes a lot of sense. In the near term, it creates a little bit of noise. And so I know you said you expect this to continue. But are there other products that you can think of within the portfolio that you will also pursue this conversion for as well? Like should we expect this to every so often come up as a theme that maybe the growth is a little bit lower in quarter, but for the long term, we're thinking of moving stuff to subscription? Are there other products that could fall into that as well? Thanks.\nElizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks for the question, Toni. You're right that we have previously talked about this in the context of our Claims Essential bundle, where there was a targeted effort for a certain customer segment. I would say as you hear us talk now more broadly across the business, we are seeing it in a number of different businesses where customers are on a pilot and choose to lock that in for a longer-term subscription or they have a subscription with overage tiers. And as their business grows, they lock into a higher subscription so that they have more visibility into their own price point. So those are trends that we will continue to see across the business. Over time, you've still seen that subscription-transactional mix of our revenues be fairly steady at 80-20-ish. And probably as some of our transactional customers convert into subscription, at the same time, we will have new and introductory products or new markets that we're entering where it's more common to enter it in a transactional basis. So we will continue to top up, I think, that transactional revenue base as well.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. Last quarter, there was also a reference to a double-digit growth within life insurance solutions and benefited the transactional revenue growth. I was wondering if you could highlight what is going on with the life insurance solution, both on the subscription but also transactional side? Thanks.\nLee Shavel: Yes. Thank you for the question, Ashish. We do not break out for individual businesses that the transactional versus subscription. There are transactional elements for the development opportunities that we have within life. As I indicated earlier in response to Manav's question, that's a business that continues to contribute and add to our growth rate, generally falling into that higher - the double-digit rate that we have for many of our higher-growth businesses.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Steinerman: Sure. Hi. It's Andrew. Could you quantify if you're willing to how Verisk's auto insurance revenue growth did in the second quarter? And specifically, when thinking about data providers into that end market, does Verisk believe that's gaining, losing or maintaining share currently for auto insurance?\nElizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks, Andrew. Our auto insurance related - the shopping-related revenue did continue to grow in this quarter. But the year-over-year comp, it means that it's growing off a much higher level. So there's deceleration there. From a market share standpoint, we believe we're generally steady in the market.\nAndrew Steinerman: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Gregory Peters from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nGregory Peters: Good morning, everyone. I'm going to pivot back to your comments, Lee, about strengthening relationships among your customer set. I have no doubt that your focus has really helped with your larger accounts. Maybe you could spend a minute and provide us an update on how you're progressing with your smaller accounts and also speak to potential disintermediation risk that might exist inside the smaller customer set?\nLee Shavel: Great. Thank you very much for the question. And I appreciate we have a broad range of clients. Naturally, our largest clients receive a lot of focus because their sophistication, their specific needs. But to your point, we want to make certain that we are delivering value for the entire insurance ecosystem. One thing that I would say kind of specific to the small and the midsized clients is that proportionately, they receive a greater value from the scale that we are able to deliver to them, both from an operational standpoint and from the value of data that we provide to them because often they have a lower share of access to overall loss costs or general information. I think they benefit more from the scale competitiveness that we provide them in a variety of claim solutions. And we have not seen any evidence of higher levels of attrition or disintermediation of that range of clients within our business. And that is something that we've watched and we've asked the question around. I think one - or two points that I would make supplementally is that a lot of our clients, while they are interested in new ideas, the risk of taking on a new, small, private technology vendor is something that they think about very carefully because they have to know that some - a firm that they can rely on over the long term. This is clearly an advantage for us because of our stability, our reliability. And to that end, we have also been working, as we've talked about, kind of most significantly in the claims area of finding ways to deliver some of those new technology providers by integrating them into our systems and platforms so that our clients can receive the benefit of that, but also in - with greater confidence that we have vetted and are supporting and integrating those products into our overall systems. So I really appreciate the perspective. It's not something that we have observed in terms of the behavior of our clients. Obviously, I think a much bigger impact is occasionally, our clients decide to leave a line of business or leave a state. That will have more influence, and we haven't seen any pattern of clients in the smaller, the midsized that have been leaving to another technology provider.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS Financial. Please go ahead.\nAlex Kramm: Yes. Hello, everyone. Apologies in advance to harp on the whole subs versus transaction one more time, but clearly, it matters to people and also for the quarter in particular. So maybe you can just help us talk about the impact of the transition in this specific quarter. I know, Lee, you gave the two-year stack. And if you're not willing to be so specific for this year, I look at what you said 8% over two years, I think the average of the reported numbers were 8.7. So is it fair that maybe that added 70 bps this quarter and maybe the core growth was more in mid-7s? Any help would be helpful since people are clearly asking.\nLee Shavel: Yes. And Alex, I am - we're trying to relate the 8.7 that you have and the 8% was looking at our total revenue, not a subscription versus transaction. So just kind of taking into account the - or trying to eliminate the impact of that that migration between subs and trans, I wanted to point out our overall revenue growth over that two-year period at 8% was still at the high end of that range. The thing that I would say further is that there was a specific significant contract that has a function of the renewal of that contract. And some of the regulatory aspects of how that needed to be approved had to be characterized as transactional in the prior year and was a subscription is now on the subscription side. So that is an element. We're not going to quantify that within it. But I would characterize that as a kind of a specific situation that added to the weakness in the subscription growth. And beyond that, we have other - I'm sorry, the weakness in the transactional growth there. So this was last year revenue from a contractual standpoint was transactional. And now that, that contract has been confirmed and executed is now subscription. So that is an element. In addition to what I think, you can look at those historical transactional growth rates in the second quarter of 2023 and see a normalization more to that longer-term growth rate. So those are the elements. We don't think it makes sense to break all of those pieces apart. But hopefully, it's clear enough that that you had some seasonal highs or cyclical highs in prior year quarter plus some structural elements that were contributing to an exceptional tough comparison on the transactional revenue growth.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird. Please go ahead.\nJeff Meuler: Yes. Thank you. Good morning. My question is on underwriting, or I guess, Slide 8. I'm having trouble connecting the descriptors under business highlights with the line chart showing deceleration. I guess it sounds like core growth is good. Life and SBS remain accretive. And two of the three bullets that you're talking about for transactional headwinds fall into claims. And I think marketing has been weak for a while. So what are the primary factors driving the OCC deceleration in underwriting just beyond the slowdown in auto rate shopping? Thank you.\nElizabeth Mann: Yes. Jeff thanks for the question. To map it in underwriting solutions, that first descriptor, you've got the underwriting data analytics solutions. That is where the auto insurance shopping activity sits. So that's an element.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Kelsey Zhu from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nKelsey Zhu: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So there's been a lot of discussion around where we are in the cycle for the insurance industry and whether we'll see pricing kind of peaking in 2025. Since 20% to 25% of Verisk revenue comes from contracts that have premium growth as a direct input in price increases but also with a two-year lag, does this basically insulates there into 2027 if 2025 was kind of the pricing peak for insurance companies. Or how should we think about the cyclical dynamics here?\nElizabeth Mann: Yes. Kelsey, thanks for the question, and welcome to the call. On the question of the insurance cycle, look, we've talked over time about being in a hard market broadly in the property and casualty industry. That's hitting different segments, certainly at different times. But we know it's not going to last forever. So it's a when, not an if that hard market begins to peak and becomes more competitive. I think one of the strengths of Verisk, you have seen us continue to grow historically through both hard markets and softer markets in the insurance cycle. I would not go so far as to say we are insulated. I think the pressure remains on us to continue to deliver value to our clients through all the innovations and product strength that we've talked about on the call. So I think if we continue do that, we will continue to deliver value to our customers and continue to grow revenue throughout the cycle.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJeff Silber: Thanks so much. My question is about your outlook. I know you don't give quarterly guidance, but you had some pretty good quarters in the first half of this year from a bottom line perspective. By maintaining your guidance, it implies a pretty slow down in adjusted EPS growth in the back half of the year. I know you called out accelerated hiring. Is there anything going on maybe from a timing perspective, but if you can provide a little bit more insight that would be appreciated. Thanks.\nElizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks for the question, Jeff. A couple of things. We have historically talked about some of the seasonality in our margin. Any quarter's margin can vary based on revenue mix as well as just the timing of spending. And we've signaled - we\u2019ve commented that we intend to invest in the business. So that our margin guidance gives you and our EBITDA guidance gives you a good feeling of where we expect to end up on an EBITDA basis. If you look at the EPS rate, in addition, there's the tax rate where we've had certain benefits in the first half of the year that we don't expect to continue in the second half of the year.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nHeather Balsky: Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to piggyback on Kelsey's question earlier on pricing and just ask, your net written premiums as we go into next year, I guess, the 2023 net written premiums were quite strong. It sounds like you're seeing very good value realization in terms of pricing from what you're doing in Core Lines. As we think about your 3% to 4% pricing target that you said at your Investor Day, do you think you're positioned to be at the higher end of that or even above based on what you're seeing? And how should we think about pricing in the near term? Thank you.\nLee Shavel: Yes. Thank you, Heather. I appreciate the question. One, I'm not going to go beyond the guidance the guidance questions or the guidance statement that we've made, just remaining confident in that we've provided. I do want to try address the pricing aspect a little further. And as I mentioned in my earlier comments, the fundamental dynamic almost regardless of the premium growth, which does, I think, influence it, in some cases, directly to a modest impact but also from a psychological standpoint, it's helpful. But even with those two, if we aren't providing value to our clients and they don't perceive that value then that's where we are going to run into challenges in improving pricing and driving the revenue. That's why the value of the investments that we have made in our Core Lines business and with our reimagine initiative, while one example of how we are driving value is what's critical - is the most critical factor in what sustains our revenue growth. And that's where we continue to get very strong feedback for how we are helping our clients improve the value of what they're doing. And I'd like to ask Saurabh Khemka, who leads that business and initiative to share a little bit about what we are hearing from clients and how they perceive the value of the investments that we have made. And hopefully, that will provide more context for how we've been able to overachieve on those - on that renewal pricing.\nSaurabh Khemka: Absolutely. Thanks, Lee. Yes, if you look on the Core Lines Reimagine side, our engagement with our customers has really demonstrated the value of our content, and the upcoming innovations that we have is delivering additional value for them. So for example, the feedback has been very encouraging across the spectrum of our customers, large and small. They are seeing additional value in the new insights like the Experience Index, the executive insights as well as the new technology innovations that we have on delivery of our content, which is creating efficiencies for them. And so what we are hearing from our customers is these new insights is helping them be better in terms of reacting to market conditions, and these new efficiency tools are helping them to be more efficient in their operations. So it's been very good. I would also say that we've been flexible in terms of how we deliver our content. So some of our smaller customers like the packaged insights and the turnkey solutions. And our larger customers prefer some of the access to underlying components to our analytics so that they can create more differentiation. And so by being flexible, we're benefiting all our customers.\nLee Shavel: And Heather, to give you two specific examples, one product innovation has been the update to our Mozart product, which allows our clients to manage their policy forms much more efficiently because they have thousands of forms based upon product line and state and different product areas. It is a very time-consuming, laborious process to keep those updated, particularly if the reference are ISO policy forms. And so the investment that we've made is effectively in a document management platform that allows them to do that much more easily and more quickly. That's one dimension where they clearly see significant value increase. Another as we've talked about is on the Experience Index. This is where they have asked us to move further beyond those traditional loss costs that we provide to them in the underwriting process and give them a more current read on what's happening, what we see evolving. And so we are able to provide them more actionable information on a more timely basis. That provides value to them on the underwriting side, just to kind of tie that down to some specific products that we've been investing in.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Russell Quelch from Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead.\nRussell Quelch: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. You made a point in the pre-remarks about putting out the fact that you're at the bottom end of the target leverage range. I'm keen to hear your thoughts on future capital deployment and potential use of that debt capacity. I'm wondering if you might look to inorganic growth again soon. We've, obviously, had a period where you haven't been that active, particularly if rates come down. And if you do, maybe could you talk to what areas you might target for inorganic growth, particularly wondering if there's more you could do, for example, in the life space, that would be great? Thanks.\nElizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks for the question, Russell. So yes, as we look at our target leverage range and where we are relative to the two to three times, we go back to our capital allocation philosophy. We are willing to deploy to support the business. We do remain active in M&A markets and looking at what is available. We tend to focus on businesses that are unique in their markets that serve our insurance end market, but for which Verisk has a unique reason to be the right owner of that business. And so those can be data opportunities that we can add to our existing services. They can be customer opportunities or geographic or market expansion.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Going back to transactional revenue performance, the 3% decline you saw in quarter, were there any unusual headwinds you would call out that may not persist? Just trying to understand the overall trend since if you look at the quarterly cadence, the swing from plus three in 1Q to down three in 2Q was quite significant and want to understand if that trajectory should be carried forward into future quarters or if the 2Q decline is a reasonable rate to persist into 3Q, which also represents a tough comp if you look at the year-ago period.\nElizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks for the question, George. So yes, we always highlight that our transactional revenue does have some variability to it. One important thing that I will point to, of course, from a growth perspective, we always look year-over-year, but it is interesting also to look on a sequential basis this quarter relative to the first quarter. Our total revenues grew relative to the first quarter. And in fact, our transactional revenues also grew relative to the first quarter. So it's just the year-over-year that has that pattern. Now there's some seasonality and things that hit the second quarter typically and that we're particularly strong in the second quarter of last year. And the ones that we called out were the weather impact, which was historically strong in the second quarter of last year, the auto shopping activity for which we've anniversaried that tough comp, and then the transition of transactional revenues to subscription.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS Financial. Please go ahead.\nAlex Kramm: Hi, thank you for the follow-up. Just quickly, and you mentioned, Lee, the Experience Index here just a couple of questions ago. But as an outsider to the industry, I can certainly see the applicability here pretty strongly. So I know it's early days, and it's good to see this finally being launched. But can you just maybe talk about the reception you've seen with that? Because again, it seems like a lot of customers should kind of move to a more real-time index. And if so, is this definitely a new revenue opportunity? Or do you think it's going to get kind of included in upgrades? Thank you.\nLee Shavel: Alex, thanks for the follow-up. I'm going to actually ask Saurabh talk about that - addressing your question.\nSaurabh Khemka: Yes, absolutely, Alex. So the feedback has been very positive. First of all, as you noted, getting more frequent data and more current data is always helpful to our customers. And this is a tool that helps them very easily benchmark their experience versus the industry. And it becomes an additional input into their own internal decision-making and priorities. So what we're hearing from customers is this is a very good innovation. We've launched it for the homeowners' line of business. And the most frequent comment I hear is, when are you going to launch the other lines of business? So, we're excited about it, and we're going to continue launching other lines of business. And as we get feedback from customers, adding more elements to the Experience Index.\nLee Shavel: And I think regardless of whether it's priced separately or it's part of the broader element, this is an example of where we expect to capture value from that greater - the greater currency, I mean, kind of recency of that data. I want to take that, Alex, just given the question and kind of broaden it. We recently did a Voice of the Customer exercise and isolated 3 primary asks that we have had from our clients. The first of which the Experience Index addresses is that they wanted more - they wanted to see greater investment in data, both broadening the data set that we have and the currency of the data sets that we have. So this is an opportunity to improve the currency and the actionability of that data set. Now the other thing that's important is that the client is also asking for more data, which means that there's an implicit desire on their part to give us more data so that we can expand and develop it. So that in and of itself creates more value for us. And we've seen a variety of initiatives and appetite from the clients in the excess and surplus area, which for insurance industry analysts will recognize has been a growing area of the - of industry underwriting. The second theme that we heard was more insights. And we talked about the emerging issues, providing greater insights from the data on what trends are that are taking place. And so that has been a key enhancement. And then the final theme that we heard from clients is connecting the ecosystem. They want us to be that that central provider building network aspect so as to improve the efficiency that the overall system and their ease of operating within that. So all of these elements I share because their reflection is not entirely of us saying, this is what the industry needs, but what we are hearing from clients that they expect from us given our role, given our centrality and the data sets that we have.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our Q&A session and today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Lee Shavel",
            "content": "Thanks, Stacey. Good morning, and thank you for participating in this morning's call. As we mark the halfway point in 2024, I can confidently say that we are on track to deliver against the strategic, operational and financial goals that we articulated at Investor Day and in our 2024 full year guidance. Elizabeth will provide the detailed financials, but at a high level, Verisk delivered solid organic constant currency revenue growth led most importantly by strong subscription growth of 8.3% that was broad-based across most of our businesses. This was partly offset in the quarter by modest declines in our transactional business, related to historically high volumes in auto shopping and elevated weather-related activity in the prior year quarter, which made for tough comparisons to normalized activity this quarter. We also experienced a drag on our transactional growth from the conversion of transaction-based contracts to subscriptions, which enhances the consistency of our growth going forward. To put this quarter in perspective and minimize the transaction to subscription conversion impact on a two-year compound annual growth rate basis, our total organic constant currency revenue growth has been 8%, at the high-end of our Investor Day revenue growth targets. We are driving subscription growth through strong renewals and improved price realization as our customers recognize the innovation and value-added upgrades we have incorporated into existing solutions. This is something that we've heard repeatedly in our renewal discussions with our largest clients. Our focus on cost discipline and operating efficiency resulted in healthy organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth and strong margin expansion, translating into 15% adjusted EPS growth. We delivered these results while continuing to invest in innovation and technologies that can help our clients improve speed, efficiency and accuracy through deeper insights, improved data and increased automation. Our strategy is unchanged as we focus on building long-term value for the insurance ecosystem while delivering consistent and predictable growth with high returns on capital for shareholders. The industry backdrop in which we are currently operating is one marked by continued strong premium growth as rate increases continue to earn in. In fact, in the first quarter of 2024, industry-wide direct premium growth increased 10%, and Swiss Re's forecast is for 8% growth for the full year. Profitability across the sector has improved, and industry-wide combined ratios have come down, though there is variability by line and geography. Carriers continue to be cautious in an uncertain environment and focused on driving profitability. Specific to the homeowners line of insurance, 2023 was the worst year on record for catastrophic losses with $15.2 billion in losses, and direct combined ratios in 17 states were above the breakeven threshold of 100. This has driven carriers to restrict underwriting in certain markets and in some cases, exit challenging states and lines of business. We are working with our clients and innovating new solutions that target these problem areas, including introducing new roof analytics that leverage aerial imagery and engaging with the respective departments of insurance in Western states to share the updates we have made to our wildfire solutions. In the near term, these market conditions may present some headwinds for our predominantly subscription property business, but in the longer term, we continue to believe it highlights the need for the most accurate information to best price the risk. Technological and regulatory change also continue to challenge the industry structurally. And we continue to partner with clients to help them address the rapid pace of technological change as well as increased regulatory scrutiny on data privacy, fairness, generative AI and climate risk. As another example of our work to support understanding of broad industry challenges, we recently co-authored a paper along with research organization RAND Corporation analyzing the impact of social inflation in insurance casualty claims payments with a focus on better understanding the trends, impact and potential structural factors in growing jury verdicts and trial awards. At the center of our growth strategy is our effort to engage with our clients on a more strategic level. As an example of what I've been hearing recently from clients, I've had conversations with both client CEOs and CIOs about the importance to them of integrating data sets across their enterprise for efficiency and consistency. We are the natural trusted technology partner to help with this data asset convergence as we are best positioned, given our deep data and domain expertise, our position in the industry and our proven track record of aggregating and integrating industry data at scale. These C-suite level and strategic conversations are opening up broader and enterprise-wide opportunities and applications of our data and analytics with the industry and new avenues for growth for Verisk. For example, in casualty, an area of focus for carriers due to the rising claim severity, our Liability Navigator is an analytic solution that objectively assesses bodily injury claims to help carriers improve settlement consistency across claim teams. By integrating our proprietary medical provider fraud data and our Discovery Navigator medical record review technology, we transformed previously unstructured and disparate medical data into actionable insights at the point of decision, thus improving efficiency and accuracy in bodily injury claims outcomes. Also key to our growth strategy is building upon our 50-plus year history in insurance and our competitive advantages and positioning to serve as a network for the insurance industry. To that end, in our specialty business solutions, we are delivering solid double-digit growth as we build out an interconnected ecosystem built upon the white space platform for participants in the London market, including brokers, underwriters and managing general agents. We are continuing to win new clients, adding 15 new clients in the quarter, and placement volumes are growing rapidly as the scale of the platform builds. This network effect is also active across our claims platforms as we continue to add new partners to our claims solutions ecosystem. The ClaimSearch partnership enables insurance technology providers to integrate with the ClaimSearch platform, allowing insurers to select the technology that best fits their individual business needs. Earlier this year, we announced two new collaborations with FRISS and Globlue Technologies, who are integrating with our ClaimSearch platform. This integration will facilitate advanced fraud analysis and detection, including more complex scoring and triaging to improve decision-making. Additionally, it should minimize the manual fraud detection process, saving valuable time and reducing operational costs for our clients. Finally, we continue to focus on innovation as a key pillar of our growth strategy. To that end, earlier this month, we officially launched ISO Experience Index, a new benchmarking tool which is part of our Core Lines Reimagine initiative. The ISO Experience Index is designed to modernize how actuaries in the insurance industry analyze risk patterns by addressing the increasing volatility and scale of loss patterns in the industry and offering a responsive and up-to-date indicator of observed underwriting experience. Experience Index empowers our clients to be more responsive to changing conditions across various geographic markets by offering quarterly releases with more frequent updates compared to traditional loss cost reviews. This enables our customers to make more informed decisions in real time. Experience Index is available for the homeowners line and will be expanded over time to other lines of insurance. Our customers are realizing the value we are delivering through Core Lines Reimagine, and we are benefiting from this investment through better price realization and improved client dialogues. In a recent conversation with the CEO of a national carrier, he expressed appreciation for our quarterly Emerging Issues updates. These reports are just one example of listening to our customers' requests to not only provide data but also deliver more valuable and actionable insights. And with that, let me turn it over to Elizabeth for the detailed financial review. Thanks, Elizabeth. In summary, our execution priorities are unchanged as we remain focused on delivering consistent and predictable growth while allocating capital to our highest return on investment opportunities. Our focus on heightened strategic engagement with clients, both large and small, has strengthened relationships and has fostered new product and business opportunities for the industry where we can invest at scale to drive value for our clients, employees and shareholders. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions. Good morning. Thank you, Manav, for the question. Yes. I appreciate the focus on the 8% two-year stack growth rate because I think it does give broader context beyond what we experienced in this quarter. And to answer your question, the drivers of that have been, generally speaking, more demand for our products from the industry as they are facing a variety of challenges in - on the underwriting side, on the claims side, the value of what we have been providing to them. But also, and I think this is the element that is the sustainable aspect of it is the success that we've had in increasing our value capture from the investments that we have made across the business. And this is something I referenced in the earlier comments. We are hearing it repeatedly from clients that they recognize the innovations, the investments that we have made, and that's enabling us in this environment to capture more of that value. And we believe that, that is a longer-term trend that will enable us to continue to meet that growth, supplemented by new products and new innovations that we are adding. We continued to see strong growth in our specialty business solutions area, where we've been innovating with our white space platform, which has those very strong network effects. We have continued to see growth in our international businesses, which is a penetration opportunity for us and growth in our life insurance business. So as we said at Investor Day, we have core strength where we are adding value and capturing that value in pricing. And that's supplemented by new penetration opportunities that we believe will sustain that growth over time. And then I'd finally add that the elevated strategic dialogue that we have accomplished with our clients is opening up new opportunities to provide our products on a broader enterprise and global basis to our clients. Recent - last week, I had two CEO-level calls, visits, where we spoke about how we can help improve the consistency of the data and the analytics that they are using across their organizations for some portions that aren't utilizing our data or our analytics. And I think that is a structural and relationship benefit that we've been able to achieve, and we'll see continued support on the growth - in our growth from those aspects. On the trends sub transition, it's happening in a variety of ways. Some of it is structural. Some of it is episodic. I think that it will be a diminishing impact over time. We had some stronger elements that that contributed to dynamic in this quarter and made for some of the more pronounced differentiation between subscription growth and transaction growth. Thank you, Surinder. So I think the thing that I would emphasize is that when you look at the second quarter of 2023 and you see the 12.4% growth, this is in the investor presentation on - in - that we had provided on the website. What we're experiencing was a very high level of shopping activity in auto as a function of rising rates within that business. You can look at the commentary of that. It was kind of truly exceptional - an exceptional level of shopping activity that was driving that transaction element. In addition, as you will see in the description around claims business, we were experiencing still a high level of weather-related claims activity that was also driving that business. And so that's really what is contributing to what we're - we are experiencing a relatively tough comparison enhanced by some of the transaction to subscription migrations that are more pronounced in this quarter. As we think about that element on an ongoing basis, I think we generally expect that our transactional growth rates are ones that are generally at our broader growth rates to slightly higher because in many cases, they represent some of our higher-growth businesses that tend to have more of a transactional aspect at the early stage. So with that, I'll ask Elizabeth to add some perspective. Yes. Thank you for the question, Ashish. We do not break out for individual businesses that the transactional versus subscription. There are transactional elements for the development opportunities that we have within life. As I indicated earlier in response to Manav's question, that's a business that continues to contribute and add to our growth rate, generally falling into that higher - the double-digit rate that we have for many of our higher-growth businesses. Great. Thank you very much for the question. And I appreciate we have a broad range of clients. Naturally, our largest clients receive a lot of focus because their sophistication, their specific needs. But to your point, we want to make certain that we are delivering value for the entire insurance ecosystem. One thing that I would say kind of specific to the small and the midsized clients is that proportionately, they receive a greater value from the scale that we are able to deliver to them, both from an operational standpoint and from the value of data that we provide to them because often they have a lower share of access to overall loss costs or general information. I think they benefit more from the scale competitiveness that we provide them in a variety of claim solutions. And we have not seen any evidence of higher levels of attrition or disintermediation of that range of clients within our business. And that is something that we've watched and we've asked the question around. I think one - or two points that I would make supplementally is that a lot of our clients, while they are interested in new ideas, the risk of taking on a new, small, private technology vendor is something that they think about very carefully because they have to know that some - a firm that they can rely on over the long term. This is clearly an advantage for us because of our stability, our reliability. And to that end, we have also been working, as we've talked about, kind of most significantly in the claims area of finding ways to deliver some of those new technology providers by integrating them into our systems and platforms so that our clients can receive the benefit of that, but also in - with greater confidence that we have vetted and are supporting and integrating those products into our overall systems. So I really appreciate the perspective. It's not something that we have observed in terms of the behavior of our clients. Obviously, I think a much bigger impact is occasionally, our clients decide to leave a line of business or leave a state. That will have more influence, and we haven't seen any pattern of clients in the smaller, the midsized that have been leaving to another technology provider. Yes. And Alex, I am - we're trying to relate the 8.7 that you have and the 8% was looking at our total revenue, not a subscription versus transaction. So just kind of taking into account the - or trying to eliminate the impact of that that migration between subs and trans, I wanted to point out our overall revenue growth over that two-year period at 8% was still at the high end of that range. The thing that I would say further is that there was a specific significant contract that has a function of the renewal of that contract. And some of the regulatory aspects of how that needed to be approved had to be characterized as transactional in the prior year and was a subscription is now on the subscription side. So that is an element. We're not going to quantify that within it. But I would characterize that as a kind of a specific situation that added to the weakness in the subscription growth. And beyond that, we have other - I'm sorry, the weakness in the transactional growth there. So this was last year revenue from a contractual standpoint was transactional. And now that, that contract has been confirmed and executed is now subscription. So that is an element. In addition to what I think, you can look at those historical transactional growth rates in the second quarter of 2023 and see a normalization more to that longer-term growth rate. So those are the elements. We don't think it makes sense to break all of those pieces apart. But hopefully, it's clear enough that that you had some seasonal highs or cyclical highs in prior year quarter plus some structural elements that were contributing to an exceptional tough comparison on the transactional revenue growth. Yes. Thank you, Heather. I appreciate the question. One, I'm not going to go beyond the guidance the guidance questions or the guidance statement that we've made, just remaining confident in that we've provided. I do want to try address the pricing aspect a little further. And as I mentioned in my earlier comments, the fundamental dynamic almost regardless of the premium growth, which does, I think, influence it, in some cases, directly to a modest impact but also from a psychological standpoint, it's helpful. But even with those two, if we aren't providing value to our clients and they don't perceive that value then that's where we are going to run into challenges in improving pricing and driving the revenue. That's why the value of the investments that we have made in our Core Lines business and with our reimagine initiative, while one example of how we are driving value is what's critical - is the most critical factor in what sustains our revenue growth. And that's where we continue to get very strong feedback for how we are helping our clients improve the value of what they're doing. And I'd like to ask Saurabh Khemka, who leads that business and initiative to share a little bit about what we are hearing from clients and how they perceive the value of the investments that we have made. And hopefully, that will provide more context for how we've been able to overachieve on those - on that renewal pricing. And Heather, to give you two specific examples, one product innovation has been the update to our Mozart product, which allows our clients to manage their policy forms much more efficiently because they have thousands of forms based upon product line and state and different product areas. It is a very time-consuming, laborious process to keep those updated, particularly if the reference are ISO policy forms. And so the investment that we've made is effectively in a document management platform that allows them to do that much more easily and more quickly. That's one dimension where they clearly see significant value increase. Another as we've talked about is on the Experience Index. This is where they have asked us to move further beyond those traditional loss costs that we provide to them in the underwriting process and give them a more current read on what's happening, what we see evolving. And so we are able to provide them more actionable information on a more timely basis. That provides value to them on the underwriting side, just to kind of tie that down to some specific products that we've been investing in. Alex, thanks for the follow-up. I'm going to actually ask Saurabh talk about that - addressing your question. And I think regardless of whether it's priced separately or it's part of the broader element, this is an example of where we expect to capture value from that greater - the greater currency, I mean, kind of recency of that data. I want to take that, Alex, just given the question and kind of broaden it. We recently did a Voice of the Customer exercise and isolated 3 primary asks that we have had from our clients. The first of which the Experience Index addresses is that they wanted more - they wanted to see greater investment in data, both broadening the data set that we have and the currency of the data sets that we have. So this is an opportunity to improve the currency and the actionability of that data set. Now the other thing that's important is that the client is also asking for more data, which means that there's an implicit desire on their part to give us more data so that we can expand and develop it. So that in and of itself creates more value for us. And we've seen a variety of initiatives and appetite from the clients in the excess and surplus area, which for insurance industry analysts will recognize has been a growing area of the - of industry underwriting. The second theme that we heard was more insights. And we talked about the emerging issues, providing greater insights from the data on what trends are that are taking place. And so that has been a key enhancement. And then the final theme that we heard from clients is connecting the ecosystem. They want us to be that that central provider building network aspect so as to improve the efficiency that the overall system and their ease of operating within that. So all of these elements I share because their reflection is not entirely of us saying, this is what the industry needs, but what we are hearing from clients that they expect from us given our role, given our centrality and the data sets that we have."

            "name": "Elizabeth Mann",
            "content": "Thanks, Lee, and good day to everyone on the call. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, second quarter revenue was $717 million, up 6.2% versus the prior year, reflecting consistent levels of growth across both underwriting and claims. Income from continuing operations was $308 million, up 51% versus the prior year, while diluted GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.15, up 53% versus the prior year. The GAAP figures include a cumulative $102 million net gain associated with retained interest in previously disposed businesses as well as a gain associated with the bond tender transaction we entered in June. The underlying EPS growth reflects strong revenue and profit growth combined with a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count. Moving to our organic constant currency results for the second quarter. Adjusted for non-operating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, our operating results demonstrated consistent growth across both underwriting and claims. OCC revenues grew 6% with growth of 6% in underwriting and 5.8% in claims. This was a slowdown in growth as expected from the first quarter as we overlap the tough comparison to our largest ever transactional revenue dollar quarter in the second quarter of 2023. Our subscription revenues, which comprised 81% of our total revenue in the quarter, grew 8.3% on an OCC basis during the second quarter. We experienced broad-based growth across most of our subscription-based solutions with strong renewals and expanded relationships with existing customers and solid sales of new solutions. Our subscription growth also reflects the benefit of conversion to subscription from previously transactional contracts. In some cases, temporary assignments or pilots are converting into longer-term contracts. In other cases, customers are looking to move away from pricing mechanisms tied to volume and instead opting for fixed pricing to give more visibility in their own cost structures. We are experiencing this trend across underwriting data solutions, anti-fraud solutions, specialty and property estimating solutions. And we expect the impact of these conversions to continue for the remainder of the year. The largest contributor to subscription growth continues to be forms rules and loss costs, where we are benefiting from improved price realization in our renewals as we continue to modernize our platform and deliver more value and insights to our clients through features like Experience Index that Lee spoke about earlier. In anti-fraud, we experienced underlying strong price realization in the business with growth augmented by strong sales of new solutions, including Claims Coverage Identifier and Claims Scoring, our new real-time monitoring tool that uses both rules-based and predictive models to identify and triage suspected fraudulent claims. And within Extreme Event Solutions, we delivered another quarter of high single-digit subscription growth driven by strong multiyear renewals with existing clients as well as the addition of new logos to Verisk. Our transactional revenues, representing 19% of total revenue in the second quarter, declined 3% on an OCC basis, reflecting a tough comparison versus the prior year, a drag on growth from conversion to subscription and the impact of more year-over-year weather-related claims activity. This was offset in part by strong growth contribution from our life insurance business and securitization within our Extreme Events business. Specific to the tough comparisons, last year, transactional revenues increased 12.4% and included benefits from elevated levels of auto shopping activity as well as the large non-rate action deal we had called out. Our revenue associated with auto shopping did continue to grow in this year's second quarter, but not at the level of the trailing 12 months. We expect those tough comparisons in auto to continue for the balance of the year. And with regard to the weather-related claims activity, while frequency of events was up in the second quarter, the severity events and associated claims volume from those events was down year-over-year from record levels in 2023. It is this volume metric that impacts our transactional revenues within property estimating solutions. All that said, we continue to experience a longer-term secular trend of growing weather-related claims across the property sector. And in fact, while 2024 claims volumes are down in the second quarter year-over-year, they are still continuing an upward trend as they are running approximately 20% above the trailing 5-year average. Moving now to our adjusted EBITDA results. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 8.5% in the quarter. While total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results, was 55.4%, up 130 basis points from the reported results in the in the prior year. As we've said the past, margin rate in any given quarter can be influenced by revenue mix and timing of spending. So we think it's useful to look at our margin on a trailing 12-month basis, which, as of June 30, 2024, was 54.3%, up 120 basis points over last year's level. This level of margin expansion reflects the positive impact of sales leverage, cost discipline and our global talent optimization efforts. Our margins also reflect a lower level of headcount growth in the quarter we expect to accelerate hiring in the back half of year to support our growth investments. For the full year 2024, we continue to expect our margins to be in the 54% to 55% range. We remain confident in our ability to meet our margin expansion targets while strategically investing in future growth opportunities. Continuing down the income statement, net interest expense was $29 million for second quarter compared to $32 million in the prior year, reflecting higher interest income on cash balances. During the second quarter, we issued $600 million of senior notes due 2034 and successfully tendered for $400 million of our notes due in 2025. The net effect of these two financing transactions is that the ongoing run rate for net interest expense will be higher in the second half of the year than it was in the first half. That said, we are comfortable with our current leverage, which at 2x is at the low end of our targeted range of 2x to 3x EBITDA. On taxes, our reported effective tax rate was 21.7% compared to 23.8% in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year decrease in the tax rate is primarily due to the timing of certain discrete items that we do not expect to repeat. We believe that our tax rate for the full year 2024 will be at the low end of the 23% to 25% range. There could some quarterly variability related to employee stock option exercise equity. Adjusted net income increased 13% to $249 million, and diluted adjusted EPS increased 15% to $1.74 for the quarter. The increase is primarily driven by solid revenue growth, strong margin expansion, a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count. This was partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense. From a cash flow perspective, on a reported basis, net cash from operating activities increased 10% to $212 million while free cash flow increased 14% to $154 million. This is the first quarter that our cash flow metrics demonstrate the results of our insurance-only business and are reflective of the operating cash flow of the new Verisk. From an M&A perspective, we did not acquire or dispose of any businesses in the quarter. But we did receive $112 million in cash proceeds related to the prior sales of our health care business in 2016 and our specialized markets business in 2022. In both of those cases, we maintained a small structured equity position, which was monetized in this quarter. As of June 30, we had $632 million in cash on our balance sheet, which gives us the financial flexibility to continue self-fund the investment back into the business. We are also committed to returning capital shareholders. During the second quarter, we initiated a $150 million accelerated share repurchase program, which was completed in July. As of June 30, we had $1.3 billion in capacity remaining under our share repurchase authorization. We are pleased with our results for the second quarter and the first half of the year. Our outlook for 2024 remains unchanged. More specifically, we continue to expect consolidated revenue for 2024 to be in the range of $2.84 billion to $2.9 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.54 billion to $1.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin in the 54% to 55% range. Below the line, we expect fixed asset depreciation to be at the high end of the range as we continue to put new projects into service and the tax rate to be at the low end of the range, given certain onetime discrete items for the first half of the year. Combined with the slightly higher net interest expense due to our refinancing, the net result is that we still expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.30 to $6.60. A complete listing all guidance measures can be found in the earnings slide deck, which has been posted to the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. And now I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments. Yes. Thanks, Lee, for characterizing the factors that impact our transaction growth, and you can see the historical trends of it in that earnings presentation that he referenced. I think for mechanical reasons - well, first of all, it is variable over time. It's inherently harder to predict. We don't try predict the weather. But that inherent variability for some of the mechanical factors, for example, the conversion of transactional to subscription, that can have a one year - that effect can persist for a full year after a subscription locks in. So I just want to - we do expect tough comparisons for the balance of the year on that transactional revenue side. Yes. Thanks for the question, Toni. You're right that we have previously talked about this in the context of our Claims Essential bundle, where there was a targeted effort for a certain customer segment. I would say as you hear us talk now more broadly across the business, we are seeing it in a number of different businesses where customers are on a pilot and choose to lock that in for a longer-term subscription or they have a subscription with overage tiers. And as their business grows, they lock into a higher subscription so that they have more visibility into their own price point. So those are trends that we will continue to see across the business. Over time, you've still seen that subscription-transactional mix of our revenues be fairly steady at 80-20-ish. And probably as some of our transactional customers convert into subscription, at the same time, we will have new and introductory products or new markets that we're entering where it's more common to enter it in a transactional basis. So we will continue to top up, I think, that transactional revenue base as well. Yes. Thanks, Andrew. Our auto insurance related - the shopping-related revenue did continue to grow in this quarter. But the year-over-year comp, it means that it's growing off a much higher level. So there's deceleration there. From a market share standpoint, we believe we're generally steady in the market. Yes. Jeff thanks for the question. To map it in underwriting solutions, that first descriptor, you've got the underwriting data analytics solutions. That is where the auto insurance shopping activity sits. So that's an element. Yes. Kelsey, thanks for the question, and welcome to the call. On the question of the insurance cycle, look, we've talked over time about being in a hard market broadly in the property and casualty industry. That's hitting different segments, certainly at different times. But we know it's not going to last forever. So it's a when, not an if that hard market begins to peak and becomes more competitive. I think one of the strengths of Verisk, you have seen us continue to grow historically through both hard markets and softer markets in the insurance cycle. I would not go so far as to say we are insulated. I think the pressure remains on us to continue to deliver value to our clients through all the innovations and product strength that we've talked about on the call. So I think if we continue do that, we will continue to deliver value to our customers and continue to grow revenue throughout the cycle. Yes. Thanks for the question, Jeff. A couple of things. We have historically talked about some of the seasonality in our margin. Any quarter's margin can vary based on revenue mix as well as just the timing of spending. And we've signaled - we've commented that we intend to invest in the business. So that our margin guidance gives you and our EBITDA guidance gives you a good feeling of where we expect to end up on an EBITDA basis. If you look at the EPS rate, in addition, there's the tax rate where we've had certain benefits in the first half of the year that we don't expect to continue in the second half of the year. Yes. Thanks for the question, Russell. So yes, as we look at our target leverage range and where we are relative to the two to three times, we go back to our capital allocation philosophy. We are willing to deploy to support the business. We do remain active in M&A markets and looking at what is available. We tend to focus on businesses that are unique in their markets that serve our insurance end market, but for which Verisk has a unique reason to be the right owner of that business. And so those can be data opportunities that we can add to our existing services. They can be customer opportunities or geographic or market expansion. Yes. Thanks for the question, George. So yes, we always highlight that our transactional revenue does have some variability to it. One important thing that I will point to, of course, from a growth perspective, we always look year-over-year, but it is interesting also to look on a sequential basis this quarter relative to the first quarter. Our total revenues grew relative to the first quarter. And in fact, our transactional revenues also grew relative to the first quarter. So it's just the year-over-year that has that pattern. Now there's some seasonality and things that hit the second quarter typically and that we're particularly strong in the second quarter of last year. And the ones that we called out were the weather impact, which was historically strong in the second quarter of last year, the auto shopping activity for which we've anniversaried that tough comp, and then the transition of transactional revenues to subscription."

            "content": "Absolutely. Thanks, Lee. Yes, if you look on the Core Lines Reimagine side, our engagement with our customers has really demonstrated the value of our content, and the upcoming innovations that we have is delivering additional value for them. So for example, the feedback has been very encouraging across the spectrum of our customers, large and small. They are seeing additional value in the new insights like the Experience Index, the executive insights as well as the new technology innovations that we have on delivery of our content, which is creating efficiencies for them. And so what we are hearing from our customers is these new insights is helping them be better in terms of reacting to market conditions, and these new efficiency tools are helping them to be more efficient in their operations. So it's been very good. I would also say that we've been flexible in terms of how we deliver our content. So some of our smaller customers like the packaged insights and the turnkey solutions. And our larger customers prefer some of the access to underlying components to our analytics so that they can create more differentiation. And so by being flexible, we're benefiting all our customers. Yes, absolutely, Alex. So the feedback has been very positive. First of all, as you noted, getting more frequent data and more current data is always helpful to our customers. And this is a tool that helps them very easily benchmark their experience versus the industry. And it becomes an additional input into their own internal decision-making and priorities. So what we're hearing from customers is this is a very good innovation. We've launched it for the homeowners' line of business. And the most frequent comment I hear is, when are you going to launch the other lines of business? So, we're excited about it, and we're going to continue launching other lines of business. And as we get feedback from customers, adding more elements to the Experience Index."

[Operator Instructions] \n For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead. \nStacey Brodbar: Thank you, operator, and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our first quarter 2024 financial results. On the call today are Lee Shavel, Verisk President and Chief Executive Officer; and Elizabeth Mann, Chief Financial Officer. \n The earnings release referenced on this call as well as our traditional quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. \n As set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone, today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance, including those related to our financial guidance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings.  \n A reconciliation of reported and historic non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call is provided in our 8-K and today's earnings presentation posted on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. However, we are not able to provide a reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable expected GAAP result because of the unreasonable effort and high unpredictability of estimating certain items that are excluded from projected non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin including, for example, tax consequences, acquisition-related costs, gain/loss from dispositions and other nonrecurring expenses, the effect of which may be significant.  \n And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Lee Shavel. \nLee Shavel: Thanks, Stacey. Good morning, and thank you for participating in this morning's call. \n 2024 is off to a solid start at Verisk as we are building upon the strong performance we delivered in 2023. Elizabeth will provide the detailed financials, but I am pleased to share that we delivered 6.9% organic constant currency revenue growth with strong underlying subscription growth of 7.8% that was broad-based across most of our businesses. \n Our focus on cost discipline and operating efficiency produced strong double-digit organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth and healthy margin expansion, translating into 26% adjusted EPS growth. \n This quarter's performance was in line with our 2024 guidance. We are driving predictable and consistent growth by harnessing the power of our more integrated insurance-focused company and executing against our strategy to partner with the insurance ecosystem to help all participants address their most pressing challenges.  \n Our execution priorities are unchanged from those that we communicated to you a year ago at Investor Day. We are building on the progress that we made in 2023 as we continue to focus on three key things: one, delivering consistent and predictable revenue growth; two, driving operating efficiency and profitability; and three, allocating our strong free cash flow with discipline and a focus on return on investment.  \n I've spoken on this call many times about our efforts to engage with our clients on a more strategic level. To that end, in April, we hosted the Verisk Insurance Conference, or VIC as it is affectionately known in the industry, which attracted a record number of attendees from across the global insurance ecosystem, including representatives from the carriers, reinsurers, regulators and our channel partners. \n VIC is our flagship event where we strategically engage with all our ecosystem clients and partners through joint discussions and presentations as an integrated One Verisk.\n This year's event featured over 70 different educational sessions and panel discussions on some of the industry's top-of-mind issues, including fairness, generative AI, fraud, climate risk, rate adequacy and social inflation. \n One of the best attended sessions was a panel discussion about Florida property insurance and featured representatives from key market players, including the carriers, regulators, legislators and Verisk. The discussion focused on lessons learned from the insurance crisis in this important and high-risk market and what other states can learn from this experience.  \n The event also featured a solutions gallery that showcased many of our offerings, covering risk, natural perils, commercial property, home and auto as well as several of our key technology ecosystem partners. The event has generated strong collaboration ideas with our clients and partners as well as leads for our sales teams. \n It also builds upon the goal that we set last year to elevate the strategic dialogue with our clients and continue our path to serve as a data and technology partner to the global insurance ecosystem.  \n During the Verisk Insurance Conference, our Extreme Events division unveiled its latest innovation, Next Generation Models or NGM, for insurers, brokers and reinsurers. Verisk is the first firm to release its full suite of over 100 models across all perils and geographies to a next-generation financial modeling framework. And these models are all now accessible via our Touchstone platform.  \n As the rising cost of catastrophes and an increase in losses from frequency-driven perils such as severe convective storms has challenged the industry, Next Generation Models provide a better quantification of uncertainty and enhanced capabilities to assess insured losses across the insurance industry more accurately.  \n With next-generation models, our clients can make better financial assessments of loss potential and more accurately represent the risk to their policyholders, their businesses and their partners. NGM also offers new advantages to support complex insurance policy structures and deal with new terms and conditions that previously went unmodeled. Clients can effectively manage risk, both at the portfolio and individual levels using the NGM suite of models.  \n NGM represents the next step in our journey towards a fully SaaS native platform, underscoring our commitment to continuous investment in advanced data and technologies and capabilities on behalf of the industry.  \n Next, I'd like to provide you with an update on our Core Lines Reimagine program. As previously mentioned, we are on a journey to digitize and enhance our essential suite of industry standard solutions to make our forms, rules and loss cost content easier to access, use and customize and provide much needed updates and insights. We have made good progress in modernizing our internal systems and processes for digital-first content creation, enabling us to deliver new client-facing modules.  \n We recently introduced Filing Intelligence, which is accessible on our new platform. This tool simplifies our filings delivery process by consolidating all necessary documents, forms, rules and loss costs into one accessible interface, eliminating the need for manual review and piecing together multiple documents. Filing Intelligence digitally connects all documents related to each filing, streamlining the process for users and ensuring seamless access to essential information.  \n On the actuarial front, we recently added Actuarial Hub to the new platform. Within the hub, clients can access new insights such as the ISO Experience Index, the loss cost activity dashboard and a new series of actuarial prospective articles. These resources offer deeper insights into our filings and data, empowering our clients to make quicker, well-informed decisions.  \n Looking ahead, we plan to launch additional customer-facing modules that will provide even more value to our clients by introducing new proprietary analytics, workflow tools and insights to further streamline processes and enhance underwriting accuracy for our clients.  \n Overall, we're excited about the progress of the Reimagine program. This initiative is already driving returns for Verisk as we are receiving positive client feedback and experiencing better price realization in contract renewals.  \n Lastly, today is an important day as May 1 is officially Verisk Generative AI day. Our technology teams from across our global offices and business units are gathered at our Jersey City headquarters to collaborate and share best practices and learnings on their work with GenAI for both customer-facing initiatives and internal efficiencies. \n More specifically, all of our divisions have active GenAI pilots running with many other areas in active development. And within our claims business, we have three solutions in production and available today for clients.  \n Generative AI continues to be top of mind for our clients and is a topic of much discussion in my conversations with industry executives. One very promising application that I'm seeing is the use of generative AI to gather and predigest massive amounts of information to organize and distill it for the insurance professional, improving and focusing their expertise, not replacing it. \n This is a natural fit and opportunity for the work we do in curating and managing the needs of the global insurance industry to facilitate more effective and efficient workflows. As we have done with other forms of advanced technology, GenAI is an area where we can invest for the benefit of the industry at a lower cost of investment in ownership than any single client can do on their own.  \n With that, I will turn it over to Elizabeth to cover the detailed financial review. \nElizabeth Mann: Thanks, Lee, and good day to everyone on the call. \n I am pleased to share that Verisk delivered a solid first quarter of 2024. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, first quarter revenue was $704 million, up 8% versus the prior year, reflecting solid growth in underwriting and more modest growth in claims. \n Income from continuing operations was $219 million, up 12.9% versus the prior year, while diluted GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.52, up 19.7% versus the prior year. This level of EPS growth reflects strong revenue and profit growth, combined with a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count due to the large accelerated share repurchase program in 2023. \n Moving to our organic constant currency results for the first quarter. Adjusted for nonoperating items, as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, our operating results demonstrated solid growth for most of our businesses. OCC revenues grew 6.9% with growth of 7.8% in underwriting and 4.7% in claims. This was an acceleration from the fourth quarter in both subsegments and was in line with our expectations and 2024 financial guidance.\n Our subscription revenues, which comprised 80% of our total revenue in the quarter, grew 7.8% on an OCC basis during the first quarter. We experienced broad-based growth across most of our subscription-based solutions, with strong renewals and expanded relationships with existing customers and solid sales of new solutions. \n The largest contributor to subscription growth was forms, rules and loss costs. We are benefiting from a stronger renewal cycle and improved price realization as we continue to modernize our platform and deliver more value and insights to our clients through our Core Lines Reimagine program that Lee spoke about earlier.  \n In anti-fraud, we experienced underlying strength in the business with growth augmented by the continued benefit from the conversion to subscription from previously transactional customers that we mentioned throughout 2023. Most of our clients have successfully completed this transition. Therefore, the benefit will continue to taper throughout 2024.  \n And within underwriting data solutions, we are seeing a positive client response to our enhanced commercial lines property solutions, which have benefited from our expanded coverage as our database of commercial property records has grown by over 200% since 2020 and now has over 15.9 million records.  \n Our transactional revenues, representing 20% of total revenue in the first quarter, increased 3.1% on an OCC basis, reflecting a tough comparison versus the prior year which benefited from the strong auto shopping activity and nonreaction activity. During the quarter, we saw continued growth across our auto suite of solutions, though growth rates have moderated as we expected.  \n Regarding auto, due to recent changes in our data source, we have decided to discontinue our existing telematics offering. The impact of this is immaterial in 2024 with less than $1 million of revenue impact. We do not expect this to have any impact on the remainder of our auto solutions.  \n Our transactional revenue growth also benefited from double-digit growth within life insurance solutions as we saw strong customer demand for incremental services.  \n And within our extreme events business, we saw better-than-expected transactional growth driven by securitization. This was offset in part by lower weather-related transaction volumes in property estimating solutions and the impact of the conversion to subscription within our anti-fraud business.  \n Moving now to our adjusted EBITDA results. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 10.6% in the quarter, while total adjusted EBIT margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results, was 54%, up 180 basis points from the reported results in the prior year. \n As we've said in the past, the margin rate in any given quarter can be influenced by revenue mix and timing of spending, so we think it's useful to look at our margin on a trailing 12-month basis which, as of March 31, 2024, was 53.9%, up 120 basis points over last year's level. This level of margin expansion reflects the positive impact of sales leverage and cost discipline.  \n We also experienced a modest margin benefit from nonoperating items, including foreign currency changes, but this was largely offset by margin impact from recent acquisitions. Our current margin rate also reflects continued organic investment for future growth, including our Reimagine program, the replatforming of key solutions in extreme events and property estimating solutions, our new financial and human capital systems as well as exploration of advanced technologies like GenAI. We remain confident in our ability to meet our margin expansion targets, while strategically investing in future growth opportunities.  \n Continuing down the income statement. Net interest expense was $29 million for the first quarter compared to $26 million in the prior year. The current level of net interest expense reflects interest income on lower cash balances than 1 year previously. \n Our reported effective tax rate was 20.3% compared to 27.1% in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year decrease in the tax rate is primarily due to tax charges incurred in structuring the sale of our energy business last year as well as certain discrete items that we do not expect to repeat in the remaining quarters of the year.  \n We continue to believe that our tax rate for the full year 2024 will be in the 23% to 25% range, so there could be some quarterly variability related to employee stock option exercise activity.  \n Adjusted net income increased 19% to $234 million, and diluted adjusted EPS increased 26% to $1.63 for the quarter. The increase is primarily driven by solid revenue growth, strong margin expansion, a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count. \n Our lower average share count reflects the impact of the large accelerated share repurchase program we completed in 2023 using the proceeds from the divestitures. This was partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization and higher net interest expense.  \n From a cash flow perspective, on a reported basis, net cash from operating activities increased 1.9% to $372 million, while free cash flow increased 4.2% to $317 million. Both cash flow metrics reflect the impact of our indemnification obligation related to our former financial services business, which we accrued for in 2023. \n It is also important to note that the prior year cash flow figures still include the results of our previously divested energy business. So these growth figures understate the cash flow growth of our insurance-only business.  \n We are committed to returning capital to shareholders. During the first quarter, we initiated a $200 million accelerated share repurchase program, which was completed in April. Our $0.39 per share dividend was up 15% from the prior year. We continue to have $1.4 billion in capacity remaining under our repurchase authorization.  \n We are pleased with our results for the first quarter and reiterate our outlook for 2024. More specifically, we continue to expect consolidated revenue for 2024 to be in the range of $2.84 billion to $2.9 billion. \n We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.54 billion to $1.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin in the 54% to 55% range. We expect our tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25% and adjusted earnings in the range of $6.30 to $6.60 per share. \n A complete listing of all guidance measures can be found in the earnings slide deck, which has been posted to the Investors section of our website, verisk.com.  \n And now, I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments. \nLee Shavel: Thanks, Elizabeth. \n In summary, our execution priorities remain consistent with those communicated at Investor Day, continued focus on revenue growth, operating efficiency and disciplined cash flow allocation. Following a strong 2023, we are pleased to see 2024 off to a strong start with implied growth of 7% in consolidated revenue and 9.5% in adjusted EBITDA, at the midpoint of our 2024 financial guidance.  \n Our focus on heightened strategic engagement with clients has strengthened relationships and fostered new product and business opportunities for the industry where we can invest at scale to drive value for our clients, employees and shareholders. \n We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. \n With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. \nAndrew Steinerman: How would you assess the health of your clients, meaning the P&C insurance industry now versus 3 or really kind of 6 months ago and how might that impact Verisk this year? \nLee Shavel: Thank you, Andrew. I've assessed the strength of our client as being very solid. And I would say in contrast to, I think, where we were 2 or 3 years ago, you are clearly seeing -- across the industry, and if you follow the quarterly releases of the property and casualty insurers, you are seeing very strong premium growth, which is a reflection of that hard market and the improving profitability as reflected in stronger combined ratios for the business.  \n And so I think the combination of that growth, the improved profitability, some reserve strengthening now beginning to offset some of the heightened cat losses that they've experienced has generally put them in a position where they are feeling positive about the outlook, the -- their ability to achieve better pricing and price adequacy from their standpoint on rate.  \n There clearly are risks that they continue to face in terms of heightened catastrophic losses or cyber exposure or exposure to increasing casualty losses. But generally, their financial position is stronger and that has, one, both a benefit for us because we do participate to some extent in their overall premium growth, but also, I think, importantly, is that, that financial strength is making them more constructive and engaged in where they can be making investments to improve their business, whether it's on the underwriting side or it's on the efficiency and processing front. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. \nJeffrey Meuler: Yes. So Lee, that all sounds like the industry is going to start to lean in more on marketing, and it seems like we've seen some signs that marketing spend is positively inflecting following a challenging period. \n But you continue to call out headwinds in your marketing solution revenue. So maybe talk through that and if it's just a lag effect and a pipe is building. \nLee Shavel: Yes. Thank you, Jeff. I think that's an accurate observation. I think we are beginning to see some early signs that marketing is picking up. Within the industry, there is a lag impact. And so we will continue to look forward to hopefully seeing some of that translate into our business. That is a small business, so it may not be discernible overall within our business. But we do think that's a positive trend.  \n I would also note that within that business, it is not entirely insurance for us that we're providing insights to some other legacy industries. And so that may cause a differentiated output. But I think your general observation is true. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. \nAshish Sabadra: I wanted to focus on the solid sales of new solution. The question there was, Lee, thanks for providing some good details on the GenAI, but I was wondering if you could provide an example of new solutions that are gaining traction.  \n And then at the Investor Day, the new initiative was expected to generate 150 to 200 basis points of incremental revenue growth going into 2025. And I was just wondering if you could comment on how that's tracking. \nLee Shavel: Thank you, Ashish. Let me take the first question since you're kind of referencing Investor Day, and I'll let Elizabeth add to this if she feels necessary. But what we outlined at Investor Day was incorporated into our guidance in terms of where we felt we could achieve incremental revenue growth. \n Naturally, we saw the performance in 2023, which was a representative of the -- of achieving those higher growth rates. We're really pleased in the first quarter to be able to similarly deliver strong growth on top of that. And so we have kind of a compounding effect. And I think that reflects in large part, the achievement of some of that revenue growth upside. So I would look to the fact that we are meeting and exceeding the guidance that we set at Investor Day. \nElizabeth Mann: Yes, I agree with Lee there. And I think in terms of examples of new products gaining traction, you've heard us talk about them on some of the recent calls, the Discovery Navigator product in claims, which is one that does -- now uses GenAI as well. We've talked about image forensics in the antifraud space and -- as well as a variety of innovations that we talked about in this call on our core products, including Core Lines Reimagine and the Next Generation Models in extreme events. \nLee Shavel: Yes. And if I -- thanks, Elizabeth, for kicking off the first part of the question. We talked with Jeff's question on some of the headwinds we're facing on marketing, but I would also say, in terms of new product adoption in our life insurance offering, we are seeing very strong uptake in that category with the applicability of the low no-code solutions to the life business within our specialty business solutions area where we have seen very strong adoption on some -- from some major industry players onto the white space platform, which is a new product that we are growing.  \n And so in -- as well as internationally, as we have been bringing our products into that market, we're seeing the uptake and very strong double-digit growth across those businesses internationally. \n And then finally, I would say, I think in terms of new product growth, we should never overlook the benefit or the uptake and receptivity that we are seeing to our existing product investments as with Core Lines Reimagine and other areas that we have been investing in similar to LightSpeed where we have improved those products, we have increased the value to the customer, we're integrating generative AI into a number of those products.  \n And in a way, that is new product adoption in terms of being able to realize incremental value in our revenues for those products. And I think that is reflected in our overall revenue growth as well here. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. \nThomas Roesch: This is Tom Roesch on for Andrew. I wanted to ask about the pricing environment. It sounds like insurers are starting off the year on good footing. So I was wondering just kind of how the pricing environment, how you think about it this year relative to last year? And then also as it relates to those contracts that are tied to prior year net premium, just kind of how you think about those, too, this year. \nLee Shavel: Sure. \nElizabeth Mann: Thanks, Tom, for the question. Yes, it's good context. You heard Lee talk about the industry and the relative strength in the industry as well as the hard market that we are in. So as he highlighted for our contracts that have a tie to net written premium growth, we're seeing generally positive tailwinds in line -- I would say, in line overall with last year. \n I think what's most important for us from a pricing standpoint is the increased engagement that we are having with our clients, and you're seeing the benefit of the investments that we're putting in our products and those are driving for us strong renewals, strong outcomes on the pricing conversations. \nLee Shavel: Yes. And Tom, I'd say that on that, we are -- we see a receptive environment because I think the industry is doing well. We're seeing recognition of the value of the products. But I would also mention that I think with some of our efforts to improve our go-to-market strategy, we're seeing a more effective sales organization that is contributing to good outcomes on the pricing side as well. \n So I think we feel very positive about some of the changes that we put in place in 2024 as a function of a close examination of what we could be doing better there. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. \nToni Kaplan: During the prepared remarks, you mentioned you're discontinuing the auto telematic offering. I was wondering, clearly, it's not generating much revenue for you, but was -- what was -- what prompted deciding to discontinue it? Was the data not valuable? Was it costly to maintain? Just any color there. \nLee Shavel: Certainly. Thank you, Toni. And the short answer is, and first, it was a small financial impact for us. The simple answer is that the entities that were providing that data to us decided to discontinue collecting that data. And so there was really not sufficient analytical value in that without the data that was being provided. And I think it's fair to assume that it's a function of some of the media attention to collect connected car data. So that really was the simple reason. \n It had been an area where we felt it was worth investing. We do believe in looking at broad data sets that are useful in evaluating driver risk. But I would emphasize that while we have discontinued that operation, and it was immaterial from a financial standpoint, we do continue to serve auto insurers in a significant way with a wide variety of products, including our LightSpeed auto, our coverage verifier, damage assessment from a claims perspective. \n So this is a very substantial business for us, and the discontinuation of the Verisk Data Exchange will not have any impact in our legacy auto businesses. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. \nFaiza Alwy: I wanted to talk about subscription growth. You mentioned the stronger renewal cycle and the price realization, but I'm curious if you held this level of subscription growth is normal for this year. And help us better understand some of the factors that can impact us. \n I asked because there has been some quarterly variation here last year, so if there's anything that you would highlight as we look ahead. \nElizabeth Mann: Yes. Faiza, thanks for the question. In terms of quarterly variations, there can always be minor puts and takes as things move from quarter-to-quarter, but nothing that we see at this point that would indicate significant quarterly changes.\n The drivers of strength for us this quarter have been really broad-based across the business. Forms, rules and loss cost has been the largest driver as the largest business, and we talked about some of the trends benefiting it there. \n We've had strong strength in the antifraud business. I would call that both absolute strength as well as benefiting from the conversion from transaction to subscription. And the extreme events business actually had strong subscription growth as well given the demonstrated value there. \nLee Shavel: Yes. And Faiza, maybe to add a little additional color, and we use this as an opportunity to say we talked about the environment. We've talked about the benefit of engaging as partners with our leading clients, which I think has helped us on that front, probably most primarily at a senior level to help our clients understand the value that we are providing to them across the enterprise. \n But something -- to your question of kind of sustainability and growth, we clearly want to grow the subscription revenues at a higher rate where possible. And coming out of a lot of intense engagement at a senior level in 2023, we have had three clients in different areas, one is an international insurer, one is a large U.S. insurer, one is outside of the insurer, but in a variety of areas, that have come to us with ideas of products that we might jointly develop or distribute with them. And I think it's a reflection of how we can potentially develop new incremental revenue sources. \n This was certainly part of our plan originally, but we've been delighted to see that, that engagement has enabled real commercial opportunities that we are in the process of exploring and structuring at this stage. That is certainly a primary path for us to find ways to continue to sustain and grow that subscription growth. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. \nJeffrey Silber: I know you talked in the past about three, I guess, buckets of investment. You talked about the Core Lines Reimagine, investing in your sales force and investing in AI. Can we just get a refresh in terms of how much you're thinking of spending in those areas and where we are in that process? \nElizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks for the question, Jeff. We don't break out sort of specific areas of investment by element. I think on the last quarter call, I mentioned those as some of the top areas for investment this year. And I think our investment in those areas is pretty much in line with our expectation for the year and embedded in the margin that you're seeing and the guidance for the full year. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Peters with Raymond James. \nCharles Peters: So I'm going to focus on the transactional revenue piece because if I look at the quarterly numbers last year, you had some pretty strong results for second and third quarter. \n Given the conversion of the antifraud business, is it your expectation that the transactional piece of OCC will be having some headwinds for the next couple of quarters? Or any sort of visibility there would be helpful. \nElizabeth Mann: Yes. Happy to cover that, Greg. Thanks. You are right that we do see headwinds on the transactional revenue side largely because the comps from last year have been so strong. You saw double-digit transactional growth for about a 1-year period last year. \n I think some of the main areas of tough comps have been and will be on the auto transactional shopping activity, which was a real area of strength last year, in addition to the nonrate action activity. And we -- that really picked up in the first quarter of last year. \n So we're starting to anniversary it now. The shopping activity did actually continue strong in the first quarter. But starting next quarter, we really anniversary strong growth there. \n The other area where it could be tough comps has been on the weather activity. We called out through 2023 the elevated weather patterns that we were seeing. And so that could be a headwind this year. \n Securitization activity was very strong last year in extreme events. So that's one that we are also waiting to see. So between those different areas, that's something we're looking at. \n I think this quarter is a demonstration of the power of the business model and the bulk of our revenue coming in that subscription revenue, which continues to show very healthy signs of strength -- shows the strength that we can deliver, even compounding those tough comps. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. \nManav Patnaik: I guess, I'll just ask on capital allocation. It sounds like you guys are starting on the ASR, so that seems to be the priority. But maybe what is the small- to medium-sized kind of M&A pipeline looks like, some of the stuff that you've been doing over the last couple of years? \nLee Shavel: Thank you, Manav. I think I heard that. I think the focus is on capital allocation and how does the outlook for small- and medium-sized M&A opportunities. I would describe them as they are out there, that I think that valuations remain really high for those entities. \n Our focus is always on how can we add value with our distribution, our data, our relationships. That has been a good equation for us. And valuations kind of continue to make that challenging for us to generate attractive returns. \n But we are very engaged in that market and always looking for products that have achieved traction with the industry where we think we can accelerate the adoption and deliver value, both to our clients and to our shareholders. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies. \nSurinder Thind: Just a question around the internal investments. So when we think about the Core Lines Reimagine or replatforming or AI, how should we think about the absolute level of investment from the perspective of how much of this is part of a normal spend cycle? And then maybe how much is maybe a little bit elevated and perhaps how we might expect CapEx to evolve, so far, whether it's this year or the next couple of years? \nElizabeth Mann: Thanks -- yes. Thanks, Surinder. I can't break it out numerically. I would say that there are -- we've talked about the various projects that we are investing in now. Those are finite projects, which we will finish, and we've talked about the time lines for each. \n There are some elements of those projects that is fixing or reinvesting in technology that has maybe been overdue. And so I would talk about our internal ERP systems as an area of that. Some of the places where we are doing tech replatforming would be those areas. And so those -- that level of investment may be elevated, and we may not need to continue going forward. \n I would say there will -- we will always be investing in our products to maintain sort of their cutting-edge status. So after we finish Core Lines Reimagine, we will continue to invest and evolve in new projects that we may not know exactly what they are today. \nLee Shavel: And I think what I would add to that, Surinder, is, I think, the short answer is that the ability for us to integrate generative AI technology as an expansion of a new form of artificial intelligence within the existing products is something that our businesses are effectively absorbing into their current financial models and thinking about where they're deploying capital within their own businesses. \n There have been, and there may be in the future, areas where we have decided that -- or we have determined that there is a really interesting application in a new product upside that we want to invest heavily in or we want to accelerate, and that will be an opportunity for us to provide a focused amount of capital or investment. \n At this stage, I think there were a couple of opportunities that we evaluated, and we determined kind of just maintaining our natural organic level of investment is the right path at this point. That may change in the future. \n But I think Elizabeth's comments, I would just reinforce by saying, right now, we're finding a way to integrate this investment into the businesses and also recognizing that we are making a heightened investment on an ERP upgrade that we think will drive operating efficiencies and informational advantages for us over time. \n And that will be one that, as we're going to finish that level of investment, may free up space, if there are good opportunities for us to invest. Otherwise, we'll return that capital as we always do with our discipline. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Russell Quelch with Redburn. \nRussell Quelch: You mentioned in the opening remarks, Lee, that you'd rolled out the next-generation nat peril model. I wondered if you could articulate what the additional upside opportunity for Verisk is there given you're already seeing strong subscription revenue growth in the extreme events business.\n And I just wanted to check as well. You mentioned on pricing that you had been able to realize more pricing on renewals due to the product upgrades. Is that already -- is that as expected and therefore already factored into your guidance for '24? Or does it present a potential upside opportunity on the guidance? \nLee Shavel: Yes. Thank you, Russell. So first on the Next Generation Models, I think that this is a major upgrade in terms of the sophistication of the models, allowing our clients to better estimate and quantify the uncertainty of their losses across the industry. \n And given -- you think about the Next Generation Models,  it is taking a variety of the environmental, physical weather risk related and then translating into what are the real costs associated with damage, restructuring and the rest. And so we can take this and apply it to all of our perils and all of our geographies. \n So it is a major enhancement to our portfolio of products, and it's also increased the sophistication of the ability to support complex insurance policy structures and deal with the new terms and conditions that weren't previously effectively captured the model. \n It also is an important step for us to the SaaS model. Getting the next-generation financial model in place was critical, and what we heard from our clients is what they wanted to be addressed first. And now we can improve the functionality and the efficiency of that. \n So we do think that this is a substantial opportunity for us to deliver more value to our risk modeling clients. And certainly, our expectations are reflected within our guidance in that regard. But it does, I think, open us up to continue to expand what we do for clients on that front. \n With regard to your question on is the pricing upside, that is reflected within our guidance. We're pleased with the progress that we're making in the reaction to -- from our clients to the investments that we've made in a variety of our products. And that's reflected in the guidance that we have put forward. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. \nAlex Kramm: Just maybe quickly on the international side. I think 23% growth year-over-year. I know that's not organic, but still pretty impressive. Can you just maybe give us an update where you're seeing the most growth in those businesses? \n And then maybe related to that, as historically viewed, those businesses are a disparate collection of different businesses in different regions. So curious if there's any efforts to maybe bring those businesses closer together or if you're already seeing any synergies between those businesses or if it is still just a lot of different disparate things. \nLee Shavel: Thank you, Alex. It's a great question. So I think the first question relates to the overall growth. And I think when we look at the businesses on an organic basis, I think we are generally viewed, as we've spoken before, and we continue to believe that they have and will continue to drive double-digit growth within the -- within our business. And so I think that's kind of the baseline. We continue to see opportunity on that front.\n Your question on the coordination, I think, is an important one. And I would say that each of those businesses are serving distinct insurance industry constituencies. And the opportunity, I think, has been less to tie all of those products together from a single client perspective, but to partner more effectively with the U.S. team to mix and the international team to make certain that we are integrating our expertise, our data, some of the investments that we've made in the U.S. to enhance and strengthen those client -- or those product sets. \n And so I think we're seeing a heightened level of partnership in that regard, but not so much tying together, for instance, the claims and the underwriting businesses as well.  \n Another dimension, which I referenced earlier is that I think that we are seeing an opportunity to partner with institutions within Europe that see that value and through their existing distribution networks have an ability for us to deliver some of that value in partnership with other players within that market. \n And so that, I think, becomes an enhancement opportunity for those products as well as some of even our U.S.-based products and technology that can be applied there. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Heather Balsky with Bank of America. \nHeather Balsky: I was really curious about the catastrophe bond piece of your business. There's been some really strong data out there, and it seems like there's some outlook for continuation of that. What's driving that? And can you also remind us just how you benefit from strength in that market? \nElizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks, Heather. Yes, it is a strong market. I think it's -- what's driving it is both the need -- the increased catastrophe risk and the need for diversifying the set of investors in that space of risk. And for new investors, it's their own desire to diversify and find uncorrelated areas of investment. So that's been driving strength in that cat bond market. \n How we benefit from it is our extreme event business is one of the primary providers of models and assessment of that risk, so that the investors and the issuers of those cat bonds can agree to transact on the pricing by assessing the risk. \nLee Shavel: And Heather, the -- what we are seeing that is driving that is both demand from investors for noncorrelated returns and interest, particularly in this hard market from an insurance standpoint, what are perceived to be more attractive returns. We're also seeing that in terms of more capital being attracted into excess and surplus lines and reinsurance generally. \n And it speaks to, I think, the ongoing development and the increasing sophistication of the portfolio -- active portfolio management of the insurance industry that is an opportunity for us given our modeling capabilities, given the loss costs and the rate modeling activities that we have. And that has been something that we have been engaged in thinking about at an enterprise level in terms of how we can support the development of that market. \n One example would be there is a category of insurers that are ILS managers, insurance-linked securities managers. And those have been modeling clients of ours and also represent opportunities for us to build broader relationships and how our suite of products can serve their needs as they manage external sources of capital. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. \nKeen Fai Tong: In the early part of last year, subscription revenue growth was in the 9% range. And over the past 2 quarters, growth was in the 7% to 8% range. \n What's a reasonable and sustainable rate of growth for subscription revenue? And what are the top 1 or 2 factors that you believe will drive either acceleration or deceleration from current levels? \nElizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks, George. We don't forecast subscription growth for you. We do -- we obviously give our medium-term target range for total revenue growth. That's 6% to 8% organic constant currency, and subscription has historically been 80% of that. So that's kind of what we can say numerally. \n In terms of drivers for acceleration and deceleration, I think all of the things that we've been talking about are investment in our products, our customer engagement and our industry expertise drive strength in the subscription revenue, both from a renewal, from a new customer base and from a pricing perspective. \n Headwinds can come with -- we've talked about this before, with potential attrition or industry consolidation or [indiscernible]. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Peters with Raymond James. \nCharles Peters: Great. So Lee, in your comments, you talked about the hard market in non-life insurance. And one of the things that's becoming apparent is that the pricing trends are going to begin to moderate. \n So building on Elizabeth's last answer, how does a market that's more normal affect subscription and transactional revenue growth as we look ahead? \nLee Shavel: Thanks, Greg, and thanks for coming back for seconds. We appreciate it. So I think that we are seeing -- I would first challenge that we are seeing kind of continued pressures on the industry, both in terms of ongoing inflation as well as increased risk that they are experiencing, that seemingly is continuing to support premium growth as well as kind of natural expansion in coverage for the industry. \n So at this point, based upon the financial reports and our engagement with clients, we have not seen early signs of that market. In fact, a lot of the reading that I have seen has been to a sustained hard market. But we do have to anticipate at some point that there may be some pressure from a margin standpoint. \n And in that context, our products and services remain critical in achieving a higher level of operational efficiency within the business in order to maintain or improve that combined ratio as well as the efficiency of making good underwriting decisions. \n And I would use this as an opportunity to say I think one of the most promising dimensions of generative AI is in gathering and predigesting a lot of the information flow that the insurance industry relies upon to evaluate policy submissions, evaluating adequacy, going into the risk, not replacing the human, but enabling them to focus their expertise on the underwriting decision, the risk and the return decision. \n We think that, that is a secular trend. As technology improves, as datasets expand, that will continue to provide ample opportunity for us to deliver value to the industry. It's nice to have some premium growth because I think it puts people in a constructive frame of mind. But these issues and challenges that the industry face are going to exist, regardless of whether it's a hard market or a soft market. And I think that's our fundamental opportunity. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. Thank you for your participation. This concludes today's call.

            "name": "Lee Shavel",
            "content": "Thanks, Stacey. Good morning, and thank you for participating in this morning's call. \n 2024 is off to a solid start at Verisk as we are building upon the strong performance we delivered in 2023. Elizabeth will provide the detailed financials, but I am pleased to share that we delivered 6.9% organic constant currency revenue growth with strong underlying subscription growth of 7.8% that was broad-based across most of our businesses. \n Our focus on cost discipline and operating efficiency produced strong double-digit organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth and healthy margin expansion, translating into 26% adjusted EPS growth. \n This quarter's performance was in line with our 2024 guidance. We are driving predictable and consistent growth by harnessing the power of our more integrated insurance-focused company and executing against our strategy to partner with the insurance ecosystem to help all participants address their most pressing challenges.  \n Our execution priorities are unchanged from those that we communicated to you a year ago at Investor Day. We are building on the progress that we made in 2023 as we continue to focus on three key things: one, delivering consistent and predictable revenue growth; two, driving operating efficiency and profitability; and three, allocating our strong free cash flow with discipline and a focus on return on investment.  \n I've spoken on this call many times about our efforts to engage with our clients on a more strategic level. To that end, in April, we hosted the Verisk Insurance Conference, or VIC as it is affectionately known in the industry, which attracted a record number of attendees from across the global insurance ecosystem, including representatives from the carriers, reinsurers, regulators and our channel partners. \n VIC is our flagship event where we strategically engage with all our ecosystem clients and partners through joint discussions and presentations as an integrated One Verisk.\n This year's event featured over 70 different educational sessions and panel discussions on some of the industry's top-of-mind issues, including fairness, generative AI, fraud, climate risk, rate adequacy and social inflation. \n One of the best attended sessions was a panel discussion about Florida property insurance and featured representatives from key market players, including the carriers, regulators, legislators and Verisk. The discussion focused on lessons learned from the insurance crisis in this important and high-risk market and what other states can learn from this experience.  \n The event also featured a solutions gallery that showcased many of our offerings, covering risk, natural perils, commercial property, home and auto as well as several of our key technology ecosystem partners. The event has generated strong collaboration ideas with our clients and partners as well as leads for our sales teams. \n It also builds upon the goal that we set last year to elevate the strategic dialogue with our clients and continue our path to serve as a data and technology partner to the global insurance ecosystem.  \n During the Verisk Insurance Conference, our Extreme Events division unveiled its latest innovation, Next Generation Models or NGM, for insurers, brokers and reinsurers. Verisk is the first firm to release its full suite of over 100 models across all perils and geographies to a next-generation financial modeling framework. And these models are all now accessible via our Touchstone platform.  \n As the rising cost of catastrophes and an increase in losses from frequency-driven perils such as severe convective storms has challenged the industry, Next Generation Models provide a better quantification of uncertainty and enhanced capabilities to assess insured losses across the insurance industry more accurately.  \n With next-generation models, our clients can make better financial assessments of loss potential and more accurately represent the risk to their policyholders, their businesses and their partners. NGM also offers new advantages to support complex insurance policy structures and deal with new terms and conditions that previously went unmodeled. Clients can effectively manage risk, both at the portfolio and individual levels using the NGM suite of models.  \n NGM represents the next step in our journey towards a fully SaaS native platform, underscoring our commitment to continuous investment in advanced data and technologies and capabilities on behalf of the industry.  \n Next, I'd like to provide you with an update on our Core Lines Reimagine program. As previously mentioned, we are on a journey to digitize and enhance our essential suite of industry standard solutions to make our forms, rules and loss cost content easier to access, use and customize and provide much needed updates and insights. We have made good progress in modernizing our internal systems and processes for digital-first content creation, enabling us to deliver new client-facing modules.  \n We recently introduced Filing Intelligence, which is accessible on our new platform. This tool simplifies our filings delivery process by consolidating all necessary documents, forms, rules and loss costs into one accessible interface, eliminating the need for manual review and piecing together multiple documents. Filing Intelligence digitally connects all documents related to each filing, streamlining the process for users and ensuring seamless access to essential information.  \n On the actuarial front, we recently added Actuarial Hub to the new platform. Within the hub, clients can access new insights such as the ISO Experience Index, the loss cost activity dashboard and a new series of actuarial prospective articles. These resources offer deeper insights into our filings and data, empowering our clients to make quicker, well-informed decisions.  \n Looking ahead, we plan to launch additional customer-facing modules that will provide even more value to our clients by introducing new proprietary analytics, workflow tools and insights to further streamline processes and enhance underwriting accuracy for our clients.  \n Overall, we're excited about the progress of the Reimagine program. This initiative is already driving returns for Verisk as we are receiving positive client feedback and experiencing better price realization in contract renewals.  \n Lastly, today is an important day as May 1 is officially Verisk Generative AI day. Our technology teams from across our global offices and business units are gathered at our Jersey City headquarters to collaborate and share best practices and learnings on their work with GenAI for both customer-facing initiatives and internal efficiencies. \n More specifically, all of our divisions have active GenAI pilots running with many other areas in active development. And within our claims business, we have three solutions in production and available today for clients.  \n Generative AI continues to be top of mind for our clients and is a topic of much discussion in my conversations with industry executives. One very promising application that I'm seeing is the use of generative AI to gather and predigest massive amounts of information to organize and distill it for the insurance professional, improving and focusing their expertise, not replacing it. \n This is a natural fit and opportunity for the work we do in curating and managing the needs of the global insurance industry to facilitate more effective and efficient workflows. As we have done with other forms of advanced technology, GenAI is an area where we can invest for the benefit of the industry at a lower cost of investment in ownership than any single client can do on their own.  \n With that, I will turn it over to Elizabeth to cover the detailed financial review. Thanks, Elizabeth. \n In summary, our execution priorities remain consistent with those communicated at Investor Day, continued focus on revenue growth, operating efficiency and disciplined cash flow allocation. Following a strong 2023, we are pleased to see 2024 off to a strong start with implied growth of 7% in consolidated revenue and 9.5% in adjusted EBITDA, at the midpoint of our 2024 financial guidance.  \n Our focus on heightened strategic engagement with clients has strengthened relationships and fostered new product and business opportunities for the industry where we can invest at scale to drive value for our clients, employees and shareholders. \n We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. \n With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions. Thank you, Andrew. I've assessed the strength of our client as being very solid. And I would say in contrast to, I think, where we were 2 or 3 years ago, you are clearly seeing -- across the industry, and if you follow the quarterly releases of the property and casualty insurers, you are seeing very strong premium growth, which is a reflection of that hard market and the improving profitability as reflected in stronger combined ratios for the business.  \n And so I think the combination of that growth, the improved profitability, some reserve strengthening now beginning to offset some of the heightened cat losses that they've experienced has generally put them in a position where they are feeling positive about the outlook, the -- their ability to achieve better pricing and price adequacy from their standpoint on rate.  \n There clearly are risks that they continue to face in terms of heightened catastrophic losses or cyber exposure or exposure to increasing casualty losses. But generally, their financial position is stronger and that has, one, both a benefit for us because we do participate to some extent in their overall premium growth, but also, I think, importantly, is that, that financial strength is making them more constructive and engaged in where they can be making investments to improve their business, whether it's on the underwriting side or it's on the efficiency and processing front. Yes. Thank you, Jeff. I think that's an accurate observation. I think we are beginning to see some early signs that marketing is picking up. Within the industry, there is a lag impact. And so we will continue to look forward to hopefully seeing some of that translate into our business. That is a small business, so it may not be discernible overall within our business. But we do think that's a positive trend.  \n I would also note that within that business, it is not entirely insurance for us that we're providing insights to some other legacy industries. And so that may cause a differentiated output. But I think your general observation is true. Thank you, Ashish. Let me take the first question since you're kind of referencing Investor Day, and I'll let Elizabeth add to this if she feels necessary. But what we outlined at Investor Day was incorporated into our guidance in terms of where we felt we could achieve incremental revenue growth. \n Naturally, we saw the performance in 2023, which was a representative of the -- of achieving those higher growth rates. We're really pleased in the first quarter to be able to similarly deliver strong growth on top of that. And so we have kind of a compounding effect. And I think that reflects in large part, the achievement of some of that revenue growth upside. So I would look to the fact that we are meeting and exceeding the guidance that we set at Investor Day. Yes. And if I -- thanks, Elizabeth, for kicking off the first part of the question. We talked with Jeff's question on some of the headwinds we're facing on marketing, but I would also say, in terms of new product adoption in our life insurance offering, we are seeing very strong uptake in that category with the applicability of the low no-code solutions to the life business within our specialty business solutions area where we have seen very strong adoption on some -- from some major industry players onto the white space platform, which is a new product that we are growing.  \n And so in -- as well as internationally, as we have been bringing our products into that market, we're seeing the uptake and very strong double-digit growth across those businesses internationally. \n And then finally, I would say, I think in terms of new product growth, we should never overlook the benefit or the uptake and receptivity that we are seeing to our existing product investments as with Core Lines Reimagine and other areas that we have been investing in similar to LightSpeed where we have improved those products, we have increased the value to the customer, we're integrating generative AI into a number of those products.  \n And in a way, that is new product adoption in terms of being able to realize incremental value in our revenues for those products. And I think that is reflected in our overall revenue growth as well here. Sure. Yes. And Tom, I'd say that on that, we are -- we see a receptive environment because I think the industry is doing well. We're seeing recognition of the value of the products. But I would also mention that I think with some of our efforts to improve our go-to-market strategy, we're seeing a more effective sales organization that is contributing to good outcomes on the pricing side as well. \n So I think we feel very positive about some of the changes that we put in place in 2024 as a function of a close examination of what we could be doing better there. Certainly. Thank you, Toni. And the short answer is, and first, it was a small financial impact for us. The simple answer is that the entities that were providing that data to us decided to discontinue collecting that data. And so there was really not sufficient analytical value in that without the data that was being provided. And I think it's fair to assume that it's a function of some of the media attention to collect connected car data. So that really was the simple reason. \n It had been an area where we felt it was worth investing. We do believe in looking at broad data sets that are useful in evaluating driver risk. But I would emphasize that while we have discontinued that operation, and it was immaterial from a financial standpoint, we do continue to serve auto insurers in a significant way with a wide variety of products, including our LightSpeed auto, our coverage verifier, damage assessment from a claims perspective. \n So this is a very substantial business for us, and the discontinuation of the Verisk Data Exchange will not have any impact in our legacy auto businesses. Yes. And Faiza, maybe to add a little additional color, and we use this as an opportunity to say we talked about the environment. We've talked about the benefit of engaging as partners with our leading clients, which I think has helped us on that front, probably most primarily at a senior level to help our clients understand the value that we are providing to them across the enterprise. \n But something -- to your question of kind of sustainability and growth, we clearly want to grow the subscription revenues at a higher rate where possible. And coming out of a lot of intense engagement at a senior level in 2023, we have had three clients in different areas, one is an international insurer, one is a large U.S. insurer, one is outside of the insurer, but in a variety of areas, that have come to us with ideas of products that we might jointly develop or distribute with them. And I think it's a reflection of how we can potentially develop new incremental revenue sources. \n This was certainly part of our plan originally, but we've been delighted to see that, that engagement has enabled real commercial opportunities that we are in the process of exploring and structuring at this stage. That is certainly a primary path for us to find ways to continue to sustain and grow that subscription growth. Thank you, Manav. I think I heard that. I think the focus is on capital allocation and how does the outlook for small- and medium-sized M&A opportunities. I would describe them as they are out there, that I think that valuations remain really high for those entities. \n Our focus is always on how can we add value with our distribution, our data, our relationships. That has been a good equation for us. And valuations kind of continue to make that challenging for us to generate attractive returns. \n But we are very engaged in that market and always looking for products that have achieved traction with the industry where we think we can accelerate the adoption and deliver value, both to our clients and to our shareholders. And I think what I would add to that, Surinder, is, I think, the short answer is that the ability for us to integrate generative AI technology as an expansion of a new form of artificial intelligence within the existing products is something that our businesses are effectively absorbing into their current financial models and thinking about where they're deploying capital within their own businesses. \n There have been, and there may be in the future, areas where we have decided that -- or we have determined that there is a really interesting application in a new product upside that we want to invest heavily in or we want to accelerate, and that will be an opportunity for us to provide a focused amount of capital or investment. \n At this stage, I think there were a couple of opportunities that we evaluated, and we determined kind of just maintaining our natural organic level of investment is the right path at this point. That may change in the future. \n But I think Elizabeth's comments, I would just reinforce by saying, right now, we're finding a way to integrate this investment into the businesses and also recognizing that we are making a heightened investment on an ERP upgrade that we think will drive operating efficiencies and informational advantages for us over time. \n And that will be one that, as we're going to finish that level of investment, may free up space, if there are good opportunities for us to invest. Otherwise, we'll return that capital as we always do with our discipline. Yes. Thank you, Russell. So first on the Next Generation Models, I think that this is a major upgrade in terms of the sophistication of the models, allowing our clients to better estimate and quantify the uncertainty of their losses across the industry. \n And given -- you think about the Next Generation Models,  it is taking a variety of the environmental, physical weather risk related and then translating into what are the real costs associated with damage, restructuring and the rest. And so we can take this and apply it to all of our perils and all of our geographies. \n So it is a major enhancement to our portfolio of products, and it's also increased the sophistication of the ability to support complex insurance policy structures and deal with the new terms and conditions that weren't previously effectively captured the model. \n It also is an important step for us to the SaaS model. Getting the next-generation financial model in place was critical, and what we heard from our clients is what they wanted to be addressed first. And now we can improve the functionality and the efficiency of that. \n So we do think that this is a substantial opportunity for us to deliver more value to our risk modeling clients. And certainly, our expectations are reflected within our guidance in that regard. But it does, I think, open us up to continue to expand what we do for clients on that front. \n With regard to your question on is the pricing upside, that is reflected within our guidance. We're pleased with the progress that we're making in the reaction to -- from our clients to the investments that we've made in a variety of our products. And that's reflected in the guidance that we have put forward. Thank you, Alex. It's a great question. So I think the first question relates to the overall growth. And I think when we look at the businesses on an organic basis, I think we are generally viewed, as we've spoken before, and we continue to believe that they have and will continue to drive double-digit growth within the -- within our business. And so I think that's kind of the baseline. We continue to see opportunity on that front.\n Your question on the coordination, I think, is an important one. And I would say that each of those businesses are serving distinct insurance industry constituencies. And the opportunity, I think, has been less to tie all of those products together from a single client perspective, but to partner more effectively with the U.S. team to mix and the international team to make certain that we are integrating our expertise, our data, some of the investments that we've made in the U.S. to enhance and strengthen those client -- or those product sets. \n And so I think we're seeing a heightened level of partnership in that regard, but not so much tying together, for instance, the claims and the underwriting businesses as well.  \n Another dimension, which I referenced earlier is that I think that we are seeing an opportunity to partner with institutions within Europe that see that value and through their existing distribution networks have an ability for us to deliver some of that value in partnership with other players within that market. \n And so that, I think, becomes an enhancement opportunity for those products as well as some of even our U.S.-based products and technology that can be applied there. And Heather, the -- what we are seeing that is driving that is both demand from investors for noncorrelated returns and interest, particularly in this hard market from an insurance standpoint, what are perceived to be more attractive returns. We're also seeing that in terms of more capital being attracted into excess and surplus lines and reinsurance generally. \n And it speaks to, I think, the ongoing development and the increasing sophistication of the portfolio -- active portfolio management of the insurance industry that is an opportunity for us given our modeling capabilities, given the loss costs and the rate modeling activities that we have. And that has been something that we have been engaged in thinking about at an enterprise level in terms of how we can support the development of that market. \n One example would be there is a category of insurers that are ILS managers, insurance-linked securities managers. And those have been modeling clients of ours and also represent opportunities for us to build broader relationships and how our suite of products can serve their needs as they manage external sources of capital. Thanks, Greg, and thanks for coming back for seconds. We appreciate it. So I think that we are seeing -- I would first challenge that we are seeing kind of continued pressures on the industry, both in terms of ongoing inflation as well as increased risk that they are experiencing, that seemingly is continuing to support premium growth as well as kind of natural expansion in coverage for the industry. \n So at this point, based upon the financial reports and our engagement with clients, we have not seen early signs of that market. In fact, a lot of the reading that I have seen has been to a sustained hard market. But we do have to anticipate at some point that there may be some pressure from a margin standpoint. \n And in that context, our products and services remain critical in achieving a higher level of operational efficiency within the business in order to maintain or improve that combined ratio as well as the efficiency of making good underwriting decisions. \n And I would use this as an opportunity to say I think one of the most promising dimensions of generative AI is in gathering and predigesting a lot of the information flow that the insurance industry relies upon to evaluate policy submissions, evaluating adequacy, going into the risk, not replacing the human, but enabling them to focus their expertise on the underwriting decision, the risk and the return decision. \n We think that, that is a secular trend. As technology improves, as datasets expand, that will continue to provide ample opportunity for us to deliver value to the industry. It's nice to have some premium growth because I think it puts people in a constructive frame of mind. But these issues and challenges that the industry face are going to exist, regardless of whether it's a hard market or a soft market. And I think that's our fundamental opportunity."

            "name": "Elizabeth Mann",
            "content": "Thanks, Lee, and good day to everyone on the call. \n I am pleased to share that Verisk delivered a solid first quarter of 2024. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, first quarter revenue was $704 million, up 8% versus the prior year, reflecting solid growth in underwriting and more modest growth in claims. \n Income from continuing operations was $219 million, up 12.9% versus the prior year, while diluted GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.52, up 19.7% versus the prior year. This level of EPS growth reflects strong revenue and profit growth, combined with a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count due to the large accelerated share repurchase program in 2023. \n Moving to our organic constant currency results for the first quarter. Adjusted for nonoperating items, as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, our operating results demonstrated solid growth for most of our businesses. OCC revenues grew 6.9% with growth of 7.8% in underwriting and 4.7% in claims. This was an acceleration from the fourth quarter in both subsegments and was in line with our expectations and 2024 financial guidance.\n Our subscription revenues, which comprised 80% of our total revenue in the quarter, grew 7.8% on an OCC basis during the first quarter. We experienced broad-based growth across most of our subscription-based solutions, with strong renewals and expanded relationships with existing customers and solid sales of new solutions. \n The largest contributor to subscription growth was forms, rules and loss costs. We are benefiting from a stronger renewal cycle and improved price realization as we continue to modernize our platform and deliver more value and insights to our clients through our Core Lines Reimagine program that Lee spoke about earlier.  \n In anti-fraud, we experienced underlying strength in the business with growth augmented by the continued benefit from the conversion to subscription from previously transactional customers that we mentioned throughout 2023. Most of our clients have successfully completed this transition. Therefore, the benefit will continue to taper throughout 2024.  \n And within underwriting data solutions, we are seeing a positive client response to our enhanced commercial lines property solutions, which have benefited from our expanded coverage as our database of commercial property records has grown by over 200% since 2020 and now has over 15.9 million records.  \n Our transactional revenues, representing 20% of total revenue in the first quarter, increased 3.1% on an OCC basis, reflecting a tough comparison versus the prior year which benefited from the strong auto shopping activity and nonreaction activity. During the quarter, we saw continued growth across our auto suite of solutions, though growth rates have moderated as we expected.  \n Regarding auto, due to recent changes in our data source, we have decided to discontinue our existing telematics offering. The impact of this is immaterial in 2024 with less than $1 million of revenue impact. We do not expect this to have any impact on the remainder of our auto solutions.  \n Our transactional revenue growth also benefited from double-digit growth within life insurance solutions as we saw strong customer demand for incremental services.  \n And within our extreme events business, we saw better-than-expected transactional growth driven by securitization. This was offset in part by lower weather-related transaction volumes in property estimating solutions and the impact of the conversion to subscription within our anti-fraud business.  \n Moving now to our adjusted EBITDA results. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 10.6% in the quarter, while total adjusted EBIT margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results, was 54%, up 180 basis points from the reported results in the prior year. \n As we've said in the past, the margin rate in any given quarter can be influenced by revenue mix and timing of spending, so we think it's useful to look at our margin on a trailing 12-month basis which, as of March 31, 2024, was 53.9%, up 120 basis points over last year's level. This level of margin expansion reflects the positive impact of sales leverage and cost discipline.  \n We also experienced a modest margin benefit from nonoperating items, including foreign currency changes, but this was largely offset by margin impact from recent acquisitions. Our current margin rate also reflects continued organic investment for future growth, including our Reimagine program, the replatforming of key solutions in extreme events and property estimating solutions, our new financial and human capital systems as well as exploration of advanced technologies like GenAI. We remain confident in our ability to meet our margin expansion targets, while strategically investing in future growth opportunities.  \n Continuing down the income statement. Net interest expense was $29 million for the first quarter compared to $26 million in the prior year. The current level of net interest expense reflects interest income on lower cash balances than 1 year previously. \n Our reported effective tax rate was 20.3% compared to 27.1% in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year decrease in the tax rate is primarily due to tax charges incurred in structuring the sale of our energy business last year as well as certain discrete items that we do not expect to repeat in the remaining quarters of the year.  \n We continue to believe that our tax rate for the full year 2024 will be in the 23% to 25% range, so there could be some quarterly variability related to employee stock option exercise activity.  \n Adjusted net income increased 19% to $234 million, and diluted adjusted EPS increased 26% to $1.63 for the quarter. The increase is primarily driven by solid revenue growth, strong margin expansion, a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count. \n Our lower average share count reflects the impact of the large accelerated share repurchase program we completed in 2023 using the proceeds from the divestitures. This was partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization and higher net interest expense.  \n From a cash flow perspective, on a reported basis, net cash from operating activities increased 1.9% to $372 million, while free cash flow increased 4.2% to $317 million. Both cash flow metrics reflect the impact of our indemnification obligation related to our former financial services business, which we accrued for in 2023. \n It is also important to note that the prior year cash flow figures still include the results of our previously divested energy business. So these growth figures understate the cash flow growth of our insurance-only business.  \n We are committed to returning capital to shareholders. During the first quarter, we initiated a $200 million accelerated share repurchase program, which was completed in April. Our $0.39 per share dividend was up 15% from the prior year. We continue to have $1.4 billion in capacity remaining under our repurchase authorization.  \n We are pleased with our results for the first quarter and reiterate our outlook for 2024. More specifically, we continue to expect consolidated revenue for 2024 to be in the range of $2.84 billion to $2.9 billion. \n We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.54 billion to $1.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin in the 54% to 55% range. We expect our tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25% and adjusted earnings in the range of $6.30 to $6.60 per share. \n A complete listing of all guidance measures can be found in the earnings slide deck, which has been posted to the Investors section of our website, verisk.com.  \n And now, I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments. Yes, I agree with Lee there. And I think in terms of examples of new products gaining traction, you've heard us talk about them on some of the recent calls, the Discovery Navigator product in claims, which is one that does -- now uses GenAI as well. We've talked about image forensics in the antifraud space and -- as well as a variety of innovations that we talked about in this call on our core products, including Core Lines Reimagine and the Next Generation Models in extreme events. Thanks, Tom, for the question. Yes, it's good context. You heard Lee talk about the industry and the relative strength in the industry as well as the hard market that we are in. So as he highlighted for our contracts that have a tie to net written premium growth, we're seeing generally positive tailwinds in line -- I would say, in line overall with last year. \n I think what's most important for us from a pricing standpoint is the increased engagement that we are having with our clients, and you're seeing the benefit of the investments that we're putting in our products and those are driving for us strong renewals, strong outcomes on the pricing conversations. Yes. Faiza, thanks for the question. In terms of quarterly variations, there can always be minor puts and takes as things move from quarter-to-quarter, but nothing that we see at this point that would indicate significant quarterly changes.\n The drivers of strength for us this quarter have been really broad-based across the business. Forms, rules and loss cost has been the largest driver as the largest business, and we talked about some of the trends benefiting it there. \n We've had strong strength in the antifraud business. I would call that both absolute strength as well as benefiting from the conversion from transaction to subscription. And the extreme events business actually had strong subscription growth as well given the demonstrated value there. Yes. Thanks for the question, Jeff. We don't break out sort of specific areas of investment by element. I think on the last quarter call, I mentioned those as some of the top areas for investment this year. And I think our investment in those areas is pretty much in line with our expectation for the year and embedded in the margin that you're seeing and the guidance for the full year. Yes. Happy to cover that, Greg. Thanks. You are right that we do see headwinds on the transactional revenue side largely because the comps from last year have been so strong. You saw double-digit transactional growth for about a 1-year period last year. \n I think some of the main areas of tough comps have been and will be on the auto transactional shopping activity, which was a real area of strength last year, in addition to the nonrate action activity. And we -- that really picked up in the first quarter of last year. \n So we're starting to anniversary it now. The shopping activity did actually continue strong in the first quarter. But starting next quarter, we really anniversary strong growth there. \n The other area where it could be tough comps has been on the weather activity. We called out through 2023 the elevated weather patterns that we were seeing. And so that could be a headwind this year. \n Securitization activity was very strong last year in extreme events. So that's one that we are also waiting to see. So between those different areas, that's something we're looking at. \n I think this quarter is a demonstration of the power of the business model and the bulk of our revenue coming in that subscription revenue, which continues to show very healthy signs of strength -- shows the strength that we can deliver, even compounding those tough comps. Thanks -- yes. Thanks, Surinder. I can't break it out numerically. I would say that there are -- we've talked about the various projects that we are investing in now. Those are finite projects, which we will finish, and we've talked about the time lines for each. \n There are some elements of those projects that is fixing or reinvesting in technology that has maybe been overdue. And so I would talk about our internal ERP systems as an area of that. Some of the places where we are doing tech replatforming would be those areas. And so those -- that level of investment may be elevated, and we may not need to continue going forward. \n I would say there will -- we will always be investing in our products to maintain sort of their cutting-edge status. So after we finish Core Lines Reimagine, we will continue to invest and evolve in new projects that we may not know exactly what they are today. Yes. Thanks, Heather. Yes, it is a strong market. I think it's -- what's driving it is both the need -- the increased catastrophe risk and the need for diversifying the set of investors in that space of risk. And for new investors, it's their own desire to diversify and find uncorrelated areas of investment. So that's been driving strength in that cat bond market. \n How we benefit from it is our extreme event business is one of the primary providers of models and assessment of that risk, so that the investors and the issuers of those cat bonds can agree to transact on the pricing by assessing the risk. Yes. Thanks, George. We don't forecast subscription growth for you. We do -- we obviously give our medium-term target range for total revenue growth. That's 6% to 8% organic constant currency, and subscription has historically been 80% of that. So that's kind of what we can say numerally. \n In terms of drivers for acceleration and deceleration, I think all of the things that we've been talking about are investment in our products, our customer engagement and our industry expertise drive strength in the subscription revenue, both from a renewal, from a new customer base and from a pricing perspective. \n Headwinds can come with -- we've talked about this before, with potential attrition or industry consolidation or [indiscernible]."
