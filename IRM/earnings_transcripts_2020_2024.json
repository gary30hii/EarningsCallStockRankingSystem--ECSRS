Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Greer Aviv, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nGreer Aviv: Thank you, Andrew. Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. We have provided the user-controlled slides on our Investor Relations website. We will also be providing the link to today's webcast and earnings materials. We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and CEO, and Barry Hytinen, our EVP and CFO. Today we plan to share a number of key messages to help you better understand our performance including how we had successfully navigated the COVID-19 pandemic, how we continue to execute on Project Summit and the resulting transformation across the organization, how we have accelerated momentum in our data center business, and how we are increasing our commitment to diversity and inclusion and other sustainability initiatives. After our prepared remarks will open up the lines for Q&A. Today's earnings materials will contain forward-looking statements, including statements about our 2021 and longer-term expectations. As you know, all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's earnings materials, the Safe Harbor language on Slide 2 and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliations to these measures as required by Reg G in our supplemental financial information. With that Bill, would you please, begin?\nBill Meaney: Thank you, Greer, and thank you all for taking the time to join us. Let me start by saying I hope you and your families are safe and well. As we close out a year, which has been marked by first quarter delivering near record growth to our remaining year where we had to manage headwinds from COVID, I want to take a few minutes to reflect on where we've been and where we're going. First, I want to pause and acknowledge that we continue to fight COVID-19 and we maintain making the safety of our employees, their families and our customers our first priority. Whilst we are optimistic of the positive impact the roll out of vaccines will have, we continue to believe that 2021 will look similar to 2020, albeit in reverse in terms of the macro economic landscape. However, 2020 was also a year where there was much to celebrate, which came out of the creativity and resiliency demonstrated by our teams. I couldn't be more proud of my fellow mountaineers around the world in terms of the way we responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. In a phrase, we managed the crisis, the crisis didn't manage us. We continue to serve our customers where throughout the depths of the crisis, more than 96% of our facilities remained open. We maintained our focus on Project Summit, where we increased our targeted sustained annual cost savings from $200 million to $375 million and have already achieved over $200 million on an annual run rate by the end of 2020. We accelerated our growth in data center, with 58.5 megawatts of new leases announced in 2020 versus 16.9 megawatts in 2019. We continued our investment in new products and innovation with a focus on supporting our customers' remote workforces. These services led to growth in our digital solutions year-on-year of 8%, excluding FX. And we continue to see good returns from our global strategic accounts organization and maintained our focus on shifting our culture as part of Project Summit to be one more in tune with accelerating our revenue growth through new services and solutions. This continued focus on expanding our service offerings to our customer base of 225,000 customers in organizations, in spite of COVID has allowed us to guide to organic revenue growth of 2% to 6% in 2021, the highest level of growth in the past decade. This significant investment in innovation, in new product development is supported by our purpose to be our customers most trusted partner for protecting and unlocking the value of what matters most to them in innovative and socially responsible ways. Our strategy is highlighted by an important balance between accelerating growth, driven by developing end-to-end solutions to help our customers unlock value from their content as well as sustaining growth in physical storage and data center. In other words, being both the lock and the key to many of our customers' physical and digital data assets. The strategy is underpinned by our high performance, customer obsessed culture and our strong customer connection with not only 225,000 customers, but over 950 of the world's largest 1000 companies. It is not simply investment in products that has given us accelerated revenue growth, but a deliberate focus on shifting our culture as part of Project Summit. This shift in culture is marked by a singular focus on our customers as our North Star and acceleration in our commitments around diversity and inclusion, not just because it is just, but also because it is a key to our strategic success in being a more creative and dynamic organization which can deliver more value in tune with our customer needs. And an increase in our commitment to carbon neutrality. 2020 saw us continue to secure renewable energy to meet the power needs of a 100% of our data centers, even with the rapid increase in bookings and new facilities operating. Some examples of our laser focus on how we have responded to our customer's needs in more creative ways included processing unemployment benefits to get them into the hands of people in need during the crisis and setting up 12 digital mailrooms around the globe for customers who didn't know how they were going to stay connected with their remote workforce. In a phrase, we helped our customers when they needed it most. What that all means to me, is that we came out of 2020 stronger than ever. A company with a new sense of momentum that will fuel both our top and bottom-line growth. In the next few minutes, allow me to illustrate for you what I mean by momentum. If resilience was the word for 2020, growth is the word for 2021. We're already seeing evidence of this growth in data centers, for example, and expect this to continue. As we have discussed before, we are also seeing good growth in digital solutions as well as physical storage, both from the continued durability of our records management business, together with an expanding consumer business, and believe this growth should continue. This change in revenue growth trajectory is a direct result of the investments we have made in new product areas, coupled with changes we have made in our commercial engine. One of the fundamental changes we have made in our commercial approach is that we have invested in creating more time for our salespeople to engage differently with our strategic customers. This extra time with customers has allowed us to uncover new revenue opportunities, not just for additional physical storage and new datacenter customers, but for digital services, which provides both greater visibility for doc data as well as deriving much more value from data born both physically and digitally. As a result, you can see both from our performance last year as well as the guidance we have provided today for 2021, our company is more and more seen by our customers as a partner who, yes, protects and manages all their physical and digital assets, but also gives our customers the key to integrating their information, unlocking its value, as well as accelerating their own digital transformation journey. For 70 years, we've offered protection for the assets our customers' value most. We now more and more catalog, index, govern and manage complete information across physical and digital domains, securely storing what customers need, disposing of what they don't, and helping them unearth the insights that drive business transformation. Let's now explore some exciting growth opportunities ahead of us. These are areas where we see great opportunities for growth as we position ourselves to unlock greater value for our customers and include data centers, fine arts and entertainment services, consumer storage, secure IT asset disposition or SITAD, small and medium business, content service platform or CSP. Think of this as electronic content management or ECM on steroids and secure offline storage or a highly secure air gapped data storage for cost effective protection against ransom attacks. Let's go into a little bit more detail about a couple of these areas. In data center, we have built a strong global platform with 15 operating facilities across three continents since 2017. And we just announced an agreement which once closed, will mark our entry into the very fast-growing Indian market through our investment in Web works. The total addressable market for our data centers globally is $20 billion and is growing at over 10% per colocation or retail customers and over 40% for the hyperscale segment. If you look at fine art stories and entertainment services, it's roughly a $2 billion market for both together. Just two months ago, the L.A. Times wrote an article about our entertainment services business. They called us the Fort Knox of Hollywood. The article highlighted how we are driving a different level of growth in that business through not just storage, but how we facilitate more opportunities for the studios and artists in distributing their assets to viewers and listeners. In consumer, we've grown the business in one year from about 2 million cubic feet of storage to more than 7 million cubic feet of storage, so three times as big in just 12 months. The total addressable market for consumer storage is more than 35 billion, and it is growing at about 5% to 6% per year. I note that our segment focus is on Valet storage, where our logistics expertise gives us a strong competitive advantage, as well as being a nice submarket which represents a significant opportunity for future growth. Our SITAD business has an addressable market of $10 billion, and we have seen strong growth in this business over the course of 2020. More importantly, we have found that our strong heritage around data security and chain of custody is proving a differentiator, as we recently took on the global responsibility for SITAD on behalf of two large financial institutions. So hopefully this helps you appreciate why we are so excited about the growth opportunities as we look to 2021 and beyond. Taking together, the seven areas I highlighted earlier, represent a significant market opportunity for us. Let me put some context around that. If you look back to 2015, the total addressable market we competed in was $10 billion and on average those markets had low growth rates. Over the last five years, as we've listened to customers, built expertise and developed new products and solutions, the addressable market we now compete in is over $80 billion, yes $80 billion. Additionally, those products and services that we've developed expertise in are growing at a 13% organic growth rate. So not only has the addressable market for expanded services grown by over eight times, but these new areas have double-digit industry growth rates, which helps facilitate our entry. Let me now shift gears and briefly review our performance in the fourth quarter and throughout 2020. At a high level, we couldn't have been more pleased with the way our mountaineers navigated the challenging environment in 2020 brought on by COVID-19. Throughout the pandemic, we were laser focused on execution and controlling those factors that we could, leading to outperformance against our own internal expectations through the last three quarters of 2020. This resulted in continued strength and total storage rental revenue, which grew nearly 4% on a constant currency basis in 2.4% organically. While service revenue declines continue to offset the solid storage growth, we grew adjusted EBITDA 1.3% when adjusting for currency. And our margin expanded a 110 basis points in 2020. This all in-spite of total revenue being down $115 million due to service activity declines. I want to thank our teams across the globe who stayed focused in the phase of so many obvious distractions. Our success is a reflection of our mountaineer's dedication and most importantly, I have been inspired by the way our teams looked after both the physical and the mental health of each other as they navigated the threats from COVID, both at work and at home. Turning now to our physical storage business. Total global organic volume was essentially flat compared to the third quarter. Contributing to this was a 1.9 million cubic foot increase in consumer and adjacent businesses, offset by a similar decrease in records and information management volume. For the full year, total global organic volume was flat, which is a good outcome considering the environment in which we were operating. This year, we expect total global organic volume to be flat to slightly up. Looking more specifically at RIM organic volume, this was down 1.9 million cubic feet sequentially. For the full year, organic volume declined 1.1%. In our Global Digital Solutions business in 2020, we were actually able to grow service revenue 8% year-over-year, excluding FX. Despite the pandemic, our team grew revenue. This goes back to the different mindset I mentioned earlier. We see a further acceleration in our digital solutions business going into 2021 and expect to exceed $300 million in revenue for the year. Turning now to our Global Data Center segment, the team had a phenomenal year. Blowing its leasing targets out of the water, quarter after quarter. For the full year, we leased more than 58 megawatts. Remember, our target coming into 2020 was 15 to 20 megawatts. I want to underscore that that success was not just the result of leasing to hyperscalers. We had a very good commercial momentum in our core enterprise retail colocation business, which represented 12 megawatts of the 58 megawatts or close to 40% of our bookings, excluding Frankfurt. We attracted 73 new logos to our platform during 2020, adding to our broad and diverse base of more than 1300 data center customers. This should enable us to strengthen our network ecosystem and increase the stickiness of our deployments. We also had a busy year in terms of development, with more than 10 megawatts commissioned across multiple data centers and geographies, increasing our leasable megawatts to a 130. Our team is actively adding to our development pipeline to ensure we have the right capacity in the right markets to meet robust customer demand and we are excited for the opportunities we see ahead of us in 2021, where we expect to end the year with over 170 leasable megawatts. One of those opportunities is further expanding our data center footprint into new fast-growing markets. As I mentioned earlier this morning, we announced entering into an agreement for a strategic JV with Web Werks, which once closed would expand our reach to India including Mumbai, Pune and Delhi. The data center market in India is projected to grow rapidly in the coming years and India is the second largest telecommunications market in the world. We are excited to be an early mover into an emerging market where the demand is high and the supply is low. Turning to Project Summit. We generated adjusted EBITDA benefits of a $165 million in 2020, consistent with our most recent expectations and significantly ahead of our initial estimates of $80 million reflecting strong execution in swift and decisive actions - activity actions on early initiatives. This gives us an exit rate of annual savings of over $200 million heading into 2021. As you will hear from Barry in more detail, we are fully on track to recognize the estimated $375 million of adjusted EBITDA benefiting this year and we are excited for the tangible benefits we will experience this year as we continue to enhance our technology and processes. Before I wrap up, I'd like to provide a little more detail about our continued commitment to cut our carbon emissions I referenced earlier. We were one of the first 100 or so corporations worldwide to have an ambitious carbon reduction goal approved by the science-based targets initiatives as being aligned with the Paris Climate Accord. Already in 2019, we reported that our goal to cut 25% was more than doubled by delivering a 52% reduction six years sooner than our 2025 commitment. As we did this, whilst growing our global data center business, one of the most energy intensive industries in the world. We continue to flex our innovation muscle around energy consumption as well as having introduced the green power pass to our customers. This is the first solution of its kind and allows us to pass the benefits of a 100% renewable energy data center platform to our customers for them to use to meet their sustainability targets. We're confident based upon the momentum we are building in this area that we can achieve a 100% carbon neutrality well before 2050, in spite of our rapidly growing data center business. To summarize, I've never been more optimistic about our opportunities for growth at any other time in our history even with the anticipated continued headwinds due to COVID impacting our traditional service areas. And I'd never been more proud of how we behaved as an organization over the course of 2020 and through the pandemic. We went above and beyond for our customers and our teams and embraced new collaboration tools in change how we work. Our mountaineers truly lived our values day-in and day-out. I'm excited to be on this journey with you all and I can't wait to see the future together. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry.\nBarry Hytinen: Thanks Bill. And thank you for joining us to discuss our full year and fourth quarter results. In a challenging macro environment, our team delivered solid performance across each of our key financial metrics. For the full year, revenue of $4.1 billion declined 2.7% on a reported basis, which includes a 100 basis point impact from foreign exchange. Total organic revenue declined 3.3%. Organic service revenue declined 12.8% reflecting the continued COVID impact on our activity levels. Despite the macro headwinds, total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.4% driven by more than 2 points of revenue management. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 1.3% year-on-year to $1.48 billion. Reflecting the team's strong progress with Project Summit and revenue management, EBITDA margin expanded 110 basis points or 35.6% representing the best margin performance in the company's history. Importantly, we see opportunity for profitability to continue to expand overtime. AFFO increased 2.4% to $888 million or $3.07 on a per share basis. Before I go into more detail, let me draw your attention to Slide 13 of our earnings presentation. We have made some refinements to our non-GAAP measures spurred by feedback from the investment community that some of our non-GAAP measures are difficult to compare appears. This includes changes to how we account for unconsolidated ventures, stock-based compensation and a portion of growth capital. To ensure comparability and transparency, we have provided our results on both the former and new methodology of course, the prior method will be comparable to current consensus estimates. For example, under our former methodology, full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA was $1.45 billion which compares to the current consensus of $1.446 billion. More detail is available in our earnings slides and on our Investor Relations website. Now, turning to our results for the quarter which are based on our updated non-GAAP definitions. On reported basis, revenue of $1.1 billion declined 1.8% which includes a 40 basis point impact from foreign exchange. Total organic revenue declined to 3.4%. Organic service revenue declined 12.1%. Overall, we continue to see service declines moderate with the fourth quarter reflecting a modest improvement in service trends. Total organic storage rental revenue grew 1.7% driven by revenue management. Adjusted EBITDA was $374 million under both our new and former definition, we exceeded the projections we shared on our last call as revenue trends both in storage and service were better than planned. Fourth quarter EBITDA reflects progress on our Summit transformation, revenue management and favorable mix offset by COVID driven impacts to the business. AFFO was $191 million or $0.66 on a per share basis in line with our prior projections. AFFO reflects an increase in recurring CapEx that had been deferred earlier in the year and higher cash taxes. Turning to segment performance, in the fourth quarter, our global RIM business had strong storage revenue growth driven by volume growth in our fastest growing markets and revenue management. This was offset by declines in service revenue albeit at moderating levels compared to earlier in the year leading to total organic revenue decline of 3.6%. In our shred business, the combination of lower tonnage and an 8% decline in paper price versus last year resulted in a net $3 million reduction in adjusted EBITDA. While there's been a slight step up in the index prices in January, recycled paper prices have remained low. At recent levels, we anticipate paper prices will result in EBITDA headwind of slightly over $10 million in 2021. We are pleased with the continued momentum in our consumer storage business as it becomes a more meaningful contributor to our overall physical storage volume growth. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 40 basis points driven by revenue management and Project Summit. In the fourth quarter, we continue to see fixed cost deleverage as we ensure we are staffed to the appropriate level to fully support our customers. We also had a step up in facility expense as we invested in maintenance that we had delayed over the prior two quarters. Taking a look at headline numbers for our global data center business, full year bookings came in at 58.5 megawatts. Excluding the full building lease in Frankfurt, we leased 31.5 megawatts representing bookings growth of 26%. Total revenue grew 9% year-over-year. We are pleased with our data center performance for the year and expect to continue to see and improving trajectory, thanks to the strong commercial success. In 2021, we expect at least 25 to 30 megawatts, which at the midpoint would result in more than 20% annual bookings growth. We feel good about the state of our pipeline, both from a hyperscale perspective as well as our core retail colocation. We project full year revenue growth in the range of low double-digits to approaching mid-teens. With our strong prior year bookings, we have good visibility to revenue. For the first quarter, we expect growth rates similar to the fourth quarter as the bulk of our 2020 bookings commence in the second quarter and beyond. Turning to Project Summit. As a reminder, we expect total program benefits of $375 million, of which we delivered $165 million in 2020. We expect an additional $150 million benefit in 2021 with the balance in 2022. This quarter, the team delivered $52 million of adjusted EBITDA benefit. As to capital expenditures, in the fourth quarter we invested $163 million, bringing the full year to $446 million in line with our prior expectations. In 2021, we expect total capital expenditures to be approximately $550 million, consisting of approximately $410 million of growth CapEx, of which we plan to allocate approximately $300 million to data center development. We expect $140 million of recurring CapEx. Turning to capital recycling. In the fourth quarter our program generated approximately $451 million of proceeds, which includes the Frankfurt data center joint venture we mentioned last quarter. For the full year, our capital recycling program generated approximately $475 million. I would like to call out the sale leaseback transaction we announced in December, which we sold a portfolio of 13 industrial facilities generating gross proceeds of $358 million. This portfolio was sold at a cap rate slightly below 4.5%. This was a compelling opportunity for us to monetize a small portion of our owned industrial assets, while effectively maintaining the long-term control of the facilities through an initial 10-year lease with multiple renewal options, among other favorable terms. On a leverage neutral basis, this transaction freed up approximately $260 million of investable capital that we intend to redeploy into faster growing areas, including our data center business. We plan to make these investments in 2021 so our year end net debt balance reflects these proceeds. With the highly favorable market backdrop and our strong data center development pipeline we are planning to continue to recycle industrial assets. In 2021, we are planning for $125 million of recycling. Turning to the balance sheet, at year end, we had approximately $2 billion of liquidity. We ended the year with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.3 times down from 5.7 times at year end 2019. Pro forma excluding the investible proceeds from our leaseback, leverage would have been slightly under 5.5 times. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term leverage range of 4.5 to 5.5 times. For 2021, we expect to end the year within our target range near the high end. With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early April. As we have said before, we are fully committed to our dividend at the sustainable level. Our long-term target for payout ratio is low to mid 60s as a percentage of AFFO. Now, to give you more details as to our outlook for 2021, we are pleased to reinstitute financial guidance reflecting the strength of our business, our team's strong execution and improved visibility. For the full year 2021, we currently expect revenue of $4.325 billion to $4.475 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.575 billion to $1.625 billion. At the midpoint, this guidance represents revenue growth of 6% and EBITDA growth of 8%. At the midpoint, our guidance implies about 75 basis points of EBITDA margin improvement year-on-year. We expect AFFO to be in the range of $945 million to $995 million or $3.25 to $3.42 per share. At the midpoint, this represents 9% growth for both metrics. Our guidance assumes global physical volume will be flat to slightly positive. Revenue management will be a significant benefit in 2021. And I will note the majority of those actions have already been taken as we speak to you today, and nearly all of them will be in place by the end of the quarter. As Bill mentioned, we are planning for a continuation in the strong trends we are seeing in digital solutions, combined with a slight recovery in our service activity across the year. In terms of EBITDA, our expectations include the benefit from revenue management and top line growth, as well as Project Summit savings. Partially offsetting those benefits is a prudent outlook for inflation, a step up in cost from prior COVID driven discretion, rent from our sale leaseback transactions and innovation spend. While we do not typically guide quarterly with the pandemic, we felt it would be helpful to share our expectations for the first quarter. On a dollar basis, we expect revenue and adjusted EBITDA to be consistent to slightly up from the fourth quarter results. In summary, our team is executing well. Visibility is improving and our pipeline across the business has been strengthening over the last several months. We feel well positioned as we move into 2021. I am confident in the team's ability to continue to build on our momentum. And with that operator, please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. You highlighted growth opportunities from data centers, fine art, consumer storage, secure IT asset disposition and other services. Can you describe your go-to market strategy to penetrate these growth markets and what proportion of revenue you expect this growth portfolio to evolve to over the next three to five years?\nBill Meaney: Hi, George. No, thanks for the question. I think this year most of the growth will be around the digital services, which I highlighted. So, I said last year we did 8%, then we see a further acceleration in that growth rate going into this year. And on SITAD, you'll continue to see its relatively small portion of the business. But as I said, to give you some idea of the scale, those two global contracts that we've signed early in this year to serve financial service institutions, those two combined are probably in the order of about 15% year-on-year growth. So, it's pretty high levels of growth on what it traditionally was smaller parts of our business. But over time, over the next year, what you can expect is over the next year or two, we'll start guiding more and more to those individual pieces of business. But if you think about it, what this all means is more on a consolidated basis. It gives us the confidence on guiding say that, we said that 2% to 6% growth in terms of top line range. And if you take the midpoint that's 4%. It just gives us much more confidence as we go forward that we can really start driving bottom line growth, not just through margin expansion, but through top line growth, because of the resiliency and the attractiveness of these new segments.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Thank you. Hey, Barry, maybe you could help me parse just the 2% to 6% organic revenue growth? When I look at it, the adjacent businesses versus the core business if they're growing roughly 13% in line with the end markets, that seems to be would be a little bit above 3% growth. What is the embedded assumption for the balance, in other words, the core business in the storage? Is that assuming you're going to get consistent 2% to 3% pricing, and is there any FX that's involved in that as well?\nBarry Hytinen: Sure, Shlomo, thanks for the question. If I take the total revenue guide, which is 4% to 8%, that's a little over $250 million at the midpoint or slightly over 6%. We're expecting data center, as I mentioned, in the prepared remarks to be up, kind of double-digits so we're approaching mid-teens. So, let's call it $40 million of pure revenue growth be a small amount of FX on that number, since you asked about that. And then turning to the global RIM business, we're projecting in a 200 plus million of total growth. Now, that's assuming revenue management of the normal levels that we've been experiencing 2% to 3%, maybe even a little bit closer to the high end as we continue to roll that out. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, certainly the vast majority of those actions will be in place by the end of the quarter. We're certainly expecting with COVID for planning to flat to slightly up volume. And Bill mentioned the digital solutions, which would be probably in the vicinity as much as $50 million of year-over-year benefit. And that results in a very slight service activity recovery for the balance of our services. On adjacent businesses, we're continuing to see the business improve. But I'd say we're being a little bit conservative and prudent with respect to the COVID impact as we continue to see those underlying markets recover. I will note that, we did see for the second quarter in a row, very nice volume out of our adjacent businesses. And that's the entertainment services business continuing to see improving trends. Bill, anything you'd like to add there?\nBill Meaney: I think, that covered it well.\nBarry Hytinen: The only other element Shlomo, I would add is from an FX perspective, it'll be about call it 1.5 in total of the 4 to 8, something of that order in light of where FX rates are in terms of forward projection on banks - bank views, so thanks for the question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Nate Crossett with Berenberg. Please go ahead.\nNate Crossett: Hey, good morning. Two quick questions, if I could. I was curious on the specs of the new JV, how much will you guys own? How did it come about and is this the kind of platform where there'll be opportunities over time? And then also just a question on capital recycling? I think you mentioned $125 million. I'm just curious, how much of your industrial portfolio would you be willing to recycle long-term?\nBill Meaney: So, thanks for the questions Nate. So, coming on the Web Werks JV that we announced this morning. Great question. So, we're super excited about India. I mean, personally, I've been to India, I don't know how many times over the last three years specifically looking for a data center, the right data center entry, because it's been on our radar screen for quite some time. And with Web Werks, we found a very good partner that already has presence in Mumbai, Pune, and Delhi, which three of the key regions, and they have a roadmap to expand that to Bangalore, Hyderabad and Chennai. So, which we really think gives us a very good platform, because Delhi is not a single location. In terms of the way, why we chose Web Werks is that, first of all the team, its entrepreneurial brothers that actually built the company, and they have always had a very strong focus on telecommunications interconnects. In fact, that's how they started their business. So, we think that actually they built a good ecosystem around the locations that they already have. They understand the market and the business extremely well. So, we're also buying into effectively a management team. And as we alluded to, in our press release is that the way the JV is structured is we start in a minority and they have about 4 megawatts that are actually running as we sit here today in those three locations, but they have both Brownfield expansion capacity as well as land for further greenfield expansion. And $150 million that we announced will be put in overtime on a cost basis as we build out that expansion. So, you can think of it as a way that we paid slight premium for our entry, to get the additional 4 megawatts and the management team. And then that $150 million that goes in over the next two or three years will lead to us to have a majority ownership. And that will be on a cost basis, that money put in. So, we'll effectively slide down towards a cost that is approaching, the actual cost to build the facility. So, we're really excited about the market. It is the second largest telecommunications market in the world, it has probably about 10% of the data center running in India and Northern Virginia. So and it's just a very fast-growing market. We've got a great management team that comes along as part of the deal. And we have a clear roadmap to expand and build a truly Indian footprint.\nBarry Hytinen: And Nate, thanks for the question. This is Barry. On the recycling point, we as you know, see recycling of industrial assets is highly attractive as we see the valuations as really good at these levels. And together with our development pipeline and data center, among others, it's a really good move for us to invest in faster growing opportunities. The way I think about it is industrial assets continue to increase in terms of valuation. So the level of recycling that we've assumed in the plan this year would kind of be a mid-single digit percent of purely the industrial asset base. So, we've got a - and that is obviously a base that continues to expand in terms of value in light of what's going on in asset prices out there. So over time, I think planning for something in this level, annually, is not a bad place to plan if I were you. And I would also note that, if we continue to see opportunities on both sides on the industrial side, as well as incremental opportunities in the development pipeline, we would not be afraid to continue to recycle even at a little bit higher level, but for the year, we're planning 125. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Funk with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael Funk: Yeah. Hi, good morning. Thank you for the question. A couple if I could. So, first thinking about the potential impact of wage inflation on the business with the $15 minimum wage, being pushed through. Wondering how that might impact your proposed cost savings?\nBill Meaney: Thanks for the question, Michael. I think it's an important topic and wage inflation just across even absent of the $15 minimum wage, in terms of our frontline staff, especially our carriers, right, we've been in that, I would say a highly competitive environment, for the last four or five years at least with a boom of e-commerce. So, for us, the $15 minimum wage is less than an issue. Most if not all of our workers are kind of north of that. The bigger issue for us is, quite frankly, the pressure on e-commerce for similar types of jobs. That being said, we've been able to manage our churn pretty well. And the one thing I've spent personally a fair amount of time traveling around the country as well as in Europe and in Mexico, speaking to our frontline staff, many of whom we had to furlough during the depths of the crisis, just to take the temperature and their connection to the company, their loyalty, the gratitude in terms of the way our leadership teams have managed the crisis and also tried to support them and their families both mentally, health wise and monetarily has been highly appreciated. So, I think, I still remain very confident that mountaineers are really mountaineers, we look after each other. But the inflation that you're referring to is less for us driven by the minimum wage and it's more driven by just the boom in e-commerce, but it's a good point.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Sheila McGrath of Evercore. Please go ahead.\nSheila McGrath: Yes. Good morning. We do sometimes get questions how Iron Mountain competes in the data center business versus pure play players. I was wondering if you can provide more insights on how you answer that question. Any details behind the benefits of Iron Mountain and cross-selling? And just what makes you more competitive? And was there much competition on that India joint venture?\nBill Meaney: Okay, thanks Sheila for both questions. So first, I guess my flippant answer to your first question is, I think 58.5 megawatts this year says that we're pretty competitive. So, I tell my congrats to our team who have really dug in. I think the other thing what I would say is just another proof point. Then I'll say how we're compete, is that if you look at our, especially on the sales side, but also in the operation side of our data centers, most if not all of these folks come from leading what I would call pure play data center companies. And so, you can almost say and to me it's not - you measure the success of your offering in two dimensions. One is, do customers buy it, right, which is the 58.5 megawatts this year of leasing activity our new leases signed, I think is a pretty good proof point. On the other side is, are people willing to bet their career and their livelihood by coming to join you who are specialists in the field and I have to say that market who leads that business has done a remarkable job in terms of attracting really, I would say, top tier focused data center talent. Now, in terms of the synergies between the business, which goes into the secret sauce, which you alluded to, is still about 40% of our whole own leads come from our traditional records management sales force. And that's you're seeing that even more and more now that we set up strategic accounts. So, I don't go to a strategic account meeting where they pulled out a strategic account executive for me along where we're not speaking about data center opportunities. I mean, just last week, Barry and I were with the number two executive of a global bank and he brought up data center even before we could, Barry and I with one of our strategic account executives. So it's a - people definitely see the connection, the decades, this is our 70th year, the decades of trust that we've had with financial service institutions. And it's the reason why the likes of Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse have trusted us with their colocation installs. So, definitely the trust is a big factor. And the team seems to be really getting great traction in the market.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin McVeigh of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nKevin McVeigh: Great, thanks so much. Barry, can you help us just understand how much the EBITDA methodology changes in fact the 2021 EBITDA if at all, just based on the recapture the air back at stock-based comp and growth capital and then the JVs?\nBarry Hytinen: Sure, thanks, Kevin. There's a lot of material in our slide deck, but let me go through a couple of things. From an EBITDA standpoint, the stock comp, year-to-year is very similar. I will note, like most companies, we have a performance element in our grant. So, it's conceivable that depending upon where performance is those grants could go higher or lower. So, I would be planning for that to be very modestly up year-on-year. On the [Indiscernible] ventures, as it relates to how that impacts EBITDA, there's two things there as you know, our consumer joint venture where we have a higher ownership, but while the business is performing better year-on-year as our plan, it still is in a loss position. So that'll be a little bit more of a headwind. And then we'll add on the Frankfurt joint venture where we own 20%, as you know. And that starts up as we mentioned before, the lease commences at about midyear and ramps over time as the client gets into the lease. So that, I would say the unconsolidated ventures portion is fairly similar year-on-year, slight improvement. So, net-to-EBITDA, very similar to the 2020 level of the add back that you see in the documents. EPS and FFO would flow similarly to EBITDA. And then from an AFFO standpoint, you'll note that there's less impact there than EBITDA since we were already adding back stock comp. So that has no change to AFFO. And the portion of growth capital is essentially at the same level. And I already mentioned the unconsolidated joint venture. So, an add back of kind of a high single digit million-dollar benefit to AFFO year-on-year, not unlike what we had again in 2022. Good question. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: The next question, comes from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nEric Luebchow: Hey, thanks for taking the questions. Bill, I think said that, post COVID you expected organic physical volume storage volume growth would be about 50 basis points or so and seems like you'll be pretty close to that range this year. So, is that still the right way to think about the business once we get beyond COVID? And then related to that, have you seen any impact this year from the decline in incoming boxes that you talked about last year as a result of the pandemic and have those declines kind of more or less normalized to this point? Or is there still some impact to the business? Thanks.\nBill Meaney: Yeah, I think to your first question I would say, yes. And in part of that, that recovery is based on the success that we've had in consumer is I mentioned in my remarks is that, we went from 2 million cubic feet to 7 million cubic feet last year, I'd say in 2020. In terms of the incoming volume, we still see the similar trends as we saw pre-COVID. At this point, we haven't seen a - we have and you can almost you can see that no supplemental, we haven't seen an acceleration in that headwind that we're getting. But we're still for sure going through what I think I described on a few calls previously, maybe was a year ago, what I call the second derivative action. In other words, virtually all our customers are continuing to send us new boxes. But some of our historically, fastest growing and largest verticals are sending them in at slower rates. So, we continue to see that what I call the second derivative drag on volume coming in slower than boxes aging out at their normal kind of 15-year lifespan. So, we expect to continue to have what I would call the same pre-COVID headwinds on the traditional document side of the business more than offset by the growth in consumer.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephanie Yee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nStephanie Yee: Hi, thank you. I also had a question about incoming boxes, just as people returned to work maybe later in the year, would you expect the incoming boxes to kind of pick up to pre-COVID levels? And kind of along with that, as incoming boxes pick up would constructions also pick up when people are back in the office more?\nBill Meaney: Hi, Stephanie, and thanks for the question. That would be our expectation, right. But I think it's - I don't think it's going to be a sharp change, because I think the people's transition back into the office will be more gradual than that. But I would expect that, but again, when you net those two things out, we don't expect a marked change in the trend. I mean, if you think about it, during the course of last year, is I think that our - it is basically a flat storage story. And then you add pricing on top of that is actually not a bad story at all. So, we don't see either an acceleration in either direction of that trend. But I think, what you described is would be, I think, a reasonable expectation, but I think they probably will, fairly closely net each other out.\nOperator: The next question comes from John Atkins of RBC. Please go ahead.\nJohn Atkins: Thanks very much. On the data center side, I guess I just wanted to get a sense on what competition you're seeing when entering new markets versus data center peers, financial sponsors, thoughts on just - a few thoughts on preferred path for joint ventures versus outright acquisitions? And then when it comes to, I guess on a related question, do you have any kind of general thoughts on build to suit versus sale leasebacks?\nBill Meaney: Okay, thanks, John, for the question is quite a bit in there. So, let me kind of start about how we think about the JVs or we use India as an example. So, India is a country that we're pretty comfortable in. That's why, specifically, it's actually been more than three years, actually I think, five years. I go to India, at least a couple times a year. But I would say five years ago, I started going there with a focus on finding the right data center entry. Even though we have a little less than 2,000 people working on the records management side in India. So, it's a market we know is for us, it was important to find the right not just physical opportunity for entry, the right footprint, but also the right team that we could build on. And with Web Werks, we found that I think from a Web Werks standpoint, they also appreciate it is that we are not a financial sponsor, or we're not a newbie in the Indian market. So, that they see how we operate in India already today. Culturally, we're tuned to the challenges that they have in a very supportive of their journey. And so that, in this case, Deutsche Bank ran the process. But I think one of the reasons why we won was the relationship we were able to build with the entrepreneurs and the way we the way we operate. So that to me is part of our secret sauce is that, we are a company that is in 56 countries around the world, over 20,000 mountaineers around the world so that we can make those connections. And then also it's not lost on these entrepreneurs in this particular case, that we were actually refusing data center demand. We had a number of customers, they were asking for capacity in India, and quite frankly, we just couldn't deliver for them so that we can bring that network to bear. I think if you kind of think more broadly on build to suit, as we build out our reputation with some of the large hyperscale players, so as we announced the Frankfurt started off, not as a build to suit but ended up being a build to suit effectively, because we had that interesting data center asset, and it was hyperscaler that needed the whole 27 megawatts. So, the design and engineering got modified to satisfy them. And that was one reason why we put it into the type of joint venture structure that we did, because it turned out to be a completely stabilized asset from day one, if you will. That has also led us to have, we haven't done any at this point but there's more and more that are approaching us to look at build to suit opportunities. And quite frankly, we just look at the returns. If the campus supports that, and it allows us to actually further expand or even upgrade the capacity of a campus by bringing in more power on the back of a build to suit opportunity, then we absolutely entertain it. The last thing I would say is that we are starting to see more pipeline. Now, whether or not we execute on that is interesting is that, when I was talking about the Frankfurt situation is that, what the customer there admitted to me that he really does see us as one of those handful of suppliers that he looks to when he's needing third party capacity. So, just naturally we are starting to see those kinds of opportunities, whether or not we actually execute on them really is going to depend on the types of returns in this specific campus opportunity.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and the Iron Mountain fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bill Meaney",
            "content": "Thank you, Greer, and thank you all for taking the time to join us. Let me start by saying I hope you and your families are safe and well. As we close out a year, which has been marked by first quarter delivering near record growth to our remaining year where we had to manage headwinds from COVID, I want to take a few minutes to reflect on where we've been and where we're going. First, I want to pause and acknowledge that we continue to fight COVID-19 and we maintain making the safety of our employees, their families and our customers our first priority. Whilst we are optimistic of the positive impact the roll out of vaccines will have, we continue to believe that 2021 will look similar to 2020, albeit in reverse in terms of the macro economic landscape. However, 2020 was also a year where there was much to celebrate, which came out of the creativity and resiliency demonstrated by our teams. I couldn't be more proud of my fellow mountaineers around the world in terms of the way we responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. In a phrase, we managed the crisis, the crisis didn't manage us. We continue to serve our customers where throughout the depths of the crisis, more than 96% of our facilities remained open. We maintained our focus on Project Summit, where we increased our targeted sustained annual cost savings from $200 million to $375 million and have already achieved over $200 million on an annual run rate by the end of 2020. We accelerated our growth in data center, with 58.5 megawatts of new leases announced in 2020 versus 16.9 megawatts in 2019. We continued our investment in new products and innovation with a focus on supporting our customers' remote workforces. These services led to growth in our digital solutions year-on-year of 8%, excluding FX. And we continue to see good returns from our global strategic accounts organization and maintained our focus on shifting our culture as part of Project Summit to be one more in tune with accelerating our revenue growth through new services and solutions. This continued focus on expanding our service offerings to our customer base of 225,000 customers in organizations, in spite of COVID has allowed us to guide to organic revenue growth of 2% to 6% in 2021, the highest level of growth in the past decade. This significant investment in innovation, in new product development is supported by our purpose to be our customers most trusted partner for protecting and unlocking the value of what matters most to them in innovative and socially responsible ways. Our strategy is highlighted by an important balance between accelerating growth, driven by developing end-to-end solutions to help our customers unlock value from their content as well as sustaining growth in physical storage and data center. In other words, being both the lock and the key to many of our customers' physical and digital data assets. The strategy is underpinned by our high performance, customer obsessed culture and our strong customer connection with not only 225,000 customers, but over 950 of the world's largest 1000 companies. It is not simply investment in products that has given us accelerated revenue growth, but a deliberate focus on shifting our culture as part of Project Summit. This shift in culture is marked by a singular focus on our customers as our North Star and acceleration in our commitments around diversity and inclusion, not just because it is just, but also because it is a key to our strategic success in being a more creative and dynamic organization which can deliver more value in tune with our customer needs. And an increase in our commitment to carbon neutrality. 2020 saw us continue to secure renewable energy to meet the power needs of a 100% of our data centers, even with the rapid increase in bookings and new facilities operating. Some examples of our laser focus on how we have responded to our customer's needs in more creative ways included processing unemployment benefits to get them into the hands of people in need during the crisis and setting up 12 digital mailrooms around the globe for customers who didn't know how they were going to stay connected with their remote workforce. In a phrase, we helped our customers when they needed it most. What that all means to me, is that we came out of 2020 stronger than ever. A company with a new sense of momentum that will fuel both our top and bottom-line growth. In the next few minutes, allow me to illustrate for you what I mean by momentum. If resilience was the word for 2020, growth is the word for 2021. We're already seeing evidence of this growth in data centers, for example, and expect this to continue. As we have discussed before, we are also seeing good growth in digital solutions as well as physical storage, both from the continued durability of our records management business, together with an expanding consumer business, and believe this growth should continue. This change in revenue growth trajectory is a direct result of the investments we have made in new product areas, coupled with changes we have made in our commercial engine. One of the fundamental changes we have made in our commercial approach is that we have invested in creating more time for our salespeople to engage differently with our strategic customers. This extra time with customers has allowed us to uncover new revenue opportunities, not just for additional physical storage and new datacenter customers, but for digital services, which provides both greater visibility for doc data as well as deriving much more value from data born both physically and digitally. As a result, you can see both from our performance last year as well as the guidance we have provided today for 2021, our company is more and more seen by our customers as a partner who, yes, protects and manages all their physical and digital assets, but also gives our customers the key to integrating their information, unlocking its value, as well as accelerating their own digital transformation journey. For 70 years, we've offered protection for the assets our customers' value most. We now more and more catalog, index, govern and manage complete information across physical and digital domains, securely storing what customers need, disposing of what they don't, and helping them unearth the insights that drive business transformation. Let's now explore some exciting growth opportunities ahead of us. These are areas where we see great opportunities for growth as we position ourselves to unlock greater value for our customers and include data centers, fine arts and entertainment services, consumer storage, secure IT asset disposition or SITAD, small and medium business, content service platform or CSP. Think of this as electronic content management or ECM on steroids and secure offline storage or a highly secure air gapped data storage for cost effective protection against ransom attacks. Let's go into a little bit more detail about a couple of these areas. In data center, we have built a strong global platform with 15 operating facilities across three continents since 2017. And we just announced an agreement which once closed, will mark our entry into the very fast-growing Indian market through our investment in Web works. The total addressable market for our data centers globally is $20 billion and is growing at over 10% per colocation or retail customers and over 40% for the hyperscale segment. If you look at fine art stories and entertainment services, it's roughly a $2 billion market for both together. Just two months ago, the L.A. Times wrote an article about our entertainment services business. They called us the Fort Knox of Hollywood. The article highlighted how we are driving a different level of growth in that business through not just storage, but how we facilitate more opportunities for the studios and artists in distributing their assets to viewers and listeners. In consumer, we've grown the business in one year from about 2 million cubic feet of storage to more than 7 million cubic feet of storage, so three times as big in just 12 months. The total addressable market for consumer storage is more than 35 billion, and it is growing at about 5% to 6% per year. I note that our segment focus is on Valet storage, where our logistics expertise gives us a strong competitive advantage, as well as being a nice submarket which represents a significant opportunity for future growth. Our SITAD business has an addressable market of $10 billion, and we have seen strong growth in this business over the course of 2020. More importantly, we have found that our strong heritage around data security and chain of custody is proving a differentiator, as we recently took on the global responsibility for SITAD on behalf of two large financial institutions. So hopefully this helps you appreciate why we are so excited about the growth opportunities as we look to 2021 and beyond. Taking together, the seven areas I highlighted earlier, represent a significant market opportunity for us. Let me put some context around that. If you look back to 2015, the total addressable market we competed in was $10 billion and on average those markets had low growth rates. Over the last five years, as we've listened to customers, built expertise and developed new products and solutions, the addressable market we now compete in is over $80 billion, yes $80 billion. Additionally, those products and services that we've developed expertise in are growing at a 13% organic growth rate. So not only has the addressable market for expanded services grown by over eight times, but these new areas have double-digit industry growth rates, which helps facilitate our entry. Let me now shift gears and briefly review our performance in the fourth quarter and throughout 2020. At a high level, we couldn't have been more pleased with the way our mountaineers navigated the challenging environment in 2020 brought on by COVID-19. Throughout the pandemic, we were laser focused on execution and controlling those factors that we could, leading to outperformance against our own internal expectations through the last three quarters of 2020. This resulted in continued strength and total storage rental revenue, which grew nearly 4% on a constant currency basis in 2.4% organically. While service revenue declines continue to offset the solid storage growth, we grew adjusted EBITDA 1.3% when adjusting for currency. And our margin expanded a 110 basis points in 2020. This all in-spite of total revenue being down $115 million due to service activity declines. I want to thank our teams across the globe who stayed focused in the phase of so many obvious distractions. Our success is a reflection of our mountaineer's dedication and most importantly, I have been inspired by the way our teams looked after both the physical and the mental health of each other as they navigated the threats from COVID, both at work and at home. Turning now to our physical storage business. Total global organic volume was essentially flat compared to the third quarter. Contributing to this was a 1.9 million cubic foot increase in consumer and adjacent businesses, offset by a similar decrease in records and information management volume. For the full year, total global organic volume was flat, which is a good outcome considering the environment in which we were operating. This year, we expect total global organic volume to be flat to slightly up. Looking more specifically at RIM organic volume, this was down 1.9 million cubic feet sequentially. For the full year, organic volume declined 1.1%. In our Global Digital Solutions business in 2020, we were actually able to grow service revenue 8% year-over-year, excluding FX. Despite the pandemic, our team grew revenue. This goes back to the different mindset I mentioned earlier. We see a further acceleration in our digital solutions business going into 2021 and expect to exceed $300 million in revenue for the year. Turning now to our Global Data Center segment, the team had a phenomenal year. Blowing its leasing targets out of the water, quarter after quarter. For the full year, we leased more than 58 megawatts. Remember, our target coming into 2020 was 15 to 20 megawatts. I want to underscore that that success was not just the result of leasing to hyperscalers. We had a very good commercial momentum in our core enterprise retail colocation business, which represented 12 megawatts of the 58 megawatts or close to 40% of our bookings, excluding Frankfurt. We attracted 73 new logos to our platform during 2020, adding to our broad and diverse base of more than 1300 data center customers. This should enable us to strengthen our network ecosystem and increase the stickiness of our deployments. We also had a busy year in terms of development, with more than 10 megawatts commissioned across multiple data centers and geographies, increasing our leasable megawatts to a 130. Our team is actively adding to our development pipeline to ensure we have the right capacity in the right markets to meet robust customer demand and we are excited for the opportunities we see ahead of us in 2021, where we expect to end the year with over 170 leasable megawatts. One of those opportunities is further expanding our data center footprint into new fast-growing markets. As I mentioned earlier this morning, we announced entering into an agreement for a strategic JV with Web Werks, which once closed would expand our reach to India including Mumbai, Pune and Delhi. The data center market in India is projected to grow rapidly in the coming years and India is the second largest telecommunications market in the world. We are excited to be an early mover into an emerging market where the demand is high and the supply is low. Turning to Project Summit. We generated adjusted EBITDA benefits of a $165 million in 2020, consistent with our most recent expectations and significantly ahead of our initial estimates of $80 million reflecting strong execution in swift and decisive actions - activity actions on early initiatives. This gives us an exit rate of annual savings of over $200 million heading into 2021. As you will hear from Barry in more detail, we are fully on track to recognize the estimated $375 million of adjusted EBITDA benefiting this year and we are excited for the tangible benefits we will experience this year as we continue to enhance our technology and processes. Before I wrap up, I'd like to provide a little more detail about our continued commitment to cut our carbon emissions I referenced earlier. We were one of the first 100 or so corporations worldwide to have an ambitious carbon reduction goal approved by the science-based targets initiatives as being aligned with the Paris Climate Accord. Already in 2019, we reported that our goal to cut 25% was more than doubled by delivering a 52% reduction six years sooner than our 2025 commitment. As we did this, whilst growing our global data center business, one of the most energy intensive industries in the world. We continue to flex our innovation muscle around energy consumption as well as having introduced the green power pass to our customers. This is the first solution of its kind and allows us to pass the benefits of a 100% renewable energy data center platform to our customers for them to use to meet their sustainability targets. We're confident based upon the momentum we are building in this area that we can achieve a 100% carbon neutrality well before 2050, in spite of our rapidly growing data center business. To summarize, I've never been more optimistic about our opportunities for growth at any other time in our history even with the anticipated continued headwinds due to COVID impacting our traditional service areas. And I'd never been more proud of how we behaved as an organization over the course of 2020 and through the pandemic. We went above and beyond for our customers and our teams and embraced new collaboration tools in change how we work. Our mountaineers truly lived our values day-in and day-out. I'm excited to be on this journey with you all and I can't wait to see the future together. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry. Hi, George. No, thanks for the question. I think this year most of the growth will be around the digital services, which I highlighted. So, I said last year we did 8%, then we see a further acceleration in that growth rate going into this year. And on SITAD, you'll continue to see its relatively small portion of the business. But as I said, to give you some idea of the scale, those two global contracts that we've signed early in this year to serve financial service institutions, those two combined are probably in the order of about 15% year-on-year growth. So, it's pretty high levels of growth on what it traditionally was smaller parts of our business. But over time, over the next year, what you can expect is over the next year or two, we'll start guiding more and more to those individual pieces of business. But if you think about it, what this all means is more on a consolidated basis. It gives us the confidence on guiding say that, we said that 2% to 6% growth in terms of top line range. And if you take the midpoint that's 4%. It just gives us much more confidence as we go forward that we can really start driving bottom line growth, not just through margin expansion, but through top line growth, because of the resiliency and the attractiveness of these new segments. I think, that covered it well. So, thanks for the questions Nate. So, coming on the Web Werks JV that we announced this morning. Great question. So, we're super excited about India. I mean, personally, I've been to India, I don't know how many times over the last three years specifically looking for a data center, the right data center entry, because it's been on our radar screen for quite some time. And with Web Werks, we found a very good partner that already has presence in Mumbai, Pune, and Delhi, which three of the key regions, and they have a roadmap to expand that to Bangalore, Hyderabad and Chennai. So, which we really think gives us a very good platform, because Delhi is not a single location. In terms of the way, why we chose Web Werks is that, first of all the team, its entrepreneurial brothers that actually built the company, and they have always had a very strong focus on telecommunications interconnects. In fact, that's how they started their business. So, we think that actually they built a good ecosystem around the locations that they already have. They understand the market and the business extremely well. So, we're also buying into effectively a management team. And as we alluded to, in our press release is that the way the JV is structured is we start in a minority and they have about 4 megawatts that are actually running as we sit here today in those three locations, but they have both Brownfield expansion capacity as well as land for further greenfield expansion. And $150 million that we announced will be put in overtime on a cost basis as we build out that expansion. So, you can think of it as a way that we paid slight premium for our entry, to get the additional 4 megawatts and the management team. And then that $150 million that goes in over the next two or three years will lead to us to have a majority ownership. And that will be on a cost basis, that money put in. So, we'll effectively slide down towards a cost that is approaching, the actual cost to build the facility. So, we're really excited about the market. It is the second largest telecommunications market in the world, it has probably about 10% of the data center running in India and Northern Virginia. So and it's just a very fast-growing market. We've got a great management team that comes along as part of the deal. And we have a clear roadmap to expand and build a truly Indian footprint. Thanks for the question, Michael. I think it's an important topic and wage inflation just across even absent of the $15 minimum wage, in terms of our frontline staff, especially our carriers, right, we've been in that, I would say a highly competitive environment, for the last four or five years at least with a boom of e-commerce. So, for us, the $15 minimum wage is less than an issue. Most if not all of our workers are kind of north of that. The bigger issue for us is, quite frankly, the pressure on e-commerce for similar types of jobs. That being said, we've been able to manage our churn pretty well. And the one thing I've spent personally a fair amount of time traveling around the country as well as in Europe and in Mexico, speaking to our frontline staff, many of whom we had to furlough during the depths of the crisis, just to take the temperature and their connection to the company, their loyalty, the gratitude in terms of the way our leadership teams have managed the crisis and also tried to support them and their families both mentally, health wise and monetarily has been highly appreciated. So, I think, I still remain very confident that mountaineers are really mountaineers, we look after each other. But the inflation that you're referring to is less for us driven by the minimum wage and it's more driven by just the boom in e-commerce, but it's a good point. Okay, thanks Sheila for both questions. So first, I guess my flippant answer to your first question is, I think 58.5 megawatts this year says that we're pretty competitive. So, I tell my congrats to our team who have really dug in. I think the other thing what I would say is just another proof point. Then I'll say how we're compete, is that if you look at our, especially on the sales side, but also in the operation side of our data centers, most if not all of these folks come from leading what I would call pure play data center companies. And so, you can almost say and to me it's not - you measure the success of your offering in two dimensions. One is, do customers buy it, right, which is the 58.5 megawatts this year of leasing activity our new leases signed, I think is a pretty good proof point. On the other side is, are people willing to bet their career and their livelihood by coming to join you who are specialists in the field and I have to say that market who leads that business has done a remarkable job in terms of attracting really, I would say, top tier focused data center talent. Now, in terms of the synergies between the business, which goes into the secret sauce, which you alluded to, is still about 40% of our whole own leads come from our traditional records management sales force. And that's you're seeing that even more and more now that we set up strategic accounts. So, I don't go to a strategic account meeting where they pulled out a strategic account executive for me along where we're not speaking about data center opportunities. I mean, just last week, Barry and I were with the number two executive of a global bank and he brought up data center even before we could, Barry and I with one of our strategic account executives. So it's a - people definitely see the connection, the decades, this is our 70th year, the decades of trust that we've had with financial service institutions. And it's the reason why the likes of Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse have trusted us with their colocation installs. So, definitely the trust is a big factor. And the team seems to be really getting great traction in the market. Yeah, I think to your first question I would say, yes. And in part of that, that recovery is based on the success that we've had in consumer is I mentioned in my remarks is that, we went from 2 million cubic feet to 7 million cubic feet last year, I'd say in 2020. In terms of the incoming volume, we still see the similar trends as we saw pre-COVID. At this point, we haven't seen a - we have and you can almost you can see that no supplemental, we haven't seen an acceleration in that headwind that we're getting. But we're still for sure going through what I think I described on a few calls previously, maybe was a year ago, what I call the second derivative action. In other words, virtually all our customers are continuing to send us new boxes. But some of our historically, fastest growing and largest verticals are sending them in at slower rates. So, we continue to see that what I call the second derivative drag on volume coming in slower than boxes aging out at their normal kind of 15-year lifespan. So, we expect to continue to have what I would call the same pre-COVID headwinds on the traditional document side of the business more than offset by the growth in consumer. Hi, Stephanie, and thanks for the question. That would be our expectation, right. But I think it's - I don't think it's going to be a sharp change, because I think the people's transition back into the office will be more gradual than that. But I would expect that, but again, when you net those two things out, we don't expect a marked change in the trend. I mean, if you think about it, during the course of last year, is I think that our - it is basically a flat storage story. And then you add pricing on top of that is actually not a bad story at all. So, we don't see either an acceleration in either direction of that trend. But I think, what you described is would be, I think, a reasonable expectation, but I think they probably will, fairly closely net each other out. Okay, thanks, John, for the question is quite a bit in there. So, let me kind of start about how we think about the JVs or we use India as an example. So, India is a country that we're pretty comfortable in. That's why, specifically, it's actually been more than three years, actually I think, five years. I go to India, at least a couple times a year. But I would say five years ago, I started going there with a focus on finding the right data center entry. Even though we have a little less than 2,000 people working on the records management side in India. So, it's a market we know is for us, it was important to find the right not just physical opportunity for entry, the right footprint, but also the right team that we could build on. And with Web Werks, we found that I think from a Web Werks standpoint, they also appreciate it is that we are not a financial sponsor, or we're not a newbie in the Indian market. So, that they see how we operate in India already today. Culturally, we're tuned to the challenges that they have in a very supportive of their journey. And so that, in this case, Deutsche Bank ran the process. But I think one of the reasons why we won was the relationship we were able to build with the entrepreneurs and the way we the way we operate. So that to me is part of our secret sauce is that, we are a company that is in 56 countries around the world, over 20,000 mountaineers around the world so that we can make those connections. And then also it's not lost on these entrepreneurs in this particular case, that we were actually refusing data center demand. We had a number of customers, they were asking for capacity in India, and quite frankly, we just couldn't deliver for them so that we can bring that network to bear. I think if you kind of think more broadly on build to suit, as we build out our reputation with some of the large hyperscale players, so as we announced the Frankfurt started off, not as a build to suit but ended up being a build to suit effectively, because we had that interesting data center asset, and it was hyperscaler that needed the whole 27 megawatts. So, the design and engineering got modified to satisfy them. And that was one reason why we put it into the type of joint venture structure that we did, because it turned out to be a completely stabilized asset from day one, if you will. That has also led us to have, we haven't done any at this point but there's more and more that are approaching us to look at build to suit opportunities. And quite frankly, we just look at the returns. If the campus supports that, and it allows us to actually further expand or even upgrade the capacity of a campus by bringing in more power on the back of a build to suit opportunity, then we absolutely entertain it. The last thing I would say is that we are starting to see more pipeline. Now, whether or not we execute on that is interesting is that, when I was talking about the Frankfurt situation is that, what the customer there admitted to me that he really does see us as one of those handful of suppliers that he looks to when he's needing third party capacity. So, just naturally we are starting to see those kinds of opportunities, whether or not we actually execute on them really is going to depend on the types of returns in this specific campus opportunity."

            "content": "Thanks Bill. And thank you for joining us to discuss our full year and fourth quarter results. In a challenging macro environment, our team delivered solid performance across each of our key financial metrics. For the full year, revenue of $4.1 billion declined 2.7% on a reported basis, which includes a 100 basis point impact from foreign exchange. Total organic revenue declined 3.3%. Organic service revenue declined 12.8% reflecting the continued COVID impact on our activity levels. Despite the macro headwinds, total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.4% driven by more than 2 points of revenue management. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 1.3% year-on-year to $1.48 billion. Reflecting the team's strong progress with Project Summit and revenue management, EBITDA margin expanded 110 basis points or 35.6% representing the best margin performance in the company's history. Importantly, we see opportunity for profitability to continue to expand overtime. AFFO increased 2.4% to $888 million or $3.07 on a per share basis. Before I go into more detail, let me draw your attention to Slide 13 of our earnings presentation. We have made some refinements to our non-GAAP measures spurred by feedback from the investment community that some of our non-GAAP measures are difficult to compare appears. This includes changes to how we account for unconsolidated ventures, stock-based compensation and a portion of growth capital. To ensure comparability and transparency, we have provided our results on both the former and new methodology of course, the prior method will be comparable to current consensus estimates. For example, under our former methodology, full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA was $1.45 billion which compares to the current consensus of $1.446 billion. More detail is available in our earnings slides and on our Investor Relations website. Now, turning to our results for the quarter which are based on our updated non-GAAP definitions. On reported basis, revenue of $1.1 billion declined 1.8% which includes a 40 basis point impact from foreign exchange. Total organic revenue declined to 3.4%. Organic service revenue declined 12.1%. Overall, we continue to see service declines moderate with the fourth quarter reflecting a modest improvement in service trends. Total organic storage rental revenue grew 1.7% driven by revenue management. Adjusted EBITDA was $374 million under both our new and former definition, we exceeded the projections we shared on our last call as revenue trends both in storage and service were better than planned. Fourth quarter EBITDA reflects progress on our Summit transformation, revenue management and favorable mix offset by COVID driven impacts to the business. AFFO was $191 million or $0.66 on a per share basis in line with our prior projections. AFFO reflects an increase in recurring CapEx that had been deferred earlier in the year and higher cash taxes. Turning to segment performance, in the fourth quarter, our global RIM business had strong storage revenue growth driven by volume growth in our fastest growing markets and revenue management. This was offset by declines in service revenue albeit at moderating levels compared to earlier in the year leading to total organic revenue decline of 3.6%. In our shred business, the combination of lower tonnage and an 8% decline in paper price versus last year resulted in a net $3 million reduction in adjusted EBITDA. While there's been a slight step up in the index prices in January, recycled paper prices have remained low. At recent levels, we anticipate paper prices will result in EBITDA headwind of slightly over $10 million in 2021. We are pleased with the continued momentum in our consumer storage business as it becomes a more meaningful contributor to our overall physical storage volume growth. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 40 basis points driven by revenue management and Project Summit. In the fourth quarter, we continue to see fixed cost deleverage as we ensure we are staffed to the appropriate level to fully support our customers. We also had a step up in facility expense as we invested in maintenance that we had delayed over the prior two quarters. Taking a look at headline numbers for our global data center business, full year bookings came in at 58.5 megawatts. Excluding the full building lease in Frankfurt, we leased 31.5 megawatts representing bookings growth of 26%. Total revenue grew 9% year-over-year. We are pleased with our data center performance for the year and expect to continue to see and improving trajectory, thanks to the strong commercial success. In 2021, we expect at least 25 to 30 megawatts, which at the midpoint would result in more than 20% annual bookings growth. We feel good about the state of our pipeline, both from a hyperscale perspective as well as our core retail colocation. We project full year revenue growth in the range of low double-digits to approaching mid-teens. With our strong prior year bookings, we have good visibility to revenue. For the first quarter, we expect growth rates similar to the fourth quarter as the bulk of our 2020 bookings commence in the second quarter and beyond. Turning to Project Summit. As a reminder, we expect total program benefits of $375 million, of which we delivered $165 million in 2020. We expect an additional $150 million benefit in 2021 with the balance in 2022. This quarter, the team delivered $52 million of adjusted EBITDA benefit. As to capital expenditures, in the fourth quarter we invested $163 million, bringing the full year to $446 million in line with our prior expectations. In 2021, we expect total capital expenditures to be approximately $550 million, consisting of approximately $410 million of growth CapEx, of which we plan to allocate approximately $300 million to data center development. We expect $140 million of recurring CapEx. Turning to capital recycling. In the fourth quarter our program generated approximately $451 million of proceeds, which includes the Frankfurt data center joint venture we mentioned last quarter. For the full year, our capital recycling program generated approximately $475 million. I would like to call out the sale leaseback transaction we announced in December, which we sold a portfolio of 13 industrial facilities generating gross proceeds of $358 million. This portfolio was sold at a cap rate slightly below 4.5%. This was a compelling opportunity for us to monetize a small portion of our owned industrial assets, while effectively maintaining the long-term control of the facilities through an initial 10-year lease with multiple renewal options, among other favorable terms. On a leverage neutral basis, this transaction freed up approximately $260 million of investable capital that we intend to redeploy into faster growing areas, including our data center business. We plan to make these investments in 2021 so our year end net debt balance reflects these proceeds. With the highly favorable market backdrop and our strong data center development pipeline we are planning to continue to recycle industrial assets. In 2021, we are planning for $125 million of recycling. Turning to the balance sheet, at year end, we had approximately $2 billion of liquidity. We ended the year with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.3 times down from 5.7 times at year end 2019. Pro forma excluding the investible proceeds from our leaseback, leverage would have been slightly under 5.5 times. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term leverage range of 4.5 to 5.5 times. For 2021, we expect to end the year within our target range near the high end. With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early April. As we have said before, we are fully committed to our dividend at the sustainable level. Our long-term target for payout ratio is low to mid 60s as a percentage of AFFO. Now, to give you more details as to our outlook for 2021, we are pleased to reinstitute financial guidance reflecting the strength of our business, our team's strong execution and improved visibility. For the full year 2021, we currently expect revenue of $4.325 billion to $4.475 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.575 billion to $1.625 billion. At the midpoint, this guidance represents revenue growth of 6% and EBITDA growth of 8%. At the midpoint, our guidance implies about 75 basis points of EBITDA margin improvement year-on-year. We expect AFFO to be in the range of $945 million to $995 million or $3.25 to $3.42 per share. At the midpoint, this represents 9% growth for both metrics. Our guidance assumes global physical volume will be flat to slightly positive. Revenue management will be a significant benefit in 2021. And I will note the majority of those actions have already been taken as we speak to you today, and nearly all of them will be in place by the end of the quarter. As Bill mentioned, we are planning for a continuation in the strong trends we are seeing in digital solutions, combined with a slight recovery in our service activity across the year. In terms of EBITDA, our expectations include the benefit from revenue management and top line growth, as well as Project Summit savings. Partially offsetting those benefits is a prudent outlook for inflation, a step up in cost from prior COVID driven discretion, rent from our sale leaseback transactions and innovation spend. While we do not typically guide quarterly with the pandemic, we felt it would be helpful to share our expectations for the first quarter. On a dollar basis, we expect revenue and adjusted EBITDA to be consistent to slightly up from the fourth quarter results. In summary, our team is executing well. Visibility is improving and our pipeline across the business has been strengthening over the last several months. We feel well positioned as we move into 2021. I am confident in the team's ability to continue to build on our momentum. And with that operator, please open the line for Q&A. Sure, Shlomo, thanks for the question. If I take the total revenue guide, which is 4% to 8%, that's a little over $250 million at the midpoint or slightly over 6%. We're expecting data center, as I mentioned, in the prepared remarks to be up, kind of double-digits so we're approaching mid-teens. So, let's call it $40 million of pure revenue growth be a small amount of FX on that number, since you asked about that. And then turning to the global RIM business, we're projecting in a 200 plus million of total growth. Now, that's assuming revenue management of the normal levels that we've been experiencing 2% to 3%, maybe even a little bit closer to the high end as we continue to roll that out. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, certainly the vast majority of those actions will be in place by the end of the quarter. We're certainly expecting with COVID for planning to flat to slightly up volume. And Bill mentioned the digital solutions, which would be probably in the vicinity as much as $50 million of year-over-year benefit. And that results in a very slight service activity recovery for the balance of our services. On adjacent businesses, we're continuing to see the business improve. But I'd say we're being a little bit conservative and prudent with respect to the COVID impact as we continue to see those underlying markets recover. I will note that, we did see for the second quarter in a row, very nice volume out of our adjacent businesses. And that's the entertainment services business continuing to see improving trends. Bill, anything you'd like to add there? The only other element Shlomo, I would add is from an FX perspective, it'll be about call it 1.5 in total of the 4 to 8, something of that order in light of where FX rates are in terms of forward projection on banks - bank views, so thanks for the question. And Nate, thanks for the question. This is Barry. On the recycling point, we as you know, see recycling of industrial assets is highly attractive as we see the valuations as really good at these levels. And together with our development pipeline and data center, among others, it's a really good move for us to invest in faster growing opportunities. The way I think about it is industrial assets continue to increase in terms of valuation. So the level of recycling that we've assumed in the plan this year would kind of be a mid-single digit percent of purely the industrial asset base. So, we've got a - and that is obviously a base that continues to expand in terms of value in light of what's going on in asset prices out there. So over time, I think planning for something in this level, annually, is not a bad place to plan if I were you. And I would also note that, if we continue to see opportunities on both sides on the industrial side, as well as incremental opportunities in the development pipeline, we would not be afraid to continue to recycle even at a little bit higher level, but for the year, we're planning 125. Thanks for the question. Sure, thanks, Kevin. There's a lot of material in our slide deck, but let me go through a couple of things. From an EBITDA standpoint, the stock comp, year-to-year is very similar. I will note, like most companies, we have a performance element in our grant. So, it's conceivable that depending upon where performance is those grants could go higher or lower. So, I would be planning for that to be very modestly up year-on-year. On the [Indiscernible] ventures, as it relates to how that impacts EBITDA, there's two things there as you know, our consumer joint venture where we have a higher ownership, but while the business is performing better year-on-year as our plan, it still is in a loss position. So that'll be a little bit more of a headwind. And then we'll add on the Frankfurt joint venture where we own 20%, as you know. And that starts up as we mentioned before, the lease commences at about midyear and ramps over time as the client gets into the lease. So that, I would say the unconsolidated ventures portion is fairly similar year-on-year, slight improvement. So, net-to-EBITDA, very similar to the 2020 level of the add back that you see in the documents. EPS and FFO would flow similarly to EBITDA. And then from an AFFO standpoint, you'll note that there's less impact there than EBITDA since we were already adding back stock comp. So that has no change to AFFO. And the portion of growth capital is essentially at the same level. And I already mentioned the unconsolidated joint venture. So, an add back of kind of a high single digit million-dollar benefit to AFFO year-on-year, not unlike what we had again in 2022. Good question. Thanks for the question."

Should you need assistance, please signal a conference specialist by pressing the star key followed by zero. After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Greer Aviv, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nGreer Aviv: Thank you, Rocco. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. We have provided the user-controlled slides on our Investor Relations website. We will also be providing the links to today\u2019s webcast and our materials. We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and CEO, and Barry Hytinen, our EVP and CFO.  Today we plan to share a number of key messages to help you better understand our performance, including how we are continuing to respond and adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic, continuing to demonstrate top line resilience in our physical storage business, continuing to see strength in our data center business, progressing on our transformation program with Project Summit, and how we are remaining committed to funding innovation and new product development. After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open up the lines for Q&A. Today\u2019s earnings materials will contain forward-looking statements. We have noted the impacts from COVID-19 and our expectations of how that may impact our operations and financial performance in 2020. We have also noted our expectations for Project Summit as well as certain other comments on our expectations for the remainder of the year. As you all know, forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today\u2019s earnings materials, the Safe Harbor language on Slide 2, and our annual report on Form 10-K and other periodic SEC filings for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included a reconciliation to these measures as required by Reg G in our supplemental financial information. With that, Bill, would you please begin?\nWilliam Meaney: Thank you Greer, and thank you all for taking the time to join us. Let me start by saying I hope you and your families are safe and well. The third quarter provided us with a great opportunity to demonstrate the significance of the measures we have taken over the last few months in response to the pandemic and set a marker for outperformance through top line resilience in our physical storage and growing data center businesses, adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, and by maintaining our strong cash generation track record all while continuing our investment in innovation and new product development. I would like to thank all of our Mountaineers for this remarkable performance and for their steadfast focus on safety and execution.  Despite lingering uncertainty related to the global COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen improvements, albeit gradual, in key U.S. and international markets as it relates to our service activity levels while showing continued strong performance in both our physical storage business and our global data center business. I continue to be inspired by the tireless efforts of our teams as they support and care for our customers, each other, and our communities whilst accelerating progress on our strategic priorities. From the start, we set our priorities to deal with the situation clearly and take care of the health and safety of our people and work hard to honor the commitments we have made to our customers. In April, we had up to one-third of our workforce out on furlough or other temporary leave. I\u2019m happy to report that we have brought a significant number of these Mountaineers back to work to serve our customers and we now have over 90% of our employees working regularly. Whilst this has been a very difficult time, we have proven to be very resilient. We are financially healthy with strong and reliable cash flow driven in part by our brand and customer loyalty. This was evident in how we\u2019ve managed the heightened uncertainty of the past eight months.  We quickly aligned on the right mix of priorities to maintain strong near term momentum whilst continuing our investments in innovation and new products as we execute our plan for long term value creation. This combined with the benefits from Project Summit has allowed us to continue to invest in transforming and modernizing our company. As demonstrated by our year-on-year constant currency year-to-date adjusted EBITDA in storage revenue growth, we can already see the evidence supporting our belief that we will emerge from this pandemic as a stronger company on all dimensions.  Clearly, there are still many uncertainties around COVID in terms of the development of the pandemic and how the governments worldwide will continue to respond with varying degrees of restrictions as infections rise. However, in the third quarter we saw signs of improvement in customer trends and as a result, the decline of our service revenue moderated.  In addition, there is clear evidence that as and when the restrictions lift, customers do come back to us with needs from both a physical and digital document storage perspective, and while some elements of our business may have changed forever, our positioning with the communities we serve remains strong. Throughout the pandemic, we have continued to adapt and transform our business model and solutions to changing customer needs due to challenges created by COVID-19. Our customers are evaluating their real estate needs, business processes, and ways to increase digitization in a remote workplace setting. We have been focused on helping them navigate these challenges and have tasked ourselves with accelerating our response to our customers\u2019 needs. One thing is certain - the pandemic has created opportunities for us to help our customers in new and innovative ways.  The fact is we\u2019re a different company than the one most people know. The strategic journey we have been on has driven this change, and to remind folks, our focus remains on three pillars: first, continue growing physical storage revenue through pricing as well as new volume growth achieved from records growth in emerging markets and art and consumer storage in developed markets; second, utilizing our global scale as well as 70 years of customer trust to deliver a differentiated data center offering; and third, new products and services that allow our customers to achieve reliable and secure information management in a more complex regulatory environment and one in which hybrid, physical and digital solutions are the norm. Further expanding on the product and services pillar, most know us for protecting highly regulated records, but over the years our relationships have evolved to help customers manage a broader set of assets and to help them solve a broader range of problems. As customers\u2019 needs evolve, their expectations with us evolve. For this reason, it is important we continue to invest in creating solutions that unlock value for our customers. A great example of this is a solution we just provided for a U.S. credit union who needed a faster, more efficient method for processing their members\u2019 mortgage loans after closing. Their old process was too manual and it could no longer support the volume of work, much less scale to meet the credit union\u2019s 30% year-over-year growth projection, and it didn\u2019t satisfy increased regulations the organization must now meet when selling their loans. We rebuilt the customer\u2019s workflow to better integrate their mix of paper and digital loan materials. This included mailroom services, document scanning, and private vault with fire resistant safeguards in defensible, secure disposition. We also applied machine learning to automate how the credit union accessed data, verified its accuracy, and resolved missing or incorrect items.  With these changes, the credit union can now process post-close mortgage loans much faster, more than doubling their capacity whilst reducing their costs by 25%. This example speaks to what we see as our differentiation and why customers ultimately call us when they need help. For some time, we have talked about our opportunity to enable our customers\u2019 digital transformation journeys. Initially, much of this work was going on behind the scenes, especially as Project Summit got underway, putting in place the systems and structures to support this transformation. The benefits of this work are now becoming more evident with notable improvements to our customer experience at a time when demand for our solution has never been greater. This materialized in the third quarter and high single growth in our digital solutions business.  If you look at our physical storage business, this remains a key foundation for Iron Mountain. Customers have long trusted us to secure their information and their assets that matter most to them. They needed us to serve as their lock, if you will. But over time whilst their needs expanded beyond security and compliance, their jobs grew more complex as they now had to store, use and extract value from growing amounts of information that was in both physical and digital form. They hybrid nature of their data was preventing them from achieving speed, compliance, efficiency, and ultimately growth.  A lock was no longer enough. They now needed a key to solve for this hybrid environment. Uniquely, Iron Mountain offers both the lock and the key that organizations need in order to realize competitive advantage from their paper and digital information.  Plenty of companies offer a secure home for valued assets; plenty offer technology services so customers can better use those assets. But this over-specialization falls short of the needs of most customers. We hear from our customers that they want partners who can help them build singular solutions capable of solving for multiple demands of speed, cost savings, revenue opportunities, and security. This is Iron Mountain\u2019s distinctive position. We serve as the lock and the key.  Now let\u2019s take a closer look at business trends during the third quarter. At a high level, we are pleased with the stabilization and early recovery we\u2019re beginning to see across our service business. Service activity levels have shown a gradual improvement from the second quarter; however, similar to what we discussed last quarter, the shape of the recovery will be dependent on macro factors. The recent increases in COVID-19 cases in many parts of the world has focused states and countries to implement new restrictions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Whilst these factors will make the recovery uneven, our experienced management team is prepared to competently manage the volatility. Turning now to our physical storage business, total organic storage rental revenue growth accelerated modestly from last quarter, up 2.5%. This once again was driven by strong revenue management results as well as growth in our emerging markets and consumer. We continue to be very encouraged with the levels of organic storage revenue growth underscoring the durability of the physical storage business in supporting strong cash generation. Total global organic volume increased 2 million cubic feet sequentially. Contributing to this was a 3 million cubic foot increase in consumer and other and fine art storage, partly offset by a decrease in records management volume.  Looking more specifically at records management organic volume, this was down 1.1 million cubic feet compared to the second quarter. Whilst still in decline, this is a significant improvement from the 3.9 million cubic foot decline last quarter, again reflecting the early signs of recovery. We continue to expect the full year organic volume to be down 1% to 1.5% and up 2.5% in terms of organic revenue based on current visibility. Turning now to our global data center segment, we are very encouraged by another strong quarter of bookings. In Q3, we leased 12.3 megawatts, bringing the year-to-date total to just over 51 megawatts. The strong leasing this year, particularly among smaller deployments, has resulted in an increase in our utilization by more than seven points to nearly 92%. Given the need for additional capacity, we have increased our development pipeline to approximately 50 megawatts, consisting of both greenfield development and further build-out of existing facilities. Moreover, in excess of 50% of our development is preleased, resulting in a strong backlog. Let me now provide a brief update on Project Summit. Our transformation program is progressing well and we are on track to realize our permanent structural cost savings of $375 million per year exiting next year. As you saw in our press release this morning, we now expect to be able to generate greater adjusted EBITDA benefits in 2020 as we have accelerated some initiatives. Most notably, these ongoing initiatives should not only significantly reduce our cost base but also make it easier for our Mountaineers to get work done, enabling them to focus on a more customer-centric approach. Some examples include driving global standardization in IT, replacing cumbersome manual processes with reliable automation, and improving the user experience whilst reducing process cycle time. We are as excited about the systems and process improvements that are Project Summit as we are about the bottom line improvement and believe the end result will be an enhanced value proposition for our customers and communities.  As we shared with you last quarter, we are strongly committed to all of our stakeholders. We are focused on our culture, especially our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities. I would also point out that we are committed at the executive level to continue on our path and accelerate improving our diversity and inclusion. In order to be a sustainable and successful company, we need to attract the best talent to drive maximum creativity through diverse and innovative thinking. I am proud to say we achieved a perfect score of 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation\u2019s 2020 Corporate Equality Index. This recognition reinforces the important work we are doing and supports our goal of building and promoting an inclusive culture that encourages our employees to bring their whole authentic selves into the workplace. As we look at our business going forward, we see opportunities as well as risks, and we are making every effort to ensure we are well placed to maximize the opportunities. We are cautious about our expectation of the pace of market recovery as we progress through 2021. In our own business, as we have shared with you on previous calls, we expect the gradual recovery in our service business to continue as economic activity recovers, leading 2021 to look similar to 2020, just in reverse in terms of quarterly progression. The work we are doing and have done to address the challenges posed by COVID-19 gives us confidence that we will come out of this positioned to consistently deliver long term, sustainable growth. In summary, we are leveraging the opportunity in this rapidly changing environment to reaffirm our commitment tour strategy of growth through increased product offerings in the physical storage area as well as continued rapid growth in our data center and digitization areas. At the same time, we continue to exercise prudent cost control and drive further efficiency across the organizations through our transformation activities. We are proud of the progress we have made towards our transformative shift during this crisis. We are now even more enthusiastic about the speed of our future transformation given the lessons we have learned during the pandemic. I hope you all remain well, and with that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Barry. \nBarry Hytinen: Thanks Bill, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results. We are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance. In a challenging macro environment, our team delivered solid performance across each of our key financial metrics. Revenue of $1.04 billion declined 2.4% on a reported basis year-on-year, which includes a 30 basis point impact from foreign exchange. Total organic revenue declined 3.4%. Organic service revenue declined 13.5%, reflecting the continued COVID impact on our activity levels. While the pace of recovery continues to be dependent on many factors, overall we continue to see service declines moderate, reflecting an improving trajectory since the April-May time frame. For the full quarter, service trends were generally consistent with the July levels we discussed on our last call. Despite the macro headwinds, total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.5% driven by three points of revenue management and data center growth, partially offset by a 30 basis point decline in global organic volume on a trailing 12-month basis. This is a 30 basis point improvement as compared to the second quarter on a trailing 12-month basis.  Adjusted EBITDA was $370 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 30 basis points year-on-year to 35.7%. The improvement reflects progress on our Summit transformation, revenue management, and favorable mix while partially offset by fixed cost deleverage on lower service revenue and higher bonus compensation accrual.  In addition, in the third quarter we incurred incremental cost to keep our team safe, for example specialized cleaning of our facilities as well as purchases of personal protective equipment. We included these expenses in our adjusted EBITDA.  Adjusted EPS was $0.31, down a penny from last year. AFFO declined 5.4% to $213 million. As compared to adjusted EBITDA, the decline in AFFO was primarily driven by timing of cash taxes consistent with our outlook. Turning to segment performance and starting with the global RIM organization, in the third quarter our global RIM business experienced declines in service revenue, albeit at moderating levels compared to earlier in the year. This was partially offset by storage volume growth in our faster growing markets and revenue management, which led to a total organic revenue decline of 3.9%. That together with better than planned Project Summit benefits resulted in adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 110 basis points. In the service business, we experienced year-on-year declines of approximately 31% for new boxes inbounded and 39% for retrievals and re-files. We also continued to see a slowdown on the outgoing side as permanent withdrawals declined 28% and destructions were down 22%. In our shred business, activity declined approximately 17%.  For the third quarter, our average realized paper price was 20% higher than the prior year, which was more than offset by a decline in paper tonnage, leading to a net $3 million reduction in adjusted EBITDA. As we projected on our last call, after the temporary spike in recycled paper prices in April and May, prices have taken a step down and by October, paper prices have now returned to the low levels experienced at the end of 2019. Our consumer storage business has maintained momentum and continues to be a more meaningful contributor to our overall physical storage volume growth. In the third quarter, we continued cost reduction actions, including furloughs and reduced work hours, albeit at much lower levels than earlier in the year. As service revenue expectations improve, we want to ensure we are staffed to the appropriate level so we can always support our customers. As we have discussed before, this does tend to cause incremental cost de-leverage as we bring back employees ahead of demand. We think this is the right investment to service our customers. Turning to global data center, the business delivered organic revenue growth of 12.1% driven by prior period leasing and strong service revenue growth. This was partially offset by moderate churn of 160 basis points, in line with our target of 1% to 2% per quarter. In the fourth quarter, we are expecting slightly elevated levels of churn compared to our normal target range. In the quarter, we booked a non-recurring revenue adjustment of $1.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 45.8% was consistent with our first half trend. As Bill noted, our data center team continued to deliver strong bookings momentum, signing over 12 megawatts of new and expansion leases, bringing year-to-date bookings of 51 megawatts. This commercial success resulted in us exceeding our previous full year target through the first nine months. For the full year, we expect to deliver more than 55 megawatts of new and expansion leasing, representing bookings growth of 45%. Of course, that includes the significant hyperscale lease in Frankfurt, and excluding that we would expect bookings growth of about 23%. This compares to our original guidance of 15 to 20 megawatts, or mid-teens booking growth. We believe we are growing considerably faster than the broader market. Going into next year, we feel good about the state of our pipeline both from a hyperscale perspective as well as our core retail co-location business supporting rich ecosystems across our platform. We believe we can lease in excess of 20 megawatts next year, which would result in mid-teens annual bookings growth. In October, we announced the formation of our joint venture with AGC Equity Partners, a great than \u20ac300 million partnership for our fully preleased data center in Frankfurt. This venture represents an important strategic step towards our goal of identifying alternative sources of capital to fund accelerating growth as we expect proceeds will be redeployed into higher return development opportunities. As we have previously disclosed, the venture will be reflected as an unconsolidated joint venture and therefore will not flow through to revenue and EBITDA.  Turning to Project Summit, in the third quarter we recognized $48 million of restructuring charges as well as an adjusted EBITDA benefit of $48 million. Through the first nine months, we have delivered $113 million of benefit. This is ahead of our prior expectations as we accelerated certain initiatives in 2020 with a particular focus on the highest return activities in response to COVID-19. As Bill referred to, we now expect the program to deliver adjusted EBITDA benefits of $165 million in 2020, approximately $150 million more in 2021, with the full program generating $375 million exiting 2021. In terms of costs related to Project Summit, we now expect to spend closer to $200 million in 2020. We continue to expect the cost to implement the full program to be approximately $450 million. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, we are operating from a position of significant balance sheet strength. In the third quarter, our team did a nice job delivering further cash cycle improvement with solid performance in both payables days and days sales outstanding. On a sequential basis, cash cycle improved by a full day as a result of continued DSO improvement. In August, the team executed another successful bond refinancing, issuing $1.1 billion to redeem our most restrictive outstanding debt and pay down a portion of the outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility. The continued strong support received from the fixed income community provided us the opportunity to upsize our transaction while printing the lowest coupon for 10-year notes in the company\u2019s history. Taken together with our bond offerings in June, we issued $3.5 billion of new debt on a leverage-neutral basis, increased our weighted average maturity by over two years to nearly eight years, while only modestly increasing our weighted average cost of debt. Additionally, these new bonds are more in line with our REIT peers as they include a fixed charge coverage ratio as opposed to a debt to EBITDA covenant. Also, I think it is worth noting that we have eliminated all of our 6.5 times leverage covenant bonds, meaning our most restrictive bond covenant is now 7 times debt to EBITDA.  At quarter end, we had $1.7 billion of liquidity. As a reminder, at the end of the second quarter, we had elevated levels of cash on our balance sheet due to the timing of the payoff of one of our notes from the June bond offering. We paid off the notes in early July, leaving us with a cash balance at September 30 of $152 million. We ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.3 times, which takes into account adjustments as described in our credit facility. Looking ahead, we expect to end the year with leverage of approximately 5.5 times, which would represent an improvement year-on-year as we make progress towards our long term leverage range. With our strong financial position, our board of directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early January. Turning to capital expenditures, our full year expectation is now approximately $450 million, or a decrease of $75 million, reflecting development capital for our Frankfurt data center that will now be a part of our venture with AGC.  Now let me share a few thoughts as to our capital allocation strategy. First, we are committed to our dividend at this sustainable level and over time, we expect to glide into our targeted AFFO payout ratio of mid-60%. Second, we are committed to our target long term leverage range of 4.5 to 5.5 times on a net lease adjusted basis. This year, the team has made good progress toward our target.  As investors know, we have been allocating significant capital to our data center business for several years, and as our pipeline continues to build with high return investment opportunities, our strategic intent is to increase the amount of capital we dedicate to the business. With that, we have considered options to generate incremental funds for investment.  We view capital recycling as a good means to monetize certain assets, particularly industrial real estate to increasingly invest in our development pipeline. Industrial cap rate are at historically low levels, and we have the opportunity to structure long term leases on favorable terms that effectively allow us to have control of the facilities, whether we lease or own. With that, in the third quarter our team accessed the market and monetized two facilities for proceeds of approximately $110 million. This brings our year-to-date proceeds to nearly $120 million, ahead of our full year target of $100 million. With the highly favorable market backdrop together with our development pipeline, we are planning to recycle relatively more going forward, albeit what will amount to a small portion of our total industrial assets. Similarly, we view selling stabilized data center assets into a joint venture as analogous to monetizing industrial real estate assets - it represents another source of capital to redeploy into development projects. The joint venture we just announced in Frankfurt is a good example of this strategy. The JV provides us with an opportunity to boost returns on stabilized assets and provides incremental capital to allocate to projects in the development phase.  Turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year, while we are not issuing official guidance today, I would like to provide an update as to our expectations excluding any material and unforeseen changes With the continued impact of COVID, we are planning for the fourth quarter to be generally in line with the third quarter for revenue and adjusted EBITDA on a dollar basis, therefore for the full year 2020, this would lead to a low single digit revenue decline and flat to slightly positive adjusted EBITDA growth as compared to last year. This outlook includes a full year headwind from foreign exchange rates approaching $60 million for revenue and $20 million for adjusted EBITDA. This outlook reflects our solid year-to-date performance, benefits from revenue management, accelerated Project Summit savings, and incorporates a cautious view for the fourth quarter. Given our favorable results, we now expect AFFO growth to be up low single digits for the full year. Our full year expectations for tax rate and shares outstanding remain unchanged from our prior commentary.  When we look ahead to 2021, as you would expect, until we get COVID-19 behind us, naturally it is difficult to provide guidance, though we are committed to providing the investment community with additional commentary on our trajectory and underlying business trends, just as we\u2019ve been doing throughout this year. While the challenges for our service business persist, we remain confident in its resiliency and the continued durability of our storage business. I am proud of how the team has responded to these challenges and the strong results we have delivered. We look forward to sharing further progress with you on our fourth quarter earnings call. With that, Operator, please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Today\u2019s first question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, thank you very much. I just actually wanted to ask a little bit about the Frankfurt JV. Can you talk a little bit about how much do you cash in, how much debt the entity will incur? Just trying to understand how that was structured and whether that--you know, how well you did on that and is this really the kind of structure we can expect in the future for--you know, kind of build and then maybe sale with a joint venture.\nBarry Hytinen: Sure, hi Shlomo. Good morning and thanks for the question. We really feel very good about the Frankfurt joint venture and what the team has done there with that fully leased up facility. We invested about $100 million at closing essentially with the deal. Over time we\u2019ll cash out nearly all of that, in fact all of it, and nearly of all that at the close. We retained over 20% retained equity interest in the venture. We will earn fees for things like property management, development and construction, and we\u2019ll take those proceeds and redeploy it into development pipeline, which has nice high return opportunities. So essentially, we see it as the opportunity to monetize essentially what is a stabilized asset, boost that return, and then redeploy. You asked about debt - yes, of course the entity would, as you\u2019re expecting, have debt on it. That debt will approximate the incremental development costs, so that might be--over time that could be as much as a couple hundred million euros. We have a very attractive rate on that debt, I might add, and we feel very good about the way the development is proceeding. Bill, anything you\u2019d like to add?\nWilliam Meaney: Yes, I think we\u2019ve talked about it, Shlomo, a few times that we see that as a path that we would like to continue to follow. If you think about you have a fully stabilized data center asset, there is a lot of pension money or funds that manage pension money that are looking for mid-digit returns on an investment basis because it\u2019s a fully stabilized asset with a very long contract, and we were able to find that both on the debt and the equity side, so it just makes sense to take that money and then plow it back into higher return projects.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Nate Crossett at Berenberg. Please go ahead.\nNate Crossett: Hey, good morning guys. Just following up on the JV, I was wondering if this is something that could be opened up to future projects with them, specifically what\u2019s their appetite for further deals and why did you go with them?  My second question is on the organic storage revenue line, growth of 2.5%. How much of that growth can be attributed to data center growth, and then just on price increases, I was wondering if you\u2019re getting any pushback from customers.\nWilliam Meaney: In terms of AGC, they do have an appetite for these things, and in fact they have a similar structure with a different customer in the United States, and we ran a process so I would expect that they would be interested in any further processes that we run down the path. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised at all for us--to see us do other things with AGC, but it will depend on the location and the opportunity. I think in terms of your question on storage revenue growth, is that it was about 1.7% if you just look at the physical storage and took out the data center, so it goes from 2.5 to 1.7, but still strong positive growth based on some of the success that we\u2019ve been having on the back of consumer, so really pleased both in terms of record management did better this quarter and also consumer is really starting to show that it\u2019s starting to hit a groove. That being said, we do expect--you know, the quarters are going to kind of go backwards and forwards a little bit because consumer is a seasonal business, but we think the trajectory is moving in the right direction for both businesses.  On the pricing side, you can see actually that we are continuing to get roughly the three points of price that Barry highlighted. We don\u2019t see any slowdown in that at all, and we have more to get in the emerging markets, which are relatively new to the game in terms of our revenue management processes, so good response from the customers. We\u2019re still considered very much an essential business or essential service to our customers, so it\u2019s a great position to be in.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nKevin McVeigh: Great, thank you. Not to put another question on the data center, but from an accounting perspective, will you recognize that as kind of the revenue--is that below the line or will it be reflected in the revenue and EBITDA, or is that below the line based on just the equity JV?\nBarry Hytinen: Good morning, this is Barry. Thanks for the question.  Yes, the JV will be an unconsolidated joint venture, and so the revenue and EBITDA will not be benefited from it, and you\u2019d see it below the line, to your question. You will see a smaller amount for the management type fees that I mentioned that would flow through revenue and therefore EBITDA - that\u2019s for things like property management, construction development. I think that answers your question, thanks.\nOperator: The next question today comes from Sheila McGrath at Evercore. Please go ahead.\nSheila McGrath: Yes, good morning. You mentioned capital recycling as a source of capital. I was wondering if you could give us more detail - do you mean selling industrial facilities outright and relocating your boxes or are you doing sale-leaseback, and what are your capital allocation priorities for that capital besides data centers?\nBarry Hytinen: Hi Sheila, this is Barry. Thanks for the question.  For the most part, you\u2019d be thinking about sales-leasebacks in terms of what we\u2019re talking about. The couple of opportunities we monetized in the most recent quarter were also sale-leasebacks. Frankly, we\u2019re seeing very, very strong performance from the team as it relates to cap rates in light of where the market is - think something like sub-5, even 4. Then with relatively long term leases together with options to further renew, we have the ability to effectively control those facilities, we feel like whether we lease or own them.  We feel good about that monetization strategy, and then in terms of priorities, it really is into higher return IRR projects that are in the development pipeline. As you know, and you know the business really well, that\u2019s focused principally on data center but not exclusively there, and so you should expect us to continue to recycle and likely step up that activity some going forward.\nSheila McGrath: Thank you.\nBarry Hytinen: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Michael Funk with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael Funk: Yes, thanks and good morning, and thank you for the questions. A couple, if I could. Going back to the digital transformation that you were talking about, working with customers there, can you help us think about comparing the revenue contribution from a customer transitioning to more of a digital solution versus a physical solution, and then where you see the growth opportunity there as well?\nWilliam Meaney: Thanks Michael. I think first of all, it\u2019s that it\u2019s incremental, it\u2019s on top, so we don\u2019t see a lot of people saying, we\u2019re going to go digital and then stop physical. There\u2019s a few cases of that, but usually people want to keep their physical records as well for proof, but where we see the digital transformation is really around the use. So if you think, a couple of examples--or either that, use and/or further downstream processing.  So the example I gave on the call about the mortgage processing is really about downstream processing, but we also have--and we talked about that, I think, a little bit on previous calls when we changed our service level agreements and really made a push on image on demand, we\u2019ve seen one customer, for instance, in the U.K. that has fully embraced that, so they only take their retrievals now through image on demand. Any time they need a retrieval, we image it and we load it up onto the system, and they access it that way, which we--which for us, longer term, it\u2019s a higher margin business for us than having vans on the road, and honestly environmentally it\u2019s better. So really, kind of two bits. One is we\u2019re getting into more processes, quite frankly, where we weren\u2019t exposed before, so we\u2019re helping them with the downstream processes, and then the other case is people are taking advantage of our image on demand, which for us is a more efficient way to get them the information back.\nOperator: Thank you, and our next question today comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to dive deeper into service activity trends during and exiting the quarter. Can you provide the rate of year-over-year decline in service activity by month during 3Q and how the declines looked in October?\nBarry Hytinen: Sure George - hi, this is Barry. Thanks for the question.  For the--if you recall in July, we mentioned that total service activities were down kind of mid to high 20s for the quarter. If you look at new boxes inbounded, they average about 31%. October is slightly below that level and September was, as you might expect, the best performance of the quarter in light of trajectory we\u2019ve been mentioning, and that really is the case for all of the other service activities - they\u2019re generally following the same trajectory.  I would say that we look at--going forward, we\u2019d use the September-October levels as being indicative of what we\u2019re expecting, and that\u2019s embedded in the forward outlook that we mentioned as it relates to third quarter and fourth quarter looking sort of similar in terms of revenue and EBITDA.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nEric Luebchow: Great, two questions, if I could. The first one on the data center business, wondering if you could let us know of what your leasing this quarter--the split was between more hyperscale logos versus enterprise. Typically hyperscale is lower return, so could you update us on whether your approach has changed at all, whether you\u2019re actively looking for more hyperscale business or if that\u2019s just more reflective of the market this year, and then what the targeted deals you\u2019re looking at are in the data center business and how that breaks out between those two customer segments. Then Barry, just quickly on the guidance, I know you said flat revenue and EBITDA for Q4. I\u2019m wondering if that implies--how you split that out between service and storage, should we expect service to maybe be flat to slightly down and storage up, or if there\u2019s anything to call out in Q4. Thank you.\nWilliam Meaney: Thanks Eric for the question.  I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re going more for hyperscale than we\u2019ve always espoused. I think we\u2019ve always said for large campuses, we\u2019d expect somewhere between 40% and 60% of the campus to be hyperscale and the rest to be co-lo or retail, but this year it may be a little bit more noticeable because the gestation period in terms of that marketing takes a while. Our relationship as we went into data centers for sure was stronger on the enterprise side, setting up project cloud for large enterprise customers than it was on the hyperscale, so this year we\u2019re actually really pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made in terms of building our reputation and exposure with the hyperscale. If you look at year to date, we\u2019re about 50/50, so about 50% of that 51 megawatts that we\u2019ve signed up here to date is hyperscale, including obviously the Frankfurt site, and about 50% is retail, so we\u2019re really happy with the mix. But for sure you\u2019re right, is that the cash and cash returns on hyperscale deployments are lower, but they\u2019re longer term contracts and it allows you to build out the facilities or the campuses faster, so it still is the right mix, we think in terms of maximizing returns.\nBarry Hytinen: Eric, it\u2019s Barry. Thanks for the question. As it relates to fourth quarter, I would say that we\u2019re working with a modeling of service revenue decline being similar in nature Q3-Q4 versus prior year, and that\u2019s what\u2019s essentially embedded in that outlook. That should work through--you\u2019ll be able to work through the storage number. I would note that that\u2019s aligned with my answer to George earlier about where we see activity levels as being fairly consistent to slightly better. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, as a reminder, if you\u2019d like to ask a question, please press star then one. Today\u2019s next question is a follow-up from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, thank you very much. Can you just comment a little bit about the step-up in fine arts volume? It\u2019s something that we really haven\u2019t seen for a while, and I\u2019m wondering what\u2019s driving that.\nBarry Hytinen: Thanks Shlomo. It\u2019s actually in our entertainment services, and the real improvement in physical I think, beyond a sustainable basis, is on the consumer side, so that was more of a true-up in terms of some private vaults that we had with our entertainment services. If you look overall, if you think about the overall record management down about 1.1 million cubic feet, consumer was up 2.5, and then I would say it was kind of a one-off true-up of a little over half a million cubes with entertainment services.\nOperator: Thank you.

            "content": "Thanks Bill, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results. We are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance. In a challenging macro environment, our team delivered solid performance across each of our key financial metrics. Revenue of $1.04 billion declined 2.4% on a reported basis year-on-year, which includes a 30 basis point impact from foreign exchange. Total organic revenue declined 3.4%. Organic service revenue declined 13.5%, reflecting the continued COVID impact on our activity levels. While the pace of recovery continues to be dependent on many factors, overall we continue to see service declines moderate, reflecting an improving trajectory since the April-May time frame. For the full quarter, service trends were generally consistent with the July levels we discussed on our last call. Despite the macro headwinds, total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.5% driven by three points of revenue management and data center growth, partially offset by a 30 basis point decline in global organic volume on a trailing 12-month basis. This is a 30 basis point improvement as compared to the second quarter on a trailing 12-month basis.  Adjusted EBITDA was $370 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 30 basis points year-on-year to 35.7%. The improvement reflects progress on our Summit transformation, revenue management, and favorable mix while partially offset by fixed cost deleverage on lower service revenue and higher bonus compensation accrual.  In addition, in the third quarter we incurred incremental cost to keep our team safe, for example specialized cleaning of our facilities as well as purchases of personal protective equipment. We included these expenses in our adjusted EBITDA.  Adjusted EPS was $0.31, down a penny from last year. AFFO declined 5.4% to $213 million. As compared to adjusted EBITDA, the decline in AFFO was primarily driven by timing of cash taxes consistent with our outlook. Turning to segment performance and starting with the global RIM organization, in the third quarter our global RIM business experienced declines in service revenue, albeit at moderating levels compared to earlier in the year. This was partially offset by storage volume growth in our faster growing markets and revenue management, which led to a total organic revenue decline of 3.9%. That together with better than planned Project Summit benefits resulted in adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 110 basis points. In the service business, we experienced year-on-year declines of approximately 31% for new boxes inbounded and 39% for retrievals and re-files. We also continued to see a slowdown on the outgoing side as permanent withdrawals declined 28% and destructions were down 22%. In our shred business, activity declined approximately 17%.  For the third quarter, our average realized paper price was 20% higher than the prior year, which was more than offset by a decline in paper tonnage, leading to a net $3 million reduction in adjusted EBITDA. As we projected on our last call, after the temporary spike in recycled paper prices in April and May, prices have taken a step down and by October, paper prices have now returned to the low levels experienced at the end of 2019. Our consumer storage business has maintained momentum and continues to be a more meaningful contributor to our overall physical storage volume growth. In the third quarter, we continued cost reduction actions, including furloughs and reduced work hours, albeit at much lower levels than earlier in the year. As service revenue expectations improve, we want to ensure we are staffed to the appropriate level so we can always support our customers. As we have discussed before, this does tend to cause incremental cost de-leverage as we bring back employees ahead of demand. We think this is the right investment to service our customers. Turning to global data center, the business delivered organic revenue growth of 12.1% driven by prior period leasing and strong service revenue growth. This was partially offset by moderate churn of 160 basis points, in line with our target of 1% to 2% per quarter. In the fourth quarter, we are expecting slightly elevated levels of churn compared to our normal target range. In the quarter, we booked a non-recurring revenue adjustment of $1.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 45.8% was consistent with our first half trend. As Bill noted, our data center team continued to deliver strong bookings momentum, signing over 12 megawatts of new and expansion leases, bringing year-to-date bookings of 51 megawatts. This commercial success resulted in us exceeding our previous full year target through the first nine months. For the full year, we expect to deliver more than 55 megawatts of new and expansion leasing, representing bookings growth of 45%. Of course, that includes the significant hyperscale lease in Frankfurt, and excluding that we would expect bookings growth of about 23%. This compares to our original guidance of 15 to 20 megawatts, or mid-teens booking growth. We believe we are growing considerably faster than the broader market. Going into next year, we feel good about the state of our pipeline both from a hyperscale perspective as well as our core retail co-location business supporting rich ecosystems across our platform. We believe we can lease in excess of 20 megawatts next year, which would result in mid-teens annual bookings growth. In October, we announced the formation of our joint venture with AGC Equity Partners, a great than \u20ac300 million partnership for our fully preleased data center in Frankfurt. This venture represents an important strategic step towards our goal of identifying alternative sources of capital to fund accelerating growth as we expect proceeds will be redeployed into higher return development opportunities. As we have previously disclosed, the venture will be reflected as an unconsolidated joint venture and therefore will not flow through to revenue and EBITDA.  Turning to Project Summit, in the third quarter we recognized $48 million of restructuring charges as well as an adjusted EBITDA benefit of $48 million. Through the first nine months, we have delivered $113 million of benefit. This is ahead of our prior expectations as we accelerated certain initiatives in 2020 with a particular focus on the highest return activities in response to COVID-19. As Bill referred to, we now expect the program to deliver adjusted EBITDA benefits of $165 million in 2020, approximately $150 million more in 2021, with the full program generating $375 million exiting 2021. In terms of costs related to Project Summit, we now expect to spend closer to $200 million in 2020. We continue to expect the cost to implement the full program to be approximately $450 million. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, we are operating from a position of significant balance sheet strength. In the third quarter, our team did a nice job delivering further cash cycle improvement with solid performance in both payables days and days sales outstanding. On a sequential basis, cash cycle improved by a full day as a result of continued DSO improvement. In August, the team executed another successful bond refinancing, issuing $1.1 billion to redeem our most restrictive outstanding debt and pay down a portion of the outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility. The continued strong support received from the fixed income community provided us the opportunity to upsize our transaction while printing the lowest coupon for 10-year notes in the company's history. Taken together with our bond offerings in June, we issued $3.5 billion of new debt on a leverage-neutral basis, increased our weighted average maturity by over two years to nearly eight years, while only modestly increasing our weighted average cost of debt. Additionally, these new bonds are more in line with our REIT peers as they include a fixed charge coverage ratio as opposed to a debt to EBITDA covenant. Also, I think it is worth noting that we have eliminated all of our 6.5 times leverage covenant bonds, meaning our most restrictive bond covenant is now 7 times debt to EBITDA.  At quarter end, we had $1.7 billion of liquidity. As a reminder, at the end of the second quarter, we had elevated levels of cash on our balance sheet due to the timing of the payoff of one of our notes from the June bond offering. We paid off the notes in early July, leaving us with a cash balance at September 30 of $152 million. We ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.3 times, which takes into account adjustments as described in our credit facility. Looking ahead, we expect to end the year with leverage of approximately 5.5 times, which would represent an improvement year-on-year as we make progress towards our long term leverage range. With our strong financial position, our board of directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early January. Turning to capital expenditures, our full year expectation is now approximately $450 million, or a decrease of $75 million, reflecting development capital for our Frankfurt data center that will now be a part of our venture with AGC.  Now let me share a few thoughts as to our capital allocation strategy. First, we are committed to our dividend at this sustainable level and over time, we expect to glide into our targeted AFFO payout ratio of mid-60%. Second, we are committed to our target long term leverage range of 4.5 to 5.5 times on a net lease adjusted basis. This year, the team has made good progress toward our target.  As investors know, we have been allocating significant capital to our data center business for several years, and as our pipeline continues to build with high return investment opportunities, our strategic intent is to increase the amount of capital we dedicate to the business. With that, we have considered options to generate incremental funds for investment.  We view capital recycling as a good means to monetize certain assets, particularly industrial real estate to increasingly invest in our development pipeline. Industrial cap rate are at historically low levels, and we have the opportunity to structure long term leases on favorable terms that effectively allow us to have control of the facilities, whether we lease or own. With that, in the third quarter our team accessed the market and monetized two facilities for proceeds of approximately $110 million. This brings our year-to-date proceeds to nearly $120 million, ahead of our full year target of $100 million. With the highly favorable market backdrop together with our development pipeline, we are planning to recycle relatively more going forward, albeit what will amount to a small portion of our total industrial assets. Similarly, we view selling stabilized data center assets into a joint venture as analogous to monetizing industrial real estate assets - it represents another source of capital to redeploy into development projects. The joint venture we just announced in Frankfurt is a good example of this strategy. The JV provides us with an opportunity to boost returns on stabilized assets and provides incremental capital to allocate to projects in the development phase.  Turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year, while we are not issuing official guidance today, I would like to provide an update as to our expectations excluding any material and unforeseen changes With the continued impact of COVID, we are planning for the fourth quarter to be generally in line with the third quarter for revenue and adjusted EBITDA on a dollar basis, therefore for the full year 2020, this would lead to a low single digit revenue decline and flat to slightly positive adjusted EBITDA growth as compared to last year. This outlook includes a full year headwind from foreign exchange rates approaching $60 million for revenue and $20 million for adjusted EBITDA. This outlook reflects our solid year-to-date performance, benefits from revenue management, accelerated Project Summit savings, and incorporates a cautious view for the fourth quarter. Given our favorable results, we now expect AFFO growth to be up low single digits for the full year. Our full year expectations for tax rate and shares outstanding remain unchanged from our prior commentary.  When we look ahead to 2021, as you would expect, until we get COVID-19 behind us, naturally it is difficult to provide guidance, though we are committed to providing the investment community with additional commentary on our trajectory and underlying business trends, just as we've been doing throughout this year. While the challenges for our service business persist, we remain confident in its resiliency and the continued durability of our storage business. I am proud of how the team has responded to these challenges and the strong results we have delivered. We look forward to sharing further progress with you on our fourth quarter earnings call. With that, Operator, please open the line for Q&A. Sure, hi Shlomo. Good morning and thanks for the question. We really feel very good about the Frankfurt joint venture and what the team has done there with that fully leased up facility. We invested about $100 million at closing essentially with the deal. Over time we'll cash out nearly all of that, in fact all of it, and nearly of all that at the close. We retained over 20% retained equity interest in the venture. We will earn fees for things like property management, development and construction, and we'll take those proceeds and redeploy it into development pipeline, which has nice high return opportunities. So essentially, we see it as the opportunity to monetize essentially what is a stabilized asset, boost that return, and then redeploy. You asked about debt - yes, of course the entity would, as you're expecting, have debt on it. That debt will approximate the incremental development costs, so that might be--over time that could be as much as a couple hundred million euros. We have a very attractive rate on that debt, I might add, and we feel very good about the way the development is proceeding. Bill, anything you'd like to add? Good morning, this is Barry. Thanks for the question.  Yes, the JV will be an unconsolidated joint venture, and so the revenue and EBITDA will not be benefited from it, and you'd see it below the line, to your question. You will see a smaller amount for the management type fees that I mentioned that would flow through revenue and therefore EBITDA - that's for things like property management, construction development. I think that answers your question, thanks. Hi Sheila, this is Barry. Thanks for the question.  For the most part, you'd be thinking about sales-leasebacks in terms of what we're talking about. The couple of opportunities we monetized in the most recent quarter were also sale-leasebacks. Frankly, we're seeing very, very strong performance from the team as it relates to cap rates in light of where the market is - think something like sub-5, even 4. Then with relatively long term leases together with options to further renew, we have the ability to effectively control those facilities, we feel like whether we lease or own them.  We feel good about that monetization strategy, and then in terms of priorities, it really is into higher return IRR projects that are in the development pipeline. As you know, and you know the business really well, that's focused principally on data center but not exclusively there, and so you should expect us to continue to recycle and likely step up that activity some going forward. You're welcome. Sure George - hi, this is Barry. Thanks for the question.  For the--if you recall in July, we mentioned that total service activities were down kind of mid to high 20s for the quarter. If you look at new boxes inbounded, they average about 31%. October is slightly below that level and September was, as you might expect, the best performance of the quarter in light of trajectory we've been mentioning, and that really is the case for all of the other service activities - they're generally following the same trajectory.  I would say that we look at--going forward, we'd use the September-October levels as being indicative of what we're expecting, and that's embedded in the forward outlook that we mentioned as it relates to third quarter and fourth quarter looking sort of similar in terms of revenue and EBITDA. Eric, it's Barry. Thanks for the question. As it relates to fourth quarter, I would say that we're working with a modeling of service revenue decline being similar in nature Q3-Q4 versus prior year, and that's what's essentially embedded in that outlook. That should work through--you'll be able to work through the storage number. I would note that that's aligned with my answer to George earlier about where we see activity levels as being fairly consistent to slightly better. Thanks for the question. Thanks Shlomo. It's actually in our entertainment services, and the real improvement in physical I think, beyond a sustainable basis, is on the consumer side, so that was more of a true-up in terms of some private vaults that we had with our entertainment services. If you look overall, if you think about the overall record management down about 1.1 million cubic feet, consumer was up 2.5, and then I would say it was kind of a one-off true-up of a little over half a million cubes with entertainment services."

            "name": "William Meaney",
            "content": "Thank you Greer, and thank you all for taking the time to join us. Let me start by saying I hope you and your families are safe and well. The third quarter provided us with a great opportunity to demonstrate the significance of the measures we have taken over the last few months in response to the pandemic and set a marker for outperformance through top line resilience in our physical storage and growing data center businesses, adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, and by maintaining our strong cash generation track record all while continuing our investment in innovation and new product development. I would like to thank all of our Mountaineers for this remarkable performance and for their steadfast focus on safety and execution.  Despite lingering uncertainty related to the global COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen improvements, albeit gradual, in key U.S. and international markets as it relates to our service activity levels while showing continued strong performance in both our physical storage business and our global data center business. I continue to be inspired by the tireless efforts of our teams as they support and care for our customers, each other, and our communities whilst accelerating progress on our strategic priorities. From the start, we set our priorities to deal with the situation clearly and take care of the health and safety of our people and work hard to honor the commitments we have made to our customers. In April, we had up to one-third of our workforce out on furlough or other temporary leave. I'm happy to report that we have brought a significant number of these Mountaineers back to work to serve our customers and we now have over 90% of our employees working regularly. Whilst this has been a very difficult time, we have proven to be very resilient. We are financially healthy with strong and reliable cash flow driven in part by our brand and customer loyalty. This was evident in how we've managed the heightened uncertainty of the past eight months.  We quickly aligned on the right mix of priorities to maintain strong near term momentum whilst continuing our investments in innovation and new products as we execute our plan for long term value creation. This combined with the benefits from Project Summit has allowed us to continue to invest in transforming and modernizing our company. As demonstrated by our year-on-year constant currency year-to-date adjusted EBITDA in storage revenue growth, we can already see the evidence supporting our belief that we will emerge from this pandemic as a stronger company on all dimensions.  Clearly, there are still many uncertainties around COVID in terms of the development of the pandemic and how the governments worldwide will continue to respond with varying degrees of restrictions as infections rise. However, in the third quarter we saw signs of improvement in customer trends and as a result, the decline of our service revenue moderated.  In addition, there is clear evidence that as and when the restrictions lift, customers do come back to us with needs from both a physical and digital document storage perspective, and while some elements of our business may have changed forever, our positioning with the communities we serve remains strong. Throughout the pandemic, we have continued to adapt and transform our business model and solutions to changing customer needs due to challenges created by COVID-19. Our customers are evaluating their real estate needs, business processes, and ways to increase digitization in a remote workplace setting. We have been focused on helping them navigate these challenges and have tasked ourselves with accelerating our response to our customers' needs. One thing is certain - the pandemic has created opportunities for us to help our customers in new and innovative ways.  The fact is we're a different company than the one most people know. The strategic journey we have been on has driven this change, and to remind folks, our focus remains on three pillars: first, continue growing physical storage revenue through pricing as well as new volume growth achieved from records growth in emerging markets and art and consumer storage in developed markets; second, utilizing our global scale as well as 70 years of customer trust to deliver a differentiated data center offering; and third, new products and services that allow our customers to achieve reliable and secure information management in a more complex regulatory environment and one in which hybrid, physical and digital solutions are the norm. Further expanding on the product and services pillar, most know us for protecting highly regulated records, but over the years our relationships have evolved to help customers manage a broader set of assets and to help them solve a broader range of problems. As customers' needs evolve, their expectations with us evolve. For this reason, it is important we continue to invest in creating solutions that unlock value for our customers. A great example of this is a solution we just provided for a U.S. credit union who needed a faster, more efficient method for processing their members' mortgage loans after closing. Their old process was too manual and it could no longer support the volume of work, much less scale to meet the credit union's 30% year-over-year growth projection, and it didn't satisfy increased regulations the organization must now meet when selling their loans. We rebuilt the customer's workflow to better integrate their mix of paper and digital loan materials. This included mailroom services, document scanning, and private vault with fire resistant safeguards in defensible, secure disposition. We also applied machine learning to automate how the credit union accessed data, verified its accuracy, and resolved missing or incorrect items.  With these changes, the credit union can now process post-close mortgage loans much faster, more than doubling their capacity whilst reducing their costs by 25%. This example speaks to what we see as our differentiation and why customers ultimately call us when they need help. For some time, we have talked about our opportunity to enable our customers' digital transformation journeys. Initially, much of this work was going on behind the scenes, especially as Project Summit got underway, putting in place the systems and structures to support this transformation. The benefits of this work are now becoming more evident with notable improvements to our customer experience at a time when demand for our solution has never been greater. This materialized in the third quarter and high single growth in our digital solutions business.  If you look at our physical storage business, this remains a key foundation for Iron Mountain. Customers have long trusted us to secure their information and their assets that matter most to them. They needed us to serve as their lock, if you will. But over time whilst their needs expanded beyond security and compliance, their jobs grew more complex as they now had to store, use and extract value from growing amounts of information that was in both physical and digital form. They hybrid nature of their data was preventing them from achieving speed, compliance, efficiency, and ultimately growth.  A lock was no longer enough. They now needed a key to solve for this hybrid environment. Uniquely, Iron Mountain offers both the lock and the key that organizations need in order to realize competitive advantage from their paper and digital information.  Plenty of companies offer a secure home for valued assets; plenty offer technology services so customers can better use those assets. But this over-specialization falls short of the needs of most customers. We hear from our customers that they want partners who can help them build singular solutions capable of solving for multiple demands of speed, cost savings, revenue opportunities, and security. This is Iron Mountain's distinctive position. We serve as the lock and the key.  Now let's take a closer look at business trends during the third quarter. At a high level, we are pleased with the stabilization and early recovery we're beginning to see across our service business. Service activity levels have shown a gradual improvement from the second quarter; however, similar to what we discussed last quarter, the shape of the recovery will be dependent on macro factors. The recent increases in COVID-19 cases in many parts of the world has focused states and countries to implement new restrictions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Whilst these factors will make the recovery uneven, our experienced management team is prepared to competently manage the volatility. Turning now to our physical storage business, total organic storage rental revenue growth accelerated modestly from last quarter, up 2.5%. This once again was driven by strong revenue management results as well as growth in our emerging markets and consumer. We continue to be very encouraged with the levels of organic storage revenue growth underscoring the durability of the physical storage business in supporting strong cash generation. Total global organic volume increased 2 million cubic feet sequentially. Contributing to this was a 3 million cubic foot increase in consumer and other and fine art storage, partly offset by a decrease in records management volume.  Looking more specifically at records management organic volume, this was down 1.1 million cubic feet compared to the second quarter. Whilst still in decline, this is a significant improvement from the 3.9 million cubic foot decline last quarter, again reflecting the early signs of recovery. We continue to expect the full year organic volume to be down 1% to 1.5% and up 2.5% in terms of organic revenue based on current visibility. Turning now to our global data center segment, we are very encouraged by another strong quarter of bookings. In Q3, we leased 12.3 megawatts, bringing the year-to-date total to just over 51 megawatts. The strong leasing this year, particularly among smaller deployments, has resulted in an increase in our utilization by more than seven points to nearly 92%. Given the need for additional capacity, we have increased our development pipeline to approximately 50 megawatts, consisting of both greenfield development and further build-out of existing facilities. Moreover, in excess of 50% of our development is preleased, resulting in a strong backlog. Let me now provide a brief update on Project Summit. Our transformation program is progressing well and we are on track to realize our permanent structural cost savings of $375 million per year exiting next year. As you saw in our press release this morning, we now expect to be able to generate greater adjusted EBITDA benefits in 2020 as we have accelerated some initiatives. Most notably, these ongoing initiatives should not only significantly reduce our cost base but also make it easier for our Mountaineers to get work done, enabling them to focus on a more customer-centric approach. Some examples include driving global standardization in IT, replacing cumbersome manual processes with reliable automation, and improving the user experience whilst reducing process cycle time. We are as excited about the systems and process improvements that are Project Summit as we are about the bottom line improvement and believe the end result will be an enhanced value proposition for our customers and communities.  As we shared with you last quarter, we are strongly committed to all of our stakeholders. We are focused on our culture, especially our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities. I would also point out that we are committed at the executive level to continue on our path and accelerate improving our diversity and inclusion. In order to be a sustainable and successful company, we need to attract the best talent to drive maximum creativity through diverse and innovative thinking. I am proud to say we achieved a perfect score of 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2020 Corporate Equality Index. This recognition reinforces the important work we are doing and supports our goal of building and promoting an inclusive culture that encourages our employees to bring their whole authentic selves into the workplace. As we look at our business going forward, we see opportunities as well as risks, and we are making every effort to ensure we are well placed to maximize the opportunities. We are cautious about our expectation of the pace of market recovery as we progress through 2021. In our own business, as we have shared with you on previous calls, we expect the gradual recovery in our service business to continue as economic activity recovers, leading 2021 to look similar to 2020, just in reverse in terms of quarterly progression. The work we are doing and have done to address the challenges posed by COVID-19 gives us confidence that we will come out of this positioned to consistently deliver long term, sustainable growth. In summary, we are leveraging the opportunity in this rapidly changing environment to reaffirm our commitment tour strategy of growth through increased product offerings in the physical storage area as well as continued rapid growth in our data center and digitization areas. At the same time, we continue to exercise prudent cost control and drive further efficiency across the organizations through our transformation activities. We are proud of the progress we have made towards our transformative shift during this crisis. We are now even more enthusiastic about the speed of our future transformation given the lessons we have learned during the pandemic. I hope you all remain well, and with that I'll turn the call over to Barry. Yes, I think we've talked about it, Shlomo, a few times that we see that as a path that we would like to continue to follow. If you think about you have a fully stabilized data center asset, there is a lot of pension money or funds that manage pension money that are looking for mid-digit returns on an investment basis because it's a fully stabilized asset with a very long contract, and we were able to find that both on the debt and the equity side, so it just makes sense to take that money and then plow it back into higher return projects. In terms of AGC, they do have an appetite for these things, and in fact they have a similar structure with a different customer in the United States, and we ran a process so I would expect that they would be interested in any further processes that we run down the path. I wouldn't be surprised at all for us--to see us do other things with AGC, but it will depend on the location and the opportunity. I think in terms of your question on storage revenue growth, is that it was about 1.7% if you just look at the physical storage and took out the data center, so it goes from 2.5 to 1.7, but still strong positive growth based on some of the success that we've been having on the back of consumer, so really pleased both in terms of record management did better this quarter and also consumer is really starting to show that it's starting to hit a groove. That being said, we do expect--you know, the quarters are going to kind of go backwards and forwards a little bit because consumer is a seasonal business, but we think the trajectory is moving in the right direction for both businesses.  On the pricing side, you can see actually that we are continuing to get roughly the three points of price that Barry highlighted. We don't see any slowdown in that at all, and we have more to get in the emerging markets, which are relatively new to the game in terms of our revenue management processes, so good response from the customers. We're still considered very much an essential business or essential service to our customers, so it's a great position to be in. Thanks Michael. I think first of all, it's that it's incremental, it's on top, so we don't see a lot of people saying, we're going to go digital and then stop physical. There's a few cases of that, but usually people want to keep their physical records as well for proof, but where we see the digital transformation is really around the use. So if you think, a couple of examples--or either that, use and/or further downstream processing.  So the example I gave on the call about the mortgage processing is really about downstream processing, but we also have--and we talked about that, I think, a little bit on previous calls when we changed our service level agreements and really made a push on image on demand, we've seen one customer, for instance, in the U.K. that has fully embraced that, so they only take their retrievals now through image on demand. Any time they need a retrieval, we image it and we load it up onto the system, and they access it that way, which we--which for us, longer term, it's a higher margin business for us than having vans on the road, and honestly environmentally it's better. So really, kind of two bits. One is we're getting into more processes, quite frankly, where we weren't exposed before, so we're helping them with the downstream processes, and then the other case is people are taking advantage of our image on demand, which for us is a more efficient way to get them the information back. Thanks Eric for the question.  I wouldn't say that we're going more for hyperscale than we've always espoused. I think we've always said for large campuses, we'd expect somewhere between 40% and 60% of the campus to be hyperscale and the rest to be co-lo or retail, but this year it may be a little bit more noticeable because the gestation period in terms of that marketing takes a while. Our relationship as we went into data centers for sure was stronger on the enterprise side, setting up project cloud for large enterprise customers than it was on the hyperscale, so this year we're actually really pleased with the progress we've made in terms of building our reputation and exposure with the hyperscale. If you look at year to date, we're about 50/50, so about 50% of that 51 megawatts that we've signed up here to date is hyperscale, including obviously the Frankfurt site, and about 50% is retail, so we're really happy with the mix. But for sure you're right, is that the cash and cash returns on hyperscale deployments are lower, but they're longer term contracts and it allows you to build out the facilities or the campuses faster, so it still is the right mix, we think in terms of maximizing returns."

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Greer Aviv, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nGreer Aviv: Thank you, Rocco. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. We have provided the user-controlled slides on our Investor Relations website. We will also be providing a link to today\u2019s webcast and earnings materials. We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and CEO; and Barry Hytinen, our EVP and CFO. Today, we plan to share a number of key messages to help you better understand our performance, including how we are successfully navigating the COVID-19 environment, how we have continued to see durability in our core Storage business, how we have continued to see strength in our Data Center business, how we are progressing on our Transformation Program with Project Summit, and how we as an organization are reflecting and acting on the recent events, highlighting continued social injustice with regards diversity broadly and of black population specifically. After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open up the lines for Q&A. Today\u2019s earnings materials will contain forward-looking statements. We have noted the impacts of COVID-19 and our expectations of how that may impact our operations and financial performance in 2020. We have also noted our expectations for Project Summit. As you know, all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today\u2019s earnings materials, the Safe Harbor language on the Slide 2 and our annual report on Form 10-K and other periodic SEC filings for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliations to these measures as required by Reg-G in our supplemental financial information. With that, Bill, would you please begin?\nWilliam Meaney: Thank you, Greer, and thank you all for taking time to join us. Let me start by saying I hope you\u2019re all continued to stay safe and healthy in these trying times. Before we get into a discussion of our second quarter performance, I\u2019d like to take some time to touch on 2 topics that are top of mind for many of us in the current environment. First, the killings of George Floyd and countless others have left me and my colleagues upset, angered and heartbroken. I want to reiterate that racism, discrimination and hate have no place at Iron Mountain. Our commitment and stated as one of our core 5 values for many years, to equality, inclusivity and diversity is part of our belief that our people are our greatest assets. Given this fact, we must continually attract, listen to and develop a broad talent pool reflecting our global demographics in order to deliver to our customers and protect our future. These tragic events have sparked difficult but important self-reflection in conversations within our organization about how well we are living up to our stated value and to commit ourselves to do much better. It is up to us to work together, educate ourselves and encourage open dialogue to promote proactive measures to help eliminate incorrect biases and spread awareness, not just because it is the right thing to do, but also because we will only be successful in serving our customers if we attract and retain the best talent. Having the best talent can only happen if we are recruiting and developing people from diverse backgrounds across the broader demographics we operate in. We remain strongly committed toward taking decisive and strategic action to create a truly inclusive Iron Mountain. We\u2019re committed to listening, learning and taking the necessary actions to support long-term positive change for the black community specifically, and people from all backgrounds in general. Whilst we cannot change the past, we have an opportunity as an organization and as individuals to positively impact the future and help fix the racial inequality prevalent in our society. Now, I\u2019d like to update you on the impact we are seeing with respect to COVID-19. As you all know, the virus is unfortunately still spreading across the globe. My thoughts and prayers go out to all those who have been affected by the virus, including those who have fallen ill as well as their loved ones and their caregivers. As always, our top priority remains the health and safety of our Mountaineers, their families and our customers. I want to acknowledge and thank the mighty Mountaineers around the world, who despite extraordinary challenges have kept their focus on ensuring that Iron Mountain continues to move forward during these uncertain times, and doing so with a view towards safety. This is all [brought home] [ph] to me again last week, during a visit I made to Northern New Jersey, so I could thank our frontline teams personally. One of our couriers relayed how he has been serving a large metro New York health system every day through the crisis and how thankful the customer is for our continued service. This particular customer went so far to send one of their doctors to our facility to assist in the protocols and training to protect our staff. For me, this is what it means to be in a true partnership with our customers. Whilst we continue to serve many customers during this crisis, as you would expect our second quarter results were impacted by disruptions due to office closures and other restrictions put in place as a result of COVID-19. Fortunately, 100% of our records management facilities are now open and operating across the globe. However, many of our global customers continue to operate at significantly lower capacities due to existing restrictions depending on geography. As a result, global demand for many of our core service offerings declined during the quarter. Looking back, no one could have anticipated the magnitude of the impact from this pandemic on the global economy and our own business. However, our team moved quickly to assess the risks, understand the consequences, and take decisive action to ensure the safety of our employees, customers and communities. As I mentioned, these various decisions have not been made lightly. And we are aware of their consequences, especially for our Mountaineers that have been impacted by furloughs and other temporary, and in some cases, permanent actions. We told you in May that approximately a third of our global workforce has been impacted by these actions in an effort to keep our labor costs in line with levels of service activity. Fortunately, we have been able to bring a number of our Mountaineers back to work. So at this time, this number has decreased to approximately 20% of our global workforce. Furthermore, the mix has shifted over the past few months, so fewer of the impacted employees are on full furlough, and a higher percentage are working reduced hours, or using vacation or sick times. At this time, we have also reopened all our corporate offices with the exception of London, which we plan to open at the beginning of September. We are practicing strict protocols around social distancing. And as such, the majority of our salaried workforce is continuing to work remotely. We should know we have been strong \u2013 we have seen strong productivity rates with working from home. That being said, given some of the increased stresses of working remotely, we continue to monitor and care for our Mountaineers\u2019 mental health and resiliency as part of our overall focus on wellness. Turning to our financial performance, our continued navigation of this challenging and uncertain environment has delivered a second quarter performance that further demonstrates, improves the durability and resilience of our people, and ultimately, our business model. I\u2019ll touch on a few highlights here. Q2 constant currency revenue declined $58 million or 5.6% year-over-year, driven entirely by a 21% decline in our service revenue. This was partly offset by strong storage revenue growth, which increased 3.7%. The early benefits of Project Summit are evident as we delivered constant currency adjusted EBITDA line, in line with the year-ago level despite the revenue decline, leading to a 200 basis point margin expansion. Barry will review the rest of the Q2 financials in more detail. Looking at our service business, we have seen improvements in activity levels across the various product lines since the end of April as global economies are starting to reopen and customers are increasingly utilizing our core service offerings in many geographies. However, the pace of our recovery still remains uncertain. Whilst the revenue decline wasn\u2019t as steep as we expected when we last spoke in early May, we continue to see some risk around the second half, depending upon what happens with the progression of the virus and possible additional restrictions on a country-by-country and state-by-state basis, as they continue to fight specific localized outbreaks of the virus. Turning now to our core Storage business, total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.3% supported by strong revenue management contribution. Moreover, we saw cash collections improve both in absolute terms year-on-year as well as by 2 days outstanding. This level of organic revenue growth underscores the durability and essential nature of our Storage business and our ability to continue to generate substantial cash flow. Total organic volume declined 1.8 million cubic feet sequentially, contributing to this decrease was in records management volume, partly offset a 2 million cubic foot increase in consumer and others. Looking more specifically at records management organic volume, this was down 3.9 million cubic feet compared to the first quarter. This shouldn\u2019t be surprising based on the decline of incoming boxes in April and a decline of 45% for the quarter. We have been asked by many investors as to what we see happening to physical volume post-COVID. So let me take a step back and provide some further context on organic records management volume. We estimate that the impact from COVID in Q2 was somewhere between 4 and 4.5 million cubic feet, net of a slowdown in permanent withdrawals. If we continue to normalize Q2 for similar levels of volume in Q1 combined with our expectation for a pickup in permanent withdrawals, volume would be flat to slightly up on a normalized basis. To get to a total physical volume impact, I will now be factoring consumer performance. In the second quarter, we added 2 million cubic feet, analyzing this would imply we would be net positive 8 million cubic feet or approximately 1% volume growth on a base of total physical volume of more than 720 million cubic feet. However, Q2 is a seasonally highest point for consumer business, so this would be overly optimistic to assume for a full year. When we net all this out in a post-COVID world, we would expect physical storage volume growth to be roughly a 0.5% with volume from records management flat to slightly up with a small net positive growth coming from consumer. It should be noted that this is all before the contribution from our normal price increases, which generally add approximately 2% to 3% to the volume growth, yielding approximately 3% organic storage revenue growth from the physical side of the business. However, when we will see this reversion to post-COVID normalized business environment remains uncertain, and it\u2019s certainly not before the end \u2013 before the second half of 2021. Despite the stress constraints from dealing with COVID\u2019s impact, we have not led up on our investments in innovation. Specifically in the quarter, we had many instances where we were able to serve our customers with a focus on delivering innovative solutions in order to help them navigate their challenges that have arisen from COVID-19. For example, regarding the commercial impact, in April, pipeline of more traditional offerings was down 40% versus the same period last year due to COVID in the resulting lower economic activity. However, we recovered one-third of this loss through new solutions we recently launched that help address our customers\u2019 needs during this time. This is just one demonstration of the resiliency and dedication of our mountaineers as we expect many of these solutions to be additive to our top and bottom lines even after our base activities rebound. Turning now to our Global Data Center segment. This business continues to perform exceptionally well, delivering strong results in the second quarter. In June, we announced a 27-megawatt data center lease with a U.S.-based Fortune 100 customer in Frankfurt, Germany. This customer will occupy the entire Frankfurt facility which should result in stabilization significantly sooner than we originally anticipated when we purchased the land last year. In addition, we signed a 3-megawatt data center lease with a Fortune Global 200 company in Singapore, another signal of strong momentum in that market. These bigger deals have been won alongside a series of smaller but significant agreements including a number of new logos. We welcomed an online gaming platform, a state government and a global logistics supplier provided to the IMDC ecosystem in Q2. All of this is contributed to a strong performance in the first half of the year with nearly 39 megawatts of new and expansion leases signed against our initial guidance of 15 to 20 megawatts for the full year. Given this great success in the first half of the year, we now expect to be able to sign leases for a total of 45 to 50 megawatts this year or an additional 10-plus megawatts of leasing in the back half. I\u2019d like to congratulate the entire data center team for an exceptional first half performance. Thank you. Based on the strength of our pipeline, we will continue to prioritize investment in data center growth. We are actively building our capacity across our global footprint with new development projects started in Amsterdam, Singapore and Phoenix. In early July, we completed the first phase of 4 megawatts and our new building on our Northern Virginia Campus, and customers are already deploying. As I mentioned earlier, Projects Submit is already paying dividends. No one could have predicted the depth or breadth of this pandemic when we first announced Project Summit in October 2019. Thankfully, the decisive actions we took early in the program allowed us to reconfigure our cost structure as well as realigned our organization to be more nimble and customer centric. These changes enabled us to be more responsive in delivering new solutions to our customers\u2019 specific needs during the crisis as well as matching our costs to a changing demand environment. In addition to the cost reduction Project Summit has achieved as demonstrated by our increased margin, we\u2019ve also made progress on the next phase and improving our customer intelligence as well as simplifying our IT systems, one such example being our master data management initiative. Through this initiative, we\u2019re improving the platforms and processes that handle all of our data. This intelligence will allow us to better understand and serve our customers making data and asset for our business. Finally, I\u2019m also very pleased with the initial success we have seen from the recent changes to our service delivery model. The rollout of the SLA changes or service level agreement changes we discussed last quarter had gone smoothly. We have already seen the early benefits of denser routes and less frequent pickups and deliveries. Our Image on Demand service has seen an increase in activity as more customers look for solutions, which include the use of digital solutions, as it helps them integrate more contactless process to reduce infection risk at their businesses. A recent survey indicated that more of our customers are interested in converting to digital versus physical delivery. In particular, our customers tell us they value speed of delivery, ease of use, and security as the most important considerations when evaluating the use of Image on Demand. To summarize, there is no doubt that COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge to our business. However, this challenge provided confirmation that the changes we have made to our organization and the investments we have made in the recent past were the right ones. COVID-19 accelerated many workplace trends, and we have demonstrated that we can provide the necessary solutions to help our customers adapt to their new unexpected work environment. Despite the unprecedented volatility of COVID-19, we remain focused on long-term growth and doing what\u2019s right for the health of our employees, our customers and our business. Importantly, we have also recommitted ourselves in our fight against racial injustice prevalent in our societies around the globe, and in creating an inclusive and diverse workforce. We are fortunate to have a strong balance sheet and a durable business model, which are helping us successfully navigate this challenging period, whilst providing us with the flexibility to continue investing in our long-term growth plans, which go beyond Project Summit. As Barry shared with you last quarter, we are proactively managing expenses and have additional levers to further adjust our cost structure if necessary and appropriate. In closing, whilst the hide degree of uncertainty remains as we look to the back half of the year, we are confident that the value of our offerings is more relevant to our customers today, and we will continue to provide innovative products and services that address their evolving business needs. Our confidence is further shared by our bondholders as evidenced by our $2.4 billion issuance to refinance some of our notes. Strong investor confidence and demand allowed us to upsize our transaction, as well as extend our maturity profile. On behalf of the leadership team, I wish to extend our heartfelt gratitude to our frontline mountaineers, who have kept our operations running seamlessly to serve our customers. Stay safe and well. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Barry.\nBarry Hytinen: Thanks, Bill, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results. I want to echo Bill\u2019s comments. I hope you all continue to be safe and healthy. We are pleased with our results for the second quarter. In a challenging macro environment, our team delivered solid performance across each of our key financial metrics, revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and AFFO. Before I go into the detail of the \u2013 our results, let me touch on the impact COVID-19 has had on our service trends. As we noted on our last conference call, for the second quarter, we were planning for service declines consistent with what we experienced in April. This proved to be slightly conservative. While May was consistent with April, we saw an improving trend across most of our service lines in June. To provide investors with as much visibility as possible, I want to share more information than we typically do, including the monthly progression of service activity. As compared to last year, our global service activities declined 37% in April, 38% in May, and 21% in June. This resulted in an average decline for the second quarter of 32%. While trends have naturally varied some by market, these are generally representative of what we\u2019ve experienced around the globe. A notable call out is Latin America, where consistent with macro headlines, the business has generally lagged the recovery elsewhere. To put that in context, this region represents approximately 5% of our revenue. In North America, we saw a year-on-year decline of 36% in April, 37% in May, and 22% in June. Our core storage business, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of our total revenue and a larger portion of our profitability, has demonstrated its durability as we continue to grow organic storage rental revenue during the pandemic. As a reminder, the stability of this business is built on the fact that over 97% of our annual storage revenue is generated by boxes that entered our facilities in prior years. And now turning to enterprise results for the second quarter, revenue of $982 million decreased 7.9% on a reported basis year-on-year, reflecting service declines as well as the stronger dollar. On a constant currency basis, revenue declined 5.6%. Total organic revenue declined 7.2%. Organic service revenue declined 23.1% reflecting the COVID impact. Despite the macro headwinds, total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.3% supported by revenue management. Adjusted EBITDA declined 2.3% to $343 million. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, adjusted EBITDA was in line with last year, despite a $58 million revenue decline. During the second quarter, we incurred $9 million of costs as a result of COVID-19 for items such as PPE and specialized cleaning of our facilities, which have been excluded from our non-GAAP measures. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 200 basis points year-over-year to 34.9%. The improvement reflects progress on our Summit transformation, revenue management and favorable mix. Adjusted EPS was $0.22 compared to $0.23 in the second quarter of 2019. Our full year expectations for tax rate and shares outstanding remain unchanged from our commentary last quarter. AFFO was $249 million, up 19% year-over-year. As compared to adjusted EBITDA, the increase in AFFO was primarily driven by tax refund. Turning to segment performance, starting with the global RIM organization. In the second quarter records management experienced year-on-year declines of approximately 45% for new boxes inbounded and 43% for retrievals and refiles. Permanent withdrawals declined 34% and destructions were down 1%. Data management saw less of an impact with activity down 10%. Our global digital solutions business has continued to perform well with revenue consistent year-on-year on a constant currency basis. Given the diverse mix of products and services in this business, we use revenue as the best indicator of activity. In our shred business, activity declined approximately 24%, which has also resulted in lower paper tonnage. The industry saw an increase in the price for recycled paper in April and May, which we believe was partially the result of elevated consumer purchases of paper products. For the second quarter, our average realized price was 15% higher than the prior year, which was a $2 million benefit to adjusted EBITDA. Prices continued to be volatile with sequential declines in June and July. The consumer storage business has seen an increase in demand and performed ahead of our expectations. These service activity levels contributed to a total organic revenue decline of 7.5% in the global RIM business. The decline was partially offset by storage volume growth in faster growing markets and revenue management. In the second quarter, we took aggressive actions including furloughs and reduced work hours which helped bring costs more in line with activity levels. Naturally, we also experienced a level of fixed costs deleverage. As these cost actions are temporary in nature and distinct from Project Summit, we continue to expect them to come back as revenue recovers. Our global RIM business delivered adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 240 basis points to 43.8%. This improvement was driven by Project Summit, revenue management and favorable next. Turning to Global Data Center, the business delivered organic revenue growth of 7.6% driven by strong leasing in prior periods and low churn of 80 basis points. This was partially offset by a mark-to-market decline in Phoenix resulting from an early contract renewal of a large legacy I/O customer. Global Data Center\u2019s adjusted EBITDA margin of 45.8% represents an increase of 140 basis points consistent with our long-term goal to drive margin expansion as our platform scales. As Bill noted, the data center team delivered very strong bookings in the first half of the year signing almost 39 megawatts of new and expansion leases including pre-leasing 100% of our Frankfurt facility currently under development. As we have said before, we are reviewing potential third-party capital options, particularly related to stabilized assets, and we will keep you updated in the second half. Turning to our adjacent businesses, the fine arts industry has continued to experience the impact of COVID and we have seen activity down approximately 85%. On the other hand, our entertainment services business has shown resilience as activity has remained in line with pre-COVID levels. As to Project Summit, in the second quarter we recognized $39 million of restructuring charges and an adjusted EBITDA benefit of $40 million. Through the first half, we have delivered $65 million of benefit. We continue to expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA benefits associated with Project Summit of $150 million and restructuring charges of $240 million in 2020. This keeps us on pace to deliver $375 million of expected total program benefits exiting 2021. And turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, we are confident in our balance sheet strength and liquidity position. In the second quarter, our team did a nice job driving cash cycle improvement of nearly 4 days year-on-year, with benefits coming from both payables\u2019 days and days sales outstanding. We continue to see the opportunity for further cash cycle improvement over the long term. With the COVID backdrop, I think the team\u2019s performance, particularly on cash collections was very strong. Despite a decline in revenue, our cash collections were up year-on-year in June. I will note that given the pandemics\u2019 impact on the macro-economy, we took a prudent view regarding receivables and increased our bad debt expense in the quarter. I\u2019d like to briefly expand on the recent bond offering that Bill mentioned. We appreciate the investment community\u2019s strong support which resulted in our ability to upsize the transaction in June to $2.4 billion. This leverage neutral offering increased our weighted average maturity by almost 2 years while only modestly increasing our cost of debt. In the second quarter, we recognized debt extinguishment charges of approximately $17 million related to a write off of unamortized deferred financing costs and call premiums. Due to the timing of the payoff of one of our notes, at quarter end we had elevated levels of cash on our balance sheet. We paid off that note on July 2, and as a result, we anticipate recording an additional $15 million of debt extinguishment charge in the third quarter. Pro forma for this payoff, we had $1.2 billion of liquidity, which provides us ample runway to operate the business in this uncertain environment. We have been able to maintain liquidity at this level since April even while continuing to fund innovation and growth initiatives as well as supporting our sustainable dividend. We ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.4 times, which takes into account certain adjustments as described in our credit facility. Looking ahead, we expect to end the year with leverage of approximately 5.6 times, which would represent a slight decline year-on-year as we make progress toward our long-term leverage range. With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early October. Now, let me provide an update as to our expectations for the remainder of the year. With the impact of COVID, we are planning for reported revenue to be down less than 5% for the full year compared to 2019. This outlook includes a full year headwind from foreign exchange rates of approximately $75 million for revenue and almost $25 million for adjusted EBITDA as compared to last year. Turning to our expectations for our Storage and Service businesses, for the full year we currently expect a decline in net organic storage volume of 1% to 1.5%. We expect reported storage rental revenue in the second half to grow on year-on-year at a rate that approaches what we delivered in the second quarter. As to Service, our July activity levels were down 24% globally. We are currently planning for third-quarter activity to be consistent with what we experienced in July. This implies a service revenue decline in high-teens year-on-year in the third quarter. With an expectation for a gradual recovery in the fourth quarter, we are planning for full-year service revenue declines in the mid-teens. We are approaching adjusted EBITDA margins with a level of conservatism and plan for both the third and fourth quarters to be flat to slightly up year-on-year. This would result in us delivering full-year adjusted EBITDA margin expansion slightly above 100 basis points relative as to last year, which reflects an improvement as compared to our comments on our last call. This reflects our solid first-half performance benefits from revenue management Project Summit and other cost actions, as well as a cautious outlook for the remainder of the year. Turning to capital expenditures, we have increased our full-year expectation to approximately $525 million or an increase of $50 million from the midpoint of our previous outlook. You should expect this increase to be evenly split between recurring CapEx and data center growth investment, given the better-than-expected performance in the core business, as well as our growing data center pipeline. As to AFFO, the team is focused on delivering at a level approaching last year\u2019s results, including the benefit of our second quarter tax refund. As it relates to capital recycling, our outlook has not changed. We continue to expect to generate proceeds of approximately $100 million this year. As we look at the back half, we have a strong pipeline of transactions and continue to see attractive valuations with historically low cap rates in the industrial real estate market. While second quarter was a challenging one for our Service business, we are confident in its resiliency and the continued durability of our Storage business. I am proud of how the team has responded to these challenges and the strong results they have delivered. We look forward to sharing further progress with you on our third quarter earnings call. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And today\u2019s first question comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nEric Luebchow: Right. Thanks for taking the question. Bill, you mentioned that you had launched some new solutions for your customers in the quarter that helped recover some of your sales losses. So I\u2019m wondering if you could maybe provide a little more color on what type solutions you\u2019re offering and any impact you think that could have? And then, I guess, just one follow-up, on the data center build out, you have mentioned that you were looking at third-party capital options. I\u2019m wondering if that facility is related to the Frankfurt lease or if there are potentially other assets that you could look to potentially a joint venture. Thanks.\nWilliam Meaney: Okay. I\u2019ll let Barry answer the last one in more detail. I think the answer to \u2013 the short answer to your question is, yeah, we continue to like the idea of third-party capital for stabilized assets. But I\u2019ll let Barry give you a full answer on that. On the first one, in terms \u2013 so, thanks for the question, Eric, on innovation and the importance of that, not just in a post-COVID world, but absolutely in the current environment. We continue to see traction on some of the things I highlighted last time in terms of what I call remote collaboration and collaborating remotely. Like I gave the example last time I think on unemployment benefits, where we\u2019re actually facilitating folks to be able to be working away from home and both receive the application for unemployment and approve it, and then, also some of the areas around mailroom which, again, I think I highlighted last time. One area I would add in addition to that, so we continue to see more and more traction for those kinds of solutions. One area too that we\u2019ve seen, a good uptick in the recent past is what we call our Clean Start program. And the Clean Start program is something that we launched a year ago, which is really helping people to re-imagine their needs to their office space, and get information flows to be more seamless when they\u2019re at work, and then, also to get things off site for things that they don\u2019t need around the office and it allows them to work in a much more flexible way. When we came into COVID that actually got \u2013 the brakes got put on that, because part of the Clean Start was, we would go into offices and do surveys and help \u2013 working with their real estate people to help them re-imagine and rebuild their work processes. And some of that, the exhaust of that process, obviously, is storage, but also some of the other services that we provide is Iron Mountain. When we got into the crisis, our real estate team product management, sales and marketing team collaborated and they created a Clean Start kit in a box, if you will. So what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve been able to put that together in a kit that allows us to deliver the same type of assessment in survey virtually without actually going into their offices. And we just recently, for instance, had a very large win with a global insurance company that was selling part of its insurance portfolio to a life insurance company, where we not only did facilitated moving sensitive records, many containing PII or Personally Identifiable Information across to that new owner of those policies and that information, but transfer a number of their employees across and at the same time help them repurpose the real estate footprint that they were left with. So it was kind of real estate optimization, helping them transfer a business to another person, transfer of people and then take a step back and say how can we actually improve the information flow in what they have left. So it just gives you another flavor of the types of things that we\u2019re finding out there.\nBarry Hytinen: And, Eric, hey, it\u2019s Barry. Thanks for the question. Just to add a little bit on to Bill\u2019s comments there, earlier in the year, we noted that we were going to pause our third-party capital. Look, as we were working through the pre-leasing activity, we noted that the pipeline was very attractive, specifically on Frankfurt. Obviously, the team did a phenomenal job in the quarter with that and as well as broader data center business. So we are looking at third-party capital, Frankfurt in particular. But I would never say never as it relates to other stabilized assets. We think it\u2019s an attractive way to improve returns for the company and we see a lot of opportunity there. I would say that implied in your question was the comment around JV. We do think that that\u2019s an attractive structure. You\u2019ve seen that done in the industry before I know. And I think at this point, what we\u2019ll say is we will come back to you quarter by quarter and give you an update as how we\u2019re progressing there. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nAdam Walsh: Hey, this is Adam on for Shlomo. On the Services business looks like the revenue decline wasn\u2019t near as high as at least we were thinking. One, what percentage of the client facilities are accessible to the company\u2019s services business? And two, how much did the paper price \u2013 increased paper price has offset the volume decline in the shredding business in the quarter?\nWilliam Meaney: Oh, okay. Hey, Adam. Thanks for the question. A couple of points there, I would say, look, our service business performed better throughout \u2013 in the quarter than we had anticipated. As you know, on the last call, we noted that we thought we\u2019d use April as a proxy going forward for the entire second quarter. April and May, generally speaking, really across the world and across our various service activity lines were very consistent. Shred was down kind of high 20%s in April, about 30% in May. It also recovered just like directionally the rest of the business was down in the vicinity of 10% on activity basis in June and kind of stayed at that level in July. I would say that, that trajectory of improvement in June, as I noted, was really pervasive across all of our activities. As it relates to paper price, in particular, the way I would think about this, Adam, is on our last call, we were \u2013 well, in the first quarter, we had a $10 million hit to EBITDA from paper prices, as you recall. In \u2013 on our last call, we thought that we would have kind of low- to mid-single-digit dollar decline as a result of paper price for each of the next couple of quarters. We actually had a $2 million positive to EBITDA as I mentioned on the call. Now, I will say that paper prices have been very volatile and have been declining quite significantly over the last couple of months, you\u2019ve probably seen that in the industry data, I know you follow that. And so our view for the back half is that it will be basically neutral year-on-year as it relates to EBITDA. So thanks for the question, Adam.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nSheila McGrath: Yes. Good morning. I was wondering if you could comment on what percentage of the new data center leasing is from existing Iron Mountain customers? Just more details on synergies there. And if you can comment on how the global sales relationship strategy might be going?\nBarry Hytinen: Okay. Good morning, Sheila. Thanks for the question. So, first of all, as we look at this quarter is most of the sales were from relative \u2013 either from new logos or hyperscalers that were the first time deploying in a hyperscale way, if you know what I mean. In other words, we \u2013 most of the hyperscalers, we were serving in some aspects, but not necessarily in large hyperscale deployment. I think overall, though, if you look at our pipeline, I would say that whilst it\u2019s right to say on \u2013 in terms of volume, that we would sell this, that one hyperscaler, you can kind of skew what that looks like is we\u2019re still seeing a good mix. So I think last quarter, we were approaching back up to about 50% from kind of existing Iron Mountain or existing data center customers. This quarter, it was a little bit lower, especially if you use the filter I\u2019m saying, breaking the hyperscalers into 2 buckets. But \u2013 overall, I think we still continue to see the pipeline, I think that some of the new logos that I highlighted, that we brought in this time were because of existing Iron Mountain relationships and say our data management business and the type of cross selling that you would see. But if you look at specifically this quarter, what we\u2019re most excited about this quarter is that, we think, we\u2019re beginning to be established in the deal flow, if you will, for hyperscale deployment. In other words, hyperscalers know that we\u2019re out there, and we see \u2013 we\u2019re seeing the RFIs, just like everybody else, so we\u2019re pretty excited. So this quarter was kind of skewed, I would say to kind of newish customers. But overall, the pipeline is still kind of in that 50% level.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s next question comes from Nate Crossett with Berenberg. Please go ahead.\nNate Crossett: Hey, good morning, guys. A couple of questions. For the organic storage revenue, it was up 2.3%. Kind of wondering if you could speak to that a bit. How much of that growth is coming from data centers now? How much is coming from the rest? And have you had any pushback on pricing increases during COVID? And then on the DCs, I\u2019m just wondering, do you worry that if you start doing JVs for the DCs that you\u2019re going to get less credit for this growing business?\nBarry Hytinen: Hey, Nate. This is Barry. Thanks for your both questions. So data center contributed 40 basis points to that number. So it really speaks to the fact that it\u2019s a nice contributor, and we expect obviously that to ramp over time as that is, as you know, a big focus for the company. We see a long-term trajectory for continued growth there. And, as I said earlier, the team is just doing really well. And that also speaks, I think, to the fact that our records management business continues to see nice growth and revenue management really contributing very, very well. As it relates to credit, as it relates to structure, I think it\u2019s a little premature to talk too much about what we do there. As it relates to third-party capital, we know that we\u2019re just evaluating but as it relates to stabilized assets, we do think that where various rates are in terms of certain folks that are willing to invest in this kind of market, it makes for very enhanced returns. And we think it\u2019s also another opportunity to help fuel incremental growth. Bill, did you have anything you want to add?\nWilliam Meaney: Yeah. The only thing, Nate, I would add on the pricing side, because I think your question, regarding your questions a little bit, in this environment, do you still \u2013 are you still seeing the same stickiness? The thing that \u2013 we knew that we were an essential business based on government authorities. As I said, even at the peak, we were 96% of our facilities were open around the globe. Now it\u2019s 100%. But the one thing that we\u2019ve seen is that we\u2019ve been able to continue to get the price increases that we expected, our customers really see us as essential as well. And that was further reinforced. I think, Barry highlighted in his introductory remarks that in the month of June, not only the DSOs go down year-on-year, but the month of June with lower sales, we collected more cash than we did June last year. So in other words, people really do see that our services are essential to keep their businesses up and running. So we haven\u2019t seen any really noise around the price increases that we were able to achieve last year in the current environment.\nBarry Hytinen: Thanks for the questions, Nate.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Jon Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Atkin: Thank you. I\u2019ve got couple of questions on the data center side, if you could maybe comment on Amsterdam and then Singapore, each of which have seen some non-COVID-related pauses or freezes in terms of new permitting, and may or may not affect you equally in both markets, but just it has had some impact on your competitors. And is there kind of any sort of an update as to the lifting of these pauses in each of those metros. Thanks.\nWilliam Meaney: Thanks, Jon. It\u2019s good to hear this morning. So I think first of all, the market extreme \u2013 both of those markets extremely well. So first on Singapore, we\u2019re continuing to keep an eye on it, because, as you probably realize, we\u2019re tracking on a track that we\u2019re going to be sold out in Singapore pretty soon. So you\u2019re right that the government has put a pause on it. We have heard the \u2013 it just so happens that our head of Asia data centers is a Singaporean based in Singapore. So he stays pretty close to the government. We are seeing that the government seems to be making noises to relax that a little bit sooner than they initially guided, say, a year ago. So we\u2019re optimistic. And obviously we\u2019re starting to or have been for a number of months now looking at how we could actually expand our footprint in Singapore. As I said the \u2013 we\u2019re well on track to fill out the old Credit Suisse data center fairly soon. On Amsterdam, interesting, we have actually quite a bit of land permitted. So we\u2019ve been less engaged with the government trying to relax that. On the other side, it\u2019s exactly as you said is, we\u2019ve seen even a number of people who have their own data centers in the Amsterdam market, for instance, coming in and starting to look to add capacity in our facilities, because of the permitting issue that you\u2019ve described. And obviously, Amsterdam is a highly connected market in our facility as a high level of connectivity within it. So it\u2019s actually playing through our strength, because we have the capacity in \u2013 but the rest of the market is constrained.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s next question comes from Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nSheila McGrath: Yes. I was wondering if you could give us a little more detail on Project Summit, how it\u2019s going versus your expectations. And for the $65 million benefit realized thus far, where are those savings come from? And what are some of the sources of the future savings? And one last one for Barry. What was the tax refund related to just more detail on that?\nWilliam Meaney: Okay, Sheila. Good morning and thanks for those questions. First off, we feel great about how Summit is doing. I think, the team is very aligned and they\u2019re very focused on delivering. I think the total company is energized by the fact that this is really an opportunity to transform the company and support our customers that much better. In terms of how it\u2019s stacking up, the second quarter of $40 million benefit year-on-year was right in line, if not a little bit ahead of what we were expecting. So we\u2019re at $65 million year-to-date, obviously, those are elevated levels as compared to what we were expecting earlier as we increase the benefit this year last quarter. So we\u2019re well on track to deliver $150 million of benefit this year. My guess is that next year, we will have another $150 million to $200 million of incremental benefit. And we\u2019ll exit next year at a run rate that has all of the benefits the entire $375 million by 2022. So a little small amount of incremental benefit there in 2022 to plan for your models in terms of where it\u2019s coming from. It\u2019s generally been thus far, probably in the vicinity of 70%, 75% from SG&A and the balance and cost of sales. You\u2019ll notice you\u2019re looking at our performance this quarter, our cost of sales, obviously, down a lot more and that reflects the fact that we made those temporary cost cuts that we talked about in the form of furloughs and et cetera. Going forward, I think, you\u2019ll see even more of Summit coming from a more balanced approach across the income statement. As initially as Bill, as commented before, the first rounds of summit were really in the SG&A area. There will be more going forward. But I think as a relative basis, sort of last quarter, we talked some about the SLA changes, which by the way, are going very, very well. Those will continue to stack incremental benefits going forward. And some of that, obviously, will be in the cost of sales line. As it relates to the tax refund, I think that was the last question. We did have about $27 million of cash refunds in the quarter as compared to prior year. Last year, we actually paid more on a cash basis. So if you\u2019re looking at AFFO, it\u2019s almost a $35 million swing year-on-year. That\u2019s one time. And we \u2013 those are for prior-year refunds that we received during the quarter. So thanks for those questions, Sheila.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Michael Funk with BoA Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nMichael Funk: Yeah, thank you for the question, guys. Good morning.\nWilliam Meaney: Good morning.\nMichael Funk: A couple if I could, can you comment some more on the churn that you\u2019re seeing? Any kind of update on the monthly progression for customer churn?\nWilliam Meaney: Yeah, I didn\u2019t quite get the question, Michael. It was a customer churn on data center or customer churn in the records business?\nMichael Funk: Yeah, sorry about that, on the records business, please.\nWilliam Meaney: On the records business, yeah. So, look, the customer churn is actually we think a little bit lower than normal than we would see. So that\u2019s when I made the comment in my introductory remarks that when we kind of normalize in a post-COVID world on one side, we would expect a pause. In other words, we don\u2019t expect the same drag on incoming volume, but on permanent withdrawals is that we saw a downtick in this quarter, because people are not in the office or making active decisions to actually withdraw. So we expected to kind of revert back to the normal levels. But if you kind of look at overall volume, I think the question behind your question is, what do we think is going to happen to volume when we get out of COVID. So on one side we would expect permanent withdrawals to go up, back to normalized levels. But on the other side is we would expect the incoming volume from our customers to come back up. And so that gives you kind of a bit of science around that if it\u2019s helpful. Let\u2019s first of all, kind of anchor on what we see with our customers right now in this environment in terms of activity. So last week when I was in New York, in New Jersey, and had to catch up with one evening with the President and Chief Operating Officer of a large global bank that\u2019s based in New York. And we were comparing notes on how many people come back to the office, et cetera. And what he shared with me is that at the depth of the crisis, say, in April, they had less than 3% of their workforce coming into the office. And whether you\u2019re standing \u2013 when I was meeting with them last week in July, they had invited 20% of the people to come back, and only 6% came back. And you\u2019re probably seeing similar things in BAML. So then, let\u2019s kind of say, how is that translated in the activity we see in terms of incoming boxes; when I say that, where are we going to end when we have COVID in the rearview mirror? So if we look at incoming boxes in April, so if you remember, like in their case, only 3% of their people, less than 3% of their people were coming into the office. We were down 58% in North America. If I\u2019m just taking North America as an example as that is a proxy, we\u2019re down 58% on incoming box volume. If we look at the quarter, as Barry mentioned, we\u2019re down about 47% overall in North America in terms of incoming box. Now, if you looked at July, we\u2019re down about 38%. So basically July is about a 20% improvement from what we saw on average in Q2. So if we were down, say, 4 million, 4.5 million cubic feet, due to \u2013 in Q2 from our records management business, or net, we said minus 3.8 million cubic feet, we were 4.5 million cubic feet worse than normal. But let\u2019s say, we were down negative 3.8 million cubic feet, then we would say that based on a 20% \u2013 the 20% improvement that we\u2019ve seen in July is worst-case scenario. You project that forward is we\u2019re down about 3 million cubic feet a quarter, right? So that\u2019s 12 million cubic feet on an annualized basis. Now, we don\u2019t expect it to plateau at these levels, obviously, because we\u2019re still only running it in financial services, less than 6% of the people that are coming to work. But with \u2013 even if we plateau at the current levels, we\u2019re seeing is you\u2019d be a 12 million annual drag, a negative 12 million annual drag on our records management business in terms of physical storage. And that\u2019s before adding consumer back in. So when you net it all out is that worst case, especially with the offset that we get from consumer, is that we think that adding, our normal price of 2% to 3%, it\u2019s manageable, where the most likely scenario is we\u2019ll continue to see improvement, people will start \u2013 I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to stay at 6% of the workforce coming to the office, it will go back up. And that\u2019s why we said in our remarks is we expect in a post-COVID world is will be kind of flattish to slightly up in the records management business, and then consumer will drive additional growth on top of that. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session and today\u2019s conference call.

            "name": "Barry Hytinen",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results. I want to echo Bill's comments. I hope you all continue to be safe and healthy. We are pleased with our results for the second quarter. In a challenging macro environment, our team delivered solid performance across each of our key financial metrics, revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and AFFO. Before I go into the detail of the \u2013 our results, let me touch on the impact COVID-19 has had on our service trends. As we noted on our last conference call, for the second quarter, we were planning for service declines consistent with what we experienced in April. This proved to be slightly conservative. While May was consistent with April, we saw an improving trend across most of our service lines in June. To provide investors with as much visibility as possible, I want to share more information than we typically do, including the monthly progression of service activity. As compared to last year, our global service activities declined 37% in April, 38% in May, and 21% in June. This resulted in an average decline for the second quarter of 32%. While trends have naturally varied some by market, these are generally representative of what we've experienced around the globe. A notable call out is Latin America, where consistent with macro headlines, the business has generally lagged the recovery elsewhere. To put that in context, this region represents approximately 5% of our revenue. In North America, we saw a year-on-year decline of 36% in April, 37% in May, and 22% in June. Our core storage business, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of our total revenue and a larger portion of our profitability, has demonstrated its durability as we continue to grow organic storage rental revenue during the pandemic. As a reminder, the stability of this business is built on the fact that over 97% of our annual storage revenue is generated by boxes that entered our facilities in prior years. And now turning to enterprise results for the second quarter, revenue of $982 million decreased 7.9% on a reported basis year-on-year, reflecting service declines as well as the stronger dollar. On a constant currency basis, revenue declined 5.6%. Total organic revenue declined 7.2%. Organic service revenue declined 23.1% reflecting the COVID impact. Despite the macro headwinds, total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.3% supported by revenue management. Adjusted EBITDA declined 2.3% to $343 million. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, adjusted EBITDA was in line with last year, despite a $58 million revenue decline. During the second quarter, we incurred $9 million of costs as a result of COVID-19 for items such as PPE and specialized cleaning of our facilities, which have been excluded from our non-GAAP measures. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 200 basis points year-over-year to 34.9%. The improvement reflects progress on our Summit transformation, revenue management and favorable mix. Adjusted EPS was $0.22 compared to $0.23 in the second quarter of 2019. Our full year expectations for tax rate and shares outstanding remain unchanged from our commentary last quarter. AFFO was $249 million, up 19% year-over-year. As compared to adjusted EBITDA, the increase in AFFO was primarily driven by tax refund. Turning to segment performance, starting with the global RIM organization. In the second quarter records management experienced year-on-year declines of approximately 45% for new boxes inbounded and 43% for retrievals and refiles. Permanent withdrawals declined 34% and destructions were down 1%. Data management saw less of an impact with activity down 10%. Our global digital solutions business has continued to perform well with revenue consistent year-on-year on a constant currency basis. Given the diverse mix of products and services in this business, we use revenue as the best indicator of activity. In our shred business, activity declined approximately 24%, which has also resulted in lower paper tonnage. The industry saw an increase in the price for recycled paper in April and May, which we believe was partially the result of elevated consumer purchases of paper products. For the second quarter, our average realized price was 15% higher than the prior year, which was a $2 million benefit to adjusted EBITDA. Prices continued to be volatile with sequential declines in June and July. The consumer storage business has seen an increase in demand and performed ahead of our expectations. These service activity levels contributed to a total organic revenue decline of 7.5% in the global RIM business. The decline was partially offset by storage volume growth in faster growing markets and revenue management. In the second quarter, we took aggressive actions including furloughs and reduced work hours which helped bring costs more in line with activity levels. Naturally, we also experienced a level of fixed costs deleverage. As these cost actions are temporary in nature and distinct from Project Summit, we continue to expect them to come back as revenue recovers. Our global RIM business delivered adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 240 basis points to 43.8%. This improvement was driven by Project Summit, revenue management and favorable next. Turning to Global Data Center, the business delivered organic revenue growth of 7.6% driven by strong leasing in prior periods and low churn of 80 basis points. This was partially offset by a mark-to-market decline in Phoenix resulting from an early contract renewal of a large legacy I/O customer. Global Data Center's adjusted EBITDA margin of 45.8% represents an increase of 140 basis points consistent with our long-term goal to drive margin expansion as our platform scales. As Bill noted, the data center team delivered very strong bookings in the first half of the year signing almost 39 megawatts of new and expansion leases including pre-leasing 100% of our Frankfurt facility currently under development. As we have said before, we are reviewing potential third-party capital options, particularly related to stabilized assets, and we will keep you updated in the second half. Turning to our adjacent businesses, the fine arts industry has continued to experience the impact of COVID and we have seen activity down approximately 85%. On the other hand, our entertainment services business has shown resilience as activity has remained in line with pre-COVID levels. As to Project Summit, in the second quarter we recognized $39 million of restructuring charges and an adjusted EBITDA benefit of $40 million. Through the first half, we have delivered $65 million of benefit. We continue to expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA benefits associated with Project Summit of $150 million and restructuring charges of $240 million in 2020. This keeps us on pace to deliver $375 million of expected total program benefits exiting 2021. And turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, we are confident in our balance sheet strength and liquidity position. In the second quarter, our team did a nice job driving cash cycle improvement of nearly 4 days year-on-year, with benefits coming from both payables' days and days sales outstanding. We continue to see the opportunity for further cash cycle improvement over the long term. With the COVID backdrop, I think the team's performance, particularly on cash collections was very strong. Despite a decline in revenue, our cash collections were up year-on-year in June. I will note that given the pandemics' impact on the macro-economy, we took a prudent view regarding receivables and increased our bad debt expense in the quarter. I'd like to briefly expand on the recent bond offering that Bill mentioned. We appreciate the investment community's strong support which resulted in our ability to upsize the transaction in June to $2.4 billion. This leverage neutral offering increased our weighted average maturity by almost 2 years while only modestly increasing our cost of debt. In the second quarter, we recognized debt extinguishment charges of approximately $17 million related to a write off of unamortized deferred financing costs and call premiums. Due to the timing of the payoff of one of our notes, at quarter end we had elevated levels of cash on our balance sheet. We paid off that note on July 2, and as a result, we anticipate recording an additional $15 million of debt extinguishment charge in the third quarter. Pro forma for this payoff, we had $1.2 billion of liquidity, which provides us ample runway to operate the business in this uncertain environment. We have been able to maintain liquidity at this level since April even while continuing to fund innovation and growth initiatives as well as supporting our sustainable dividend. We ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.4 times, which takes into account certain adjustments as described in our credit facility. Looking ahead, we expect to end the year with leverage of approximately 5.6 times, which would represent a slight decline year-on-year as we make progress toward our long-term leverage range. With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early October. Now, let me provide an update as to our expectations for the remainder of the year. With the impact of COVID, we are planning for reported revenue to be down less than 5% for the full year compared to 2019. This outlook includes a full year headwind from foreign exchange rates of approximately $75 million for revenue and almost $25 million for adjusted EBITDA as compared to last year. Turning to our expectations for our Storage and Service businesses, for the full year we currently expect a decline in net organic storage volume of 1% to 1.5%. We expect reported storage rental revenue in the second half to grow on year-on-year at a rate that approaches what we delivered in the second quarter. As to Service, our July activity levels were down 24% globally. We are currently planning for third-quarter activity to be consistent with what we experienced in July. This implies a service revenue decline in high-teens year-on-year in the third quarter. With an expectation for a gradual recovery in the fourth quarter, we are planning for full-year service revenue declines in the mid-teens. We are approaching adjusted EBITDA margins with a level of conservatism and plan for both the third and fourth quarters to be flat to slightly up year-on-year. This would result in us delivering full-year adjusted EBITDA margin expansion slightly above 100 basis points relative as to last year, which reflects an improvement as compared to our comments on our last call. This reflects our solid first-half performance benefits from revenue management Project Summit and other cost actions, as well as a cautious outlook for the remainder of the year. Turning to capital expenditures, we have increased our full-year expectation to approximately $525 million or an increase of $50 million from the midpoint of our previous outlook. You should expect this increase to be evenly split between recurring CapEx and data center growth investment, given the better-than-expected performance in the core business, as well as our growing data center pipeline. As to AFFO, the team is focused on delivering at a level approaching last year's results, including the benefit of our second quarter tax refund. As it relates to capital recycling, our outlook has not changed. We continue to expect to generate proceeds of approximately $100 million this year. As we look at the back half, we have a strong pipeline of transactions and continue to see attractive valuations with historically low cap rates in the industrial real estate market. While second quarter was a challenging one for our Service business, we are confident in its resiliency and the continued durability of our Storage business. I am proud of how the team has responded to these challenges and the strong results they have delivered. We look forward to sharing further progress with you on our third quarter earnings call. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. And, Eric, hey, it's Barry. Thanks for the question. Just to add a little bit on to Bill's comments there, earlier in the year, we noted that we were going to pause our third-party capital. Look, as we were working through the pre-leasing activity, we noted that the pipeline was very attractive, specifically on Frankfurt. Obviously, the team did a phenomenal job in the quarter with that and as well as broader data center business. So we are looking at third-party capital, Frankfurt in particular. But I would never say never as it relates to other stabilized assets. We think it's an attractive way to improve returns for the company and we see a lot of opportunity there. I would say that implied in your question was the comment around JV. We do think that that's an attractive structure. You've seen that done in the industry before I know. And I think at this point, what we'll say is we will come back to you quarter by quarter and give you an update as how we're progressing there. Thanks for the question. Okay. Good morning, Sheila. Thanks for the question. So, first of all, as we look at this quarter is most of the sales were from relative \u2013 either from new logos or hyperscalers that were the first time deploying in a hyperscale way, if you know what I mean. In other words, we \u2013 most of the hyperscalers, we were serving in some aspects, but not necessarily in large hyperscale deployment. I think overall, though, if you look at our pipeline, I would say that whilst it's right to say on \u2013 in terms of volume, that we would sell this, that one hyperscaler, you can kind of skew what that looks like is we're still seeing a good mix. So I think last quarter, we were approaching back up to about 50% from kind of existing Iron Mountain or existing data center customers. This quarter, it was a little bit lower, especially if you use the filter I'm saying, breaking the hyperscalers into 2 buckets. But \u2013 overall, I think we still continue to see the pipeline, I think that some of the new logos that I highlighted, that we brought in this time were because of existing Iron Mountain relationships and say our data management business and the type of cross selling that you would see. But if you look at specifically this quarter, what we're most excited about this quarter is that, we think, we're beginning to be established in the deal flow, if you will, for hyperscale deployment. In other words, hyperscalers know that we're out there, and we see \u2013 we're seeing the RFIs, just like everybody else, so we're pretty excited. So this quarter was kind of skewed, I would say to kind of newish customers. But overall, the pipeline is still kind of in that 50% level. Hey, Nate. This is Barry. Thanks for your both questions. So data center contributed 40 basis points to that number. So it really speaks to the fact that it's a nice contributor, and we expect obviously that to ramp over time as that is, as you know, a big focus for the company. We see a long-term trajectory for continued growth there. And, as I said earlier, the team is just doing really well. And that also speaks, I think, to the fact that our records management business continues to see nice growth and revenue management really contributing very, very well. As it relates to credit, as it relates to structure, I think it's a little premature to talk too much about what we do there. As it relates to third-party capital, we know that we're just evaluating but as it relates to stabilized assets, we do think that where various rates are in terms of certain folks that are willing to invest in this kind of market, it makes for very enhanced returns. And we think it's also another opportunity to help fuel incremental growth. Bill, did you have anything you want to add? Thanks for the questions, Nate."

            "content": "Thank you, Greer, and thank you all for taking time to join us. Let me start by saying I hope you're all continued to stay safe and healthy in these trying times. Before we get into a discussion of our second quarter performance, I'd like to take some time to touch on 2 topics that are top of mind for many of us in the current environment. First, the killings of George Floyd and countless others have left me and my colleagues upset, angered and heartbroken. I want to reiterate that racism, discrimination and hate have no place at Iron Mountain. Our commitment and stated as one of our core 5 values for many years, to equality, inclusivity and diversity is part of our belief that our people are our greatest assets. Given this fact, we must continually attract, listen to and develop a broad talent pool reflecting our global demographics in order to deliver to our customers and protect our future. These tragic events have sparked difficult but important self-reflection in conversations within our organization about how well we are living up to our stated value and to commit ourselves to do much better. It is up to us to work together, educate ourselves and encourage open dialogue to promote proactive measures to help eliminate incorrect biases and spread awareness, not just because it is the right thing to do, but also because we will only be successful in serving our customers if we attract and retain the best talent. Having the best talent can only happen if we are recruiting and developing people from diverse backgrounds across the broader demographics we operate in. We remain strongly committed toward taking decisive and strategic action to create a truly inclusive Iron Mountain. We're committed to listening, learning and taking the necessary actions to support long-term positive change for the black community specifically, and people from all backgrounds in general. Whilst we cannot change the past, we have an opportunity as an organization and as individuals to positively impact the future and help fix the racial inequality prevalent in our society. Now, I'd like to update you on the impact we are seeing with respect to COVID-19. As you all know, the virus is unfortunately still spreading across the globe. My thoughts and prayers go out to all those who have been affected by the virus, including those who have fallen ill as well as their loved ones and their caregivers. As always, our top priority remains the health and safety of our Mountaineers, their families and our customers. I want to acknowledge and thank the mighty Mountaineers around the world, who despite extraordinary challenges have kept their focus on ensuring that Iron Mountain continues to move forward during these uncertain times, and doing so with a view towards safety. This is all [brought home] [ph] to me again last week, during a visit I made to Northern New Jersey, so I could thank our frontline teams personally. One of our couriers relayed how he has been serving a large metro New York health system every day through the crisis and how thankful the customer is for our continued service. This particular customer went so far to send one of their doctors to our facility to assist in the protocols and training to protect our staff. For me, this is what it means to be in a true partnership with our customers. Whilst we continue to serve many customers during this crisis, as you would expect our second quarter results were impacted by disruptions due to office closures and other restrictions put in place as a result of COVID-19. Fortunately, 100% of our records management facilities are now open and operating across the globe. However, many of our global customers continue to operate at significantly lower capacities due to existing restrictions depending on geography. As a result, global demand for many of our core service offerings declined during the quarter. Looking back, no one could have anticipated the magnitude of the impact from this pandemic on the global economy and our own business. However, our team moved quickly to assess the risks, understand the consequences, and take decisive action to ensure the safety of our employees, customers and communities. As I mentioned, these various decisions have not been made lightly. And we are aware of their consequences, especially for our Mountaineers that have been impacted by furloughs and other temporary, and in some cases, permanent actions. We told you in May that approximately a third of our global workforce has been impacted by these actions in an effort to keep our labor costs in line with levels of service activity. Fortunately, we have been able to bring a number of our Mountaineers back to work. So at this time, this number has decreased to approximately 20% of our global workforce. Furthermore, the mix has shifted over the past few months, so fewer of the impacted employees are on full furlough, and a higher percentage are working reduced hours, or using vacation or sick times. At this time, we have also reopened all our corporate offices with the exception of London, which we plan to open at the beginning of September. We are practicing strict protocols around social distancing. And as such, the majority of our salaried workforce is continuing to work remotely. We should know we have been strong \u2013 we have seen strong productivity rates with working from home. That being said, given some of the increased stresses of working remotely, we continue to monitor and care for our Mountaineers' mental health and resiliency as part of our overall focus on wellness. Turning to our financial performance, our continued navigation of this challenging and uncertain environment has delivered a second quarter performance that further demonstrates, improves the durability and resilience of our people, and ultimately, our business model. I'll touch on a few highlights here. Q2 constant currency revenue declined $58 million or 5.6% year-over-year, driven entirely by a 21% decline in our service revenue. This was partly offset by strong storage revenue growth, which increased 3.7%. The early benefits of Project Summit are evident as we delivered constant currency adjusted EBITDA line, in line with the year-ago level despite the revenue decline, leading to a 200 basis point margin expansion. Barry will review the rest of the Q2 financials in more detail. Looking at our service business, we have seen improvements in activity levels across the various product lines since the end of April as global economies are starting to reopen and customers are increasingly utilizing our core service offerings in many geographies. However, the pace of our recovery still remains uncertain. Whilst the revenue decline wasn't as steep as we expected when we last spoke in early May, we continue to see some risk around the second half, depending upon what happens with the progression of the virus and possible additional restrictions on a country-by-country and state-by-state basis, as they continue to fight specific localized outbreaks of the virus. Turning now to our core Storage business, total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.3% supported by strong revenue management contribution. Moreover, we saw cash collections improve both in absolute terms year-on-year as well as by 2 days outstanding. This level of organic revenue growth underscores the durability and essential nature of our Storage business and our ability to continue to generate substantial cash flow. Total organic volume declined 1.8 million cubic feet sequentially, contributing to this decrease was in records management volume, partly offset a 2 million cubic foot increase in consumer and others. Looking more specifically at records management organic volume, this was down 3.9 million cubic feet compared to the first quarter. This shouldn't be surprising based on the decline of incoming boxes in April and a decline of 45% for the quarter. We have been asked by many investors as to what we see happening to physical volume post-COVID. So let me take a step back and provide some further context on organic records management volume. We estimate that the impact from COVID in Q2 was somewhere between 4 and 4.5 million cubic feet, net of a slowdown in permanent withdrawals. If we continue to normalize Q2 for similar levels of volume in Q1 combined with our expectation for a pickup in permanent withdrawals, volume would be flat to slightly up on a normalized basis. To get to a total physical volume impact, I will now be factoring consumer performance. In the second quarter, we added 2 million cubic feet, analyzing this would imply we would be net positive 8 million cubic feet or approximately 1% volume growth on a base of total physical volume of more than 720 million cubic feet. However, Q2 is a seasonally highest point for consumer business, so this would be overly optimistic to assume for a full year. When we net all this out in a post-COVID world, we would expect physical storage volume growth to be roughly a 0.5% with volume from records management flat to slightly up with a small net positive growth coming from consumer. It should be noted that this is all before the contribution from our normal price increases, which generally add approximately 2% to 3% to the volume growth, yielding approximately 3% organic storage revenue growth from the physical side of the business. However, when we will see this reversion to post-COVID normalized business environment remains uncertain, and it's certainly not before the end \u2013 before the second half of 2021. Despite the stress constraints from dealing with COVID's impact, we have not led up on our investments in innovation. Specifically in the quarter, we had many instances where we were able to serve our customers with a focus on delivering innovative solutions in order to help them navigate their challenges that have arisen from COVID-19. For example, regarding the commercial impact, in April, pipeline of more traditional offerings was down 40% versus the same period last year due to COVID in the resulting lower economic activity. However, we recovered one-third of this loss through new solutions we recently launched that help address our customers' needs during this time. This is just one demonstration of the resiliency and dedication of our mountaineers as we expect many of these solutions to be additive to our top and bottom lines even after our base activities rebound. Turning now to our Global Data Center segment. This business continues to perform exceptionally well, delivering strong results in the second quarter. In June, we announced a 27-megawatt data center lease with a U.S.-based Fortune 100 customer in Frankfurt, Germany. This customer will occupy the entire Frankfurt facility which should result in stabilization significantly sooner than we originally anticipated when we purchased the land last year. In addition, we signed a 3-megawatt data center lease with a Fortune Global 200 company in Singapore, another signal of strong momentum in that market. These bigger deals have been won alongside a series of smaller but significant agreements including a number of new logos. We welcomed an online gaming platform, a state government and a global logistics supplier provided to the IMDC ecosystem in Q2. All of this is contributed to a strong performance in the first half of the year with nearly 39 megawatts of new and expansion leases signed against our initial guidance of 15 to 20 megawatts for the full year. Given this great success in the first half of the year, we now expect to be able to sign leases for a total of 45 to 50 megawatts this year or an additional 10-plus megawatts of leasing in the back half. I'd like to congratulate the entire data center team for an exceptional first half performance. Thank you. Based on the strength of our pipeline, we will continue to prioritize investment in data center growth. We are actively building our capacity across our global footprint with new development projects started in Amsterdam, Singapore and Phoenix. In early July, we completed the first phase of 4 megawatts and our new building on our Northern Virginia Campus, and customers are already deploying. As I mentioned earlier, Projects Submit is already paying dividends. No one could have predicted the depth or breadth of this pandemic when we first announced Project Summit in October 2019. Thankfully, the decisive actions we took early in the program allowed us to reconfigure our cost structure as well as realigned our organization to be more nimble and customer centric. These changes enabled us to be more responsive in delivering new solutions to our customers' specific needs during the crisis as well as matching our costs to a changing demand environment. In addition to the cost reduction Project Summit has achieved as demonstrated by our increased margin, we've also made progress on the next phase and improving our customer intelligence as well as simplifying our IT systems, one such example being our master data management initiative. Through this initiative, we're improving the platforms and processes that handle all of our data. This intelligence will allow us to better understand and serve our customers making data and asset for our business. Finally, I'm also very pleased with the initial success we have seen from the recent changes to our service delivery model. The rollout of the SLA changes or service level agreement changes we discussed last quarter had gone smoothly. We have already seen the early benefits of denser routes and less frequent pickups and deliveries. Our Image on Demand service has seen an increase in activity as more customers look for solutions, which include the use of digital solutions, as it helps them integrate more contactless process to reduce infection risk at their businesses. A recent survey indicated that more of our customers are interested in converting to digital versus physical delivery. In particular, our customers tell us they value speed of delivery, ease of use, and security as the most important considerations when evaluating the use of Image on Demand. To summarize, there is no doubt that COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge to our business. However, this challenge provided confirmation that the changes we have made to our organization and the investments we have made in the recent past were the right ones. COVID-19 accelerated many workplace trends, and we have demonstrated that we can provide the necessary solutions to help our customers adapt to their new unexpected work environment. Despite the unprecedented volatility of COVID-19, we remain focused on long-term growth and doing what's right for the health of our employees, our customers and our business. Importantly, we have also recommitted ourselves in our fight against racial injustice prevalent in our societies around the globe, and in creating an inclusive and diverse workforce. We are fortunate to have a strong balance sheet and a durable business model, which are helping us successfully navigate this challenging period, whilst providing us with the flexibility to continue investing in our long-term growth plans, which go beyond Project Summit. As Barry shared with you last quarter, we are proactively managing expenses and have additional levers to further adjust our cost structure if necessary and appropriate. In closing, whilst the hide degree of uncertainty remains as we look to the back half of the year, we are confident that the value of our offerings is more relevant to our customers today, and we will continue to provide innovative products and services that address their evolving business needs. Our confidence is further shared by our bondholders as evidenced by our $2.4 billion issuance to refinance some of our notes. Strong investor confidence and demand allowed us to upsize our transaction, as well as extend our maturity profile. On behalf of the leadership team, I wish to extend our heartfelt gratitude to our frontline mountaineers, who have kept our operations running seamlessly to serve our customers. Stay safe and well. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry. Okay. I'll let Barry answer the last one in more detail. I think the answer to \u2013 the short answer to your question is, yeah, we continue to like the idea of third-party capital for stabilized assets. But I'll let Barry give you a full answer on that. On the first one, in terms \u2013 so, thanks for the question, Eric, on innovation and the importance of that, not just in a post-COVID world, but absolutely in the current environment. We continue to see traction on some of the things I highlighted last time in terms of what I call remote collaboration and collaborating remotely. Like I gave the example last time I think on unemployment benefits, where we're actually facilitating folks to be able to be working away from home and both receive the application for unemployment and approve it, and then, also some of the areas around mailroom which, again, I think I highlighted last time. One area I would add in addition to that, so we continue to see more and more traction for those kinds of solutions. One area too that we've seen, a good uptick in the recent past is what we call our Clean Start program. And the Clean Start program is something that we launched a year ago, which is really helping people to re-imagine their needs to their office space, and get information flows to be more seamless when they're at work, and then, also to get things off site for things that they don't need around the office and it allows them to work in a much more flexible way. When we came into COVID that actually got \u2013 the brakes got put on that, because part of the Clean Start was, we would go into offices and do surveys and help \u2013 working with their real estate people to help them re-imagine and rebuild their work processes. And some of that, the exhaust of that process, obviously, is storage, but also some of the other services that we provide is Iron Mountain. When we got into the crisis, our real estate team product management, sales and marketing team collaborated and they created a Clean Start kit in a box, if you will. So what we've done is we've been able to put that together in a kit that allows us to deliver the same type of assessment in survey virtually without actually going into their offices. And we just recently, for instance, had a very large win with a global insurance company that was selling part of its insurance portfolio to a life insurance company, where we not only did facilitated moving sensitive records, many containing PII or Personally Identifiable Information across to that new owner of those policies and that information, but transfer a number of their employees across and at the same time help them repurpose the real estate footprint that they were left with. So it was kind of real estate optimization, helping them transfer a business to another person, transfer of people and then take a step back and say how can we actually improve the information flow in what they have left. So it just gives you another flavor of the types of things that we're finding out there. Oh, okay. Hey, Adam. Thanks for the question. A couple of points there, I would say, look, our service business performed better throughout \u2013 in the quarter than we had anticipated. As you know, on the last call, we noted that we thought we'd use April as a proxy going forward for the entire second quarter. April and May, generally speaking, really across the world and across our various service activity lines were very consistent. Shred was down kind of high 20%s in April, about 30% in May. It also recovered just like directionally the rest of the business was down in the vicinity of 10% on activity basis in June and kind of stayed at that level in July. I would say that, that trajectory of improvement in June, as I noted, was really pervasive across all of our activities. As it relates to paper price, in particular, the way I would think about this, Adam, is on our last call, we were \u2013 well, in the first quarter, we had a $10 million hit to EBITDA from paper prices, as you recall. In \u2013 on our last call, we thought that we would have kind of low- to mid-single-digit dollar decline as a result of paper price for each of the next couple of quarters. We actually had a $2 million positive to EBITDA as I mentioned on the call. Now, I will say that paper prices have been very volatile and have been declining quite significantly over the last couple of months, you've probably seen that in the industry data, I know you follow that. And so our view for the back half is that it will be basically neutral year-on-year as it relates to EBITDA. So thanks for the question, Adam. Yeah. The only thing, Nate, I would add on the pricing side, because I think your question, regarding your questions a little bit, in this environment, do you still \u2013 are you still seeing the same stickiness? The thing that \u2013 we knew that we were an essential business based on government authorities. As I said, even at the peak, we were 96% of our facilities were open around the globe. Now it's 100%. But the one thing that we've seen is that we've been able to continue to get the price increases that we expected, our customers really see us as essential as well. And that was further reinforced. I think, Barry highlighted in his introductory remarks that in the month of June, not only the DSOs go down year-on-year, but the month of June with lower sales, we collected more cash than we did June last year. So in other words, people really do see that our services are essential to keep their businesses up and running. So we haven't seen any really noise around the price increases that we were able to achieve last year in the current environment. Thanks, Jon. It's good to hear this morning. So I think first of all, the market extreme \u2013 both of those markets extremely well. So first on Singapore, we're continuing to keep an eye on it, because, as you probably realize, we're tracking on a track that we're going to be sold out in Singapore pretty soon. So you're right that the government has put a pause on it. We have heard the \u2013 it just so happens that our head of Asia data centers is a Singaporean based in Singapore. So he stays pretty close to the government. We are seeing that the government seems to be making noises to relax that a little bit sooner than they initially guided, say, a year ago. So we're optimistic. And obviously we're starting to or have been for a number of months now looking at how we could actually expand our footprint in Singapore. As I said the \u2013 we're well on track to fill out the old Credit Suisse data center fairly soon. On Amsterdam, interesting, we have actually quite a bit of land permitted. So we've been less engaged with the government trying to relax that. On the other side, it's exactly as you said is, we've seen even a number of people who have their own data centers in the Amsterdam market, for instance, coming in and starting to look to add capacity in our facilities, because of the permitting issue that you've described. And obviously, Amsterdam is a highly connected market in our facility as a high level of connectivity within it. So it's actually playing through our strength, because we have the capacity in \u2013 but the rest of the market is constrained. Okay, Sheila. Good morning and thanks for those questions. First off, we feel great about how Summit is doing. I think, the team is very aligned and they're very focused on delivering. I think the total company is energized by the fact that this is really an opportunity to transform the company and support our customers that much better. In terms of how it's stacking up, the second quarter of $40 million benefit year-on-year was right in line, if not a little bit ahead of what we were expecting. So we're at $65 million year-to-date, obviously, those are elevated levels as compared to what we were expecting earlier as we increase the benefit this year last quarter. So we're well on track to deliver $150 million of benefit this year. My guess is that next year, we will have another $150 million to $200 million of incremental benefit. And we'll exit next year at a run rate that has all of the benefits the entire $375 million by 2022. So a little small amount of incremental benefit there in 2022 to plan for your models in terms of where it's coming from. It's generally been thus far, probably in the vicinity of 70%, 75% from SG&A and the balance and cost of sales. You'll notice you're looking at our performance this quarter, our cost of sales, obviously, down a lot more and that reflects the fact that we made those temporary cost cuts that we talked about in the form of furloughs and et cetera. Going forward, I think, you'll see even more of Summit coming from a more balanced approach across the income statement. As initially as Bill, as commented before, the first rounds of summit were really in the SG&A area. There will be more going forward. But I think as a relative basis, sort of last quarter, we talked some about the SLA changes, which by the way, are going very, very well. Those will continue to stack incremental benefits going forward. And some of that, obviously, will be in the cost of sales line. As it relates to the tax refund, I think that was the last question. We did have about $27 million of cash refunds in the quarter as compared to prior year. Last year, we actually paid more on a cash basis. So if you're looking at AFFO, it's almost a $35 million swing year-on-year. That's one time. And we \u2013 those are for prior-year refunds that we received during the quarter. So thanks for those questions, Sheila. Good morning. Yeah, I didn't quite get the question, Michael. It was a customer churn on data center or customer churn in the records business? On the records business, yeah. So, look, the customer churn is actually we think a little bit lower than normal than we would see. So that's when I made the comment in my introductory remarks that when we kind of normalize in a post-COVID world on one side, we would expect a pause. In other words, we don't expect the same drag on incoming volume, but on permanent withdrawals is that we saw a downtick in this quarter, because people are not in the office or making active decisions to actually withdraw. So we expected to kind of revert back to the normal levels. But if you kind of look at overall volume, I think the question behind your question is, what do we think is going to happen to volume when we get out of COVID. So on one side we would expect permanent withdrawals to go up, back to normalized levels. But on the other side is we would expect the incoming volume from our customers to come back up. And so that gives you kind of a bit of science around that if it's helpful. Let's first of all, kind of anchor on what we see with our customers right now in this environment in terms of activity. So last week when I was in New York, in New Jersey, and had to catch up with one evening with the President and Chief Operating Officer of a large global bank that's based in New York. And we were comparing notes on how many people come back to the office, et cetera. And what he shared with me is that at the depth of the crisis, say, in April, they had less than 3% of their workforce coming into the office. And whether you're standing \u2013 when I was meeting with them last week in July, they had invited 20% of the people to come back, and only 6% came back. And you're probably seeing similar things in BAML. So then, let's kind of say, how is that translated in the activity we see in terms of incoming boxes; when I say that, where are we going to end when we have COVID in the rearview mirror? So if we look at incoming boxes in April, so if you remember, like in their case, only 3% of their people, less than 3% of their people were coming into the office. We were down 58% in North America. If I'm just taking North America as an example as that is a proxy, we're down 58% on incoming box volume. If we look at the quarter, as Barry mentioned, we're down about 47% overall in North America in terms of incoming box. Now, if you looked at July, we're down about 38%. So basically July is about a 20% improvement from what we saw on average in Q2. So if we were down, say, 4 million, 4.5 million cubic feet, due to \u2013 in Q2 from our records management business, or net, we said minus 3.8 million cubic feet, we were 4.5 million cubic feet worse than normal. But let's say, we were down negative 3.8 million cubic feet, then we would say that based on a 20% \u2013 the 20% improvement that we've seen in July is worst-case scenario. You project that forward is we're down about 3 million cubic feet a quarter, right? So that's 12 million cubic feet on an annualized basis. Now, we don't expect it to plateau at these levels, obviously, because we're still only running it in financial services, less than 6% of the people that are coming to work. But with \u2013 even if we plateau at the current levels, we're seeing is you'd be a 12 million annual drag, a negative 12 million annual drag on our records management business in terms of physical storage. And that's before adding consumer back in. So when you net it all out is that worst case, especially with the offset that we get from consumer, is that we think that adding, our normal price of 2% to 3%, it's manageable, where the most likely scenario is we'll continue to see improvement, people will start \u2013 I don't think we're going to stay at 6% of the workforce coming to the office, it will go back up. And that's why we said in our remarks is we expect in a post-COVID world is will be kind of flattish to slightly up in the records management business, and then consumer will drive additional growth on top of that. I don't know if that's helpful."

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Greer Aviv, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nGreer Aviv: Thank you, Francesca. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. The user controlled slides are available on our Investor Relations website along with a link to today\u2019s webcast and earnings materials. On today's call, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, Iron Mountain's President and CEO, who will discuss Q1 highlights and our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Barry Hytinen, our CFO will then cover financial results, our leverage and liquidity position and our expectations for the remainder of the year. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the lines for Q&A. Referring now to slide 2 of the presentation. Today's earnings materials will contain forward looking statements. Most notably, the impact from COVID-19 and our expectations of how that may impact our operations and financial performance in 2020 and expectations from Project Summit. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's earnings materials, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our annual report on Form 10-K and future SEC filings for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial information, and the reconciliations to these measures as required by Reg G are included in the supplemental financial information. With that Bill, would you please begin?\nBill Meaney: Thank you, Greer, and thank you all for taking time to join us. First and foremost, let me start by saying, I hope you are all healthy and well and our thoughts go out to all those who have been impacted by COVID-19. I also would like to say, thank you to our employees in particular our front line mountaineers, who are on the road and in our facilities every day. As many of our services are considered essential, many of our colleagues have been ensuring our customers' needs are met as seamlessly as possible. Our mountaineers have shown selfless dedication and resilience in these challenging times. As we go through this morning's call, I will focus my remarks on a few key subjects. How we are responding and managing the business in light of COVID-19 pandemic; the new service and storage revenue opportunities we have seized, as we respond in real-time to our customers' changing needs, and the durability and strength of our core storage and data center businesses, which provide valuable recurring revenue during times such as these. First, we continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 situation, which as you are aware continues to evolve at a rapid pace. Our top priority is to ensure the safety and security of our people, their families and our customers. As a global business, we have been assessing the situation and implementing extensive precautionary measures since first learning about the virus in January. We have been constant. First in Asia and now globally in striving to minimize the spread of the virus and its impacts on our people, the communities we operate in and our customers. We have been serving our customers many of which are considered essential businesses in new and innovative ways as they navigate this pandemic. Now let me address the current situation, the impact on our business, and what we are doing to mitigate that impact. As an example, we are reserving storage base for critical assets and unanticipated inventory volumes, including supplies needed by health responders in food and drug retailers. We are also providing outflow storage for businesses now stockpiling inventory due to service or supply chain disruptions. In addition, we are availing our customers of our digital and AI-based services to facilitate remote working on a range of activities, including distribution of mail from corporate mailrooms to providing a digital solution allowing the processing of unemployment benefits remotely. The first quarter introduced unprecedented challenges and required us to closely examine our priorities and focus on what we could do beyond our normal course of business to remain strong, resilient and well positioned to support all of our stakeholders. Fortunately, Iron Mountain is considered an essential service in many locations and sectors where we operate. In our global records and information management business, we have been able to keep more than 96% of our facilities open at varying levels of operations all with heightened safety and cleaning procedures in place. We are seeing a need for new and more creative solutions in our digital solutions and global data center businesses. To help our customers respond to COVID-19, we are providing storage and distribution of PPE and other critical health care supplies and are offering innovative solutions around document scanning and application of artificial intelligence through our Insight platform, which can help enable our customers' home-based workforces. Whilst there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the length of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing recovery from an economic perspective, I am confident we will get through this and come out an even stronger company. We are already seeing customers seek out new services that have resulted in revenue. So whilst it's possible that customers may not use our services the same way they did historically, we are confident that we will be able to continue to generate new revenue streams. Our customer-facing teams have been closely listening to customers, engaging differently in solving problems that didn't even exist a few short months ago. We are deepening relationships with our customers and further differentiating Iron Mountain from our peers, many of which do not have our level of financial strength, breadth of digital and physical offerings and flexibility. We believe this positions Iron Mountain better for the longer term. Liquidity remains the top priority from a financial perspective, and we are operating from a strong liquidity and cash position. Barry will provide more detail on the specific actions we are taking but at a high level we are prioritizing cash generation, and we have taken action to reduce operating expenses in discretionary capital expenditures, including M&A. As of the end of the first quarter, we had more than $1.2 billion in liquidity between cash on hand and availability on our revolving credit facility. This strong balance sheet should provide us with sufficient runway to operate the business in this uncertain environment. As you would expect in a crisis such as this, our service levels have experienced significant declines in numerous geographies as many customers have instituted mandatory work from home policies or ban visits to their offices and facilities from external parties. The timing and magnitude of decline in service activity has varied by market and by product line. Whilst we are a global company with operations in over 50 markets, our exposure to countries that saw a peak in Q1, such as China, is limited, so we did not see a significant service activity decline until mid-March for the majority of our business. In our records management and secure shred businesses, which account for approximately 75% of our service revenue. Service activity has declined by 40% to 50% during the times when the respective markets have had restrictions in place as compared to the prior year. As restrictions are lifted, we expect this service activity to gradually pick back up. For instance, in our Chinese markets, we are seeing current service activity at 60% to 70% of normal levels, which has improved from only approximately 20% at the peak of the virus spread in China. While service generally contributes only about 20% of our profit, given the size of the decline as well as some of the fixed costs in the business, the impact is significant. As we have encountered this slowdown, we have made tough decisions that impact our fellow Iron Mountain colleagues. In an effort to keep our labor costs in line with levels of service activity, we have either furloughed, reduced hours or utilized other temporary reduction measures for approximately 1/3 of our global workforce. We have also managed costs by putting on hold our -- on recruiting activity in terminating most of our temporary and contract workers in our global records and information management business. Decisions that impact our employees are never taken lightly, and we have set up numerous resources to support impacted employees during this unprecedented time. This includes, but is not limited to, continue to provide benefits in sponsoring the employee portion of health care for impacted employees, helping our employees utilize their respective government programs available to those individuals unemployed or furloughed, assisting our colleagues with outplacement support and actively assisting employees through our employee funded relief fund. At the same time, our core storage business remains durable, and we continue to benefit from our deep and long-lasting customer relationships. Whilst we have seen a slowdown in the new boxes that we have been able to inbound, the majority of our storage revenue is from existing boxes that were inbounded in prior months and years, and we continue to earn revenue on that inventory. However, the impact the crisis will have on our future organic storage rental revenue growth and volume remains unknown and is dependent on the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. In Q1, total organic storage revenue grew 3%, supported by strong benefits from revenue management. Global organic volume in Q1 was flat compared to Q4, driven primarily by growth in adjacent businesses and consumer of 8% and 5%, respectively on a sequential basis. Organic global records management volume declined approximately 600,000 cubic feet from the fourth quarter. Due to the impact of COVID 2019, we expect our volume of incoming boxes for the remaining of the year to be lower than we initially expected entering the year, but we will continue to look for ways to mitigate the slowdown. As I mentioned before, we also remain in active dialogue with our customers about leveraging existing and customized Iron Mountain solutions to help them navigate this difficult situation. I want to briefly mention a few key examples. One of our digital services that have benefited our customers during this crisis is Image on Demand. This service provides safe, contact list, digital delivery, which enhances the chain of custody security and provides a quick 24-hour turnaround online delivery. This solution enables customers to be more effective by sharing information with those who need it, whilst ensuring the information security and privacy are maintained, which is even more necessary in today's remote environment. Another example is one where we are helping one of our customers, a national health care provider, which was struggling with a surge in the need for medical supplies and supply chain challenges. This particular customer needed to distribute critical PPE to 32,000 employees at 750 sites in 36 US states and required a secure location to prep PPE kits without taking up valuable space that was being used to care for patients. In order to meet those critical needs, we provided non-records business storage and logistics support. We in-bounded in stored pallets from multiple suppliers, prepared PPE kits made up of 12 to 15 items and distributed the kits to healthcare sites. This is only one example of how we have helped many of our healthcare and medical customers during these trying times. A third relevant example is a government labor department that needed to maintain critical processes whilst enabling home-based workers to process high volumes of unemployment claim records as quickly as possible. The government agency leveraged our InSight Essentials platform, which enabled the government department to receive the scan claims via our InSight application to more than 800 unemployment examiners. We will continue to store the hard copy records for them until they need to be securely destroyed. We are currently speaking to multiple U.S. states about similar solutions to address both elevated volume and unemployment and Medicare claims during this crisis as well as the need for remote working of the teams approving the claims. As you would expect, our global data center business has also been resilient as an unprecedented number of organizations are adjusting to remote working practices, which has driven a substantial increase in traffic and the need for additional bandwidth. Moreover, the current pandemic further underscores the vital and expanding role of multi-tenant data center play in an increasingly digital economy. COVID-19 is causing companies to evaluate and accelerate their digital transformation journeys, especially as it relates to outsourcing their IT infrastructure and fortifying their remote capabilities. In fact, industry experts believe that COVID-19 is serving to fast-track trends that were already evident in the data center industry, which bodes well for this portion of our business moving forward. Looking at recent performance, our global data center business had a strong Q1 with organic revenue growth of almost 10%. We signed 6.4 megawatts of new and expansion leases and our pipeline remains robust. This leasing consisted of a 3-megawatt booking with a new logo, a leading hyperscale enterprise software provider, which also includes a contractually committed reservation for an additional 2-megawatts and our expanded campus in Phoenix. We also continued to maintain good momentum with our enterprise customers. Commercially despite an unprecedented macro backdrop, our data center team continues to receive significant engagement in RFPs for both hyperscale, corporate and government requirements. The team has quickly adjusted to the new normal of remote working and has been innovative and continue to meet our current and prospective customer needs, including hosting virtual data center tours to support demand and the increased need for capacity. We are committed to ensuring uptime and resiliency for our data center customers and we are ready with capacity and our staff to handle support, upgrades and new installations if additional bandwidth is needed whilst remote workforces are supported. One area that we continue to monitor closely is the impact on the pace of construction of our -- for our data centers currently under development. While it's not significant, we do see modest delays across many of our projects, which is also happening across the industry. Given our relatively high capacity utilization of almost 90%, should delays extend or increase in length, this could create a tight supply situation. As I said, we are keeping a close eye on this and are in regular contact with all of our vendors and construction partners. And at this moment, we do not foresee it will materially impact our anticipated bookings and delivery for this year. As we look ahead these are truly unprecedented times and the path to recovery is clouded by uncertainty and will likely be choppy. It is very difficult to predict how long this current environment will go on. And what the new normal will look like on the other side. It will undoubtedly be lasting changes to how we work and how our customers will conduct business. Given the combined effects of the pandemic and the associated financial impact on the global economy, we believe a conservative approach is warranted. As you can see from our Q1 results, Project Summit is off to a strong start. Now that our project teams are up and running, and given the speed with which we implemented Wave One, we have identified additional opportunities to accelerate strategies to streamline our business and operations. We have pulled forward a number of initiatives that were planned for waves two and three of Project Summit and expect to see those benefits materialize at a faster pace in 2020. In addition to finding new ways to work differently with our customers as we roll out Project Summit, COVID-19 has uncovered ways for us to support our customers as they adjust to remote work -- to a remote working environment. Our customers' increased need for digital delivery has allowed us to reassess our service delivery model. Our R&D and growth initiatives have well positioned us with services like Image on Demand to address customers' changing needs as they adapt to new ways of working. Leveraging these new technology capabilities, enables us to adjust our service delivery model and more efficiently utilize our fleet, labor and real estate. The most impactful changes to our service delivery model revolve around new service level agreements or SLAs. These new agreements will allow us to better align our external customer SLAs with our internal record center SLAs as well as leverage more effective use of digital delivery to serve our customers. In addition, we will also utilize third party logistics providers more extensively than we have historically for our pickups and delivery. We have proactively communicated with our customers in some of our largest markets regarding these changes and have begun implementing the SLA changes, which has resulted in some additional reduction in force across the business. This broadened scope of Project Summit should result in even higher levels of adjusted EBITDA benefit and associated charges than we initially expected. Project Summit is now expected to generate $375 million of adjusted EBITDA benefits exiting 2021. This represents a meaningful increase from the prior expectation of $200 million. The total program is expected to cost approximately $450 million, up from our prior expectation of $240 million. In closing, this additional benefit from Project Summit should only further propel the underlying strength of our business once we emerge from COVID -- from the COVID-19 situation. Our strong performance in Q1, together with the additional promise from an expanded Project Summit makes us confident that we will emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic as an even stronger company than envisioned before. We continue to demonstrate resilience and determination and show all of our customers and communities that they can count on us in their time of need and that Iron Mountain really is iron. I want to thank all of my fellow mountaineers and their families again for their perseverance in these difficult times and I pray for their safety. I hope all of you and your loved ones are remaining safe and well. With that, I turn the call over to you Barry.\nBarry Hytinen: Thanks, Bill, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results. I want to echo Bill's comments. I hope you are all safe and healthy. I would like to say thank you to our Iron Mountain team. I've been truly impressed by the team's commitment, hard work and perseverance during these challenging times. As Bill noted we are confident that we will emerge from this period a stronger company driven by our durable business model and the strength of our balance sheet. I will briefly touch on our first quarter performance before discussing our approach to addressing the pandemic. In the first quarter, we exceeded our expectations. And through the first nine weeks of the quarter, we were on track to exceed our targets even more substantially. Though by mid-March, our service activity began to experience declines compared to planned as more customers instituted mandatory work-from-home policies and restricted visits to their facilities. Despite this, we delivered a strong performance across our key metrics of revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS, and AFFO. Revenue of $1.1 billion increased 1.4% on a reported basis and 3.2% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Total organic revenue grew by 1% in the first quarter. This was primarily driven by organic, storage, rental revenue growth of 3%, which reflected our successful execution of revenue management. Adjusted EBITDA grew 11.9% for the first quarter to $363 million despite the negative impact from lower paper prices in foreign exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA grew almost 14%. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 320 basis points year-over-year to 34%. Adjusted EPS was $0.27, up significantly from $0.17 in the first quarter 2019. AFFO grew 20% year-over-year to $231 million, driven by adjusted EBITDA growth. This represents a new quarterly high for Iron Mountain, reflecting our team's focus on driving cash generation and increasing levels of AFFO overtime. Turning to segment performance, global RIM delivered total organic revenue growth of 60 basis points for the quarter, reflecting volume growth in faster growing markets and revenue management, partially offset by lower year-over-year paper prices. Global RIM's adjusted EBITDA margin of 41%, represents an increase of 230 basis points driven by revenue management, benefits from Project Summit and continuous improvement initiatives. The data center business delivered organic revenue growth of 9.9%, driven by strong leasing and low churn of 50 basis points. Data centers EBITDA margin of 45.9%, represents an increase of 360 basis points consistent with our long-term goal to drive margin expansion. As a reminder as we move through the balance of the year on a reported basis, the 2019 data center results have some one-time benefits that we called out last year, which make the year-over-year comparisons less meaningful. Turning to Project Summit, as Bill mentioned, we are on track and have accelerated and expanded initiatives in certain areas in response to COVID-19. In the first quarter, we recognized $41 million of restructuring charges to implement the remainder of the first wave plus components of wave two, which contributed to the first quarter benefit of $25 million. With the increased size and scope of the program, we now expect to realize the full $375 million of benefit related to Project Summit exiting 2021 with all actions complete and the associated $450 million of charges incurred by the end of 2021. In 2020, we now expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA benefits associated with Project Summit activities of $150 million compared with our prior expectation of the $80 million in restructuring charges of $240 million, up from $130 million previously. Now, I would like to provide an update on how COVID-19 is impacting our business and what actions we are taking to ensure we are well-positioned. Given the macro uncertainty, we want to be as transparent as possible to help inverters understand what we are seeing. To that end, I'm going to provide Insights that are more granular than we typically provide. But first I want to put into perspective how much of our storage revenue is generated by what is already on the shelf at the beginning of the year. As a reminder, our core storage business accounts for nearly two-thirds of our total revenue and a larger portion of our profitability. In a typical year, new volume accounts for less than 3% of our annual storage revenue. In other words, nearly all of our annual storage revenue comes from boxes that entered our facilities in prior years. As Bill mentioned, in markets where our ability to service customer facilities is limited, we have naturally seen a decline in the number of boxes that we are able to pickup. Partially as a result of this, we currently expect a net decline in cube volume in 2020, but of course that is subject to change based on the duration of the pandemic. As you would expect, the impact this has on storage revenue is much more muted than the impact it has on our service activity levels. Turning to our service business, which was about 35% of our 2019 revenue. In April, we saw activity declined approximately 40% overall, on the service business. As investors would expect, the impact has not been uniform across our service lines, so let's take a look at how this has trended across our business. I will use North America as an example, as it is both our largest market. And fairly representative of the activity levels, we have seen in other markets with similar closures and restrictions. Records management in North America, for the month of April had a 58% year-over-year reduction in new boxes in bounded and a 49% year-over-year reduction in retrievals and re-files. Data management activity in April declined less approximately 30%. A digital solution has seen a slowdown in activity compared to the first quarter, though April activity levels were flat year-over-year. In our shred business, activity declined approximately 27% in April, which has led to a corresponding decline in our paper tonnage. While we have seen an encouraging rebound in the market for paper prices recently, our average realized price in the first quarter was 44% lower than the prior year, which was a $10 million headwind to adjusted EBITDA. Consistent with the broader industry trends, we saw a sequential improvement in paper price of about 2.5% in the first quarter. And the trend has continued to improve. As investors will recall, in the past we have mentioned that a $10 per tonne change in paper price, represents an approximate $6 million EBITDA impact. Of course, this is clearly influenced by volume, so the EBITDA impact of paper price movement will change proportionately with the change in paper volume. Now, let me make a couple of comments on two of our smaller businesses. The Fine Arts industry has experienced a significant slowdown, during the pandemic. And given the nonessential nature of the business, we have temporarily closed all of our Fine Arts facilities. With a prudent view as to the intermediate term impact, we recorded $23 million non-cash impairment charge on the goodwill associated with that reporting unit. The consumer storage business through our partnership with MakeSpace, has seen an increase in demand. This led to over 5% growth in storage volume in the first quarter. And we have continued to see strong demand in April. Given the nature of the service level decline I just discussed, we have taken actions which we expect to be temporary and are in addition to the actions we had underway, with Project Summit. These actions include furloughs, reduced work hours, a pause in hiring, reductions in certain expenses like travel, and lower variable compensation. With these adjustments, we anticipate we will have removed in excess of $350 million on an annualized basis as compared to our prior plans. You will see these reductions materialize in cost of sales within our service business, as well as in our SG&A expenses. These actions are designed to help align our costs and revenues, as we navigate the uncertain environment. Therefore, we expect these costs to come back as revenue recovers. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, we are confident, in our balance sheet strength and liquidity position. In the first quarter, our team did a nice job driving cash cycle improvement up eight days year-on-year with benefits coming from both payables days and day's sales outstanding. I view the team's performance is particularly strong, given the COVID-19 backdrop. We continue to see the opportunity for further cash cycle improvement over the long-term. We ended the quarter with $153 million of cash and together with the availability under our revolving credit facility we had approximately $1.2 billion of liquidity. At this point in early May, our liquidity remains unchanged at that level, which we believe provides us ample runway to operate the business, in this uncertain environment. For context, this liquidity represents over three times the 2019, full year adjusted EBITDA of our service business. With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share earlier this week to be paid in early July. As the economy recovers in 2022 and 2023 and with a sustainable dividend at this level, we would expect our payout ratio to glide toward the mid-60s to low 70s, as a percent of AFFO. As we noted in our press release, we are no longer providing guidance for 2020, in light of the unknown severity and duration of the impact of the crisis on our markets and customers. However, we don't want to help you understand how we are currently planning for the remainder of 2020. Let me start with the impact of the much stronger U.S. dollar. Based on recent FX rates, we currently expect a full year impact on our revenue of about $100 million versus last year. At the time of our last call, FX rates implied an adjusted EBITDA headwind of about $5 million. Though with a stronger dollar, current FX rates translate into a full year adjusted EBITDA headwind of $35 million versus last year. Turning to activity levels, we are expecting April to be representative of the trends we experienced for the remainder of the second quarter, which we expect to be the weakest quarter in 2020 for comparative revenue and adjusted EBITDA change. Although recent trends suggest this may prove to be conservative as more and more of our customers around the world are gradually opening back up and we are seeing other positive indicators. I will note we are maintaining flexibility to rebound quickly, if business conditions improve faster than expected. And on the other hand, if conditions worsen we have already identified additional options that can be executed quickly as needed. At this point, we anticipate delivering full year adjusted EBITDA margin flat to slightly up compared to last year, reflecting our solid first quarter performance, benefits from revenue management, Project Summit and other cost actions. This will be partially offset by our conservative posture as to service revenues and fixed cost deleverage. Given the current environment, we have also quickly taken actions to preserve capital. We reduced capital investments both for capital expenditures and M&A by a net total of $110 million relative to our original guidance for 2020. This is made up of approximately $110 million of reduced CapEx and $75 million of reduced investment in M&A and acquisitions of customer relationships. This net total also reflects an increased investment of $75 million, to support the construction of our Frankfurt data center. Additional detail can be seen in the supplemental and is highlighted on slide 14 of our presentation. We continue to expect to generate capital recycling proceeds of approximately $100 million in 2020. As we look at the market for industrial assets, we continue to see attractive valuations and our pipeline has actually increased over the last couple of months. As investors would expect, we have run multiple scenarios based on varying assumptions for revenue, margins the duration of the crisis and the speed of recovery. Included in these scenarios are some extreme stress test models, which we develop to understand the possible impact, if conditions worsened materially and persisted for an extended period of time. One of the stress test we ran was based on service activity being down about 65% year-on-year and persisting at that level through 2021. Even in that scenario, we do not foresee an issue with liquidity or leverage through 2021. I'll also note, the severity and duration of our stress tests are much more extreme than both what we have seen thus far and what current trends and macro forecasts indicate we will likely experience. Even still we would have significant cushion in terms of both liquidity and leverage. In closing, we are confident in the durability of our storage business and believe the magnitude of impact on our service business combined with the actions we have taken leave us in a strong financial position. We look forward to sharing further progress with you on our second quarter earnings call. I hope everyone stays safe and healthy. And with that, operator please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Shiela McGrath with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nSheila McGrath: Hi. Yes, good morning. That was very positive news on your guidance on the savings from Project Summit. I was just wondering, can you explain in a little bit more detail where that upside is coming from? Where you're finding those savings?\nBill Meaney: Good morning, Sheila. Thanks for the question. So as we got into COVID-19, as I alluded to is that our customers needed to be served a different way. And we already had a Summit teams spun up to look at our cost of sales. And what we found was, if we look specifically at SLAs for instance returning a box in 24 hours -- returning a box in 24 hours in this environment where people are working remotely wasn't going to help. So what we've done is we've actually in the major markets we've already implemented this. So this is United States, Canada, Ireland, the U.K., Australia and New Zealand. As we said, we're taking that to five business days so once a week we will pick up or deliver physical boxes. If they need something quicker then we will actually digitize it and we'll send it to them in a digital secure link through our InSight platform in Image on Demand. So we're actually giving them a better service and at the same time changing from 24 hours to five business days or once a week. You can imagine how significant that impact is on our logistics operations and allows us to really take out quite a bit of cost.\nSheila McGrath: Okay. And then also I was just wondering, if you could comment on the dividend philosophy. As your \u2013 many REITs have chosen to revisit their dividend just as a source of liquidity. And just want to understand how you're thinking about the dividend?\nBill Meaney: Well, I think we're blessed by being kind of an industry one. So we're a specialized REIT and our operations are still running strongly. We \u2013 although service has been impacted as Barry said 40% to 50% that's on 20% of our profits or 40% of our sales. So whilst it's impactful it's not a threat to our liquidity. So for our \u2013 from our standpoint, there isn't a liquidity reason that we would have to adjust our dividend. And then, as if you look at 2022, where we think we'll be looking at COVID in the back \u2013 in the rearview mirror by 2022. So we're assuming that it doesn't happen until then. Then we're actually gliding quite nicely into our original goal in our financial models as we get into the 2022 and 2023 period in terms of getting into the mid-60s to low-70s as payout as a percentage of AFFO. So we feel good about where we are. We'd rather not have COVID-19 because we would have gotten there much faster, but we feel good about the position.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Nate Crossett with Berenberg. Please go ahead.\nNate Crossett : Hey, good morning. Just a follow-up on Sheila's question about Summit, so how much of that $175 million benefit is coming from that SLA change, and are there any other kind of big drivers in there?\nBill Meaney: Yes. So thanks Nate for the question. So it is -- that is actually the major driver. Because if you look at our cost of service, which is a combination of labor, fleet in terms of the trucks that we put on the road and our facilities. It is -- we are one -- it is actually the largest cost as a company. And when you then say okay we're going to a five-day or once a week service cycle which allows us to marshal or consolidate volumes much more. And then for more rapid turnaround to give people digital ways of getting that back it's a major change in terms of cost of sales. We always as part of Project Summit we're going to optimize the cost of sales across those three labor trucking and facilities. But actually changing that from a 24-hour rhythm to a once a week rhythm is super impactful.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi. Two questions. I didn't understand if this new rhythm for delivery to once a week from once every day was also positioned for the post-COVID environment meaning it would stay? And my second question Barry is with the stepped-up benefits from Project Summit when you reach those benefits what would be the implied EBITDA margin?\nBill Meaney: So Andrew on the first one yes this is -- and we communicated that to our customers. This is beyond COVID. And in fact, this probably is something that could have happened before, but it's easier to actually get people to change their mindset in terms of how they want to be served given the current environment. Because if you think about the 24-hour SLAs than something that was historical in the business for decades. And the way people use the information that they retrieve now is very different. And quite frankly, lots of times they'd rather have it electronically. So yes this is -- COVID was -- it allowed us to have the catalyst to have that conversation with the customers, but it's permanent going forward.\nBarry Hytinen: Hi. Andrew, thanks for the question. Good morning. While we're not giving guidance for even this year's EBITDA, it's a little bit hard to get into projecting how much of that extra $175 million of benefit from Summit going forward is going to be as it relates to the numerator and denominator of EBITDA and sales. But certainly, if you thought about that $175 million incremental in sort of perpetuity and that's the way you should because it's a ongoing benefit. And put that against either our prior guidance or last year's results, for example, it is a very significant increase in the relative level of profitability and will certainly dramatically assist us in our goal of increasing margin and moving that into the very high 30s, if not potentially beyond going forward. But I think what we'll do is take it one quarter at a time this year and provide you updates as how we're doing. But I will tell you as Bill -- I'll reiterate Bill's point, we feel very good about what we've got going on with respect to Summit and the way the teams are performing. And we look forward to reporting the progress against that with you every quarter.\nAndrew Steinerman: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Marlane Pereiro with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nMarlane Pereiro: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Just a quick one. Just to clarify, under your extreme scenarios, you anticipate not staying within both your maintenance and incurrence covenants, is that correct?\nBarry Hytinen: Yes.\nMarlane Pereiro: Okay. I mean, do you have -- would you be able to provide roughly an idea of how much cushion or headroom that you would have under those scenarios?\nBarry Hytinen: So I mean let me frame it this way for you. As we think about leverage for this year based on the -- our current view of trends and the outline of how Bill and I spoke about it earlier, we would expect leverage to be flattish to maybe slightly up year-on-year at year-end this year. Now I will note that it is a positive development I think speaks to the team's progress and the performance we put up in the first quarter that are actually our leverage ticked down a 10th from year-end. But when we stress test the business, it probably slightly above those levels, but we feel very good about in each scenario. I don't want to give and I think you can appreciate why specific leverage points under various stress tests because there are so many models -- so many elements that go into those models. But as we said on the call, we would have sufficient cushion in both the leverage -- on all the tests that you mentioned as well as liquidity. So we feel very good about where we're positioned. And that is thanks to the incremental Summit benefits, we've pulled forward here at the incremental Summit benefits coming from the SLA changes that Bill mentioned, as well as the cost actions we took to align revenues and costs in this period here during the pandemic.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Franois \u2013 it\u2019s from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Okay, excuse me. The next question is from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.\nAndrew Steinerman: One more. Yes just one more question from me Andrew. Organic revenue growth in storage. Is your working assumption that it stays positive throughout the year?\nBill Meaney: Yes.\nAndrew Steinerman: Okay. Thanks very much.\nOperator: The next question is from Franois Mambo [ph]. The next question is from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. Thank you. Maybe just give a little thought as to the impact on kind of both the storage and the data center business longer term given the shift in service, do you expect any impact on the storage business? And then ultimately data center as well as it relates to maybe incoming volumes things like that if you think about potential structural changes as a result of COVID-19?\nBill Meaney: On the storage side Kevin post-COVID-19 there \u2013 right now our surveys there's many customers that say that there will be no change as there \u2013 those that say that will be continuing on their current program. So no, we don't expect a major change in the trends that we're seeing on the storage. On data center, as we said is that we've seen actually continued building of our pipeline through COVID-19 and we expect that to continue to be strong on the other side. We can't tell you right now if our strong pipeline is just because of the momentum we were building into the \u2013 in the data center business as we were coming in or specific to COVID-19. But yes, there's nothing that we're hearing from customers that's saying that their demand post COVID-19 is going to be any different on the data center side than what we're seeing in terms of the positive momentum in the basis today.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and today's conference call.

            "name": "Bill Meaney",
            "content": "Thank you, Greer, and thank you all for taking time to join us. First and foremost, let me start by saying, I hope you are all healthy and well and our thoughts go out to all those who have been impacted by COVID-19. I also would like to say, thank you to our employees in particular our front line mountaineers, who are on the road and in our facilities every day. As many of our services are considered essential, many of our colleagues have been ensuring our customers' needs are met as seamlessly as possible. Our mountaineers have shown selfless dedication and resilience in these challenging times. As we go through this morning's call, I will focus my remarks on a few key subjects. How we are responding and managing the business in light of COVID-19 pandemic; the new service and storage revenue opportunities we have seized, as we respond in real-time to our customers' changing needs, and the durability and strength of our core storage and data center businesses, which provide valuable recurring revenue during times such as these. First, we continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 situation, which as you are aware continues to evolve at a rapid pace. Our top priority is to ensure the safety and security of our people, their families and our customers. As a global business, we have been assessing the situation and implementing extensive precautionary measures since first learning about the virus in January. We have been constant. First in Asia and now globally in striving to minimize the spread of the virus and its impacts on our people, the communities we operate in and our customers. We have been serving our customers many of which are considered essential businesses in new and innovative ways as they navigate this pandemic. Now let me address the current situation, the impact on our business, and what we are doing to mitigate that impact. As an example, we are reserving storage base for critical assets and unanticipated inventory volumes, including supplies needed by health responders in food and drug retailers. We are also providing outflow storage for businesses now stockpiling inventory due to service or supply chain disruptions. In addition, we are availing our customers of our digital and AI-based services to facilitate remote working on a range of activities, including distribution of mail from corporate mailrooms to providing a digital solution allowing the processing of unemployment benefits remotely. The first quarter introduced unprecedented challenges and required us to closely examine our priorities and focus on what we could do beyond our normal course of business to remain strong, resilient and well positioned to support all of our stakeholders. Fortunately, Iron Mountain is considered an essential service in many locations and sectors where we operate. In our global records and information management business, we have been able to keep more than 96% of our facilities open at varying levels of operations all with heightened safety and cleaning procedures in place. We are seeing a need for new and more creative solutions in our digital solutions and global data center businesses. To help our customers respond to COVID-19, we are providing storage and distribution of PPE and other critical health care supplies and are offering innovative solutions around document scanning and application of artificial intelligence through our Insight platform, which can help enable our customers' home-based workforces. Whilst there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the length of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing recovery from an economic perspective, I am confident we will get through this and come out an even stronger company. We are already seeing customers seek out new services that have resulted in revenue. So whilst it's possible that customers may not use our services the same way they did historically, we are confident that we will be able to continue to generate new revenue streams. Our customer-facing teams have been closely listening to customers, engaging differently in solving problems that didn't even exist a few short months ago. We are deepening relationships with our customers and further differentiating Iron Mountain from our peers, many of which do not have our level of financial strength, breadth of digital and physical offerings and flexibility. We believe this positions Iron Mountain better for the longer term. Liquidity remains the top priority from a financial perspective, and we are operating from a strong liquidity and cash position. Barry will provide more detail on the specific actions we are taking but at a high level we are prioritizing cash generation, and we have taken action to reduce operating expenses in discretionary capital expenditures, including M&A. As of the end of the first quarter, we had more than $1.2 billion in liquidity between cash on hand and availability on our revolving credit facility. This strong balance sheet should provide us with sufficient runway to operate the business in this uncertain environment. As you would expect in a crisis such as this, our service levels have experienced significant declines in numerous geographies as many customers have instituted mandatory work from home policies or ban visits to their offices and facilities from external parties. The timing and magnitude of decline in service activity has varied by market and by product line. Whilst we are a global company with operations in over 50 markets, our exposure to countries that saw a peak in Q1, such as China, is limited, so we did not see a significant service activity decline until mid-March for the majority of our business. In our records management and secure shred businesses, which account for approximately 75% of our service revenue. Service activity has declined by 40% to 50% during the times when the respective markets have had restrictions in place as compared to the prior year. As restrictions are lifted, we expect this service activity to gradually pick back up. For instance, in our Chinese markets, we are seeing current service activity at 60% to 70% of normal levels, which has improved from only approximately 20% at the peak of the virus spread in China. While service generally contributes only about 20% of our profit, given the size of the decline as well as some of the fixed costs in the business, the impact is significant. As we have encountered this slowdown, we have made tough decisions that impact our fellow Iron Mountain colleagues. In an effort to keep our labor costs in line with levels of service activity, we have either furloughed, reduced hours or utilized other temporary reduction measures for approximately 1/3 of our global workforce. We have also managed costs by putting on hold our -- on recruiting activity in terminating most of our temporary and contract workers in our global records and information management business. Decisions that impact our employees are never taken lightly, and we have set up numerous resources to support impacted employees during this unprecedented time. This includes, but is not limited to, continue to provide benefits in sponsoring the employee portion of health care for impacted employees, helping our employees utilize their respective government programs available to those individuals unemployed or furloughed, assisting our colleagues with outplacement support and actively assisting employees through our employee funded relief fund. At the same time, our core storage business remains durable, and we continue to benefit from our deep and long-lasting customer relationships. Whilst we have seen a slowdown in the new boxes that we have been able to inbound, the majority of our storage revenue is from existing boxes that were inbounded in prior months and years, and we continue to earn revenue on that inventory. However, the impact the crisis will have on our future organic storage rental revenue growth and volume remains unknown and is dependent on the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. In Q1, total organic storage revenue grew 3%, supported by strong benefits from revenue management. Global organic volume in Q1 was flat compared to Q4, driven primarily by growth in adjacent businesses and consumer of 8% and 5%, respectively on a sequential basis. Organic global records management volume declined approximately 600,000 cubic feet from the fourth quarter. Due to the impact of COVID 2019, we expect our volume of incoming boxes for the remaining of the year to be lower than we initially expected entering the year, but we will continue to look for ways to mitigate the slowdown. As I mentioned before, we also remain in active dialogue with our customers about leveraging existing and customized Iron Mountain solutions to help them navigate this difficult situation. I want to briefly mention a few key examples. One of our digital services that have benefited our customers during this crisis is Image on Demand. This service provides safe, contact list, digital delivery, which enhances the chain of custody security and provides a quick 24-hour turnaround online delivery. This solution enables customers to be more effective by sharing information with those who need it, whilst ensuring the information security and privacy are maintained, which is even more necessary in today's remote environment. Another example is one where we are helping one of our customers, a national health care provider, which was struggling with a surge in the need for medical supplies and supply chain challenges. This particular customer needed to distribute critical PPE to 32,000 employees at 750 sites in 36 US states and required a secure location to prep PPE kits without taking up valuable space that was being used to care for patients. In order to meet those critical needs, we provided non-records business storage and logistics support. We in-bounded in stored pallets from multiple suppliers, prepared PPE kits made up of 12 to 15 items and distributed the kits to healthcare sites. This is only one example of how we have helped many of our healthcare and medical customers during these trying times. A third relevant example is a government labor department that needed to maintain critical processes whilst enabling home-based workers to process high volumes of unemployment claim records as quickly as possible. The government agency leveraged our InSight Essentials platform, which enabled the government department to receive the scan claims via our InSight application to more than 800 unemployment examiners. We will continue to store the hard copy records for them until they need to be securely destroyed. We are currently speaking to multiple U.S. states about similar solutions to address both elevated volume and unemployment and Medicare claims during this crisis as well as the need for remote working of the teams approving the claims. As you would expect, our global data center business has also been resilient as an unprecedented number of organizations are adjusting to remote working practices, which has driven a substantial increase in traffic and the need for additional bandwidth. Moreover, the current pandemic further underscores the vital and expanding role of multi-tenant data center play in an increasingly digital economy. COVID-19 is causing companies to evaluate and accelerate their digital transformation journeys, especially as it relates to outsourcing their IT infrastructure and fortifying their remote capabilities. In fact, industry experts believe that COVID-19 is serving to fast-track trends that were already evident in the data center industry, which bodes well for this portion of our business moving forward. Looking at recent performance, our global data center business had a strong Q1 with organic revenue growth of almost 10%. We signed 6.4 megawatts of new and expansion leases and our pipeline remains robust. This leasing consisted of a 3-megawatt booking with a new logo, a leading hyperscale enterprise software provider, which also includes a contractually committed reservation for an additional 2-megawatts and our expanded campus in Phoenix. We also continued to maintain good momentum with our enterprise customers. Commercially despite an unprecedented macro backdrop, our data center team continues to receive significant engagement in RFPs for both hyperscale, corporate and government requirements. The team has quickly adjusted to the new normal of remote working and has been innovative and continue to meet our current and prospective customer needs, including hosting virtual data center tours to support demand and the increased need for capacity. We are committed to ensuring uptime and resiliency for our data center customers and we are ready with capacity and our staff to handle support, upgrades and new installations if additional bandwidth is needed whilst remote workforces are supported. One area that we continue to monitor closely is the impact on the pace of construction of our -- for our data centers currently under development. While it's not significant, we do see modest delays across many of our projects, which is also happening across the industry. Given our relatively high capacity utilization of almost 90%, should delays extend or increase in length, this could create a tight supply situation. As I said, we are keeping a close eye on this and are in regular contact with all of our vendors and construction partners. And at this moment, we do not foresee it will materially impact our anticipated bookings and delivery for this year. As we look ahead these are truly unprecedented times and the path to recovery is clouded by uncertainty and will likely be choppy. It is very difficult to predict how long this current environment will go on. And what the new normal will look like on the other side. It will undoubtedly be lasting changes to how we work and how our customers will conduct business. Given the combined effects of the pandemic and the associated financial impact on the global economy, we believe a conservative approach is warranted. As you can see from our Q1 results, Project Summit is off to a strong start. Now that our project teams are up and running, and given the speed with which we implemented Wave One, we have identified additional opportunities to accelerate strategies to streamline our business and operations. We have pulled forward a number of initiatives that were planned for waves two and three of Project Summit and expect to see those benefits materialize at a faster pace in 2020. In addition to finding new ways to work differently with our customers as we roll out Project Summit, COVID-19 has uncovered ways for us to support our customers as they adjust to remote work -- to a remote working environment. Our customers' increased need for digital delivery has allowed us to reassess our service delivery model. Our R&D and growth initiatives have well positioned us with services like Image on Demand to address customers' changing needs as they adapt to new ways of working. Leveraging these new technology capabilities, enables us to adjust our service delivery model and more efficiently utilize our fleet, labor and real estate. The most impactful changes to our service delivery model revolve around new service level agreements or SLAs. These new agreements will allow us to better align our external customer SLAs with our internal record center SLAs as well as leverage more effective use of digital delivery to serve our customers. In addition, we will also utilize third party logistics providers more extensively than we have historically for our pickups and delivery. We have proactively communicated with our customers in some of our largest markets regarding these changes and have begun implementing the SLA changes, which has resulted in some additional reduction in force across the business. This broadened scope of Project Summit should result in even higher levels of adjusted EBITDA benefit and associated charges than we initially expected. Project Summit is now expected to generate $375 million of adjusted EBITDA benefits exiting 2021. This represents a meaningful increase from the prior expectation of $200 million. The total program is expected to cost approximately $450 million, up from our prior expectation of $240 million. In closing, this additional benefit from Project Summit should only further propel the underlying strength of our business once we emerge from COVID -- from the COVID-19 situation. Our strong performance in Q1, together with the additional promise from an expanded Project Summit makes us confident that we will emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic as an even stronger company than envisioned before. We continue to demonstrate resilience and determination and show all of our customers and communities that they can count on us in their time of need and that Iron Mountain really is iron. I want to thank all of my fellow mountaineers and their families again for their perseverance in these difficult times and I pray for their safety. I hope all of you and your loved ones are remaining safe and well. With that, I turn the call over to you Barry. Good morning, Sheila. Thanks for the question. So as we got into COVID-19, as I alluded to is that our customers needed to be served a different way. And we already had a Summit teams spun up to look at our cost of sales. And what we found was, if we look specifically at SLAs for instance returning a box in 24 hours -- returning a box in 24 hours in this environment where people are working remotely wasn't going to help. So what we've done is we've actually in the major markets we've already implemented this. So this is United States, Canada, Ireland, the U.K., Australia and New Zealand. As we said, we're taking that to five business days so once a week we will pick up or deliver physical boxes. If they need something quicker then we will actually digitize it and we'll send it to them in a digital secure link through our InSight platform in Image on Demand. So we're actually giving them a better service and at the same time changing from 24 hours to five business days or once a week. You can imagine how significant that impact is on our logistics operations and allows us to really take out quite a bit of cost. Well, I think we're blessed by being kind of an industry one. So we're a specialized REIT and our operations are still running strongly. We \u2013 although service has been impacted as Barry said 40% to 50% that's on 20% of our profits or 40% of our sales. So whilst it's impactful it's not a threat to our liquidity. So for our \u2013 from our standpoint, there isn't a liquidity reason that we would have to adjust our dividend. And then, as if you look at 2022, where we think we'll be looking at COVID in the back \u2013 in the rearview mirror by 2022. So we're assuming that it doesn't happen until then. Then we're actually gliding quite nicely into our original goal in our financial models as we get into the 2022 and 2023 period in terms of getting into the mid-60s to low-70s as payout as a percentage of AFFO. So we feel good about where we are. We'd rather not have COVID-19 because we would have gotten there much faster, but we feel good about the position. Yes. So thanks Nate for the question. So it is -- that is actually the major driver. Because if you look at our cost of service, which is a combination of labor, fleet in terms of the trucks that we put on the road and our facilities. It is -- we are one -- it is actually the largest cost as a company. And when you then say okay we're going to a five-day or once a week service cycle which allows us to marshal or consolidate volumes much more. And then for more rapid turnaround to give people digital ways of getting that back it's a major change in terms of cost of sales. We always as part of Project Summit we're going to optimize the cost of sales across those three labor trucking and facilities. But actually changing that from a 24-hour rhythm to a once a week rhythm is super impactful. So Andrew on the first one yes this is -- and we communicated that to our customers. This is beyond COVID. And in fact, this probably is something that could have happened before, but it's easier to actually get people to change their mindset in terms of how they want to be served given the current environment. Because if you think about the 24-hour SLAs than something that was historical in the business for decades. And the way people use the information that they retrieve now is very different. And quite frankly, lots of times they'd rather have it electronically. So yes this is -- COVID was -- it allowed us to have the catalyst to have that conversation with the customers, but it's permanent going forward. Yes. On the storage side Kevin post-COVID-19 there \u2013 right now our surveys there's many customers that say that there will be no change as there \u2013 those that say that will be continuing on their current program. So no, we don't expect a major change in the trends that we're seeing on the storage. On data center, as we said is that we've seen actually continued building of our pipeline through COVID-19 and we expect that to continue to be strong on the other side. We can't tell you right now if our strong pipeline is just because of the momentum we were building into the \u2013 in the data center business as we were coming in or specific to COVID-19. But yes, there's nothing that we're hearing from customers that's saying that their demand post COVID-19 is going to be any different on the data center side than what we're seeing in terms of the positive momentum in the basis today."

            "name": "Barry Hytinen",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results. I want to echo Bill's comments. I hope you are all safe and healthy. I would like to say thank you to our Iron Mountain team. I've been truly impressed by the team's commitment, hard work and perseverance during these challenging times. As Bill noted we are confident that we will emerge from this period a stronger company driven by our durable business model and the strength of our balance sheet. I will briefly touch on our first quarter performance before discussing our approach to addressing the pandemic. In the first quarter, we exceeded our expectations. And through the first nine weeks of the quarter, we were on track to exceed our targets even more substantially. Though by mid-March, our service activity began to experience declines compared to planned as more customers instituted mandatory work-from-home policies and restricted visits to their facilities. Despite this, we delivered a strong performance across our key metrics of revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS, and AFFO. Revenue of $1.1 billion increased 1.4% on a reported basis and 3.2% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Total organic revenue grew by 1% in the first quarter. This was primarily driven by organic, storage, rental revenue growth of 3%, which reflected our successful execution of revenue management. Adjusted EBITDA grew 11.9% for the first quarter to $363 million despite the negative impact from lower paper prices in foreign exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA grew almost 14%. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 320 basis points year-over-year to 34%. Adjusted EPS was $0.27, up significantly from $0.17 in the first quarter 2019. AFFO grew 20% year-over-year to $231 million, driven by adjusted EBITDA growth. This represents a new quarterly high for Iron Mountain, reflecting our team's focus on driving cash generation and increasing levels of AFFO overtime. Turning to segment performance, global RIM delivered total organic revenue growth of 60 basis points for the quarter, reflecting volume growth in faster growing markets and revenue management, partially offset by lower year-over-year paper prices. Global RIM's adjusted EBITDA margin of 41%, represents an increase of 230 basis points driven by revenue management, benefits from Project Summit and continuous improvement initiatives. The data center business delivered organic revenue growth of 9.9%, driven by strong leasing and low churn of 50 basis points. Data centers EBITDA margin of 45.9%, represents an increase of 360 basis points consistent with our long-term goal to drive margin expansion. As a reminder as we move through the balance of the year on a reported basis, the 2019 data center results have some one-time benefits that we called out last year, which make the year-over-year comparisons less meaningful. Turning to Project Summit, as Bill mentioned, we are on track and have accelerated and expanded initiatives in certain areas in response to COVID-19. In the first quarter, we recognized $41 million of restructuring charges to implement the remainder of the first wave plus components of wave two, which contributed to the first quarter benefit of $25 million. With the increased size and scope of the program, we now expect to realize the full $375 million of benefit related to Project Summit exiting 2021 with all actions complete and the associated $450 million of charges incurred by the end of 2021. In 2020, we now expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA benefits associated with Project Summit activities of $150 million compared with our prior expectation of the $80 million in restructuring charges of $240 million, up from $130 million previously. Now, I would like to provide an update on how COVID-19 is impacting our business and what actions we are taking to ensure we are well-positioned. Given the macro uncertainty, we want to be as transparent as possible to help inverters understand what we are seeing. To that end, I'm going to provide Insights that are more granular than we typically provide. But first I want to put into perspective how much of our storage revenue is generated by what is already on the shelf at the beginning of the year. As a reminder, our core storage business accounts for nearly two-thirds of our total revenue and a larger portion of our profitability. In a typical year, new volume accounts for less than 3% of our annual storage revenue. In other words, nearly all of our annual storage revenue comes from boxes that entered our facilities in prior years. As Bill mentioned, in markets where our ability to service customer facilities is limited, we have naturally seen a decline in the number of boxes that we are able to pickup. Partially as a result of this, we currently expect a net decline in cube volume in 2020, but of course that is subject to change based on the duration of the pandemic. As you would expect, the impact this has on storage revenue is much more muted than the impact it has on our service activity levels. Turning to our service business, which was about 35% of our 2019 revenue. In April, we saw activity declined approximately 40% overall, on the service business. As investors would expect, the impact has not been uniform across our service lines, so let's take a look at how this has trended across our business. I will use North America as an example, as it is both our largest market. And fairly representative of the activity levels, we have seen in other markets with similar closures and restrictions. Records management in North America, for the month of April had a 58% year-over-year reduction in new boxes in bounded and a 49% year-over-year reduction in retrievals and re-files. Data management activity in April declined less approximately 30%. A digital solution has seen a slowdown in activity compared to the first quarter, though April activity levels were flat year-over-year. In our shred business, activity declined approximately 27% in April, which has led to a corresponding decline in our paper tonnage. While we have seen an encouraging rebound in the market for paper prices recently, our average realized price in the first quarter was 44% lower than the prior year, which was a $10 million headwind to adjusted EBITDA. Consistent with the broader industry trends, we saw a sequential improvement in paper price of about 2.5% in the first quarter. And the trend has continued to improve. As investors will recall, in the past we have mentioned that a $10 per tonne change in paper price, represents an approximate $6 million EBITDA impact. Of course, this is clearly influenced by volume, so the EBITDA impact of paper price movement will change proportionately with the change in paper volume. Now, let me make a couple of comments on two of our smaller businesses. The Fine Arts industry has experienced a significant slowdown, during the pandemic. And given the nonessential nature of the business, we have temporarily closed all of our Fine Arts facilities. With a prudent view as to the intermediate term impact, we recorded $23 million non-cash impairment charge on the goodwill associated with that reporting unit. The consumer storage business through our partnership with MakeSpace, has seen an increase in demand. This led to over 5% growth in storage volume in the first quarter. And we have continued to see strong demand in April. Given the nature of the service level decline I just discussed, we have taken actions which we expect to be temporary and are in addition to the actions we had underway, with Project Summit. These actions include furloughs, reduced work hours, a pause in hiring, reductions in certain expenses like travel, and lower variable compensation. With these adjustments, we anticipate we will have removed in excess of $350 million on an annualized basis as compared to our prior plans. You will see these reductions materialize in cost of sales within our service business, as well as in our SG&A expenses. These actions are designed to help align our costs and revenues, as we navigate the uncertain environment. Therefore, we expect these costs to come back as revenue recovers. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, we are confident, in our balance sheet strength and liquidity position. In the first quarter, our team did a nice job driving cash cycle improvement up eight days year-on-year with benefits coming from both payables days and day's sales outstanding. I view the team's performance is particularly strong, given the COVID-19 backdrop. We continue to see the opportunity for further cash cycle improvement over the long-term. We ended the quarter with $153 million of cash and together with the availability under our revolving credit facility we had approximately $1.2 billion of liquidity. At this point in early May, our liquidity remains unchanged at that level, which we believe provides us ample runway to operate the business, in this uncertain environment. For context, this liquidity represents over three times the 2019, full year adjusted EBITDA of our service business. With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share earlier this week to be paid in early July. As the economy recovers in 2022 and 2023 and with a sustainable dividend at this level, we would expect our payout ratio to glide toward the mid-60s to low 70s, as a percent of AFFO. As we noted in our press release, we are no longer providing guidance for 2020, in light of the unknown severity and duration of the impact of the crisis on our markets and customers. However, we don't want to help you understand how we are currently planning for the remainder of 2020. Let me start with the impact of the much stronger U.S. dollar. Based on recent FX rates, we currently expect a full year impact on our revenue of about $100 million versus last year. At the time of our last call, FX rates implied an adjusted EBITDA headwind of about $5 million. Though with a stronger dollar, current FX rates translate into a full year adjusted EBITDA headwind of $35 million versus last year. Turning to activity levels, we are expecting April to be representative of the trends we experienced for the remainder of the second quarter, which we expect to be the weakest quarter in 2020 for comparative revenue and adjusted EBITDA change. Although recent trends suggest this may prove to be conservative as more and more of our customers around the world are gradually opening back up and we are seeing other positive indicators. I will note we are maintaining flexibility to rebound quickly, if business conditions improve faster than expected. And on the other hand, if conditions worsen we have already identified additional options that can be executed quickly as needed. At this point, we anticipate delivering full year adjusted EBITDA margin flat to slightly up compared to last year, reflecting our solid first quarter performance, benefits from revenue management, Project Summit and other cost actions. This will be partially offset by our conservative posture as to service revenues and fixed cost deleverage. Given the current environment, we have also quickly taken actions to preserve capital. We reduced capital investments both for capital expenditures and M&A by a net total of $110 million relative to our original guidance for 2020. This is made up of approximately $110 million of reduced CapEx and $75 million of reduced investment in M&A and acquisitions of customer relationships. This net total also reflects an increased investment of $75 million, to support the construction of our Frankfurt data center. Additional detail can be seen in the supplemental and is highlighted on slide 14 of our presentation. We continue to expect to generate capital recycling proceeds of approximately $100 million in 2020. As we look at the market for industrial assets, we continue to see attractive valuations and our pipeline has actually increased over the last couple of months. As investors would expect, we have run multiple scenarios based on varying assumptions for revenue, margins the duration of the crisis and the speed of recovery. Included in these scenarios are some extreme stress test models, which we develop to understand the possible impact, if conditions worsened materially and persisted for an extended period of time. One of the stress test we ran was based on service activity being down about 65% year-on-year and persisting at that level through 2021. Even in that scenario, we do not foresee an issue with liquidity or leverage through 2021. I'll also note, the severity and duration of our stress tests are much more extreme than both what we have seen thus far and what current trends and macro forecasts indicate we will likely experience. Even still we would have significant cushion in terms of both liquidity and leverage. In closing, we are confident in the durability of our storage business and believe the magnitude of impact on our service business combined with the actions we have taken leave us in a strong financial position. We look forward to sharing further progress with you on our second quarter earnings call. I hope everyone stays safe and healthy. And with that, operator please open the line for Q&A. Hi. Andrew, thanks for the question. Good morning. While we're not giving guidance for even this year's EBITDA, it's a little bit hard to get into projecting how much of that extra $175 million of benefit from Summit going forward is going to be as it relates to the numerator and denominator of EBITDA and sales. But certainly, if you thought about that $175 million incremental in sort of perpetuity and that's the way you should because it's a ongoing benefit. And put that against either our prior guidance or last year's results, for example, it is a very significant increase in the relative level of profitability and will certainly dramatically assist us in our goal of increasing margin and moving that into the very high 30s, if not potentially beyond going forward. But I think what we'll do is take it one quarter at a time this year and provide you updates as how we're doing. But I will tell you as Bill -- I'll reiterate Bill's point, we feel very good about what we've got going on with respect to Summit and the way the teams are performing. And we look forward to reporting the progress against that with you every quarter. Yes. So I mean let me frame it this way for you. As we think about leverage for this year based on the -- our current view of trends and the outline of how Bill and I spoke about it earlier, we would expect leverage to be flattish to maybe slightly up year-on-year at year-end this year. Now I will note that it is a positive development I think speaks to the team's progress and the performance we put up in the first quarter that are actually our leverage ticked down a 10th from year-end. But when we stress test the business, it probably slightly above those levels, but we feel very good about in each scenario. I don't want to give and I think you can appreciate why specific leverage points under various stress tests because there are so many models -- so many elements that go into those models. But as we said on the call, we would have sufficient cushion in both the leverage -- on all the tests that you mentioned as well as liquidity. So we feel very good about where we're positioned. And that is thanks to the incremental Summit benefits, we've pulled forward here at the incremental Summit benefits coming from the SLA changes that Bill mentioned, as well as the cost actions we took to align revenues and costs in this period here during the pandemic."

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.\nWilliam Meaney: Thank you, Gillian, and thank you all for taking time to join us today. We are pleased to have delivered record performance for both the fourth quarter and the full year. These record results are reflective of our broad offerings, deep customer relationships, resilient business model and our dedicated teams. Despite the challenges associated with the pandemic and most recently with the Omicron variant, our Mountaineers around the world have continued each and every day to put our customers first now with renewed and invigorated focus on growth. And our historically high revenue and profitability are a testament to our Mountaineers' commitment. Speaking about our Mountaineers, I wish to begin my remarks by stating that we are all saddened by the overnight events in the Ukraine. Our thoughts and prayers are with our customers there and our fellow 60 Mountaineers and their families living and working in the Ukraine. I am sure for all of us, given the current events in Europe, it deals in many ways inappropriate discussing our financial results with this backdrop. Yet at the same time, it is in keeping with our Mountaineer spirit. With that, let me begin our discussion of our remarkable and record year. In the fourth quarter, we achieved our highest ever quarterly revenue of $1.16 billion, yielding 8.5% of total organic revenue growth and record EBITDA of $431 million. For the full year, we achieved record revenue of nearly $4.5 billion and EBITDA of $1.6 billion. These results were fueled by increased demand for our services across key markets. For the full year, we delivered organic storage rental revenue growth of 2.6%, reflecting continued benefit of pricing combined with positive volume trends. We drove double-digit growth in digital offerings, including data center inside our digital transformation services and secure IT disposition, now referred to as ALM, or asset life cycle management. Our digital services and ALM businesses continue to build momentum, growing over 20% in the fourth quarter and capping off an excellent year of growth. Further to our recent success in the ALM area, we are also pleased to report that the acquisition of ITRenew, announced in December, closed in January. This acquisition will accelerate our growth trajectory in this $30 billion market, which is growing over 10% per year. Our newly created ALM division will absorb our historical secure ITAD business line. This enlarged division not only helps us provide chain of custody for our customers' IT assets, but our ALM activities also assure our customers that their IT assets are wiped of any data at the end of their life and destroyed and recycled in a responsible way. On this last point, in terms of recycling, our expanded offerings in this space around a circular economy are important for both IRM's and our customers' ESG goals leading to carbon neutrality. This expanded ALM division also strongly complements our fast-growing data center business, bringing capabilities to serve some of the largest and most innovative companies in the world in a more cradle-to-grave way, consistent with the best security and ESG practices. This expanded ALM platform will directly benefit from Iron Mountain's 225,000 loyal customer base, which includes 95% of the Fortune 1000. This global customer base is supported by 25,000 Mountaineers across 1,450 facilities in 63 countries. Our recent expansions in data center, machine learning-driven data analytics and insights and now ALM are just some of the examples of how we continue to invest in growth to capitalize on our many opportunities ahead, serving a customer base which has been loyal to Iron Mountain for decades. I have shared with you previously how in the last 5 years, these investments have taken the total addressable market, or TAM, of our products and services from $10 billion to some $80 billion. I am happy to report our continued build-out of new products and services in the last year as well as growth in these underlying markets has now taken our TAM to over $120 billion. Our continued drive in building an ever-expanding set of synergistic and customer-centric solutions, together with global reach and scale, is the fuel behind much of the acceleration in our growth. Let me share a few examples of how we've been empowering our customers' success in growth through our diverse solution offerings and unmatched customer service. Our recent customer win with a large aerospace company, where we won a backfile digitization deal of over $20 million, is a superb example of collaboration amongst our entertainment services, technology organization and our global records organization, or GRO. In order to achieve its goal of being a 100% model engineering company and to most effectively use designs and data from historical archives to refine new designs, this aerospace company sought help with the digitization and auto classification of over 50 million digital engineering assets. We were tasked to store, classify and utilize machine learning to identify relevant information whilst maintaining compliance with International Traffic in Arms Regulations known as ITAR. To this end, we developed and implemented an ITAR-compliant solution using our InSight machine learning platform operating in the AWS government cloud environment. Iron Mountain is uniquely positioned to assist our partner with this initiative with our storage capabilities, our understanding of ITAR compliance complexities, our machine learning-trained analytic engines and our technological support to ensure efficiency and success. Moreover, this project enables us to deliver critical insight into engineering data, not just to this company but also to other manufacturing and engineering customers across the globe. Another key win worth highlighting is with a branch of the U.S. federal government. We concluded a Phase 1 contract and have also been awarded a Phase 2 contract for this branch. The agency originally planned to select 3 vendors for the first contract due to the high volume of microfilm reels needing to be processed, but our solution surpassed the customer's expectations, and Iron Mountain was awarded the exclusive contract to process all 177,000 of microfilm reels or over 2 billion records needing analysis. This win was based on our unique splitting technique, proprietary machine learning, automated QA process and processing scalability that helped us to differentiate our offer from the competition. These technology innovations for the customer have enabled future use cases, which rely on advanced pattern recognition at scale, including OCR microfilm processing projects, applying machine learning extraction techniques for digital mailroom, invoice processing and extracting information from claims documents, to name a few. Another example how Iron Mountain is working with customers to support their digital transformation is our recent partnership with a production and development company operating in the U.K.'s North Sea. We've undertaken a significant back scan of their legacy archive records to meet their regulatory obligations to the U.K. oil and gas authority in order to relinquish their license to operate on 230 wells they wish to abandon. They're required to digitally upload all information assets to the National Data Repository. Using the InSight platform, we were able to solve the problem of having enormous amounts of data to sift whilst consolidating physical and digital data in disconnected information silos and resulting in millions of dollars of annual savings. Moving back above ground, recently in our Crozier Fine Arts division, we won a contract to provide comprehensive storage solutions and logistical support for the museum operations of the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures. We were excited and proud that based upon a foundation of long-term partnership and trust built up through many years of support from Iron Mountain's Entertainment Services division, they came to us to meet their evolving needs where Crozier services were an ideal match. Now turning to wins in our data center business. Recall that our bookings target for the year was 30 megawatts. We are pleased to have finished the year with nearly 49 megawatts of leases signed with over 27 megawatts of leases in the fourth quarter alone. This includes the new 20-megawatt lease in our Manassas, Virginia data center announced in December. This lease is expected to commence in phases from mid-2022 through mid-2023. We continue to see strong demand for comprehensive data center solutions from our existing customer base. This lease is indicative of our ability to meet that demand and reflects our commitment to strategically partnering with our customers to meet their individual requirements. Based on current design plans, we now expect that the VA2 facility to support 36 megawatts, up from 30 megawatts previously. With these changes and other additions to our portfolio, our total capacity is now in excess of 600 megawatts. Finally, we continue to be recognized for our leadership around ESG. This has been an important focus for us for many years, having produced annual sustainability reports outlining our commitments and progress since 2013. Some of our past recognitions have included: 100% of our data center power is generated by renewables; we were the launch provider of Green Power Pass, which allows our customers to report reductions in their carbon footprint when using our data centers; we were a co-signer with Google to expand our commitment to green-powered data centers to 24/7 carbon-free electricity; and we were one of the original signatories of the UN Global Compact on Sustainability back in 2016. More recently, we announced, in addition to their RE100 program, we have joined the Climate Group's EV100 initiative and reached a key milestone in electrifying our global vehicle fleet in line to reach our climate pledge commitment to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2040. We have made real progress towards our carbon reduction goals. Since establishing our first science-based targets, we have reduced absolute greenhouse gas emissions by over 60% from our 2016 baseline whilst growing the business. We believe that our commercial growth and ESG initiatives make us stand out, and we suspect they were a major factor of our being ranked amongst the top 100 on Newsweek's list of America's most responsible companies. In summary, our future ahead is bright. We are building on our growth momentum as we expand our portfolio to meet our customers' evolving needs. And with our strong footprint, powerful portfolio and deep customer relationships, we are confident that we can continue this momentum as we ascend our mountain range and provide another set of performance records this year and the years ahead. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry.\nBarry Hytinen: Thanks, Bill, and thank you for joining us to discuss our results. In the fourth quarter, our team delivered strong performance, exceeding the expectations we provided on our last call. Before I dive into our results, I would like to take a moment to thank our dedicated Mountaineers for their outstanding performance and continued commitment to Iron Mountain. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.16 billion grew 9.4% year-on-year with total organic revenue up 8.5%. Revenue was $10 million ahead of the high end of the expectations we shared previously despite the U.S. dollar strengthening and being more of a headwind in the quarter. As an example of the momentum we are building, on a 2-year basis, our total organic revenue growth continued to accelerate in the quarter. Organic storage revenue grew 3.6% in the quarter, reflecting our strong pricing and data center commencements. Organic service revenue increased $65 million or 17.6% driven by continued strong growth in digital solutions and asset life cycle management. As revenue associated with our traditional transportation services were still down nearly 10% from pre-pandemic levels, we are even more pleased with this performance. Adjusted EBITDA was $431 million, an increase of $56 million from last year. As a result of strong flow-through driven by pricing and productivity, fourth quarter EBITDA exceeded the high end of our expectations by $6 million despite additional FX headwind. AFFO was $267 million or $0.92 on a per share basis, up $76 million and $0.26, respectively, from the fourth quarter of last year. In both cases, we significantly exceeded the high end of our expectations. Now let me briefly summarize the full year. Revenue of $4.5 billion increased 8% on a reported basis and over 6% on an organic constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA increased 11% year-on-year to $1.635 billion, an increase of $159 million year-on-year. We achieved the high end of our full year guidance. AFFO increased 14% to $1.01 billion or $3.48 on a per share basis, in both cases, exceeding our full year guidance ranges. Now let's turn to segment performance. In the fourth quarter, our Global RIM business delivered revenue of $1.02 billion, an increase of $76 million from last year or 8% on a reported basis from last year. On an organic basis, revenue increased 7%. Constant currency storage rental revenue growth of 4.2% or 2.5% on an organic basis reflects our focus on revenue management and solid volume trends. With positive volume trends and growth in our adjacent and consumer businesses, total physical volume was in line with our expectations for the quarter and the year. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $453 million, an increase of $49 million year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was up 160 basis points year-on-year, reflecting continued pricing strength and productivity. Turning to our global data center business. Our team booked 27 megawatts in the quarter. For the full year, bookings came in at 49 megawatts, significantly exceeding our full year guidance of 30 megawatts. We are very pleased with the team's leasing performance. To give some historical context, we leased 10 megawatts in 2018, 17 megawatts in 2019 and excluding our joint venture in Frankfurt, 31 megawatts in 2020. In terms of revenue, as we projected, fourth quarter growth accelerated to 25% year-over-year. Storage revenue grew 18% year-on-year, and service revenue was up sharply and in line with our projections. As a reminder, service revenue in the second half includes fit-out services we are providing to our Frankfurt joint venture. We expect that activity will be completed early in 2022. Even with the large service component, EBITDA margin increased sequentially with strong commencements. We are pleased with our data center performance, and our pipeline has continued to strengthen, both in terms of hyperscale and retail colocation. In 2022, we expect to lease 50 megawatts, which would represent 28% annual bookings growth. We project full year data center revenue growth in a range of high teens percent year-on-year with even higher growth rates on storage. With our strong prior year bookings and recent commencements, we have very good visibility to revenue. With pricing and improved mix, we expect data center margin for the full year to be up modestly compared to 2021. Turning to Project Summit. This quarter, the team delivered $30 million of incremental year-on-year adjusted EBITDA benefit. For the full year, as compared to 2020, Summit delivered $160 million of benefits. We continue to expect another $50 million of year-on-year benefit in 2022. Total capital expenditures were $219 million, of which $173 million was growth and $46 million was recurring. For the full year, total capital expenditures were $606 million, of which $309 million was growth capital related to data center development. In 2022, we expect total capital expenditures to be approximately $850 million. We are projecting approximately $700 million of growth CapEx, with data center development representing about 3/4 of that. We expect recurring CapEx to approach $155 million. Turning to capital recycling. As we have said before, we view the market for industrial assets as highly attractive as a means to supplement our growth capital. With that backdrop, in the fourth quarter, we upsized our recycling program and generated approximately $63 million of proceeds, bringing the full year to $278 million. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.3x, in line with our projection and modestly improved compared to last quarter. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term leverage range of 4.5 to 5.5x. For 2022, with the closing of the ITRenew transaction, we expect leverage to tick up modestly in the first quarter. We expect to exit the year at levels within our target range. In December, thanks to strong support from the fixed income community, our team successfully issued 10-year notes to support the ITRenew transaction. From a cash perspective, I would like to recognize our team for driving strong collections, improving our days sales outstanding and resulting in year-on-year improvement in our cash cycle. The collective performance has resulted in a 5-day improvement from pre-pandemic levels. With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early April. Also, as you may have seen, we are pleased to announce an important strategic milestone related to our unconsolidated joint venture focused on the fast-growing valet consumer storage market. MakeSpace recently completed a merger with Clutter, a similarly sized business also focused on valet storage. We expect the combination will result in considerable benefits, including a focus on a single brand, Clutter, broader reach and natural synergies. Iron Mountain will continue to provide storage services to the business, and our ownership interest will be nearly 25% of the combined entity. We are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and expect continued benefit to our total physical volume. Now turning to our outlook. For the full year 2022, we currently expect revenue of $5.125 billion to $5.275 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.8 billion to $1.85 billion. At the midpoint, our guidance represents revenue growth of 16% and EBITDA growth of 12%. We expect AFFO to be in the range of $1.085 billion to $1.12 billion, which represents 9% year-on-year growth at the midpoint point. We expect AFFO per share to be in a range of $3.70 to $3.82. Our guidance assumes organic global physical volume will be consistent to slightly positive year-on-year. We expect revenue management will be a significant benefit, and I will note that the majority of those actions have already been taken as we speak to you today. And nearly all of them will be in place by the end of the quarter. As Bill mentioned, we are planning for a continuation in the strong trends we are seeing in digital solutions and our organic ALM business, combined with a slight recovery in our service activity across the year. Our guidance also assumes the contribution from our acquisition of ITRenew. As we closed the deal at the end of January, we are including 11 months of the results in our guidance. Our guidance includes approximately $450 million of revenue from ITRenew. We estimate the stronger U.S. dollar will result in foreign exchange headwinds to revenue of approximately $60 million year-on-year with the vast majority of that in the first half. In terms of EBITDA, our expectations include the benefit from revenue management and top line growth, the contribution from ITRenew as well as Project Summit benefits. Our EBITDA guidance also assumes a prudent outlook for inflation, rent from our recent sale leaseback transactions, increased innovation spend, the stronger U.S. dollar and the divestiture of the software escrow business, which we sold in late second quarter. With the ongoing volatilities in the market associated with the pandemic as well as the closing of the ITRenew transaction during the quarter, we felt it would be helpful to share our expectations for the first quarter. We expect total revenue to be in excess of $1.2 billion. We expect EBITDA to be approximately $425 million. We expect AFFO to be in excess of $250 million. In summary, our team is executing well. Our pipeline continues to expand, and momentum continues to build across our business. Our addressable market has grown significantly over the last several years, and we expect this to continue to expand. We feel confident in our ability to deliver higher levels of growth. Thanks to our team's collective efforts, together with our strong customer relationships, brand position and investments in innovation, we feel very well positioned as we enter 2022. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Sheila McGrath from Evercore.\nSheila McGrath: The revenue growth that you're targeting in 2022 is very strong. I was wondering if you could give us a little more detail on the drivers of that growth. And if it's more momentum in services, how should we think about the EBITDA margin in 2022 as compared to 2021?\nWilliam Meaney: Thanks for the question. So I think I'll talk about, first of all, where the revenue growth comes. And then I'll let Barry comment a little bit on the EBITDA margin, the impact that has. So I think we continue to see 2022 to have the same kind of momentum that we had in 2021. And the momentum that you saw in 2021 was driven by 2 things. First of all, a very solid foundation from our GRO business across the globe. So that continues to drive low single-digit growth and highly profitable. And then a continued acceleration in terms of our new areas, which are everything that includes data center, the digitization platform, which uses the artificial intelligence, machine learning InSight platform as well as the acceleration in asset life cycle management. So we still see that to be strong double-digit growth in those new service areas. So some of those have a different margin associated with it, but that's where we see the fuel of the revenue growth. And maybe, Barry, you want to comment in terms of what that does in terms of EBITDA progression.\nBarry Hytinen: Thanks for the question. So we feel great about where we're positioned as it relates to profits and revenue and really see the business building quite well. The things I would call out to add to Bill's comments are you're right, there's a fair bit of services. On a total EBITDA margin, you will see the margin mix down, but that's the contribution of ITRenew. I'd say for planning purposes, if I were you, what we're using in our model is that business, as you would have seen from prior disclosures, is kind of a mid- to high-teens EBITDA margin. But when you get underneath that and back that out, you'd see that our core Iron Mountain margins are actually continuing to improve, and that's driven by the fact that we have very strong pricing contribution this year. From a planning posture, we kind of assumed 2 to 3 points. But as you probably saw in the most recent results, we're seeing the upper ends of that and probably more going forward, so feel very good about our revenue management program. Our data center business is doing phenomenally well, as you've seen, and that is a margin benefit as we move forward. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we expect our data center profitability to be up modestly year-to-year as a lot of revenue growth coming out of our storage side of the data center business. Of course, our Summit contributions continue to roll in. We'll have $50 million or more from Summit, thanks to the team's very strong contributions. You would have noticed from seeing our most recent results that our services gross margins and EBITDA margins are at very high levels. You can think like up 500, 600 basis points year-on-year in the fourth quarter. I expect that we will continue to see very strong service margin out of the core going forward. So we feel very well positioned, Sheila, and I appreciate the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Barry, maybe I could just piggy back off the last comment on the services business and the services margin. Can you talk about what drove the gross margin improvement? You had very strong services revenue. Maybe you could talk about how much of that was maybe Frankfurt versus some services that might still be coming back versus just new wins that you've got. And then it's a pretty significant margin improvement sequentially as well. If you could talk about where it's coming from and particularly in the face of inflation and wage inflation and how you're managing that.\nBarry Hytinen: Okay. Thanks, Shlomo. I appreciate that. So first thing I'll tell you is on -- since you mentioned Frankfurt is it's not coming from that because those are really almost -- think of those as sort of pass-through revenues on the services business. In fact, that's a hit to our margins. And that's one of the reasons why our data center margin has been a little bit more muted. But as we move through finishing up those services in early '22, that's one of the reasons we expect the margin to be up year-on-year as you'll see a lot more contribution from our storage and, therefore, likely less service revenue coming out of data center. That said, where it's coming from is the core. And as we've said for quite a few quarters now, Project Summit and just general productivity coming out of our operations has been very beneficial. You saw our gross margin to be up, I think it's 550 basis points year-on-year. It was up 400 basis points sequentially. And that's just very strong operating leverage. I would say there's some incremental mix there. Bill spoke a lot about our digital solutions and our asset life cycle management. That is also contributing very nicely. There's some revenue management on our services line as well. So in terms of -- you mentioned about inflation. As I said, at this time last year, I will reiterate, we've been what I think is prudent with our outlook. We have embedded in our guidance a healthy amount of inflation more than we're currently seeing similar posture to what we took last year. And while there is certainly a level of inflation, as we all know, out in the economy, I would look at our more fixed structure and say that together with our revenue management program, we have the benefit of working to drive productivity and seeing a considerable amount of our pricing fall to the bottom line. So we feel very good about where we are positioned currently, Shlomo, with respect to services and the guide in total.\nWilliam Meaney: Yes. The only thing I would add, Shlomo, because you know the business really well is the other thing -- the uptick that you see in the services, we're doing, quite frankly, more value-added. I mean, more and more of our digitization services have an ML or machine learning component of it. I mentioned auto classification and some of the work that we're doing. It's not just simple scanning. So there's an analytical piece to that as well, which obviously has a higher margin. And we see almost -- I wouldn't say all, but now it's almost all the new projects we're selling have some component of that, which just naturally attract higher margin. And as Barry said, you've heard us talk about inflation for a long time is that, well, inflation is not good for people on the street, and so I'm not trying to be blase about it for our business because it's such a high-margin business that the pricing action generally is expansion. It has an expansive effect on our margins because our margins were relatively high-margin business. So it's -- yes, we feel good about the progression that we're getting.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse.\nKevin McVeigh: Congratulations on ITRenew and our thoughts with your Ukrainian employees as well. Barry, if you said this -- I missed it, but can you help us because obviously a sizable step-up in CapEx, which feels like that's around data center, but how should we think about free cash flow in 2022?\nBarry Hytinen: Yes. Thanks, Kevin. Appreciate the question. So first up on CapEx. Our total CapEx guide is $850 million. Growth capital is $700 million of that. And you are right, as you point out that the data center is getting basically all of that increase. So we are planning our data center development CapEx at $550 million. That's up from about $300 million in 2021. The thing about that is, of course, as you've seen from the strong leasing we've had and the very strong pipeline we have continuing to build that -- and it's a necessity in the sense because we are -- the team is continuing to win great deals around the world. So we're very pleased with the way the data center team is planning. From a free cash flow standpoint, while the CapEx will be up, I'll note that all of our Summit costs are behind us now, Kevin. So there's -- if you think about last year, we had over $200 million of costs to achieve Summit, which go away this year. Have a little bit more cash taxes, of course, with the ITRenew services business and having some more services revenue in our business. And -- but as you look at it, as you get through your model, I think you'll find that there's considerable growth in free cash flow before growth in the model. So I appreciate the question. We look forward to showing you the strength in the cash flow as we move forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Goldman Sachs.\nGeorge Tong: The secure IT asset disposition industry has typically grown in the strong double digits. Can you elaborate on how quickly you expect your new ALM business to grow and what key drivers you're leaning on to support that growth?\nWilliam Meaney: So thanks, George, for the question. So as you noticed, we've been getting kind of strong double-digit, roughly, say, 20%. We had a couple of quarters where it was up 30%, kind of in that high teens, kind of low 20s in terms of growth rate going forward, and we continue to see that kind of evolution. We're really impressed by how quickly the book is building, quite frankly, because the ITRenew business had very strong exposure to the hyperscale community, which has direct or synergistic effects with our data center team. So we're finding we're already getting additional traction even beyond what ITRenew is bringing by the discussions that we're having between our data team -- data center team and the ITRenew team that came across talking to the hyperscalers. But then on the other side, to your point, we're -- if you think about our traditional customers, whether it's financial services, insurance or general industry, is those folks that the way they dispose of their IT assets, both from a security standpoint as well as making sure that they disposed in a way that's environmentally sensitive, is becoming more and more important. So we continue to see now with an expanded platform to have similar growth -- organic growth rates that we did this past year, which I said we're, let's say, upper teens to touching into the 20% category. And we'll update you as we go through the progress, but we're really happy in terms of already the synergies that we're getting from that, putting the 2 teams together.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Luebchow from Wells Fargo.\nEric Luebchow: So I wanted to touch on the data center business. Barry, I think you said that the target leasing outlook is 50 megawatts for this year. So that probably means you had pretty good visibility and some larger hyperscale wins. So maybe you could talk about or maybe disaggregate that outlook into larger hyperscale versus more traditional enterprise sales. And then on the return side, any changes in the return targets on the higher capital spend this year based on any supply chain or inflationary impacts in the data center space?\nWilliam Meaney: So let me -- I'll start with the leasing activity, and then Barry can comment further. But I think the -- you're right, I mean, that with the hyperscale folks, you do have more visibility. I mean, I think you can expect that the retail side or the colo side would be -- continue to be kind of in the teens of megawatts a year. So we like that business. We continue to see the same kind of deal flow or pipeline coming in on that side. And then the thing we're also very excited about is that a few years ago, we were relatively a new entrant in the hyperscale. And clearly, if you look at the results this past year, almost hitting 50 megawatts, and this year, we're guiding to another 50 megawatts. We're making really, really good progress. So we're starting to look more like, what I would say, a typical industry player in the data center space where you're getting like kind of 60% to 70% of the volume, maybe even a little bit more from hyperscale and the rest from colocation and retail.\nBarry Hytinen: The only thing I would add is that while we see some level -- as you've heard from other industry participants, some level of inflation in cost, we also see very good pricing. And so we expect mark-to-market to be flat to up, if not better than that. We are seeing good pricing in terms of new deals. And we feel very well positioned. And I'm pleased to be able to say we expect the margin to be rising year-on-year. So thanks for the question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan.\nAndrew Steinerman: Barry, I was hoping you could give us an organic constant currency revenue growth for the '22 guide. I definitely heard you that ITRenew is $450 million of revs and FX is $60 million headwind. I assume this is still a little bit more revenue from other acquisitions that you did as well. And so if you could just kind of total it out for us and give us organic revenue growth for the '22 guide, that would be helpful.\nBarry Hytinen: Yes. Thanks, Andrew. I'll disaggregate it for you. So you would be working with $450 million for ITRenew. The net of all of our other M&A activity in 2021 is about $25 million of benefit year-on-year. So not a lot. And you might be -- might have been thinking that, that would be higher, and I'll just remind folks that we did sell our software escrow business back in June. So that's a headwind to revenue, and then we bought a small data center in Frankfurt and we also did the small acquisition in the -- relatively small acquisition in the Mid East. So the net of all that is about $25 million year-on-year. And it's kind of first quarter, it's about $5 million, and it's about $5 million in the second quarter and with the balance kind of in the third. From an EBITDA standpoint, because as we talked about before that, that software escrow business was a high profit margin business, you're only looking for about $5 million of EBITDA from all of that incremental revenue. And then the FX is about $60 million of a headwind, that's as of yesterday. So -- and that's about $25 million or so of EBITDA headwind. So if you work through that, that would get you to your organic. It's very strong, by the way. And it's benefited by the fact that we have very strong visibility on pricing.  And the services side that Bill mentioned, we're growing strength to strength with our digital solutions probably being up at least 20% on top of 20% and the data center business and the storage area there being up in the 20s. So we feel very well positioned. Thank you, Andrew.\nOperator: Our next question is a follow-up question from Sheila McGrath from Evercore.\nSheila McGrath: Yes. Bill, you called out a number of wins in your prepared remarks with government contracts and other customers. I was wondering if you can help us understand if the legacy traditional storage offering was part of the mix with any of those contracts. Or just what were the different components of Iron Mountain's business offering that helped you win that business?\nWilliam Meaney: Thank you, Sheila, for the question. And actually, I just got back from a trip to D.C. a couple of weeks ago. So the -- I would say it's kind of yes and no. Yes, in terms of the brand, right, because we have been a very trusted partner operating government-approved facilities for their physical storage for many years, as you know. And I think that brand recognition with the U.S. federal government has been extremely strong. That being said, the recent contracts I've been highlighting have been us actually providing digital service, auto classification analytics around some of these documents, also taking documents that are already in digital form that we're not actually storing on behalf of the federal government. So more and more going forward is that we're providing purely digital services. But I wouldn't underestimate the halo effect of the understanding of the brand and the trust and the security associated with working with Iron Mountain.\nOperator: Our next question is a follow-up question from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Bill, I think you've missed it if I didn't ask you a question about the RIM volume changes quarter-to-quarter. So I want to bring that up a little. There's a slight decline, and it looks like there was also 30 basis points of sequential decline in records retention. Were there any strong document destruction projects in the quarter? Or how should I be thinking about that in terms of just the movements quarter between quarter?\nWilliam Meaney: So first of all, I guess -- I thought you were asleep this morning, so I notice someone had taken your voice. No. So first of all, we're really pleased with the progression in terms of our records management business because if you notice that actually, sequentially, it's actually getting stronger, not weaker. And as I said, the slight negative drag on the records management business is really a second derivative effect. And as that kind of wears through, you start seeing a stabilization. And indeed, we're actually seeing an improvement in the trends in the records management. And in terms of total volume, physical storage volume, is our other areas of storage and adjacent business areas and consumer more than offset those flattening trends. I would say -- the only other thing I would say is that, yes, you're right, and you've been watching this business for a long time. You always see a little bit of an uptick in destructions in the fourth quarter because, generally, it's kind of like people do their spring housecleaning in our business as they kind of do their fall housekeeping. So we do see some -- just generally. But that's like every year. I didn't -- we didn't see more of that or less of that this year. And Barry, you might want to talk more specifically about the trend.\nBarry Hytinen: Yes. The only thing I would add to that, Shlomo, and thanks again for the question, is I usually look at the records management retention rate on a year-over-year basis as opposed to sequentially because of the points that Bill was just making. And if you look at that versus the year-end 2020 number, it's actually up 40 basis points. So we feel very good about where the record retention rate finished the year. And the only other thing I guess I would add is if you look at the storage rental revenue growth on an organic basis, it was up 3.6% in the quarter. And that is -- 2/3 of that is coming out of our core and 1/3 of that is coming up from data center in terms of that improvement in terms of organic revenue growth. And when you look -- disaggregate the 2/3 coming out of our core, it's actually both pricing as well as improved volume trends because, as you know, the organic volume on a year -- full year basis was actually up. So we feel very good about where things are trending. We expect our volume to be consistent to up again in 2022. Thank you for the question.\nOperator: Our next question is a follow-up from Eric Luebchow from Wells Fargo.\nEric Luebchow: So I just wanted to touch on the capital allocation outlook for this year. So Barry, you said that leverage should be within the range by year-end, but just wanted to know what was embedded in that. Do you expect to do any incremental acquisitions? Should we expect any additional asset sales as a funding mechanism? And then based on the strong AFFO per share outlook, you'll be in the mid-60s from a payout ratio. At what point would you consider starting to grow the dividend again?\nBarry Hytinen: Okay. Thanks, Eric. A few points in there. Let me answer those. We aren't embedding any additional M&A in our guidance for this year. So we shouldn't be planning for that. As we said before, we're very committed to our leverage range, and we'll get back into that leverage range and the year within it. In terms of additional things to put in the model, I would say I would be planning for something like $150 million of capital recycling. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the cap rates there are phenomenal. We've seen cap rates even sub-4. So it's very, very good environment out there. And as a reminder, we're generally doing sale leaseback transactions that are very favorable, in our opinion, because we essentially have ownership-like interest in the building while monetizing it at these great cap rates. And that enables us to really just be very strategic about the capital allocation plan. In terms of your question about AFFO payout ratio, you're right, in our guidance, we'd be just above the mid-60s by the end of the year. And we've said repeatedly that our target is for that to be kind of the low to mid-60s over the long term. And at that point, we'd be looking at a dividend increase. So in fact, we'd be almost approaching sort of the REIT minimum under certain scenarios under that -- at that level. And therefore, you probably would be expecting dividends through in the future to be rising with the same rate as AFFO per share.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and the Iron Mountain Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Barry Hytinen",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and thank you for joining us to discuss our results. In the fourth quarter, our team delivered strong performance, exceeding the expectations we provided on our last call. Before I dive into our results, I would like to take a moment to thank our dedicated Mountaineers for their outstanding performance and continued commitment to Iron Mountain. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.16 billion grew 9.4% year-on-year with total organic revenue up 8.5%. Revenue was $10 million ahead of the high end of the expectations we shared previously despite the U.S. dollar strengthening and being more of a headwind in the quarter. As an example of the momentum we are building, on a 2-year basis, our total organic revenue growth continued to accelerate in the quarter. Organic storage revenue grew 3.6% in the quarter, reflecting our strong pricing and data center commencements. Organic service revenue increased $65 million or 17.6% driven by continued strong growth in digital solutions and asset life cycle management. As revenue associated with our traditional transportation services were still down nearly 10% from pre-pandemic levels, we are even more pleased with this performance. Adjusted EBITDA was $431 million, an increase of $56 million from last year. As a result of strong flow-through driven by pricing and productivity, fourth quarter EBITDA exceeded the high end of our expectations by $6 million despite additional FX headwind. AFFO was $267 million or $0.92 on a per share basis, up $76 million and $0.26, respectively, from the fourth quarter of last year. In both cases, we significantly exceeded the high end of our expectations. Now let me briefly summarize the full year. Revenue of $4.5 billion increased 8% on a reported basis and over 6% on an organic constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA increased 11% year-on-year to $1.635 billion, an increase of $159 million year-on-year. We achieved the high end of our full year guidance. AFFO increased 14% to $1.01 billion or $3.48 on a per share basis, in both cases, exceeding our full year guidance ranges. Now let's turn to segment performance. In the fourth quarter, our Global RIM business delivered revenue of $1.02 billion, an increase of $76 million from last year or 8% on a reported basis from last year. On an organic basis, revenue increased 7%. Constant currency storage rental revenue growth of 4.2% or 2.5% on an organic basis reflects our focus on revenue management and solid volume trends. With positive volume trends and growth in our adjacent and consumer businesses, total physical volume was in line with our expectations for the quarter and the year. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $453 million, an increase of $49 million year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was up 160 basis points year-on-year, reflecting continued pricing strength and productivity. Turning to our global data center business. Our team booked 27 megawatts in the quarter. For the full year, bookings came in at 49 megawatts, significantly exceeding our full year guidance of 30 megawatts. We are very pleased with the team's leasing performance. To give some historical context, we leased 10 megawatts in 2018, 17 megawatts in 2019 and excluding our joint venture in Frankfurt, 31 megawatts in 2020. In terms of revenue, as we projected, fourth quarter growth accelerated to 25% year-over-year. Storage revenue grew 18% year-on-year, and service revenue was up sharply and in line with our projections. As a reminder, service revenue in the second half includes fit-out services we are providing to our Frankfurt joint venture. We expect that activity will be completed early in 2022. Even with the large service component, EBITDA margin increased sequentially with strong commencements. We are pleased with our data center performance, and our pipeline has continued to strengthen, both in terms of hyperscale and retail colocation. In 2022, we expect to lease 50 megawatts, which would represent 28% annual bookings growth. We project full year data center revenue growth in a range of high teens percent year-on-year with even higher growth rates on storage. With our strong prior year bookings and recent commencements, we have very good visibility to revenue. With pricing and improved mix, we expect data center margin for the full year to be up modestly compared to 2021. Turning to Project Summit. This quarter, the team delivered $30 million of incremental year-on-year adjusted EBITDA benefit. For the full year, as compared to 2020, Summit delivered $160 million of benefits. We continue to expect another $50 million of year-on-year benefit in 2022. Total capital expenditures were $219 million, of which $173 million was growth and $46 million was recurring. For the full year, total capital expenditures were $606 million, of which $309 million was growth capital related to data center development. In 2022, we expect total capital expenditures to be approximately $850 million. We are projecting approximately $700 million of growth CapEx, with data center development representing about 3/4 of that. We expect recurring CapEx to approach $155 million. Turning to capital recycling. As we have said before, we view the market for industrial assets as highly attractive as a means to supplement our growth capital. With that backdrop, in the fourth quarter, we upsized our recycling program and generated approximately $63 million of proceeds, bringing the full year to $278 million. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.3x, in line with our projection and modestly improved compared to last quarter. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term leverage range of 4.5 to 5.5x. For 2022, with the closing of the ITRenew transaction, we expect leverage to tick up modestly in the first quarter. We expect to exit the year at levels within our target range. In December, thanks to strong support from the fixed income community, our team successfully issued 10-year notes to support the ITRenew transaction. From a cash perspective, I would like to recognize our team for driving strong collections, improving our days sales outstanding and resulting in year-on-year improvement in our cash cycle. The collective performance has resulted in a 5-day improvement from pre-pandemic levels. With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early April. Also, as you may have seen, we are pleased to announce an important strategic milestone related to our unconsolidated joint venture focused on the fast-growing valet consumer storage market. MakeSpace recently completed a merger with Clutter, a similarly sized business also focused on valet storage. We expect the combination will result in considerable benefits, including a focus on a single brand, Clutter, broader reach and natural synergies. Iron Mountain will continue to provide storage services to the business, and our ownership interest will be nearly 25% of the combined entity. We are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and expect continued benefit to our total physical volume. Now turning to our outlook. For the full year 2022, we currently expect revenue of $5.125 billion to $5.275 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.8 billion to $1.85 billion. At the midpoint, our guidance represents revenue growth of 16% and EBITDA growth of 12%. We expect AFFO to be in the range of $1.085 billion to $1.12 billion, which represents 9% year-on-year growth at the midpoint point. We expect AFFO per share to be in a range of $3.70 to $3.82. Our guidance assumes organic global physical volume will be consistent to slightly positive year-on-year. We expect revenue management will be a significant benefit, and I will note that the majority of those actions have already been taken as we speak to you today. And nearly all of them will be in place by the end of the quarter. As Bill mentioned, we are planning for a continuation in the strong trends we are seeing in digital solutions and our organic ALM business, combined with a slight recovery in our service activity across the year. Our guidance also assumes the contribution from our acquisition of ITRenew. As we closed the deal at the end of January, we are including 11 months of the results in our guidance. Our guidance includes approximately $450 million of revenue from ITRenew. We estimate the stronger U.S. dollar will result in foreign exchange headwinds to revenue of approximately $60 million year-on-year with the vast majority of that in the first half. In terms of EBITDA, our expectations include the benefit from revenue management and top line growth, the contribution from ITRenew as well as Project Summit benefits. Our EBITDA guidance also assumes a prudent outlook for inflation, rent from our recent sale leaseback transactions, increased innovation spend, the stronger U.S. dollar and the divestiture of the software escrow business, which we sold in late second quarter. With the ongoing volatilities in the market associated with the pandemic as well as the closing of the ITRenew transaction during the quarter, we felt it would be helpful to share our expectations for the first quarter. We expect total revenue to be in excess of $1.2 billion. We expect EBITDA to be approximately $425 million. We expect AFFO to be in excess of $250 million. In summary, our team is executing well. Our pipeline continues to expand, and momentum continues to build across our business. Our addressable market has grown significantly over the last several years, and we expect this to continue to expand. We feel confident in our ability to deliver higher levels of growth. Thanks to our team's collective efforts, together with our strong customer relationships, brand position and investments in innovation, we feel very well positioned as we enter 2022. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. Thanks for the question. So we feel great about where we're positioned as it relates to profits and revenue and really see the business building quite well. The things I would call out to add to Bill's comments are you're right, there's a fair bit of services. On a total EBITDA margin, you will see the margin mix down, but that's the contribution of ITRenew. I'd say for planning purposes, if I were you, what we're using in our model is that business, as you would have seen from prior disclosures, is kind of a mid- to high-teens EBITDA margin. But when you get underneath that and back that out, you'd see that our core Iron Mountain margins are actually continuing to improve, and that's driven by the fact that we have very strong pricing contribution this year. From a planning posture, we kind of assumed 2 to 3 points. But as you probably saw in the most recent results, we're seeing the upper ends of that and probably more going forward, so feel very good about our revenue management program. Our data center business is doing phenomenally well, as you've seen, and that is a margin benefit as we move forward. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we expect our data center profitability to be up modestly year-to-year as a lot of revenue growth coming out of our storage side of the data center business. Of course, our Summit contributions continue to roll in. We'll have $50 million or more from Summit, thanks to the team's very strong contributions. You would have noticed from seeing our most recent results that our services gross margins and EBITDA margins are at very high levels. You can think like up 500, 600 basis points year-on-year in the fourth quarter. I expect that we will continue to see very strong service margin out of the core going forward. So we feel very well positioned, Sheila, and I appreciate the question. Okay. Thanks, Shlomo. I appreciate that. So first thing I'll tell you is on -- since you mentioned Frankfurt is it's not coming from that because those are really almost -- think of those as sort of pass-through revenues on the services business. In fact, that's a hit to our margins. And that's one of the reasons why our data center margin has been a little bit more muted. But as we move through finishing up those services in early '22, that's one of the reasons we expect the margin to be up year-on-year as you'll see a lot more contribution from our storage and, therefore, likely less service revenue coming out of data center. That said, where it's coming from is the core. And as we've said for quite a few quarters now, Project Summit and just general productivity coming out of our operations has been very beneficial. You saw our gross margin to be up, I think it's 550 basis points year-on-year. It was up 400 basis points sequentially. And that's just very strong operating leverage. I would say there's some incremental mix there. Bill spoke a lot about our digital solutions and our asset life cycle management. That is also contributing very nicely. There's some revenue management on our services line as well. So in terms of -- you mentioned about inflation. As I said, at this time last year, I will reiterate, we've been what I think is prudent with our outlook. We have embedded in our guidance a healthy amount of inflation more than we're currently seeing similar posture to what we took last year. And while there is certainly a level of inflation, as we all know, out in the economy, I would look at our more fixed structure and say that together with our revenue management program, we have the benefit of working to drive productivity and seeing a considerable amount of our pricing fall to the bottom line. So we feel very good about where we are positioned currently, Shlomo, with respect to services and the guide in total. Yes. Thanks, Kevin. Appreciate the question. So first up on CapEx. Our total CapEx guide is $850 million. Growth capital is $700 million of that. And you are right, as you point out that the data center is getting basically all of that increase. So we are planning our data center development CapEx at $550 million. That's up from about $300 million in 2021. The thing about that is, of course, as you've seen from the strong leasing we've had and the very strong pipeline we have continuing to build that -- and it's a necessity in the sense because we are -- the team is continuing to win great deals around the world. So we're very pleased with the way the data center team is planning. From a free cash flow standpoint, while the CapEx will be up, I'll note that all of our Summit costs are behind us now, Kevin. So there's -- if you think about last year, we had over $200 million of costs to achieve Summit, which go away this year. Have a little bit more cash taxes, of course, with the ITRenew services business and having some more services revenue in our business. And -- but as you look at it, as you get through your model, I think you'll find that there's considerable growth in free cash flow before growth in the model. So I appreciate the question. We look forward to showing you the strength in the cash flow as we move forward. The only thing I would add is that while we see some level -- as you've heard from other industry participants, some level of inflation in cost, we also see very good pricing. And so we expect mark-to-market to be flat to up, if not better than that. We are seeing good pricing in terms of new deals. And we feel very well positioned. And I'm pleased to be able to say we expect the margin to be rising year-on-year. So thanks for the question. Yes. Thanks, Andrew. I'll disaggregate it for you. So you would be working with $450 million for ITRenew. The net of all of our other M&A activity in 2021 is about $25 million of benefit year-on-year. So not a lot. And you might be -- might have been thinking that, that would be higher, and I'll just remind folks that we did sell our software escrow business back in June. So that's a headwind to revenue, and then we bought a small data center in Frankfurt and we also did the small acquisition in the -- relatively small acquisition in the Mid East. So the net of all that is about $25 million year-on-year. And it's kind of first quarter, it's about $5 million, and it's about $5 million in the second quarter and with the balance kind of in the third. From an EBITDA standpoint, because as we talked about before that, that software escrow business was a high profit margin business, you're only looking for about $5 million of EBITDA from all of that incremental revenue. And then the FX is about $60 million of a headwind, that's as of yesterday. So -- and that's about $25 million or so of EBITDA headwind. So if you work through that, that would get you to your organic. It's very strong, by the way. And it's benefited by the fact that we have very strong visibility on pricing.  And the services side that Bill mentioned, we're growing strength to strength with our digital solutions probably being up at least 20% on top of 20% and the data center business and the storage area there being up in the 20s. So we feel very well positioned. Thank you, Andrew. Yes. The only thing I would add to that, Shlomo, and thanks again for the question, is I usually look at the records management retention rate on a year-over-year basis as opposed to sequentially because of the points that Bill was just making. And if you look at that versus the year-end 2020 number, it's actually up 40 basis points. So we feel very good about where the record retention rate finished the year. And the only other thing I guess I would add is if you look at the storage rental revenue growth on an organic basis, it was up 3.6% in the quarter. And that is -- 2/3 of that is coming out of our core and 1/3 of that is coming up from data center in terms of that improvement in terms of organic revenue growth. And when you look -- disaggregate the 2/3 coming out of our core, it's actually both pricing as well as improved volume trends because, as you know, the organic volume on a year -- full year basis was actually up. So we feel very good about where things are trending. We expect our volume to be consistent to up again in 2022. Thank you for the question. Okay. Thanks, Eric. A few points in there. Let me answer those. We aren't embedding any additional M&A in our guidance for this year. So we shouldn't be planning for that. As we said before, we're very committed to our leverage range, and we'll get back into that leverage range and the year within it. In terms of additional things to put in the model, I would say I would be planning for something like $150 million of capital recycling. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the cap rates there are phenomenal. We've seen cap rates even sub-4. So it's very, very good environment out there. And as a reminder, we're generally doing sale leaseback transactions that are very favorable, in our opinion, because we essentially have ownership-like interest in the building while monetizing it at these great cap rates. And that enables us to really just be very strategic about the capital allocation plan. In terms of your question about AFFO payout ratio, you're right, in our guidance, we'd be just above the mid-60s by the end of the year. And we've said repeatedly that our target is for that to be kind of the low to mid-60s over the long term. And at that point, we'd be looking at a dividend increase. So in fact, we'd be almost approaching sort of the REIT minimum under certain scenarios under that -- at that level. And therefore, you probably would be expecting dividends through in the future to be rising with the same rate as AFFO per share."

            "content": "Thank you, Gillian, and thank you all for taking time to join us today. We are pleased to have delivered record performance for both the fourth quarter and the full year. These record results are reflective of our broad offerings, deep customer relationships, resilient business model and our dedicated teams. Despite the challenges associated with the pandemic and most recently with the Omicron variant, our Mountaineers around the world have continued each and every day to put our customers first now with renewed and invigorated focus on growth. And our historically high revenue and profitability are a testament to our Mountaineers' commitment. Speaking about our Mountaineers, I wish to begin my remarks by stating that we are all saddened by the overnight events in the Ukraine. Our thoughts and prayers are with our customers there and our fellow 60 Mountaineers and their families living and working in the Ukraine. I am sure for all of us, given the current events in Europe, it deals in many ways inappropriate discussing our financial results with this backdrop. Yet at the same time, it is in keeping with our Mountaineer spirit. With that, let me begin our discussion of our remarkable and record year. In the fourth quarter, we achieved our highest ever quarterly revenue of $1.16 billion, yielding 8.5% of total organic revenue growth and record EBITDA of $431 million. For the full year, we achieved record revenue of nearly $4.5 billion and EBITDA of $1.6 billion. These results were fueled by increased demand for our services across key markets. For the full year, we delivered organic storage rental revenue growth of 2.6%, reflecting continued benefit of pricing combined with positive volume trends. We drove double-digit growth in digital offerings, including data center inside our digital transformation services and secure IT disposition, now referred to as ALM, or asset life cycle management. Our digital services and ALM businesses continue to build momentum, growing over 20% in the fourth quarter and capping off an excellent year of growth. Further to our recent success in the ALM area, we are also pleased to report that the acquisition of ITRenew, announced in December, closed in January. This acquisition will accelerate our growth trajectory in this $30 billion market, which is growing over 10% per year. Our newly created ALM division will absorb our historical secure ITAD business line. This enlarged division not only helps us provide chain of custody for our customers' IT assets, but our ALM activities also assure our customers that their IT assets are wiped of any data at the end of their life and destroyed and recycled in a responsible way. On this last point, in terms of recycling, our expanded offerings in this space around a circular economy are important for both IRM's and our customers' ESG goals leading to carbon neutrality. This expanded ALM division also strongly complements our fast-growing data center business, bringing capabilities to serve some of the largest and most innovative companies in the world in a more cradle-to-grave way, consistent with the best security and ESG practices. This expanded ALM platform will directly benefit from Iron Mountain's 225,000 loyal customer base, which includes 95% of the Fortune 1000. This global customer base is supported by 25,000 Mountaineers across 1,450 facilities in 63 countries. Our recent expansions in data center, machine learning-driven data analytics and insights and now ALM are just some of the examples of how we continue to invest in growth to capitalize on our many opportunities ahead, serving a customer base which has been loyal to Iron Mountain for decades. I have shared with you previously how in the last 5 years, these investments have taken the total addressable market, or TAM, of our products and services from $10 billion to some $80 billion. I am happy to report our continued build-out of new products and services in the last year as well as growth in these underlying markets has now taken our TAM to over $120 billion. Our continued drive in building an ever-expanding set of synergistic and customer-centric solutions, together with global reach and scale, is the fuel behind much of the acceleration in our growth. Let me share a few examples of how we've been empowering our customers' success in growth through our diverse solution offerings and unmatched customer service. Our recent customer win with a large aerospace company, where we won a backfile digitization deal of over $20 million, is a superb example of collaboration amongst our entertainment services, technology organization and our global records organization, or GRO. In order to achieve its goal of being a 100% model engineering company and to most effectively use designs and data from historical archives to refine new designs, this aerospace company sought help with the digitization and auto classification of over 50 million digital engineering assets. We were tasked to store, classify and utilize machine learning to identify relevant information whilst maintaining compliance with International Traffic in Arms Regulations known as ITAR. To this end, we developed and implemented an ITAR-compliant solution using our InSight machine learning platform operating in the AWS government cloud environment. Iron Mountain is uniquely positioned to assist our partner with this initiative with our storage capabilities, our understanding of ITAR compliance complexities, our machine learning-trained analytic engines and our technological support to ensure efficiency and success. Moreover, this project enables us to deliver critical insight into engineering data, not just to this company but also to other manufacturing and engineering customers across the globe. Another key win worth highlighting is with a branch of the U.S. federal government. We concluded a Phase 1 contract and have also been awarded a Phase 2 contract for this branch. The agency originally planned to select 3 vendors for the first contract due to the high volume of microfilm reels needing to be processed, but our solution surpassed the customer's expectations, and Iron Mountain was awarded the exclusive contract to process all 177,000 of microfilm reels or over 2 billion records needing analysis. This win was based on our unique splitting technique, proprietary machine learning, automated QA process and processing scalability that helped us to differentiate our offer from the competition. These technology innovations for the customer have enabled future use cases, which rely on advanced pattern recognition at scale, including OCR microfilm processing projects, applying machine learning extraction techniques for digital mailroom, invoice processing and extracting information from claims documents, to name a few. Another example how Iron Mountain is working with customers to support their digital transformation is our recent partnership with a production and development company operating in the U.K.'s North Sea. We've undertaken a significant back scan of their legacy archive records to meet their regulatory obligations to the U.K. oil and gas authority in order to relinquish their license to operate on 230 wells they wish to abandon. They're required to digitally upload all information assets to the National Data Repository. Using the InSight platform, we were able to solve the problem of having enormous amounts of data to sift whilst consolidating physical and digital data in disconnected information silos and resulting in millions of dollars of annual savings. Moving back above ground, recently in our Crozier Fine Arts division, we won a contract to provide comprehensive storage solutions and logistical support for the museum operations of the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures. We were excited and proud that based upon a foundation of long-term partnership and trust built up through many years of support from Iron Mountain's Entertainment Services division, they came to us to meet their evolving needs where Crozier services were an ideal match. Now turning to wins in our data center business. Recall that our bookings target for the year was 30 megawatts. We are pleased to have finished the year with nearly 49 megawatts of leases signed with over 27 megawatts of leases in the fourth quarter alone. This includes the new 20-megawatt lease in our Manassas, Virginia data center announced in December. This lease is expected to commence in phases from mid-2022 through mid-2023. We continue to see strong demand for comprehensive data center solutions from our existing customer base. This lease is indicative of our ability to meet that demand and reflects our commitment to strategically partnering with our customers to meet their individual requirements. Based on current design plans, we now expect that the VA2 facility to support 36 megawatts, up from 30 megawatts previously. With these changes and other additions to our portfolio, our total capacity is now in excess of 600 megawatts. Finally, we continue to be recognized for our leadership around ESG. This has been an important focus for us for many years, having produced annual sustainability reports outlining our commitments and progress since 2013. Some of our past recognitions have included: 100% of our data center power is generated by renewables; we were the launch provider of Green Power Pass, which allows our customers to report reductions in their carbon footprint when using our data centers; we were a co-signer with Google to expand our commitment to green-powered data centers to 24/7 carbon-free electricity; and we were one of the original signatories of the UN Global Compact on Sustainability back in 2016. More recently, we announced, in addition to their RE100 program, we have joined the Climate Group's EV100 initiative and reached a key milestone in electrifying our global vehicle fleet in line to reach our climate pledge commitment to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2040. We have made real progress towards our carbon reduction goals. Since establishing our first science-based targets, we have reduced absolute greenhouse gas emissions by over 60% from our 2016 baseline whilst growing the business. We believe that our commercial growth and ESG initiatives make us stand out, and we suspect they were a major factor of our being ranked amongst the top 100 on Newsweek's list of America's most responsible companies. In summary, our future ahead is bright. We are building on our growth momentum as we expand our portfolio to meet our customers' evolving needs. And with our strong footprint, powerful portfolio and deep customer relationships, we are confident that we can continue this momentum as we ascend our mountain range and provide another set of performance records this year and the years ahead. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry. Thanks for the question. So I think I'll talk about, first of all, where the revenue growth comes. And then I'll let Barry comment a little bit on the EBITDA margin, the impact that has. So I think we continue to see 2022 to have the same kind of momentum that we had in 2021. And the momentum that you saw in 2021 was driven by 2 things. First of all, a very solid foundation from our GRO business across the globe. So that continues to drive low single-digit growth and highly profitable. And then a continued acceleration in terms of our new areas, which are everything that includes data center, the digitization platform, which uses the artificial intelligence, machine learning InSight platform as well as the acceleration in asset life cycle management. So we still see that to be strong double-digit growth in those new service areas. So some of those have a different margin associated with it, but that's where we see the fuel of the revenue growth. And maybe, Barry, you want to comment in terms of what that does in terms of EBITDA progression. Yes. The only thing I would add, Shlomo, because you know the business really well is the other thing -- the uptick that you see in the services, we're doing, quite frankly, more value-added. I mean, more and more of our digitization services have an ML or machine learning component of it. I mentioned auto classification and some of the work that we're doing. It's not just simple scanning. So there's an analytical piece to that as well, which obviously has a higher margin. And we see almost -- I wouldn't say all, but now it's almost all the new projects we're selling have some component of that, which just naturally attract higher margin. And as Barry said, you've heard us talk about inflation for a long time is that, well, inflation is not good for people on the street, and so I'm not trying to be blase about it for our business because it's such a high-margin business that the pricing action generally is expansion. It has an expansive effect on our margins because our margins were relatively high-margin business. So it's -- yes, we feel good about the progression that we're getting. So thanks, George, for the question. So as you noticed, we've been getting kind of strong double-digit, roughly, say, 20%. We had a couple of quarters where it was up 30%, kind of in that high teens, kind of low 20s in terms of growth rate going forward, and we continue to see that kind of evolution. We're really impressed by how quickly the book is building, quite frankly, because the ITRenew business had very strong exposure to the hyperscale community, which has direct or synergistic effects with our data center team. So we're finding we're already getting additional traction even beyond what ITRenew is bringing by the discussions that we're having between our data team -- data center team and the ITRenew team that came across talking to the hyperscalers. But then on the other side, to your point, we're -- if you think about our traditional customers, whether it's financial services, insurance or general industry, is those folks that the way they dispose of their IT assets, both from a security standpoint as well as making sure that they disposed in a way that's environmentally sensitive, is becoming more and more important. So we continue to see now with an expanded platform to have similar growth -- organic growth rates that we did this past year, which I said we're, let's say, upper teens to touching into the 20% category. And we'll update you as we go through the progress, but we're really happy in terms of already the synergies that we're getting from that, putting the 2 teams together. So let me -- I'll start with the leasing activity, and then Barry can comment further. But I think the -- you're right, I mean, that with the hyperscale folks, you do have more visibility. I mean, I think you can expect that the retail side or the colo side would be -- continue to be kind of in the teens of megawatts a year. So we like that business. We continue to see the same kind of deal flow or pipeline coming in on that side. And then the thing we're also very excited about is that a few years ago, we were relatively a new entrant in the hyperscale. And clearly, if you look at the results this past year, almost hitting 50 megawatts, and this year, we're guiding to another 50 megawatts. We're making really, really good progress. So we're starting to look more like, what I would say, a typical industry player in the data center space where you're getting like kind of 60% to 70% of the volume, maybe even a little bit more from hyperscale and the rest from colocation and retail. Thank you, Sheila, for the question. And actually, I just got back from a trip to D.C. a couple of weeks ago. So the -- I would say it's kind of yes and no. Yes, in terms of the brand, right, because we have been a very trusted partner operating government-approved facilities for their physical storage for many years, as you know. And I think that brand recognition with the U.S. federal government has been extremely strong. That being said, the recent contracts I've been highlighting have been us actually providing digital service, auto classification analytics around some of these documents, also taking documents that are already in digital form that we're not actually storing on behalf of the federal government. So more and more going forward is that we're providing purely digital services. But I wouldn't underestimate the halo effect of the understanding of the brand and the trust and the security associated with working with Iron Mountain. So first of all, I guess -- I thought you were asleep this morning, so I notice someone had taken your voice. No. So first of all, we're really pleased with the progression in terms of our records management business because if you notice that actually, sequentially, it's actually getting stronger, not weaker. And as I said, the slight negative drag on the records management business is really a second derivative effect. And as that kind of wears through, you start seeing a stabilization. And indeed, we're actually seeing an improvement in the trends in the records management. And in terms of total volume, physical storage volume, is our other areas of storage and adjacent business areas and consumer more than offset those flattening trends. I would say -- the only other thing I would say is that, yes, you're right, and you've been watching this business for a long time. You always see a little bit of an uptick in destructions in the fourth quarter because, generally, it's kind of like people do their spring housecleaning in our business as they kind of do their fall housekeeping. So we do see some -- just generally. But that's like every year. I didn't -- we didn't see more of that or less of that this year. And Barry, you might want to talk more specifically about the trend."

Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Sarah Berry of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nSarah Berry: Thank you, Chris. Good morning and welcome to our Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. On today's call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and CEO, and Barry Hytinen, our EVP and CFO. After prepared remarks, we will open up the lines for Q&A. Today's earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations.  All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's earnings materials, the Safe Harbor language on Slide 2, and our annual report on Form 10-K for discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliations to these measures in our supplemental financial information. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Meaney: Thank you, Sarah, and thank you all for taking time to join us. We are pleased to have delivered strong performance in the third quarter reflecting our broad offerings, deep customer relationships, resilient business model, and the strength of our team. This can be easily highlighted by our 7.4% total organic revenue growth. This strong overall organic revenue growth has been delivered by continued strength in our storage business, as well as double-digit growth in our new and existing digital offerings, including data center inside our digital transformation services, and IT asset disposition or I-Tech.  Throughout the pandemic, including the most recent challenges of the Delta variant, our Mountaineers around the world have truly stepped up. Each and every day to put our customers first with a focus on growth. I'm both proud and humbled by this incredibly talented and dedicated team and what we've been able to accomplish through such a challenging time. Today's results, including our strong organic revenue growth exceeding 7%, is a direct result of their dedication in serving our customers in ways they need to keep their businesses growing. We have a lot to cover today, so I'll start with a brief overview of our results and key business drivers.  During the third quarter, we reported revenue of over $1.1 billion EBITDA of over -- of EBITDA of $418 million, both of which are new record highs. Our results are fueled by increased demand for our services across key markets and continued positive momentum in the business. Our digital services in iPad business continue to build on its prior performance and deliver almost 20% growth in the quarter. Today, we're proud to say that 95% of the Fortune 1000 are among the 225,000 of our loyal customer base. We have a growing footprint of more than 1,460 facilities and with our recent expansion in the Middle East, we are now present in 63 countries. And we are supported by 25,000 Mountaineers across the globe. As we look ahead to future opportunities, there is no doubt the world has changed. But, we're making the improvements to our business today to serve the changed needs of the world tomorrow. That is why we have built, evolved, and expanded our trusted relationships with our customers as not only the leading storage platform of physical assets, but also the business services partner to support data center co-location, information security, data insights, Secure IT Asset Disposition and business process management.  With this focus, we have expanded our total addressable market to more than $80 billion. Together with our strong customer relationships, focus on innovation, and 70-year heritage, we are operating from a unique position of strength. Now let's turn to some of the exciting events during the quarter. You'll hear us talk a lot about customer - centricity here at Iron Mountain. And when we help our customers not only protect their information, but also unlock new revenue opportunities, as well as cost efficiencies. That's a big win for our customers, and ultimately, for us. We were proud to be featured as one of the winners of Google's first-ever Google Cloud Customer Award for Financial Services for our work with a large financial institution. This is a great follow-on award from a couple of years ago when we won their machine learning artificial intelligence partner of the year. But this award, we leveraged our expertise in mortgage document processing to train machine learning models to automate document classification and data extraction and validation, deliver advanced exception management and unlock value for our customers.  In line with our automation first mindset, we utilize Google's document understanding for AI algorithms in Iron Mountain's insight platform to identify, classify, extract and validate loan data to support authenticity, accuracy, and completeness. As a result of our services, the customer has seen efficiency improvements including a 25% post-closing cost reduction, increased scalability, a shortened cycle time, and increased responsiveness to market demand, among other enhancements. We are not only proud of our work with this financial services customer, but are also dedicated to continuing to enrich our customer's ability to protect and preserve their high-value assets in -- and in turn, a system with gaining market share in their businesses through higher end-customer satisfaction. I'm also pleased to report that Iron Mountain received the JP Morgan Chase Strategic Diverse Gold Supplier Award for our commitment to supplier diversity and the contributions of our very own supplier diversity program. Together with our fellow Gold Suppliers, we have collectively agreed to increase spending with diverse owned businesses and have set ambitious goals over the next three years. As part of this, we are on track to achieve our goal of $63 million in supplier diversity spend by the end of 2021. This is not just about our diversity goals, but it is also about helping our customers like JPMorgan Chase and our fellow Gold Suppliers to drive improvements in supplier diversity, which we recognize is important for all communities in which we operate.  By working together, we're having a far greater impact than any one company can achieve alone. I would now like to highlight our recent win working together with General Dynamics. You will recall we have been speaking for some time about the potential for our services inside the U.S. Federal Government. Whilst the transformation of the federal government has taken some time, we have seen over the past year major growth in our business across a number of governmental agencies. This growth is due not only to the residents that our products are having with the government and assisting them on their own transformation paths, but also to the work our government team has done in partnership with the likes of General Dynamics. This partnership is already resulting in a 3-year Iron Mountain contract worth $23 million to help the Department of Veteran's Affairs with their digital transformation in order to serve better our U.S. soldiers. As part of this initial project, we're helping the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs digitally process an estimated 15 million official military personnel files. Through digital transformation, this agency is taking a proactive approach to provide greater access to personnel files, as well as streamline the overall claims process in order to get veterans the benefits they deserve. In addition to our success with General Dynamics, I would like to highlight another win in our global RIM segment. We've had a long-standing relationship with a major global financial institution for over 20 years, and we have recently expanded our relationship with them, by signing a new 10-year global contract in which they committed to renew and consolidate all global records in data management business with us.  Through this work, along with our global scale, we won an additional two-year contract for data restoration and migration services. We will provide the customer with clear, detailed information from backup tapes spanning 11 years, which will help them make informed decisions around data deletion, retention, and remediation. Ultimately, we will reduce and enhance data management and compliance. Finally, turning to data center, we are well on track to exceeding our bookings target of 30 megawatts this year. In fact, through October, we stand at 24 megawatts in addition to our continued growth in bookings this quarter, we closed on the acquisition of our new data center in Frankfurt. When we purchased the new Frankfurt data center, we inherited over 2 megawatts of existing clients, and we have expansion capacity of 8 megawatts for a total of over 10 megawatts on that site.  Already in this quarter, we have signed 1.6 megawatts of new leases for this site and have a strong pipeline which should absorb the remaining capacity over the next 2 to 3 years. I should also add that our first in purpose-built data center in Frankfurt is up and running and a tenant which leases the entire 27 megawatts is moving in this quarter. With this transaction in Frankfurt, we now have a total potential capacity in Europe of more than a 107 megawatts, which provides access to important interconnection markets for new and existing customers looking for reliable, flexible and secure data center locations across the Frankfurt, Amsterdam, and London markets. Even with our rapid growth, sustainability remains at the core of how we offer data center capacity. Iron Mountain continues to source more than a 100% of its energy used for data centers from renewable energy.  Moreover, as we announced in April, we took a significant step forward in the development of enhanced solutions for purchasing renewable energy by entering into an agreement to track the hourly load. I'm proud to announce that this September, we were able to report on our performance for the first half of the year for our datacenters in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey that are benefiting from this agreement. Over the past several months, we have taken definitive steps towards a truly carbon-free energy supply.  Not just by offsetting our carbon footprint by purchasing and reselling renewables, but by matching renewable energy in the very grids in which we operate. We are the first company to join Google to adopt the 24/7 carbon-free energy goal, and we became a founding signatory to the new UN Clean Energy Compact being released at COP26 this week. We can already publish 24/7 carbon-free energy performance at 3 of our campuses, becoming the 1st large co-location data center provider with this capability. We recognize that we are an important component of our clients energy footprint and we will continue to take every opportunity to minimize our environmental impact on their behalf. The awards and successes I outlined today are just a few among the various wins Iron Mountain has achieved this quarter. As we continue to deliver accelerated growth at IRM, in spite of the continued impact of COVID on some of our traditional service areas, I am confident that our resilient business model expanded product portfolio, customer first culture, and strategic transformation will continue to deliver strong sales growth. With that, I will turn the call over to Barry.\nBarry Hytinen: Thanks, Bill. And thank you for joining us. The third quarter exceeded our expectations across each of our key financial metrics. Continuing the trend, we have seen over the last few quarters, revenue continued to strengthen with a strong recovery in service revenue, reflecting accelerating rates of growth driven by the new service offerings Bill discussed. Our core physical storage business performed well, and we are seeing continued strength in our growth areas. Turning to our results for the quarter. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.13 billion grew 9%. Total organic revenue increased 7.4% year-over-year.  As an example of the momentum we are building on a 2-year basis, our organic revenue growth continued to accelerate in the quarter. Organic service revenue increased $61 million or 18%. Our team drove strong growth in both Global Digital Solutions business and Secure IT Asset Disposition. Total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.3% with continued benefit from pricing and positive trends in volume. Adjusted EBITDA was $418 million an increase of $42 million from last year. We exceeded the projections we shared on our last call as the team drove improved margin performance, despite the stronger U.S. dollar. AFFO $263 million or $0.90 on a per-share basis, up 47 million dollars and $0.15 respectively from the third quarter of last year. Turning to segment performance.  In the third quarter, our global RIM business delivered revenue of $996 million, an increase of 74 million from last year. On an organic basis, revenue increased 6% The team performed well with constant currency storage rental revenue growth of 2.7% or 1.8% on an organic basis. This performance reflects an acceleration in growth as compared to the last few quarters. Growth was driven by pricing and volume. With positive volume trends in the Mid East deal that Bill mentioned, total physical volume achieved a new all-time record of 744 million cubic feet. We are pleased with the underlying trends, and continue to expect total volume on an organic basis to be flat to modestly up for the full year.  Our traditional services business continue to recover from the pandemic with revenue growing 14% year-over-year, all be at still down 4% from the levels achieved in 2019 reflecting the continued COVID impact. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $443 million, an increase of $49 million year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 180 basis points year-over-year as a result of strong operating leverage and improved service margins. Turning to our global datacenter business, our team booked 9 megawatts in the quarter. And through the end of the third quarter, we have booked at 22 megawatts.  With our strong and building pipeline and the additional contracts we've already signed this quarter, we are confident in our ability to exceed our full-year guidance of 30 megawatts. In terms of revenue as we projected, growth accelerated sharply to 22% year-over-year. In light of our strong performance year-to-date and prior-year bookings, we now expect full-year revenue growth of at least mid-teens percent, exceeding our prior projections. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 40% was consistent with the expectations we shared on our last call and driven by Buildout services at our Frankfurt facility. Turning to Project Summit, this quarter, the team delivered $38 million of the incremental year-on-year adjusted EBITDA benefit. We continue to expect year-on-year benefits from summit of $160 million with another $50 million of year-on-year benefit in 2022. Total capital expenditures were $138 million of which $100 million was growth, and $38 million was recurring. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.4 times slightly better than our projection. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term leverage range of 4 and 1/2 to 5 and 1/2 times. For 2021, we expect to exit the year at levels at or below the third quarter.  From a cash cycle perspective, I would like to highlight that our team drove a two-day improvement from last year and specifically call out that our Days Sales Outstanding are at the best level they've been at in several years. With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early January. Turning to our outlook. With the ongoing pandemic and where we are in the year, I feel it will be helpful to provide our view explicitly for this quarter. We expect total revenue growth to be in the high single-digit percentage range year-over-year in the fourth quarter.  For EBITDA, we expect percentage growth to be in the range of low double-digit to low teens year-over-year in the fourth quarter. We expect year over year AFFO growth in excess of 30% in the fourth quarter. As you may remember, last year we had an elevated level of maintenance capex in the fourth quarter as we caught up from pandemic-driven delays. On a more normalized level of capex spend last year, this implies at least 20% growth in AFFO in the fourth quarter of 2021. In summary, our team is executing well, our pipeline is growing, and momentum continues to build across our business. Our addressable market continues to expand and we feel confident in our ability to drive growth. We feel well-positioned and look forward to updating you on our progress following the fourth quarter. And with that, Operator, please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. We will limit analysts to one question and you can then rejoin the queue. Our first question is from Sheila McGrath of Evercore, please go ahead.\nSheila McGrath: I guess god morning. Bill and Barry. I've gotten questions from investors. that bottom line, growth, and margin improvement has benefited from Project Summit. And that benefit will be less of a factor going forward. Can you outline what revenue growth opportunities you are positive about for Iron Mountain looking out the next few years? And a related question to that is, can you also outline how you're able to effectively present such a broad offering of products to your customers when it appears there be different context at the -- at the customers for storage versus data centers versus insight.\nBill Meaney: Good morning, Sheila. So I'll start with strategically in where the product portfolio is going and then let Barry comment a little bit more on the nuts and bolts in terms of margin. So thanks for the question. I think, first -- I think part of Project Summit, you've seen that show up in the record high EBITDA margin that we have this quarter, so thank you for the call out on that. And I think that that's an ongoing benefit that we'll have. That EBITDA margin may move up and down depending on the product mix and it comes to your product portfolio question. On the product portfolio, a part of Summit that you haven't seen directly, in other words it isn't in the margin, is we've also taken a lot of benefit of Project Summit and reinvested in the business.  So besides actually driving the margin improvement that we printed today, we've also reinvested in the business and that's really what's driven that total addressable market going from $10 billion to $80 billion that we've highlighted the last few quarters. And part of that $80 billion of new total addressable market is the almost 20% growth that we've seen in digital services, which is primarily our insight driven digital platform, together with IT Asset Disposal business.  Those are some of the new areas that I think you're highlighting behind your question. So we actually see -- that business is growing strong double-digits and we can see that continue. You take that on top of the growth and the continued acceleration in growth in our data center businesses so we're well on track to exceed our upgraded guidance last quarter of 30 megawatts of bookings for this year. Then I do -- we do expect to see -- continue with levels of revenue growth like we've seen the last few quarters. Because this growth that we've seen in the topline, whilst we have seen -- luckily, some recovery in terms of our traditional service business. I think it's fair to say that we've seen an acceleration in terms of our revenue growth that's really driven by the new product areas and less from what I would call a rebound from historically low activity due to COVID. I don't know, Barry if you want to comment a little bit around the margin?\nBarry Hytinen: Hi, Sheila. Good morning and thanks for the question. I would say when we look outlook and you look at where our margin has been recently, where it's going to continue to go, We have very favorable trends in pricing. I think that you will continue to see at least the level of pricing activity going forward as we've seen here over the last year or so. There's some macro trends there that are both positive for us I think on a pricing benefit. If you look at our data center business of the margin, as we talked about has on a transitory basis been a little bit lower than where we expect it to go over time.  That business is obviously dealing with some fit-out on our Frankfurt facility, which is transitory here in the third and the fourth quarter. And as we move forward, we see that margin expanding. So that's obviously a very nice secular tailwind to the business. And then I would say when you look at ongoing productivity, we continue to see that. So while Summit has been incredibly beneficial to the business and we'll have more Summit benefit year-on-year next year, we certainly see the opportunity for additional productivity. The only other thing I'll say is, as you know, since you follow the company well, we've had couple of relatively large sale leaseback transactions over the last 12 months. And while I expect to continue to do a relative amount of capital recycling, that's been a big headwind on a year-over-year basis. So if that comes down to a more -- a little more normalized level going forward, that's also a benefit.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. The next question is from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. As it relates to your overall growth portfolio, can you provide a sense of how quickly it grew and also discuss examples of recent success and traction outside of your Data Centers business?\nBill Meaney: Yes. Thanks, George. If you look at the 20% growth that we called out this quarter, or just under 20% growth, that's all non Data Center. So that is the -- what we call ITAD or IT Asset Disposal business and we've won some recent large global contracts for that. Mainly for corporates that are trying to make sure that they both manage the secured destruction of any information that happens to be on their devices or hardware, as well as making sure that they can be managed in an environmentally friendly way. That's one part of it. And the other part of it is just the rapid growth that we've seen in adoption of our InSight platform and overall digitization of people's information.  So that's everything from people taking advantage to say, okay, when they're retrieving documents on a very simple basis, is we want to actually retrieve them electronically through the InSight platform where they can access those from a secure platform in the cloud, to Digital Mailroom, which is beyond the typical mail-room employee arbitrage model, but again allowing people to have not only access to the information that comes through their mail room, but to be able to operate in a hybrid work fashion. In other words, where people can work from home and the office and always have access to their information.  To even some, what I would call larger, more complex deals, I mean, I just returned from the Middle East about a month ago, where we're working with a government there and their National Archives to help them digitize everything about the way the government works. And that's again using the insight platform. But it's not just the insight platform, but auto classification of the documents to create metadata so that they can actually share the information digitally to the right people with the right security level in a way that can be managed for the long term. So it's multifaceted thing, but those are the areas that are really driving a lot of the top line growth that we see today. And as well as our data center business. I mean, obviously the data center business with the types of bookings that we have, will continue to drive increasing levels of growth. I should -- but I should not miss how it is, the underlying growth of the more traditional side of the business, mostly driven by pricing, continues to the chug along nicely.\nOperator: Thank you sir. The next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead. Mr. Rosenbaum, your line is open. Just check that you're not muted.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Sorry. I was muted. Thank you. I wanted to ask a little bit about the storage business and some of the puts and takes that went through it. It seems like there is some other -- with an acquisition something added about 10 million cubic feet. You guys are getting pricing. There's some organic growth. But when I go to the total revenue from adjusted storage when including the terminations and permanent withdrawal fees, it's really flattish sequentially. And so I was just want to ask you, what are some of the puts and takes that you might have seen on a sequential basis because I think you commented last quarter expecting some volumes to come in that will pent up from COVID-19. And was just wondering how this is translating into revenue as you build through the year.\nBarry Hytinen: Hi Shlomo, it's Barry, thanks for the question. I will try to unpack that for you. So you are right. We did close on the transaction in the Mid East, which we think is a great platform for us to continue to grow in that region together with our existing business. Now I will note that that closed very late in the quarter in the second half of September so really had almost no benefit to the quarter in terms of the financials, albeit it is in our cube as you note. So that didn't really help the sequential. On the pricing, you might recall that the beginning of the year and then again on the quarter call, I mentioned that all of the pricing we had planned for was already set as of March or April.  And so the sequential benefit on pricing was not much and we weren't planning for it. And then the other thing I'll call out, as you think about storage sequentially is we did divest the software escrow business in June, second -- first part of June last quarter. And so the sequential move from the second to the third on storage, that was completely storage business. So it's about $6 or $7 million of sequential decline due to that being in the second quarter, but not in the third quarter. So all in, we feel quite good. In fact, I'll be -- I'll tell you that the storage revenue performed better than we were planning on a sequential basis. And as it relates to the point about pent-up demand, you'll recall last quarter we did note that -- and that was in some of the economies, particularly in Asia and I'd say with the -- some of the COVID and Delta variant and various other elements that occurred in some of those markets, we continue to have a pretty good-sized backlog. Bill, anything you want to add?\nBill Meaney: No. I think that's -- covers that.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Then the next question is from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nEric Luebchow: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to touch upon fairly topical area in data centers today. A lot of talk in the industry about cost inflation in terms of development costs along with supply chain challenges and getting new equipment. Maybe you could just give us your perspective on what you're seeing in your footprint. Whether that's -- any development cost, inflation, any development delays in terms of timing. And also the impact of higher power cost, particularly in Europe. And then from a broader pricing perspective, do you think that this environment may be supportive of industry pricing moving upwards in the next couple of years as we work through all these challenges? Thanks.\nBill Meaney: Thanks, Eric. I appreciate the question. So 2 or 3 points that I'll cover in your question. I think the first bit is that, I would say that for 2022 in terms of supply chain, we're pretty well covered just because of the lead time. But to your point is, we have seen I would say 10 to 12 weeks increase in supply chain or lead time on some of the MEP and related equipment, and even in Including steel in some markets. I think to your point is, we are seeing a lengthening of the supply chain, but I would say for 2022, we're well covered because that's already been in training committed contracts to actually do that build-out.  And we're -- now we're already looking at 2023 and we're factoring in that extended lead time for some of that equipment in our planning. So the good news -- the bad news is that the lead times have increased. The good news is that we're well covered for 2022, so we've got the time to make sure we incorporate that in our planning for 2023. So that's -- I would say one aspect. And in terms of the increase in the prices -- so we're pretty well hedged for the 2022 commitments that we have because those are contracts that we've already lead. So we are seeing an increase in inflation in some of those raw materials. That being said because this is a business where the cost of construction is well known and quite transparent to our customer base, is we see trends and we expect that to continue. Our pricing will go in line with the cost of build. So I think we're kind of naturally hedged given the transparency of these businesses. In terms of the power cost is that the -- again, we're pretty well covered for this year, but we have seen an uptick in pricing in pretty much all the markets as you -- as everyone's noticed. And I would say that -- first part is, I would say about 60% of our portfolio in 2022 will be pretty much straight power pass-through, so we don't have any exposure in terms of the power costs. The remainder, most of that is still on long-term -- we've contracted for the power long-term. So think of our business has north of 70% naturally hedged, and the part that isn't is is up for renewal during the course of 2022, or a big part of it is. So we don't really see power affecting us in any material way. And in fact, we see continued upward progression in terms of our EBITDA margins as we get into 2022. But thanks for the question.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Next question is from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan, please go ahead.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi, this is Alex on for Andrew Steinerman. Our question is regarding your guidance. Your guidance for high-single-digit percentage growth in revenue and low double-digit to low teens percentage growth in EBITDA for fourth quarter appears to imply an adjusted EBIDTA margin of about 36.5%. Can you confirm that we're doing the math there right? Maybe speak to some of the drivers behind that? Thank you.\nBarry Hytinen: Hi, Alex. It's Barry. Thanks for the question. Why don't I help you with both the revenue and the EBITDA the way we are thinking about it. So in the fourth quarter, you right, we said about high single-digit. So let's say that's 8% or 9% on the revenue side just to give you a couple of the puts and takes. We have a -- the dollar is stronger as we have less than a point of FX benefit year-on-year, and a similar amount from M&A less than a point because just as a reminder, as I mentioned to Shlomo, we divested that software Escrow business in the second quarter. And so as a result, it's not much M&A benefit. So that leaves you with about call it 7% of organic constant currency growth.  And with the strength of the Data Center business, that'll contribute probably 1.5 points alone because that business is performing very well and so you should be working with your model and think like 20 plus percent growth in the fourth quarter from our Data Center business. The balance would be coming from low-single-digit growth in our storage rental revenue. And that'll be with good pricing contribution. Course the remainder is as Bill 's highlighted on the call, the very nice growth we're seeing out of our Digital Solutions and SITAD business. On the EBITDA stand side, we're looking at low double-digit to low -- sorry, mid-teens growth. So let's say that's 13 or so percent just to keep the midpoint there. For the purpose of this discussion, that's about, call it, $48 million of year-on-year increase. FX is a very small contribution, almost nothing, and M&A would be actually a net negative on a year-over-year basis in light of the escrow business was a very high-margin. And so think about data center as having a modest increase in margin sequentially still affected by the fit-out in Frankfurt. So a few million of benefit to EBITDA from data center.  Our Summit is -- our Summit Project is doing phenomenally well and the team is executing very well. You'll probably see $30+ million of year-on-year benefit in the quarter from that. And then of course, pricing will continue to be a very strong contributor. And the services margin, I expect to continue to improve which you've been seeing throughout the year. So naturally, there are some offsets with sale leaseback, as I mentioned earlier, and higher levels of commission in light of the very good trajectory the team is driving on top line. So we're feeling very good about the fourth quarter as we sit here today, and look forward to talking to you about it in 90 days. Thank you. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. This concludes our question and answer session and the Iron Mountain third quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Bill Meaney",
            "content": "Thank you, Sarah, and thank you all for taking time to join us. We are pleased to have delivered strong performance in the third quarter reflecting our broad offerings, deep customer relationships, resilient business model, and the strength of our team. This can be easily highlighted by our 7.4% total organic revenue growth. This strong overall organic revenue growth has been delivered by continued strength in our storage business, as well as double-digit growth in our new and existing digital offerings, including data center inside our digital transformation services, and IT asset disposition or I-Tech.  Throughout the pandemic, including the most recent challenges of the Delta variant, our Mountaineers around the world have truly stepped up. Each and every day to put our customers first with a focus on growth. I'm both proud and humbled by this incredibly talented and dedicated team and what we've been able to accomplish through such a challenging time. Today's results, including our strong organic revenue growth exceeding 7%, is a direct result of their dedication in serving our customers in ways they need to keep their businesses growing. We have a lot to cover today, so I'll start with a brief overview of our results and key business drivers.  During the third quarter, we reported revenue of over $1.1 billion EBITDA of over -- of EBITDA of $418 million, both of which are new record highs. Our results are fueled by increased demand for our services across key markets and continued positive momentum in the business. Our digital services in iPad business continue to build on its prior performance and deliver almost 20% growth in the quarter. Today, we're proud to say that 95% of the Fortune 1000 are among the 225,000 of our loyal customer base. We have a growing footprint of more than 1,460 facilities and with our recent expansion in the Middle East, we are now present in 63 countries. And we are supported by 25,000 Mountaineers across the globe. As we look ahead to future opportunities, there is no doubt the world has changed. But, we're making the improvements to our business today to serve the changed needs of the world tomorrow. That is why we have built, evolved, and expanded our trusted relationships with our customers as not only the leading storage platform of physical assets, but also the business services partner to support data center co-location, information security, data insights, Secure IT Asset Disposition and business process management.  With this focus, we have expanded our total addressable market to more than $80 billion. Together with our strong customer relationships, focus on innovation, and 70-year heritage, we are operating from a unique position of strength. Now let's turn to some of the exciting events during the quarter. You'll hear us talk a lot about customer - centricity here at Iron Mountain. And when we help our customers not only protect their information, but also unlock new revenue opportunities, as well as cost efficiencies. That's a big win for our customers, and ultimately, for us. We were proud to be featured as one of the winners of Google's first-ever Google Cloud Customer Award for Financial Services for our work with a large financial institution. This is a great follow-on award from a couple of years ago when we won their machine learning artificial intelligence partner of the year. But this award, we leveraged our expertise in mortgage document processing to train machine learning models to automate document classification and data extraction and validation, deliver advanced exception management and unlock value for our customers.  In line with our automation first mindset, we utilize Google's document understanding for AI algorithms in Iron Mountain's insight platform to identify, classify, extract and validate loan data to support authenticity, accuracy, and completeness. As a result of our services, the customer has seen efficiency improvements including a 25% post-closing cost reduction, increased scalability, a shortened cycle time, and increased responsiveness to market demand, among other enhancements. We are not only proud of our work with this financial services customer, but are also dedicated to continuing to enrich our customer's ability to protect and preserve their high-value assets in -- and in turn, a system with gaining market share in their businesses through higher end-customer satisfaction. I'm also pleased to report that Iron Mountain received the JP Morgan Chase Strategic Diverse Gold Supplier Award for our commitment to supplier diversity and the contributions of our very own supplier diversity program. Together with our fellow Gold Suppliers, we have collectively agreed to increase spending with diverse owned businesses and have set ambitious goals over the next three years. As part of this, we are on track to achieve our goal of $63 million in supplier diversity spend by the end of 2021. This is not just about our diversity goals, but it is also about helping our customers like JPMorgan Chase and our fellow Gold Suppliers to drive improvements in supplier diversity, which we recognize is important for all communities in which we operate.  By working together, we're having a far greater impact than any one company can achieve alone. I would now like to highlight our recent win working together with General Dynamics. You will recall we have been speaking for some time about the potential for our services inside the U.S. Federal Government. Whilst the transformation of the federal government has taken some time, we have seen over the past year major growth in our business across a number of governmental agencies. This growth is due not only to the residents that our products are having with the government and assisting them on their own transformation paths, but also to the work our government team has done in partnership with the likes of General Dynamics. This partnership is already resulting in a 3-year Iron Mountain contract worth $23 million to help the Department of Veteran's Affairs with their digital transformation in order to serve better our U.S. soldiers. As part of this initial project, we're helping the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs digitally process an estimated 15 million official military personnel files. Through digital transformation, this agency is taking a proactive approach to provide greater access to personnel files, as well as streamline the overall claims process in order to get veterans the benefits they deserve. In addition to our success with General Dynamics, I would like to highlight another win in our global RIM segment. We've had a long-standing relationship with a major global financial institution for over 20 years, and we have recently expanded our relationship with them, by signing a new 10-year global contract in which they committed to renew and consolidate all global records in data management business with us.  Through this work, along with our global scale, we won an additional two-year contract for data restoration and migration services. We will provide the customer with clear, detailed information from backup tapes spanning 11 years, which will help them make informed decisions around data deletion, retention, and remediation. Ultimately, we will reduce and enhance data management and compliance. Finally, turning to data center, we are well on track to exceeding our bookings target of 30 megawatts this year. In fact, through October, we stand at 24 megawatts in addition to our continued growth in bookings this quarter, we closed on the acquisition of our new data center in Frankfurt. When we purchased the new Frankfurt data center, we inherited over 2 megawatts of existing clients, and we have expansion capacity of 8 megawatts for a total of over 10 megawatts on that site.  Already in this quarter, we have signed 1.6 megawatts of new leases for this site and have a strong pipeline which should absorb the remaining capacity over the next 2 to 3 years. I should also add that our first in purpose-built data center in Frankfurt is up and running and a tenant which leases the entire 27 megawatts is moving in this quarter. With this transaction in Frankfurt, we now have a total potential capacity in Europe of more than a 107 megawatts, which provides access to important interconnection markets for new and existing customers looking for reliable, flexible and secure data center locations across the Frankfurt, Amsterdam, and London markets. Even with our rapid growth, sustainability remains at the core of how we offer data center capacity. Iron Mountain continues to source more than a 100% of its energy used for data centers from renewable energy.  Moreover, as we announced in April, we took a significant step forward in the development of enhanced solutions for purchasing renewable energy by entering into an agreement to track the hourly load. I'm proud to announce that this September, we were able to report on our performance for the first half of the year for our datacenters in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey that are benefiting from this agreement. Over the past several months, we have taken definitive steps towards a truly carbon-free energy supply.  Not just by offsetting our carbon footprint by purchasing and reselling renewables, but by matching renewable energy in the very grids in which we operate. We are the first company to join Google to adopt the 24/7 carbon-free energy goal, and we became a founding signatory to the new UN Clean Energy Compact being released at COP26 this week. We can already publish 24/7 carbon-free energy performance at 3 of our campuses, becoming the 1st large co-location data center provider with this capability. We recognize that we are an important component of our clients energy footprint and we will continue to take every opportunity to minimize our environmental impact on their behalf. The awards and successes I outlined today are just a few among the various wins Iron Mountain has achieved this quarter. As we continue to deliver accelerated growth at IRM, in spite of the continued impact of COVID on some of our traditional service areas, I am confident that our resilient business model expanded product portfolio, customer first culture, and strategic transformation will continue to deliver strong sales growth. With that, I will turn the call over to Barry. Good morning, Sheila. So I'll start with strategically in where the product portfolio is going and then let Barry comment a little bit more on the nuts and bolts in terms of margin. So thanks for the question. I think, first -- I think part of Project Summit, you've seen that show up in the record high EBITDA margin that we have this quarter, so thank you for the call out on that. And I think that that's an ongoing benefit that we'll have. That EBITDA margin may move up and down depending on the product mix and it comes to your product portfolio question. On the product portfolio, a part of Summit that you haven't seen directly, in other words it isn't in the margin, is we've also taken a lot of benefit of Project Summit and reinvested in the business.  So besides actually driving the margin improvement that we printed today, we've also reinvested in the business and that's really what's driven that total addressable market going from $10 billion to $80 billion that we've highlighted the last few quarters. And part of that $80 billion of new total addressable market is the almost 20% growth that we've seen in digital services, which is primarily our insight driven digital platform, together with IT Asset Disposal business.  Those are some of the new areas that I think you're highlighting behind your question. So we actually see -- that business is growing strong double-digits and we can see that continue. You take that on top of the growth and the continued acceleration in growth in our data center businesses so we're well on track to exceed our upgraded guidance last quarter of 30 megawatts of bookings for this year. Then I do -- we do expect to see -- continue with levels of revenue growth like we've seen the last few quarters. Because this growth that we've seen in the topline, whilst we have seen -- luckily, some recovery in terms of our traditional service business. I think it's fair to say that we've seen an acceleration in terms of our revenue growth that's really driven by the new product areas and less from what I would call a rebound from historically low activity due to COVID. I don't know, Barry if you want to comment a little bit around the margin? Yes. Thanks, George. If you look at the 20% growth that we called out this quarter, or just under 20% growth, that's all non Data Center. So that is the -- what we call ITAD or IT Asset Disposal business and we've won some recent large global contracts for that. Mainly for corporates that are trying to make sure that they both manage the secured destruction of any information that happens to be on their devices or hardware, as well as making sure that they can be managed in an environmentally friendly way. That's one part of it. And the other part of it is just the rapid growth that we've seen in adoption of our InSight platform and overall digitization of people's information.  So that's everything from people taking advantage to say, okay, when they're retrieving documents on a very simple basis, is we want to actually retrieve them electronically through the InSight platform where they can access those from a secure platform in the cloud, to Digital Mailroom, which is beyond the typical mail-room employee arbitrage model, but again allowing people to have not only access to the information that comes through their mail room, but to be able to operate in a hybrid work fashion. In other words, where people can work from home and the office and always have access to their information.  To even some, what I would call larger, more complex deals, I mean, I just returned from the Middle East about a month ago, where we're working with a government there and their National Archives to help them digitize everything about the way the government works. And that's again using the insight platform. But it's not just the insight platform, but auto classification of the documents to create metadata so that they can actually share the information digitally to the right people with the right security level in a way that can be managed for the long term. So it's multifaceted thing, but those are the areas that are really driving a lot of the top line growth that we see today. And as well as our data center business. I mean, obviously the data center business with the types of bookings that we have, will continue to drive increasing levels of growth. I should -- but I should not miss how it is, the underlying growth of the more traditional side of the business, mostly driven by pricing, continues to the chug along nicely. No. I think that's -- covers that. Thanks, Eric. I appreciate the question. So 2 or 3 points that I'll cover in your question. I think the first bit is that, I would say that for 2022 in terms of supply chain, we're pretty well covered just because of the lead time. But to your point is, we have seen I would say 10 to 12 weeks increase in supply chain or lead time on some of the MEP and related equipment, and even in Including steel in some markets. I think to your point is, we are seeing a lengthening of the supply chain, but I would say for 2022, we're well covered because that's already been in training committed contracts to actually do that build-out.  And we're -- now we're already looking at 2023 and we're factoring in that extended lead time for some of that equipment in our planning. So the good news -- the bad news is that the lead times have increased. The good news is that we're well covered for 2022, so we've got the time to make sure we incorporate that in our planning for 2023. So that's -- I would say one aspect. And in terms of the increase in the prices -- so we're pretty well hedged for the 2022 commitments that we have because those are contracts that we've already lead. So we are seeing an increase in inflation in some of those raw materials. That being said because this is a business where the cost of construction is well known and quite transparent to our customer base, is we see trends and we expect that to continue. Our pricing will go in line with the cost of build. So I think we're kind of naturally hedged given the transparency of these businesses. In terms of the power cost is that the -- again, we're pretty well covered for this year, but we have seen an uptick in pricing in pretty much all the markets as you -- as everyone's noticed. And I would say that -- first part is, I would say about 60% of our portfolio in 2022 will be pretty much straight power pass-through, so we don't have any exposure in terms of the power costs. The remainder, most of that is still on long-term -- we've contracted for the power long-term. So think of our business has north of 70% naturally hedged, and the part that isn't is is up for renewal during the course of 2022, or a big part of it is. So we don't really see power affecting us in any material way. And in fact, we see continued upward progression in terms of our EBITDA margins as we get into 2022. But thanks for the question."

            "name": "Barry Hytinen",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill. And thank you for joining us. The third quarter exceeded our expectations across each of our key financial metrics. Continuing the trend, we have seen over the last few quarters, revenue continued to strengthen with a strong recovery in service revenue, reflecting accelerating rates of growth driven by the new service offerings Bill discussed. Our core physical storage business performed well, and we are seeing continued strength in our growth areas. Turning to our results for the quarter. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.13 billion grew 9%. Total organic revenue increased 7.4% year-over-year.  As an example of the momentum we are building on a 2-year basis, our organic revenue growth continued to accelerate in the quarter. Organic service revenue increased $61 million or 18%. Our team drove strong growth in both Global Digital Solutions business and Secure IT Asset Disposition. Total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.3% with continued benefit from pricing and positive trends in volume. Adjusted EBITDA was $418 million an increase of $42 million from last year. We exceeded the projections we shared on our last call as the team drove improved margin performance, despite the stronger U.S. dollar. AFFO $263 million or $0.90 on a per-share basis, up 47 million dollars and $0.15 respectively from the third quarter of last year. Turning to segment performance.  In the third quarter, our global RIM business delivered revenue of $996 million, an increase of 74 million from last year. On an organic basis, revenue increased 6% The team performed well with constant currency storage rental revenue growth of 2.7% or 1.8% on an organic basis. This performance reflects an acceleration in growth as compared to the last few quarters. Growth was driven by pricing and volume. With positive volume trends in the Mid East deal that Bill mentioned, total physical volume achieved a new all-time record of 744 million cubic feet. We are pleased with the underlying trends, and continue to expect total volume on an organic basis to be flat to modestly up for the full year.  Our traditional services business continue to recover from the pandemic with revenue growing 14% year-over-year, all be at still down 4% from the levels achieved in 2019 reflecting the continued COVID impact. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $443 million, an increase of $49 million year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 180 basis points year-over-year as a result of strong operating leverage and improved service margins. Turning to our global datacenter business, our team booked 9 megawatts in the quarter. And through the end of the third quarter, we have booked at 22 megawatts.  With our strong and building pipeline and the additional contracts we've already signed this quarter, we are confident in our ability to exceed our full-year guidance of 30 megawatts. In terms of revenue as we projected, growth accelerated sharply to 22% year-over-year. In light of our strong performance year-to-date and prior-year bookings, we now expect full-year revenue growth of at least mid-teens percent, exceeding our prior projections. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 40% was consistent with the expectations we shared on our last call and driven by Buildout services at our Frankfurt facility. Turning to Project Summit, this quarter, the team delivered $38 million of the incremental year-on-year adjusted EBITDA benefit. We continue to expect year-on-year benefits from summit of $160 million with another $50 million of year-on-year benefit in 2022. Total capital expenditures were $138 million of which $100 million was growth, and $38 million was recurring. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.4 times slightly better than our projection. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term leverage range of 4 and 1/2 to 5 and 1/2 times. For 2021, we expect to exit the year at levels at or below the third quarter.  From a cash cycle perspective, I would like to highlight that our team drove a two-day improvement from last year and specifically call out that our Days Sales Outstanding are at the best level they've been at in several years. With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early January. Turning to our outlook. With the ongoing pandemic and where we are in the year, I feel it will be helpful to provide our view explicitly for this quarter. We expect total revenue growth to be in the high single-digit percentage range year-over-year in the fourth quarter.  For EBITDA, we expect percentage growth to be in the range of low double-digit to low teens year-over-year in the fourth quarter. We expect year over year AFFO growth in excess of 30% in the fourth quarter. As you may remember, last year we had an elevated level of maintenance capex in the fourth quarter as we caught up from pandemic-driven delays. On a more normalized level of capex spend last year, this implies at least 20% growth in AFFO in the fourth quarter of 2021. In summary, our team is executing well, our pipeline is growing, and momentum continues to build across our business. Our addressable market continues to expand and we feel confident in our ability to drive growth. We feel well-positioned and look forward to updating you on our progress following the fourth quarter. And with that, Operator, please open the line for Q&A. Hi, Sheila. Good morning and thanks for the question. I would say when we look outlook and you look at where our margin has been recently, where it's going to continue to go, We have very favorable trends in pricing. I think that you will continue to see at least the level of pricing activity going forward as we've seen here over the last year or so. There's some macro trends there that are both positive for us I think on a pricing benefit. If you look at our data center business of the margin, as we talked about has on a transitory basis been a little bit lower than where we expect it to go over time.  That business is obviously dealing with some fit-out on our Frankfurt facility, which is transitory here in the third and the fourth quarter. And as we move forward, we see that margin expanding. So that's obviously a very nice secular tailwind to the business. And then I would say when you look at ongoing productivity, we continue to see that. So while Summit has been incredibly beneficial to the business and we'll have more Summit benefit year-on-year next year, we certainly see the opportunity for additional productivity. The only other thing I'll say is, as you know, since you follow the company well, we've had couple of relatively large sale leaseback transactions over the last 12 months. And while I expect to continue to do a relative amount of capital recycling, that's been a big headwind on a year-over-year basis. So if that comes down to a more -- a little more normalized level going forward, that's also a benefit. Hi Shlomo, it's Barry, thanks for the question. I will try to unpack that for you. So you are right. We did close on the transaction in the Mid East, which we think is a great platform for us to continue to grow in that region together with our existing business. Now I will note that that closed very late in the quarter in the second half of September so really had almost no benefit to the quarter in terms of the financials, albeit it is in our cube as you note. So that didn't really help the sequential. On the pricing, you might recall that the beginning of the year and then again on the quarter call, I mentioned that all of the pricing we had planned for was already set as of March or April.  And so the sequential benefit on pricing was not much and we weren't planning for it. And then the other thing I'll call out, as you think about storage sequentially is we did divest the software escrow business in June, second -- first part of June last quarter. And so the sequential move from the second to the third on storage, that was completely storage business. So it's about $6 or $7 million of sequential decline due to that being in the second quarter, but not in the third quarter. So all in, we feel quite good. In fact, I'll be -- I'll tell you that the storage revenue performed better than we were planning on a sequential basis. And as it relates to the point about pent-up demand, you'll recall last quarter we did note that -- and that was in some of the economies, particularly in Asia and I'd say with the -- some of the COVID and Delta variant and various other elements that occurred in some of those markets, we continue to have a pretty good-sized backlog. Bill, anything you want to add? Hi, Alex. It's Barry. Thanks for the question. Why don't I help you with both the revenue and the EBITDA the way we are thinking about it. So in the fourth quarter, you right, we said about high single-digit. So let's say that's 8% or 9% on the revenue side just to give you a couple of the puts and takes. We have a -- the dollar is stronger as we have less than a point of FX benefit year-on-year, and a similar amount from M&A less than a point because just as a reminder, as I mentioned to Shlomo, we divested that software Escrow business in the second quarter. And so as a result, it's not much M&A benefit. So that leaves you with about call it 7% of organic constant currency growth.  And with the strength of the Data Center business, that'll contribute probably 1.5 points alone because that business is performing very well and so you should be working with your model and think like 20 plus percent growth in the fourth quarter from our Data Center business. The balance would be coming from low-single-digit growth in our storage rental revenue. And that'll be with good pricing contribution. Course the remainder is as Bill 's highlighted on the call, the very nice growth we're seeing out of our Digital Solutions and SITAD business. On the EBITDA stand side, we're looking at low double-digit to low -- sorry, mid-teens growth. So let's say that's 13 or so percent just to keep the midpoint there. For the purpose of this discussion, that's about, call it, $48 million of year-on-year increase. FX is a very small contribution, almost nothing, and M&A would be actually a net negative on a year-over-year basis in light of the escrow business was a very high-margin. And so think about data center as having a modest increase in margin sequentially still affected by the fit-out in Frankfurt. So a few million of benefit to EBITDA from data center.  Our Summit is -- our Summit Project is doing phenomenally well and the team is executing very well. You'll probably see $30+ million of year-on-year benefit in the quarter from that. And then of course, pricing will continue to be a very strong contributor. And the services margin, I expect to continue to improve which you've been seeing throughout the year. So naturally, there are some offsets with sale leaseback, as I mentioned earlier, and higher levels of commission in light of the very good trajectory the team is driving on top line. So we're feeling very good about the fourth quarter as we sit here today, and look forward to talking to you about it in 90 days. Thank you. Have a great day."

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Greer Aviv, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nGreer Aviv: Thank you, Debbie. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. On today\u2019s call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and CEO; and Barry Hytinen, our EVP and CFO. Today, we plan to share a number of key messages to help you better understand our performance, including our Q2 outperformance, the increased momentum in the business, our updated outlook for 2021 financial guidance, the continued growth in our data center business and the strong performance in our growth areas. After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open up the lines for Q&A. Today\u2019s earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today\u2019s earnings materials, the Safe Harbor language on Slide 2, and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliation to these measures in our supplemental financial information. With that, I will turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Meaney: Thank you, Greer, and thank you all for taking time to join us. I hope you and your families are safe and well. This morning we reported record second quarter financial results with revenue of more than $1.1 billion and EBITDA of $406 million. This strong performance in both Q2 in the first half of the year reflects the breadth and depth of our products and solutions and the strength of our deep customer relationships. Our second quarter results especially reflect increased demand for our services across our key markets in is based upon these strong results in the increased momentum in the business that has caused us to increase the midpoint of our financial guidance as well has increased the expected bookings in our data center business. As we celebrate and honor Iron Mountain\u2019s 70th anniversary this month, I am extremely proud of what our team has accomplished in growing our relationships with our large and diverse customer base in spite of the continued challenges due to COVID. Our Mountaineers across the globe have conquered every obstacle with tenacity, and an innovative mindset all with a focus on accelerating growth and services to assist our customers. Before we dive into our record results and the positive momentum in our business, I want to take a moment to reflect on the current situation with the pandemic in new variants, still wrecking havoc in many parts of the world. In addition to operational complexities, we\u2019re also dealing with the realities of a workplace and the world changed forever by the COVID-19 pandemic. At Iron Mountain, we\u2019re thinking how we can move forward instead of getting back to normal. All whilst remaining diligent to ensure the physical and mental health as well as the overall safety of our teams, their families, and our customers. As I mentioned earlier, this year we celebrate 70 years of Iron Mountain. It\u2019s a legacy with a rich inspired past, which continues inspiring the future. Since that day on August 24, 1951, we have built, evolved and expanded our trusted relationship with our customers to include not just the leading storage platform of physical assets, but now includes a rapidly increasing range of business services. These new services are centered around data center co-location, information security, data, insights, IT asset disposition in business process management. And today, with this broadened portfolio of services and storage capabilities, we have become an innovative and global leader in our field with more than 225,000 customers including more than 95% of the Fortune 1000, a global footprint of more than 1,450 facilities with a presence in 58 countries and 24,000 dedicated Mountaineers across the globe. And doing all this within an energy sustainable way, with a 100% of our data centers powered by renewable energy. Many of the things about us have changed in 70 years. What hasn\u2019t changed is our core values and commitment to building and delivering on the trust our customers have come to count on. Over the last two quarters we shared with you that we now have an expanded total addressable market or TAM of more than $80 billion. And against that expanded TAM, we\u2019ve identified the building blocks for growth that will enable future growth and success. And in fact, you can already see evidence of this expansion through our year-on-year digital service revenue growth together with secure IT Asset Disposition or ITAD. In this quarter versus a year ago, these business lines have grown over 37% resulting in $25 million of incremental growth. I want to highlight a few examples, which illustrate our progress in helping our customers through utilizing new technologically enabled approaches and products to not only protect, but unlocked value from what matters most to them. The first one I want to highlight is in Singapore with a multinational banking and financial services corporation. We won a $750,000 annual recurring revenue, digital mailroom contract over their current service provider. At first, the bank didn\u2019t believe that Iron Mountain could solve this need for them as they had only known us for support \u2013 to support their storage and scanning requirements. However, the account came pursued the opportunity and highlighted Iron Mountain strengths utilizing a new technologically based approach, which allows us to assist in managing the very start of much of the information entering the bank while securely facilitating a hybrid office and home working model. As we are already this customers partner for business process outsourcing and processing much of the bank\u2019s critical information. The mail room is a key additional service, which will yield further security and simplicity for the bank. Turning to another area representing part of our expanded TAM, I want to touch briefly on secure ITAD. Think of this as an area where we apply our highly secure chain of custody with a service that allows our customers to dispose securely in an environmentally responsible way their IT assets, which are at end of life. We have continued to see good momentum in our secure ITAD solution following a number of big wins last quarter. We won a deal with one of the world\u2019s largest banks to recycle corporate laptops, monitors and outdated IT equipment across over 400 corporate offices, 4,000 conference rooms and 5,000 retail offices, which we expect to generate annual run rate revenues greater than $5 million. This is a valuable offering given our expertise in chain of custody and compliance, helping customers securely dispose of their IT equipment. Turning to our data center business. We want to share not only our continued growth in top and bottom line, but some recent exciting developments in the last month, which has led us to increase our guidance for expected 2021 leasing from 25 to 30 megawatts to over 30 megawatts, not including additional leasing expected from the recent acquisitions in Frankfurt and India. Our increased guidance around leasing activities and based upon the momentum have seen in the business in the first half of the year, as well as the pipeline. Today, we announced not only the 3.6 megawatts of new leases, we signed in the second quarter, but also a 6 megawatt lease with a new logo to our platform that was signed post Q2 in Northern Virginia. Taken together along with our strong results in Q1, we have recorded a total of 19 megawatts of new and expansion leases in the first seven months of the year. This is a great launching off point for the remainder of the year. And we feel confident we will achieve leasing activity above the top end of our original guidance. Turning back to Q2. It should be noted of the 3.6 megawatts we leased in the quarter and majority was in the retail and enterprise segments. This result in an attractive pricing for the quarter, which increased 14% sequentially. Our strongest markets in terms of new and expansion leasing were Phoenix, Singapore and Northern Virginia. Finally, in terms of development, you likely saw from our recent press releases our data center business is expanding rapidly in Europe. We have a new 27 megawatt Greenfield build in London, adjacent to our existing London one facility, as well as the pending acquisition of a multitenant co-location data center in Frankfurt. Taken together, this will increase our total potential capacity in Europe to more than 88 megawatts. And we\u2019ll provide access to important interconnection markets for new and existing customers looking for a reliable, flexible and secure data center location. As always sustainability continues to be a top priority. And as part of our commitments, we will power our new buildings in London and Frankfurt with a 100% renewable energy. Before I hand the call over, I also wish to touch upon some new product areas, which are leading to more growth in our traditional storage areas. One of these newer product offerings is clean start, which is a service that helps customers navigate today\u2019s changing workplace requirements from reconfiguring the office the social distancing to office closures, or moving to a more digital way of working. Since inception the clean start product has generated over $19 million in revenue and has uncovered $1.1 million net new cube over a three-year period. In 2020, we decided to expand clean start globally with all regions engaged and growing the program. Since taking the business globally, we have seen an acceleration in bookings specifically in the first half of 2021, clean start has delivered $5 million of new revenue or some 25% of the total revenue from this program since its inception three years ago. A specific customer example in this quarter includes a $1.8 million deal with a leading global hotel chain over the next five years. Due to challenges from the pandemic, the customer needed solutions to help with compliance and storage of materials. This customer has been with Iron Mountain for years at an individual hotel level and its corporate team saw the value in our scale, breadth of offerings, compliance expertise and risk reduction solutions. This prompted the decision to deploy our services across 103 hotels plus an additional 15 one-off sites as required. We were able to manage much more than just the record storage, also meeting the destruction needs and providing Image on Demand services, all of this being done company-wide at a scale unmatched by any other provider. Another example, which showcases our innovative new products, which drive records volume and services growth is Smart Sort. Our customers want to reduce costs and risks by defensively destroying records as they meet retention requirements, which is difficult to do if records are not stored by the destruction eligibility date. For example, many healthcare accounts store records by patient number or last date of visit and not by retention requirement. With Smart Sort, we organize the records by destruction date, so the customer knows what they can destroy and when. Our team understood a pervasive customer problem took a customer centric approach and proactively came up with a solution to solve it with Smart Sort. Just in the last year, we\u2019ve had 10 healthcare vertical wins for Smart Sort with our most recent win with Johns Hopkins Medical Center. The agreement is a five-year term, which includes a $1.2 million Smart Sort move project, bringing in additional 160,000 cubic feet of inventory, representing over 4 million individual patient records. Reflecting some of these successes, total global volume grew to a record 733 million cubic feet this quarter. In spite of organic volume being down 10 basis points in the second quarter versus the first quarter, total global organic volume was up 1.6 million cubic feet in the first half of the year. And we continue to expect organic volume to be flat to slightly up for the full year. This expected organic volume together with continued strong price increases sets us up well for continued strength in organic storage revenue growth from our physical business areas. In closing, I want to say thank you to the 24,000 Mountaineers, who have done an outstanding job navigating through the pandemic. I\u2019m extremely proud of their relentless dedication to each other and our customers. With a resilient business model, ongoing market share growth and strategic investments to transform the company, we are excited about the significant opportunities ahead of us, which continued to exceed even our ambitious targets. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Barry.\nBarry Hytinen: Thanks, Bill, and thank you for joining us. The second quarter exceeded our expectations across each of our key financial metrics. Continuing the trend we have seen over the last few quarters, revenue continued to strengthen with a strong recovery in service revenue and activity levels. Our core physical storage business performed well and we are seeing great progress in our growth areas. Reflecting that progress and the outperformance in the first half, we increased the midpoint of our financial guidance. Turning to our results for the quarter. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.1, billion grew 14%, total organic revenue increased 10%. Organic service revenue increased $81 million or 26% and was ahead of our expectations. Our team drove strong growth in both our Global Digital Solutions business and Secure IT Asset Disposition. Total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.5% with continued benefit from pricing together with positive trends in volume. Adjusted EBITDA was $406 million. We exceeded the projections we shared on our last call as the team delivered better than expected Project Summit savings together with the revenue beat. AFFO was $246 million or $0.85 on a per share basis. If you recall, last year\u2019s the AFFO benefited from a $23 million tax refund, adjusting for this AFFO would have increased 8% year-over-year. As we mentioned on our prior earnings call, AFFO also reflects an increase in recurring CapEx as we catch up on some projects that were deferred during the pandemic. Our full year recurring CapEx guidance is unchanged. Turning to segment performance. In the second quarter, our global RIM business delivered revenue of $993 million, an increase of $116 million from last year. On an organic basis, revenue increased 9.1%. The team performed well with constant currency storage rental revenue growth of 1.9% or 1.6% on an organic basis. Growth was driven primarily by pricing and volume. We added about 4.5 million cubic feet from our acquisition in Indonesia, which closed during the quarter. Our traditional services business continued to recover from the pandemic with revenue growing 24% year-over-year and 4% from the first quarter. Our Global Digital Solutions business continued to display strong momentum, growing 24% year-over-year. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $430 million, an increase of $47 million year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin declined 50 basis points year-over-year as a result of mix given the strong service revenue growth. Sequentially, EBITDA margin increased 110 basis points due to Project Summit benefits and the contribution from pricing. Turning to our Global Data Center business, where the team continues to perform exceptionally well. We booked at 3.6 megawatts in the quarter and through the first half, we have booked at 12.6 megawatts. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we signed a 6 megawatt lease in Northern Virginia. Based on the year-to-date performance and the strength of our pipeline, we increased our full year leasing target to more than 30 megawatts, which would represent a 23% increase in bookings. In terms of revenue, as we projected growth accelerated sharply to 15% year-over-year. We continue to plan for full year revenue growth in the range of low double digits to approaching mid-teens. The combination of our strong prior year bookings and the team\u2019s leasing performance year-to-date provides high visibility. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 43.4% increased 60 basis points from the first quarter and was ahead of our expectations. As compared to our prior outlook, the improvement was driven primarily by timing related to the Frankfurt build-out we discussed last quarter, which has been modestly delayed. As a result, we now expect more of the work associated with that project to occur in the second half, which will result in a temporary impact on segment margins on the order of three points relative to the second quarter level. Turning to Project Summit. This quarter, the team delivered $42 million of incremental year-on-year adjusted EBITDA benefit. With the strength of the team\u2019s performance year-to-date, we now expect year-on-year benefits from Summit to approach $160 million with another $50 million of year-on-year benefit in 2022. Total capital expenditures were $136 million, with $100 million was growth and $36 million was recurring. Turning to capital recycling. As we have said before, we view the market for industrial assets as highly attractive, as a means to supplement our growth capital. With that backdrop in the second quarter, we upsized our recycling program and generated approximately $203 million of proceeds. Year-to-date, we have generated $215 million in proceeds compared to our previous guidance of $125 million. With our strong data center development pipeline, we are now expecting to generate full year proceeds of approximately $250 million. Turning to the balance sheet. At quarter end, we had approximately $2.1 billion of liquidity. We ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.3 times slightly better than our projection and down from both last year and last quarter. This marks our lowest leverage level since year-end 2017. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term leverage range of 4.5 to 5.5 times. For 2021, we expect to end the year within our target range and estimate we will exit the year at levels similar to the second quarter. With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early October. Turning to our outlook. Today, we are pleased to increase the midpoint of our 2021 financial guidance. There are three factors driving the improved projections. First, operational performance in the second quarter was better than expected and we have good momentum in our key growth areas. Second, we have identified additional benefits from Project Summit, primarily related to opportunities that our commercial team has been able to uncover. And third, we have acquired a small records management business in Morocco that will add about $5 million in revenue. Conversely, as compared to our prior guidance, there are two headwinds I would call out. First, we divested our Intellectual Property Management business in early June. Compared to our prior guidance, this represents a reduction of approximately $20 million of revenue and $15 million of EBITDA. Second, since May, the stronger U.S. dollar is more of a headwind by nearly $20 million for revenue and $7 million for EBITDA. For the full year 2021, we now expect revenue of $4.415 billion to $4.515 billion. We now expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.6 billion to $1.635 billion. At the midpoint, this guidance represents growth of 8% and EBITDA growth of 10%. We now expect AFFO to be in the range of $970 million to $1.05 billion and AFFO per share of $3.33 to $3.45. At the midpoint, this represents 11% and 10% growth respectively. Our guidance assumes global organic physical volume will be flat to slightly positive versus last year and with continued benefits and pricing, we anticipate low single digit growth in total organic storage revenue. For services, we expect to maintain positive revenue growth through remainder of the year. With the ongoing pandemic, we believe it is helpful to share our short-term expectations. For the third quarter, we expect revenue and EBITDA to both increase approximately $10 million sequentially from the second quarter levels. We expect AFFO to be slightly in excess of $250 million in the third quarter. In summary, our team is executing well. We have seen positive trends in the macro environment and our pipeline continues to build. The momentum we had entering the year has strengthened, our addressable market continues to expand and we feel confident in our ability to drive growth. We feel well positioned and look forward to updating you on our progress following the third quarter. And with that operator, please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nSheila McGrath: Yes, good morning. The services rebound was very strong in the quarter, and I understand it\u2019s based on some new products, which you called out. Just wondering if there\u2019s more leverage as people returned to the office in some of your services businesses that have been held back from the pandemic or people working from a home. Is there more leverage for those businesses to increase as people return to office?\nBill Meaney: Good morning, Sheila. Thanks for the question. So first, I appreciate the call out it. We\u2019re really pleased with the organic service revenue approaching 26% in this quarter, which we thought was just a very strong result. And as you pointed out, that was really driven by a lot of our new digital solutions, which was well north of 30% growth if you take ITAD and digital services combined. I think your question on the traditional service side is a good one, because what we\u2019ve seen actually is an increase in the backlog of incoming cube, which quite frankly, we haven\u2019t been able to get at in some countries because of continued rolling lockdowns or intermittent lockdowns. So we do expect has some of the lockdowns get ease that on the traditional service lines that \u2013 we know that there\u2019s a backlog of incoming cube that we haven\u2019t been able to access the offices for. So I think there will be some in the medium term in that area, how big it\u2019s hard to judge right now.\nOperator: The next question is from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My question is on Project Summit, you mentioned that you\u2019re realizing additional benefits from Project Summit. That\u2019s causing you to raise your guidance and you talked about expectations of $160 million savings with another $50 million next year. So how much of the upside in savings represent the pull forward from future periods? Or would you say, this is like an increase in total savings from Project Summit. And can you just sort of map out the entire timeline of when you would expect to realize the full amount of project savings over the next couple of years. Maybe related to that the Project Summit savings, how does your increased investment into growth initiatives impact the flow-through of Project Summit savings in terms of margin expansion opportunity. Thank you.\nBarry Hytinen: Okay. Hi, George, it\u2019s Barry. Thanks for the questions. So we feel really good about the way the team is progressing with respect to Project Summit. The full program we anticipate generating $375 million of benefit. You\u2019ll recall that last year, we generate about $165 million of benefit. And year-to-date, together with last year, so program to-date, we\u2019re at about $257 million of benefit. We will end the year with all of the run rate savings in the numbers. So we expect to be exiting the year at the full program benefit that leaves about $50 million of year-on-year benefit next year. And so you should be penciling something about $70 million of incremental year-on-year benefit in the back half, probably split pretty equally this year with that $50 million remaining. So we feel great about the way the program is progressing. The team is executing well. You asked about investments. What you will see is we certainly did as part of Summit, invest in certain areas like our commercial organization, innovation, our global strategic accounts organization, and you would see that in our SG&A expenses this year, if you look at our SG&A year-on-year, it\u2019s up excluding stock compensation expenses of about $16 million and actually more than all of that is in the commercial organization supporting growth. And so we \u2013 both in the form of increasing that organization, as well as some variable costs that go along with the great sales performance year-on-year, like, variable compensation expense. So you are seeing those expenses in the numbers already, and we expect that you will continue to see very good performance out of the team on Summit. Thanks.\nBill Meaney: Yes. And the other thing I would just add to it, Barry, I think, Barry\u2019s last point as important as the $375 million is a net number. So obviously we\u2019re making a lot of investments to transform the business, but the $375 million is net of all the investments we\u2019re making.\nOperator: The next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, great. Thank you very much for taking my question. I just still focus a little more on the services business, obviously that seems to be doing a lot better you have new products and things coming to market. And I was just wondering, is there some impact on the margin from the mix of the newer products? It just seems like the gross margin was down sequentially, despite higher revenue, is they had kind of a ramp thing that\u2019s going on. Maybe you could just give us a little bit more color on how that\u2019s going through.\nBarry Hytinen: Sure. Hey, Shlomo. It\u2019s Barry. Thanks for the question. We feel really good about the way the team\u2019s performing in our services organization, as you know the revenue is up considerable amount both year-on-year and sequentially. While the gross margin is a tick down, call it, 40 basis points, I\u2019ll note that, that is driven by the fact that revenue in that line outstripped our projections. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks and if you look at versus our projections last quarter \u2013 for the quarter, we beat revenue by about $25 million round numbers, the vast majority of that was in services. So we certainly did to maintain customer service and we did have some level of, what I would consider like, surge expenses related to servicing that uptick in demand. And then I think you should expect that that will even out as we move forward. The decline in gross margin is about $1 million. So it\u2019s not a tremendous amount. We feel good about the margins we\u2019re generating off the new product offerings to Bill\u2019s point on our Global Digital Solutions and our Secure IT Asset Disposition. Those are very nice margins. The other thing I\u2019ll note is, our \u2013 if you work through the numbers in our services area on EBITDA, the EBITDA margin in that business was actually up 100 basis points sequentially, and that was up 640 basis point year-on-year. So we feel good about the way our services are performing. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: The next question is from Nate Crossett with Berenberg. Please go ahead.\nNate Crossett: Hey, good morning. A couple of data center questions, if I may. There\u2019s over $6 million of leasing per megawatt that you did in July. Was that single hyperscale lead, maybe give some detail on that? And then also, if you could talk about your outlook for pricing for the data center business, more specifically on renewals and mark-to-market over the next few years, because I think there\u2019s been some crosscurrents in this space and your data center peers have said different things, when it comes to that. So I\u2019m curious to hear, what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the outlook for renewal pricing.\nBill Meaney: Good morning, Nate. I appreciate the question. So first on the 6 megawatts, yes, we really pleased to say, it\u2019s a single customer for our Northern Virginia campus hyperscale and it\u2019s a new logo to us. So on \u2013 just a number of fronts, it\u2019s just a great \u2013 it\u2019s a great customer win. And as you can see, our \u2013 we keep expanding capacity in our Northern Virginia campus based on the pipeline that we see even beyond that. So really congratulations to the team. I think in terms of the pricing, you\u2019ve noticed this month, we were up slightly. So we thought that was actually a good trend. I think generally what we\u2019re blessed being in that sense, relatively newcomer to the data center space that we don\u2019t have as many historical customers that were originally sold in at higher than what today market prices are. So most of our customers, because we\u2019ve been growing very quickly over the last few years are relatively new customers that are at, what I would call, new and \u2013 the new pricing level. So we don\u2019t have as much pressure as some of our older peers that have had that. With the exception, we\u2019ve called out in the last few quarters from time to time, when we did acquisitions, we knew we were acquiring some customers that had been with our acquired companies for a long time and that those were rolling off. So generally, we feel pretty good where we are on pricing. You notice that this quarter, we were on the 3.6 megawatts we were up quarter-on-quarter on pricing. And that was really more about mix that we were highly focused on collocation or retail and enterprise customers, which obviously come at higher pricing. So generally, we don\u2019t see a big change in the pricing on customers that we\u2019ve acquired or brought into facilities that we\u2019ve acquired.\nOperator: The next question is from Michael Funk from BoA. Please go ahead.\nMichael Funk: Yes, thank you for the questions. Just one of the refocus on the RIM business for a moment, you made a comment saying as a backlog of incoming cubes. I\u2019d love to get more thoughts there on, how that might impact volume moving forward. But then also took out the last quarter, would love any kind of commentary just on the volume trends you\u2019re seeing, whether that\u2019s the growth additions, the churn, and then how acquisitions also impacted the volume in the quarter.\nBill Meaney: Thanks. Thanks for the question. Good morning. I think that couple things, I would say. First of all, if we look at on the Records Management business, we see a very \u2013 if you look at quarter-on-quarter over the last, say four or five quarters, we see kind of pretty much the same kind of trends that bumps up and down. So we don\u2019t see a big change in terms of the net volume trends in that part of the business. I do think that, because of the shutdowns that I referred to earlier in a number of our countries, we have seen a significant increase in backlog, waiting for people to be able to get back to office to allow us access to bring that in, so that\u2019s positive. But if you just look overall in terms of our total physical storage business, we\u2019re really pleased with how that\u2019s coming out. Because if you look across the portfolio of our physical storage businesses, the first year \u2013 the first half of the year, where we\u2019re up organically in terms of volume, we expect the second half of the year in terms of our physical storage business to continue that trend. So overall, the year we say flat to slightly up, but, as I say, we\u2019re up slightly in the first half when we expect the second half to look the same. And then we add the normal price increase on top. So we feel really good in terms of where we\u2019re sitting on the general trends and the trends within each of those segments of our physical storage business seem to be relatively consistent. I think, it will be a short-term uptick once we can access some of the boxes that were \u2013 that have been ordered for us to pick up. But I think that\u2019s more to do with a one-off transition as we hopefully get out of COVID.\nOperator: Our next question comes from [indiscernible] Management. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for taking the question. One of my questions you\u2019ve already answered, but your company obviously has a larger workforce than a typical REIT. So I was wondering and you touched on some of the costs and how it\u2019s expected to even out over the balance of the year. But I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the ease or the lack thereof that you guys were able to source new employees, retain employees. And also to what degree, wages are moving up. And do you expect that to accelerate in the back half?\nBill Meaney: I appreciate the question. So maybe what we\u2019ll do is, I\u2019ll answer the first bit, in terms of the acquisition of employees, because it\u2019s a really good point. And then I\u2019ll let Barry comment on the inflation that we see across our business, not just on labor. I will just say, inflation for us generally is our friend, because we have such high 75% \u2013 70% to 75% gross margin business then, obviously, and we\u2019re able to price pretty aggressively against that. So it generally creates a tailwind towards our margins. On accessing talent, look, it is luckily \u2013 we\u2019re blessed with a very strong culture. So if you look at our employees and I\u2019m referring mainly to our frontline employees, who really are the heart and soul of the company, these are the people that you see our trucks out on the road or people see our folks coming into the facilities or the people that keep the lights on in our data centers. They are very long-term employees. Culture is very strong and we have very low churn, for a service company, probably one of the lowest churns in the industry. So we\u2019re blessed that we don\u2019t have a lot of outflow of employees. That being said, the growth that we\u2019re seeing in a number of our service areas, as well as our data center means that we are actively going out there and acquiring talent. And I\u2019ll be honest with you, it\u2019s tough at sometimes, but our biggest reference, our current core employee growth. So we haven\u2019t seen a situation where we haven\u2019t been able to grow with the demand except as a backlog I mentioned, because we just can\u2019t access facilities. And there has been some short-term blips that Barry called out in terms of we had to use some expedited labor in a couple of cases, so that we could meet the demand. But generally, we feel that our culture has been our friend in terms of being able to acquire the necessary talent.\nBarry Hytinen: Rob, it\u2019s Barry. Thanks for the recent pickup of coverage. We appreciate that. On your question is related to inflation, I\u2019ll say that, beginning of the year, I would say we were quite prudent with respect to our guidance on inflation, obviously, that\u2019s a topic that\u2019s very much in the popular culture right now. We \u2013 one of the reasons we can be confident in our guidance and increase the midpoint today is that, what we are seeing is not outside the realm of what we baked into our original guidance. And if you look at our cost of service label, for example, you actually see that we\u2019re generating productivity, they\u2019re both sequentially and year-on-year. And so we feel good about where we are and appreciate the interest. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nEric Luebchow: Thanks for the question. Wondering on the capital recycling front, so you guided to $250 million this year, and it seems like cap rates continue to be pretty attractive kind of the low 4% range. So if I recall, I think you have just north of $2 billion of industrial real estate in your portfolio. How much that over time do you think you could potentially sell them, given the attractive valuation environment? I mean, do you think you could do even more in the near-term than you had previously guided? Thanks.\nBarry Hytinen:\n$125 million and I\u2019m just increased it to $250 million: I think from a standpoint of going forward, you are thinking about it the right way. We\u2019ve got a large portfolio and we see the opportunity \u2013 opportunistically continue to recycle a \u2013 relatively small amount. Without giving forward guidance, we\u2019d historically said, you something on the order of a $100 million a year, maybe even $125 million a year as a planning posture. Obviously, our recycling efforts are back in circumstances we driven both based on what\u2019s out there in terms of cap rates, as well as what we need from a development pipeline. I will say that one of the benefits of our businesses in light of the growth in EBITDA and the cash generation of our core business, which is just tremendous. We see the opportunity to continue to fund our development, both from internal growth of EBITDA and cash generation, as well as this sort of modest recycling. So that\u2019s the way I would think about it. And I appreciate your interest.\nOperator: Next, we have a follow-up question from Shlomo Rosenbaum. Please go ahead.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, thank you very much for letting me back in here. One of the \u2013 just a question on understanding the volume \u2013 physical volume trends in aggregate. There\u2019s just over $5 million of volume from business acquisitions in the quarter and I was trying to \u2013 is that all in the wind business? And if I kind of assumed that, it looks like the room sequentially went down by $2.8 billion \u2013 $2.8 million. And I\u2019m just trying to understand the last quarter, we kind of leveled out a little bit and it seemed to come down a little bit more this quarter. And I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of, is there a stabilizing trend, a continued trend with a little bumps here and there. And just to basically try to understand that. And with the understanding that the other businesses seem to be outgrowing it in terms of the adjacent business and consumer other, but I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of that RIM side.\nBarry Hytinen: Hi, Shlomo, it\u2019s Barry. Thanks for the question. Let me clarify that of the $5 million, about $4.5 million is in the core. That\u2019s from the small deal we did in Asia, which is a $4.5 million acute. The rest is in the adjacent business category. And so when you work that through the model, you should find that the core was down just about 30 basis points, which to your point is \u2013 Bill\u2019s earlier comments, very consistent with what we\u2019ve been seeing even a little bit better than where we were, let\u2019s say, a year, year and a half ago, in terms of sequential performance. We continue to feel good about our core business and expected as we guided earlier to be flat to slightly down on an organic basis for the full year. And in light of the dynamics that Bill mentioned in terms of the backlog for incoming cube and likely for the pandemic to continue to ease over time. We expect that that performance will continue to bump along and maybe even slightly improved. So we feel really good about where we are there.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and the Iron Mountain\u2019s Second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect. Everyone else has left the call.",

            "name": "Bill Meaney",
            "content": "Thank you, Greer, and thank you all for taking time to join us. I hope you and your families are safe and well. This morning we reported record second quarter financial results with revenue of more than $1.1 billion and EBITDA of $406 million. This strong performance in both Q2 in the first half of the year reflects the breadth and depth of our products and solutions and the strength of our deep customer relationships. Our second quarter results especially reflect increased demand for our services across our key markets in is based upon these strong results in the increased momentum in the business that has caused us to increase the midpoint of our financial guidance as well has increased the expected bookings in our data center business. As we celebrate and honor Iron Mountain's 70th anniversary this month, I am extremely proud of what our team has accomplished in growing our relationships with our large and diverse customer base in spite of the continued challenges due to COVID. Our Mountaineers across the globe have conquered every obstacle with tenacity, and an innovative mindset all with a focus on accelerating growth and services to assist our customers. Before we dive into our record results and the positive momentum in our business, I want to take a moment to reflect on the current situation with the pandemic in new variants, still wrecking havoc in many parts of the world. In addition to operational complexities, we're also dealing with the realities of a workplace and the world changed forever by the COVID-19 pandemic. At Iron Mountain, we're thinking how we can move forward instead of getting back to normal. All whilst remaining diligent to ensure the physical and mental health as well as the overall safety of our teams, their families, and our customers. As I mentioned earlier, this year we celebrate 70 years of Iron Mountain. It's a legacy with a rich inspired past, which continues inspiring the future. Since that day on August 24, 1951, we have built, evolved and expanded our trusted relationship with our customers to include not just the leading storage platform of physical assets, but now includes a rapidly increasing range of business services. These new services are centered around data center co-location, information security, data, insights, IT asset disposition in business process management. And today, with this broadened portfolio of services and storage capabilities, we have become an innovative and global leader in our field with more than 225,000 customers including more than 95% of the Fortune 1000, a global footprint of more than 1,450 facilities with a presence in 58 countries and 24,000 dedicated Mountaineers across the globe. And doing all this within an energy sustainable way, with a 100% of our data centers powered by renewable energy. Many of the things about us have changed in 70 years. What hasn't changed is our core values and commitment to building and delivering on the trust our customers have come to count on. Over the last two quarters we shared with you that we now have an expanded total addressable market or TAM of more than $80 billion. And against that expanded TAM, we've identified the building blocks for growth that will enable future growth and success. And in fact, you can already see evidence of this expansion through our year-on-year digital service revenue growth together with secure IT Asset Disposition or ITAD. In this quarter versus a year ago, these business lines have grown over 37% resulting in $25 million of incremental growth. I want to highlight a few examples, which illustrate our progress in helping our customers through utilizing new technologically enabled approaches and products to not only protect, but unlocked value from what matters most to them. The first one I want to highlight is in Singapore with a multinational banking and financial services corporation. We won a $750,000 annual recurring revenue, digital mailroom contract over their current service provider. At first, the bank didn't believe that Iron Mountain could solve this need for them as they had only known us for support \u2013 to support their storage and scanning requirements. However, the account came pursued the opportunity and highlighted Iron Mountain strengths utilizing a new technologically based approach, which allows us to assist in managing the very start of much of the information entering the bank while securely facilitating a hybrid office and home working model. As we are already this customers partner for business process outsourcing and processing much of the bank's critical information. The mail room is a key additional service, which will yield further security and simplicity for the bank. Turning to another area representing part of our expanded TAM, I want to touch briefly on secure ITAD. Think of this as an area where we apply our highly secure chain of custody with a service that allows our customers to dispose securely in an environmentally responsible way their IT assets, which are at end of life. We have continued to see good momentum in our secure ITAD solution following a number of big wins last quarter. We won a deal with one of the world's largest banks to recycle corporate laptops, monitors and outdated IT equipment across over 400 corporate offices, 4,000 conference rooms and 5,000 retail offices, which we expect to generate annual run rate revenues greater than $5 million. This is a valuable offering given our expertise in chain of custody and compliance, helping customers securely dispose of their IT equipment. Turning to our data center business. We want to share not only our continued growth in top and bottom line, but some recent exciting developments in the last month, which has led us to increase our guidance for expected 2021 leasing from 25 to 30 megawatts to over 30 megawatts, not including additional leasing expected from the recent acquisitions in Frankfurt and India. Our increased guidance around leasing activities and based upon the momentum have seen in the business in the first half of the year, as well as the pipeline. Today, we announced not only the 3.6 megawatts of new leases, we signed in the second quarter, but also a 6 megawatt lease with a new logo to our platform that was signed post Q2 in Northern Virginia. Taken together along with our strong results in Q1, we have recorded a total of 19 megawatts of new and expansion leases in the first seven months of the year. This is a great launching off point for the remainder of the year. And we feel confident we will achieve leasing activity above the top end of our original guidance. Turning back to Q2. It should be noted of the 3.6 megawatts we leased in the quarter and majority was in the retail and enterprise segments. This result in an attractive pricing for the quarter, which increased 14% sequentially. Our strongest markets in terms of new and expansion leasing were Phoenix, Singapore and Northern Virginia. Finally, in terms of development, you likely saw from our recent press releases our data center business is expanding rapidly in Europe. We have a new 27 megawatt Greenfield build in London, adjacent to our existing London one facility, as well as the pending acquisition of a multitenant co-location data center in Frankfurt. Taken together, this will increase our total potential capacity in Europe to more than 88 megawatts. And we'll provide access to important interconnection markets for new and existing customers looking for a reliable, flexible and secure data center location. As always sustainability continues to be a top priority. And as part of our commitments, we will power our new buildings in London and Frankfurt with a 100% renewable energy. Before I hand the call over, I also wish to touch upon some new product areas, which are leading to more growth in our traditional storage areas. One of these newer product offerings is clean start, which is a service that helps customers navigate today's changing workplace requirements from reconfiguring the office the social distancing to office closures, or moving to a more digital way of working. Since inception the clean start product has generated over $19 million in revenue and has uncovered $1.1 million net new cube over a three-year period. In 2020, we decided to expand clean start globally with all regions engaged and growing the program. Since taking the business globally, we have seen an acceleration in bookings specifically in the first half of 2021, clean start has delivered $5 million of new revenue or some 25% of the total revenue from this program since its inception three years ago. A specific customer example in this quarter includes a $1.8 million deal with a leading global hotel chain over the next five years. Due to challenges from the pandemic, the customer needed solutions to help with compliance and storage of materials. This customer has been with Iron Mountain for years at an individual hotel level and its corporate team saw the value in our scale, breadth of offerings, compliance expertise and risk reduction solutions. This prompted the decision to deploy our services across 103 hotels plus an additional 15 one-off sites as required. We were able to manage much more than just the record storage, also meeting the destruction needs and providing Image on Demand services, all of this being done company-wide at a scale unmatched by any other provider. Another example, which showcases our innovative new products, which drive records volume and services growth is Smart Sort. Our customers want to reduce costs and risks by defensively destroying records as they meet retention requirements, which is difficult to do if records are not stored by the destruction eligibility date. For example, many healthcare accounts store records by patient number or last date of visit and not by retention requirement. With Smart Sort, we organize the records by destruction date, so the customer knows what they can destroy and when. Our team understood a pervasive customer problem took a customer centric approach and proactively came up with a solution to solve it with Smart Sort. Just in the last year, we've had 10 healthcare vertical wins for Smart Sort with our most recent win with Johns Hopkins Medical Center. The agreement is a five-year term, which includes a $1.2 million Smart Sort move project, bringing in additional 160,000 cubic feet of inventory, representing over 4 million individual patient records. Reflecting some of these successes, total global volume grew to a record 733 million cubic feet this quarter. In spite of organic volume being down 10 basis points in the second quarter versus the first quarter, total global organic volume was up 1.6 million cubic feet in the first half of the year. And we continue to expect organic volume to be flat to slightly up for the full year. This expected organic volume together with continued strong price increases sets us up well for continued strength in organic storage revenue growth from our physical business areas. In closing, I want to say thank you to the 24,000 Mountaineers, who have done an outstanding job navigating through the pandemic. I'm extremely proud of their relentless dedication to each other and our customers. With a resilient business model, ongoing market share growth and strategic investments to transform the company, we are excited about the significant opportunities ahead of us, which continued to exceed even our ambitious targets. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry. Good morning, Sheila. Thanks for the question. So first, I appreciate the call out it. We're really pleased with the organic service revenue approaching 26% in this quarter, which we thought was just a very strong result. And as you pointed out, that was really driven by a lot of our new digital solutions, which was well north of 30% growth if you take ITAD and digital services combined. I think your question on the traditional service side is a good one, because what we've seen actually is an increase in the backlog of incoming cube, which quite frankly, we haven't been able to get at in some countries because of continued rolling lockdowns or intermittent lockdowns. So we do expect has some of the lockdowns get ease that on the traditional service lines that \u2013 we know that there's a backlog of incoming cube that we haven't been able to access the offices for. So I think there will be some in the medium term in that area, how big it's hard to judge right now. Yes. And the other thing I would just add to it, Barry, I think, Barry's last point as important as the $375 million is a net number. So obviously we're making a lot of investments to transform the business, but the $375 million is net of all the investments we're making. Good morning, Nate. I appreciate the question. So first on the 6 megawatts, yes, we really pleased to say, it's a single customer for our Northern Virginia campus hyperscale and it's a new logo to us. So on \u2013 just a number of fronts, it's just a great \u2013 it's a great customer win. And as you can see, our \u2013 we keep expanding capacity in our Northern Virginia campus based on the pipeline that we see even beyond that. So really congratulations to the team. I think in terms of the pricing, you've noticed this month, we were up slightly. So we thought that was actually a good trend. I think generally what we're blessed being in that sense, relatively newcomer to the data center space that we don't have as many historical customers that were originally sold in at higher than what today market prices are. So most of our customers, because we've been growing very quickly over the last few years are relatively new customers that are at, what I would call, new and \u2013 the new pricing level. So we don't have as much pressure as some of our older peers that have had that. With the exception, we've called out in the last few quarters from time to time, when we did acquisitions, we knew we were acquiring some customers that had been with our acquired companies for a long time and that those were rolling off. So generally, we feel pretty good where we are on pricing. You notice that this quarter, we were on the 3.6 megawatts we were up quarter-on-quarter on pricing. And that was really more about mix that we were highly focused on collocation or retail and enterprise customers, which obviously come at higher pricing. So generally, we don't see a big change in the pricing on customers that we've acquired or brought into facilities that we've acquired. Thanks. Thanks for the question. Good morning. I think that couple things, I would say. First of all, if we look at on the Records Management business, we see a very \u2013 if you look at quarter-on-quarter over the last, say four or five quarters, we see kind of pretty much the same kind of trends that bumps up and down. So we don't see a big change in terms of the net volume trends in that part of the business. I do think that, because of the shutdowns that I referred to earlier in a number of our countries, we have seen a significant increase in backlog, waiting for people to be able to get back to office to allow us access to bring that in, so that's positive. But if you just look overall in terms of our total physical storage business, we're really pleased with how that's coming out. Because if you look across the portfolio of our physical storage businesses, the first year \u2013 the first half of the year, where we're up organically in terms of volume, we expect the second half of the year in terms of our physical storage business to continue that trend. So overall, the year we say flat to slightly up, but, as I say, we're up slightly in the first half when we expect the second half to look the same. And then we add the normal price increase on top. So we feel really good in terms of where we're sitting on the general trends and the trends within each of those segments of our physical storage business seem to be relatively consistent. I think, it will be a short-term uptick once we can access some of the boxes that were \u2013 that have been ordered for us to pick up. But I think that's more to do with a one-off transition as we hopefully get out of COVID. I appreciate the question. So maybe what we'll do is, I'll answer the first bit, in terms of the acquisition of employees, because it's a really good point. And then I'll let Barry comment on the inflation that we see across our business, not just on labor. I will just say, inflation for us generally is our friend, because we have such high 75% \u2013 70% to 75% gross margin business then, obviously, and we're able to price pretty aggressively against that.

            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and thank you for joining us. The second quarter exceeded our expectations across each of our key financial metrics. Continuing the trend we have seen over the last few quarters, revenue continued to strengthen with a strong recovery in service revenue and activity levels. Our core physical storage business performed well and we are seeing great progress in our growth areas. Reflecting that progress and the outperformance in the first half, we increased the midpoint of our financial guidance. Turning to our results for the quarter. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.1, billion grew 14%, total organic revenue increased 10%. Organic service revenue increased $81 million or 26% and was ahead of our expectations. Our team drove strong growth in both our Global Digital Solutions business and Secure IT Asset Disposition. Total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.5% with continued benefit from pricing together with positive trends in volume. Adjusted EBITDA was $406 million. We exceeded the projections we shared on our last call as the team delivered better than expected Project Summit savings together with the revenue beat. AFFO was $246 million or $0.85 on a per share basis. If you recall, last year's the AFFO benefited from a $23 million tax refund, adjusting for this AFFO would have increased 8% year-over-year. As we mentioned on our prior earnings call, AFFO also reflects an increase in recurring CapEx as we catch up on some projects that were deferred during the pandemic. Our full year recurring CapEx guidance is unchanged. Turning to segment performance. In the second quarter, our global RIM business delivered revenue of $993 million, an increase of $116 million from last year. On an organic basis, revenue increased 9.1%. The team performed well with constant currency storage rental revenue growth of 1.9% or 1.6% on an organic basis. Growth was driven primarily by pricing and volume. We added about 4.5 million cubic feet from our acquisition in Indonesia, which closed during the quarter. Our traditional services business continued to recover from the pandemic with revenue growing 24% year-over-year and 4% from the first quarter. Our Global Digital Solutions business continued to display strong momentum, growing 24% year-over-year. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $430 million, an increase of $47 million year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin declined 50 basis points year-over-year as a result of mix given the strong service revenue growth. Sequentially, EBITDA margin increased 110 basis points due to Project Summit benefits and the contribution from pricing. Turning to our Global Data Center business, where the team continues to perform exceptionally well. We booked at 3.6 megawatts in the quarter and through the first half, we have booked at 12.6 megawatts. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we signed a 6 megawatt lease in Northern Virginia. Based on the year-to-date performance and the strength of our pipeline, we increased our full year leasing target to more than 30 megawatts, which would represent a 23% increase in bookings. In terms of revenue, as we projected growth accelerated sharply to 15% year-over-year. We continue to plan for full year revenue growth in the range of low double digits to approaching mid-teens. The combination of our strong prior year bookings and the team's leasing performance year-to-date provides high visibility. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 43.4% increased 60 basis points from the first quarter and was ahead of our expectations. As compared to our prior outlook, the improvement was driven primarily by timing related to the Frankfurt build-out we discussed last quarter, which has been modestly delayed. As a result, we now expect more of the work associated with that project to occur in the second half, which will result in a temporary impact on segment margins on the order of three points relative to the second quarter level. Turning to Project Summit. This quarter, the team delivered $42 million of incremental year-on-year adjusted EBITDA benefit. With the strength of the team's performance year-to-date, we now expect year-on-year benefits from Summit to approach $160 million with another $50 million of year-on-year benefit in 2022. Total capital expenditures were $136 million, with $100 million was growth and $36 million was recurring. Turning to capital recycling. As we have said before, we view the market for industrial assets as highly attractive, as a means to supplement our growth capital. With that backdrop in the second quarter, we upsized our recycling program and generated approximately $203 million of proceeds. Year-to-date, we have generated $215 million in proceeds compared to our previous guidance of $125 million. With our strong data center development pipeline, we are now expecting to generate full year proceeds of approximately $250 million. Turning to the balance sheet. At quarter end, we had approximately $2.1 billion of liquidity. We ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.3 times slightly better than our projection and down from both last year and last quarter. This marks our lowest leverage level since year-end 2017. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term leverage range of 4.5 to 5.5 times. For 2021, we expect to end the year within our target range and estimate we will exit the year at levels similar to the second quarter. With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early October. Turning to our outlook. Today, we are pleased to increase the midpoint of our 2021 financial guidance. There are three factors driving the improved projections. First, operational performance in the second quarter was better than expected and we have good momentum in our key growth areas. Second, we have identified additional benefits from Project Summit, primarily related to opportunities that our commercial team has been able to uncover. And third, we have acquired a small records management business in Morocco that will add about $5 million in revenue. Conversely, as compared to our prior guidance, there are two headwinds I would call out. First, we divested our Intellectual Property Management business in early June. Compared to our prior guidance, this represents a reduction of approximately $20 million of revenue and $15 million of EBITDA. Second, since May, the stronger U.S. dollar is more of a headwind by nearly $20 million for revenue and $7 million for EBITDA. For the full year 2021, we now expect revenue of $4.415 billion to $4.515 billion. We now expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.6 billion to $1.635 billion. At the midpoint, this guidance represents growth of 8% and EBITDA growth of 10%. We now expect AFFO to be in the range of $970 million to $1.05 billion and AFFO per share of $3.33 to $3.45. At the midpoint, this represents 11% and 10% growth respectively. Our guidance assumes global organic physical volume will be flat to slightly positive versus last year and with continued benefits and pricing, we anticipate low single digit growth in total organic storage revenue. For services, we expect to maintain positive revenue growth through remainder of the year. With the ongoing pandemic, we believe it is helpful to share our short-term expectations. For the third quarter, we expect revenue and EBITDA to both increase approximately $10 million sequentially from the second quarter levels. We expect AFFO to be slightly in excess of $250 million in the third quarter. In summary, our team is executing well. We have seen positive trends in the macro environment and our pipeline continues to build. The momentum we had entering the year has strengthened, our addressable market continues to expand and we feel confident in our ability to drive growth. We feel well positioned and look forward to updating you on our progress following the third quarter. And with that operator, please open the line for Q&A. Okay. Hi, George, it's Barry. Thanks for the questions. So we feel really good about the way the team is progressing with respect to Project Summit. The full program we anticipate generating $375 million of benefit. You'll recall that last year, we generate about $165 million of benefit. And year-to-date, together with last year, so program to-date, we're at about $257 million of benefit. We will end the year with all of the run rate savings in the numbers. So we expect to be exiting the year at the full program benefit that leaves about $50 million of year-on-year benefit next year. And so you should be penciling something about $70 million of incremental year-on-year benefit in the back half, probably split pretty equally this year with that $50 million remaining. So we feel great about the way the program is progressing. The team is executing well. You asked about investments. What you will see is we certainly did as part of Summit, invest in certain areas like our commercial organization, innovation, our global strategic accounts organization, and you would see that in our SG&A expenses this year, if you look at our SG&A year-on-year, it's up excluding stock compensation expenses of about $16 million and actually more than all of that is in the commercial organization supporting growth. And so we \u2013 both in the form of increasing that organization, as well as some variable costs that go along with the great sales performance year-on-year, like, variable compensation expense. So you are seeing those expenses in the numbers already, and we expect that you will continue to see very good performance out of the team on Summit. Thanks. Sure. Hey, Shlomo. It's Barry. Thanks for the question. We feel really good about the way the team's performing in our services organization, as you know the revenue is up considerable amount both year-on-year and sequentially. While the gross margin is a tick down, call it, 40 basis points, I'll note that, that is driven by the fact that revenue in that line outstripped our projections. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks and if you look at versus our projections last quarter \u2013 for the quarter, we beat revenue by about $25 million round numbers, the vast majority of that was in services. So we certainly did to maintain customer service and we did have some level of, what I would consider like, surge expenses related to servicing that uptick in demand. And then I think you should expect that that will even out as we move forward. The decline in gross margin is about $1 million. So it's not a tremendous amount. We feel good about the margins we're generating off the new product offerings to Bill's point on our Global Digital Solutions and our Secure IT Asset Disposition. Those are very nice margins. The other thing I'll note is, our \u2013 if you work through the numbers in our services area on EBITDA, the EBITDA margin in that business was actually up 100 basis points sequentially, and that was up 640 basis point year-on-year. So we feel good about the way our services are performing. Thanks for the question. Rob, it's Barry. Thanks for the recent pickup of coverage. We appreciate that. On your question is related to inflation, I'll say that, beginning of the year, I would say we were quite prudent with respect to our guidance on inflation, obviously, that's a topic that's very much in the popular culture right now. We \u2013 one of the reasons we can be confident in our guidance and increase the midpoint today is that, what we are seeing is not outside the realm of what we baked into our original guidance. And if you look at our cost of service label, for example, you actually see that we're generating productivity, they're both sequentially and year-on-year. And so we feel good about where we are and appreciate the interest. Thank you. $125 million and I'm just increased it to $250 million: I think from a standpoint of going forward, you are thinking about it the right way. We've got a large portfolio and we see the opportunity \u2013 opportunistically continue to recycle a \u2013 relatively small amount. Without giving forward guidance, we'd historically said, you something on the order of a $100 million a year, maybe even $125 million a year as a planning posture. Obviously, our recycling efforts are back in circumstances we driven both based on what's out there in terms of cap rates, as well as what we need from a development pipeline. I will say that one of the benefits of our businesses in light of the growth in EBITDA and the cash generation of our core business, which is just tremendous. We see the opportunity to continue to fund our development, both from internal growth of EBITDA and cash generation, as well as this sort of modest recycling. So that's the way I would think about it. And I appreciate your interest. Hi, Shlomo, it's Barry. Thanks for the question. Let me clarify that of the $5 million, about $4.5 million is in the core. That's from the small deal we did in Asia, which is a $4.5 million acute. The rest is in the adjacent business category. And so when you work that through the model, you should find that the core was down just about 30 basis points, which to your point is \u2013 Bill's earlier comments, very consistent with what we've been seeing even a little bit better than where we were, let's say, a year, year and a half ago, in terms of sequential performance. We continue to feel good about our core business and expected as we guided earlier to be flat to slightly down on an organic basis for the full year. And in light of the dynamics that Bill mentioned in terms of the backlog for incoming cube and likely for the pandemic to continue to ease over time. We expect that that performance will continue to bump along and maybe even slightly improved. So we feel really good about where we are there."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Greer Aviv, SVP, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nGreer Aviv: Thank you, Irene. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. On today's call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and CEO and Barry Hytinen, our EVP and CFO. Today, we plan to share a number of key messages to help you better understand our performance, including our strong start to 2021, despite the ongoing impact of the pandemic; the continued execution of our strategic plan; solid progress in our key growth areas; continued expansion of our global data center platform; and our strong commitment to corporate social responsibility, including diversity, equity and inclusion. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the lines for Q&A. Today's earnings materials will contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's earnings materials, the safe harbor language on Slide 2, and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliation to these measures in our supplemental financial information. With that, I will turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Meaney: Thank you, Greer, and thank you all for taking time to join us. I hope you and your families are safe and well. We are pleased to have delivered a strong start to the year with both revenue and profitability coming in ahead of our expectations for the first quarter, despite the ongoing challenges of the pandemic and continued lockdowns in many parts of the world. Some of the key accomplishments of the quarter include, we achieved a record level of quarterly revenue, pricing continues to yield strong results as highlighted by our organic storage rental revenue growth of 1.7% year-on-year. Total organic volume grew some 2 million cubic feet versus last quarter and we continue to forecast overall volume growth to be flat to slightly positive for the year. We saw strong performance from our growth areas. For example, digital solutions is showing year-over-year organic growth of 11%, while secure IT asset disposition or SITAD has shown 30% growth. We are in line with delivering over $50 million of revenue growth from these two dynamic areas this year. Our global data center team leased nine megawatts in Q1 versus our guidance of between 25 and 30 megawatts for the full year. We continue to grow our footprint acquiring a new land parcel adjacent to our campus in Northern Virginia, which will increase our total potential capacity in that key market to 145 megawatts bringing our total potential datacenter capacity globally to 445 megawatts. Finally, adjusted EBITDA grew 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and our margin expanded 100 basis points. It should be noted that Q1 this year is even more impressive given that we are comparing it to a year ago where COVID, for the most part, was affecting very few of our customers. Whilst the impact from COVID during this quarter continues with many of the 56 countries we operate in to be in various stages of lockdown, we are proud of the consistency and stability of our core business and we continue to deliver on our strategic plan. This reflects the diversity and scale of our portfolio, the depth and breadth of our service offerings and the efficiencies that have been created through project summit. To further underline the point, our sales productivity remains strong and our mountaineers persevered, resulting in Q1 overall revenue slightly ahead of last year, whilst our traditional service revenue, which is most closely tied with being in the office was off 7%. We continue to expect to see very modest improvements in core service revenue as we progress through the year and we are not factoring in a full COVID recovery for the traditional side of the business before Q4 and perhaps for some parts of the world, even Q1 next year. In the meantime, we can see in our results and our improved guidance, our growth from new product areas will continue to deliver overall growth in our business in spite of the COVID impacts elsewhere. We remain committed to taking purposeful and bold steps to transform our entire organization, both operationally and culturally. We remain true to our plans to accelerate growth and continue our digital transformation journey, which for us includes both an internal focus as well has expanded product offerings for our customers. We are confident that our continued delivery of overall revenue growth, together with the expansion of margins due to Project Summit will enable us to continue our acceleration and cash generation which will allow us to continue to invest in our future whilst returning more and more cash to our investors. Project Summit is well on track to deliver $375 million of annual run rate adjusted EBITDA benefits exiting this year, even after investing in new growth areas. In addition to adding $375 million to our EBITDA through margin improvement, Project Summit will continue to enable us to invest in the growth areas we identified and discussed last quarter, further accelerating our growth in revenue as well as profits. Some of these areas you will recall include digital solutions, consumer storage data center and SITAD. Examples to illustrate the impact of our focus on revenue growth can be seen from recent wins in digital services in SITAD. One recent win in digital services was with a global insurance company, which was managing its exposure from a large and complicated liability claim. This customer desired end state was to streamline underwriting and claims management processes by providing digital accessibility to records to quickly identify risk exposure, reduce processing times, improve SLAs, ensure chain of custody and gain scalability for large discovery audits. Our unique solution was to integrate 440,000 of their physical boxes with their digital information to provide a single view to search across and identify relevant and required information on demand. By leveraging our insight platform, we were able to immediately improve their legal discovery efforts and automate their claims processes. Another recent win was with the Government of Canada to leverage our Image on Demand or IOD solution to process applications for immigration, refugee or citizenship status. The government experienced a backlog during COVID, as staff could not access offices and applications kept piling up. This digital solution enabled the government staff to work through the backlog. We are currently imaging more than 4000 applications on a weekly basis, which are then digitally delivered for processing by the Government of Canada's employees. Switching to SITAD, this quarter, we have secured contracts with for large global clients to provide services across the globe. These engagements cover everything from enterprise infrastructure, such as servers, routers, switches, printers, copiers, to small personal devices and specialized equipment such as card readers. Our solutions in SITAD are the only ones on the market built around a secure chain of custody where assets attract at every stage of their journey, and our customers' data is kept secure. Also, our disposition process is built with sustainability in mind. We are a leader in thinking and acting for the environment. Demand for these services is particularly strong as companies look to consolidate and transform their physical footprint to move to new hybrid collaboration models post COVID and we expect to partner with many more of our enterprise and global clients throughout 2021 and beyond. Now, let me switch gears and spend some time discussing our ESG commitments including the sustainability of our products, services and operations, as well as our efforts focused on diversity, equity and inclusion. Our Eighth Annual Corporate Social Responsibility report will be published later today. In that report, we share sustainability goals as part of our ESG commitments to reduce our environmental impact. Whilst we have been extremely successful in achieving targets that were previously said, including exceeding our science-based targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions six years ahead of schedule, we are introducing even stronger commitments to our planet, our customers, our employees and our communities. Some highlights include we are committed to achieving carbon net zero by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Climate Accord. We are proud to be ranked number 81 on Newsweek's list of America's Most Responsible Companies in 2021. By 2025, we are committed to building all of our newly constructed multi-tenant data centers to be certified to the BREEAM green building standard. In addition to contracting for renewable energy equivalent to 100% of our data center electricity load worldwide and passing through the carbon reduction benefits to our customers who avail themselves of our green power pass, we have announced our first electricity supply contract that matches our load 24/7 with local renewable generation for our facilities in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Additionally, we shared with you our recommitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, not just because it is just but also because it is key to our strategic success and being a more creative and dynamic organization, which can deliver more value in tune with our customer needs. For example, by 2025, we have committed to increasing representation of women in our global leadership team to 40% from 31% today, and people who identify as BIPOC in our US leadership team to 30% from 19%. Thanks to the true commitment of my fellow mountaineers across the globe, and with the guidance and engagement of our employee resource groups, we have made significant progress on our journey, but have a lot more to do. To further us on our journey, I'm pleased to announce that we have recently recruited Charlene Jackson as our Global Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer. Charlene brings a strong set of experience and skills as we continue building our global enterprise into an organization which is both diverse and inclusive. Finally, before handing the call over to Barry, I would like to provide a bit more information on the data center performance. As I mentioned earlier, our global data center team is off to a strong start leasing more than nine megawatts in the first quarter. As you likely saw, this included six megawatts with an existing US-based Fortune 100 technology company. We also signed a one-megawatt lease in Singapore with a leading e commerce end gaming company. The remainder of the leasing for the quarter was co-location and we continue to build our pipeline for both hyperscale and retail deployments. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we closed on our joint venture with Web Werks, and have already seen great growth prospects from that partnership. Web Werks recently announced that they have acquired a land parcel to build a standalone purpose-built Greenfield data center in Mumbai. This new data center will be designed to support 12.5 megawatts of IT capacity with a rich, interconnected ecosystem consisting of major telcos, over 150 internet service providers, and three major internet exchanges. The new facility expected to be operational by mid-2022 abuts Web Werks existing data center in Mumbai, which would result in a campus with 15 megawatts of total capacity. We also continue to grow our platform organically with the recent purchase of a land parcel adjacent to our existing Northern Virginia campus. This parcel is expected to support 32 megawatts of IT capacity at full build out. In addition, we redesigned our Manassas Campus master plan and can now support 30 megawatts of IT load at VA-2 compared to 24 megawatts previously, as well as an additional 35 megawatts of capacity at the campus. With these designs and scope changes, our NOVA campus capacity has increased more than 90% to 145 megawatts with 16 megawatts built in 72% of that leased. Our total data center potential capacity globally now is 445 megawatts and/or an increase of more than 18%, giving us a long runway for future development and growth. In closing, let me say thank you to our mountaineers and their families for their continued support and dedication in what has been a difficult and heart wrenching year for many. We and our customers count on our essential workers every day. And I personally always come back inspired after meeting with many of our teams around the globe. Our results demonstrate accelerating earnings growth, the resiliency of our business, revenue growth in new areas and the benefits of our culture. Our culture supports customer first with an innovative mindset. With that inner DNA, we will continue to climb higher together with our customers. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry.\nBarry Hytinen: Thanks, Bill and thank you for joining us. In the first quarter, our team delivered solid performance that exceeded expectations across each of our key financial metrics. Building on the improved performance we delivered in the second half of 2020, revenue trends continue to strengthen in the first quarter. Our core physical storage business is demonstrating its resilience and momentum is building in our growth areas. We are confident in our projections and are pleased to raise our full year financial guidance. Turning to our results for the quarter. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.1 billion grew 1.2%. Total organic revenue declined 60 basis points. Organic service revenue declined 4.8%, a marked improvement from prior quarters representing our best performance since the first quarter of 2020. While our service activity is still experiencing an impact from COVID, March was the first month since February 2020 with positive organic service revenue growth. Our team continues to drive improving trends with growth in our global digital solutions business and revenue management notable call outs. Total organic storage rental revenue grew 1.7% with continued benefits from pricing, combined with a slight increase in volume. Adjusted EBITDA was $381 million. We exceeded the projections we shared on our last call, as the team delivered stronger margin flow through together with the revenue beat. First quarter EBITDA reflects progress on our Summit transformation and revenue management, offset by COVID driven impacts to the business. AFFO was $235 million or $0.81 on a per share basis. As we mentioned on our prior earnings call, AFFO reflects an increase in recurring CapEx as we catch up on some projects that were deferred during the pandemic. Our full year recurring CapEx guidance is unchanged. Turning to segment performance. In the first quarter, our global RIM business delivered revenue of $967 million, an increase of $11 million from last year. On an organic basis, revenue declined 80 basis points. The team performed well with constant currency storage rental revenue growth of 1.7% or 1.6% on an organic basis. Growth was driven by pricing and volume. While our traditional services have been impacted by the pandemic, trends continue to improve during the first quarter. We are focused on expanding our global digital solutions business and in the first quarter, we experienced strong growth building on the commercial successes we delivered in 2020. We are pleased with the continued performance in our consumer storage business. Even with normal seasonality, the business contributed nicely to our overall physical volume. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $409 million, an increase of $17 million year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 120 basis points driven by pricing and Project Summit. Taking a look at headline numbers for our global data center business, we had another strong quarter of bookings with 9 megawatts. We are well on track to deliver our full year target of 25 to 30 megawatts. Total revenue grew 6% year-over-year, in line with our projections. As I mentioned on our prior call, we expect revenue growth in the data center business will be more back half weighted as the bulk of our 2020 bookings commence in the second quarter and beyond. We continue to project all year revenue growth in the range of low-double-digits to approaching mid-teens. With our strong prior year bookings, we have good visibility. In the second quarter, we anticipate an increase in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA compared to the first quarter. In terms of margin, we expect the second quarter to be down two to three points sequentially as a result of COVID driven construction delays and one-time build out services for a specific customer. We expect margins to remain at that level in the third quarter before recovering in the fourth quarter. In late April, we formed a joint venture with Web Werks, a leading co-location data center provider in India. We made an initial investment of approximately $50 million in exchange for a non-controlling interest. As we have previously disclosed, we expect to invest an additional $100 million over the next two years, which we expect will result in a majority ownership position. Turning to Project Summit, this quarter, the team delivered $50 million of incremental year-on-year adjusted EBITDA benefit. As a reminder, we expect Summit to contribute $150 million a year-on-your benefit in 2021, with another $60 million of year-on-year benefit in 2022. Total capital expenditures were $113 million, with an investment of 85 million of growth CapEx along with 29 million of recurring CapEx. Turning to capital recycling, in the first quarter, our program generated approximately $12 million of proceeds. With the highly favorable market backdrop and our strong data center development pipeline, we remain committed to recycling approximately $125 million of industrial assets for the full year. Turning to the balance sheet. At quarter end, we had approximately $1.8 billion of liquidity. We ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of just under 5.5 times, slightly better than our projection and down from last year. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term leverage range of 4.5 to 5.5 times. For 2021, we continue to expect to end the year within our target range near the high end, which will be modestly down from year end 2020 on a pro forma basis. With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early July. As we have said before, we are fully committed to our dividend at this sustainable level. Our long-term target for payout ratio is low to mid 60s as a percentage of AFFO. Turning to our outlook. Today, we are pleased to increase our 2021 financial guidance. There are two factors driving the improved projections. Our outlook for the business continues to improve with first quarter performance better than expected and increased confidence in our key growth drivers and the underlying business trends. Second, we've also factored in the benefit from two small recently closed acquisitions as well as the Web Werks investment. And I would note that we have been able to increase our guidance despite the ongoing impact of COVID on our traditional services business and construction delays in Frankfort. For the full year 2021, we now expect revenue of $4.365 billion to $4.515 billion. We now expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.585 billion to $1.635 billion. At the midpoint, this guidance represents growth - of revenue growth of 7% and EBITDA growth of 9%. We now expect AFFO to be in the range of $955 million to $1,005 million and AFFO per share of $3.28 to $3.45. At the midpoint, this represents 10% growth for both metrics. Our guidance assumes global organic physical volume will be flat to slightly positive versus last year, our revenue management program will provide a significant benefit in 2021 and I will note that nearly all of the actions driving that benefit were in place by the end of the first quarter. For services, we are prudently assuming some measure of continued COVID impact, albeit the first quarter was another good proof point for the momentum building in our digital solutions business. While we do not typically guide quarterly, with the pandemic, we felt it would be helpful to share our expectations for the second quarter. We expect revenue to approach $1.1 billion and adjusted EBITDA to approach $400 million. We are confident in our outlook and the strength of our pipeline. We expect to grow revenue sequentially throughout the year. In summary, the year is off to a good start. I am confident in the team's ability to continue to build on our momentum. We feel well positioned. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from George Tong of Goldman Sachs.\nGeorge Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Last quarter, you made a push into various growth markets. At this point, can you summarize how big your growth portfolio is? And how your growth expectations for this growth portfolio have evolved over the past quarter since doubling down into these areas of growth verticals and perhaps how much funding you would need to put into your initiatives in order to accelerate the growth in these in these growth markets? Thank you.\nBill Meaney: Good morning, George. Thanks for the question. So taking back, as you referred to, the last meeting, so over the last five years, we've been developing a number of new products and market approaches that really have taken us from a total addressable market where our products and services range from 10 billion to over 80 billion. So the things that we've been doubling down are consistent with that roadmap and picture that we highlighted last year, and that 80 billion, I should highlight, is also growing kind of low teens in terms of organic growth rate. So if you think about highlighted SITAD, for instance, in digital services today, I mean, I wouldn't say that we've just been doubling down on them in the last quarter, this has been a continuous build with I would say acceleration is part of Project Summit. And part of Project Summit, you're seeing the 375 million net EBITDA improvement that we are delivering and committing to. This is net of the investments that take us - that's required to actually invest in our digital services SITAD, our continued investment in data center, further acceleration in consumer, for instance. So the investment is already in there. The 375 million is a net number that's coming out. And I think you can expect, as we said today, if we just looked at SITAD in digital services this year alone that will add roughly $50 million of revenue on a year-over-year basis. So, we feel pretty good. Obviously, we just highlighted those two today, but across the board, and you can see it also in data center with nine megawatts leased in this quarter. So we feel pretty good about now aiming towards an $80 billion market in terms of revenue growth and that was part of Barry upsizing the revenue guidance for the full year.\nOperator: Our next question is from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo.\nEric Luebchow: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just one on the guidance, I'm just wondering if you can parse out the guidance increase what's coming from really operational outperformance versus perhaps some slightly more favorable foreign exchange rates that you experienced in the quarter versus last year? And then, another question on the data center side, just wondering, if you look at future growth areas, are there potentially any new markets either domestically or internationally that can make sense for Iron Mountain to enter either via M&A or through new Greenfield development or do you think you're just going to continue to develop in the markets that you have today? Thank you.\nBarry Hytinen: Hey, Eric. Good morning. It's Barry. Maybe I'll take the first one and I'll let Bill take the second one. I appreciate the question. As compared to our prior guidance, the increase of $40 million of revenue and 10 million of EBITDA is really driven by two factors as I mentioned on the call. First, it's our outlook on the business which just continues and improve, the first quarter performance I think is a testament of that. The team did very well - executed very well in the first quarter. And we're continuing to increase our confidence in our growth drivers and the underlying business trends. That's about $20 million of revenue in the guide up and probably seven - round numbers 7 million of the EBITDA. The second point is we factored in the benefit from two recently closed acquisitions, as well as the Web Werks investment. That's about combined $20 million of revenue in the year. Note that we acquired those in the second quarter, and then about call it 3 million of EBITDA. I'll remind people that the Web Werks acquisition is not consolidated, so there's no revenue that comes along with that in our financials. I would also just note that there's no change in our assumption as it relates to foreign exchange rates. So the rates that we're using and the impact of that on our growth that we had in our prior guidance is unchanged in the current guidance. So it's the underlying business performance together with the couple of small deals. Thanks for the question, Eric.\nBill Meaney: Yeah, the only thing I would add, Eric, in terms of other areas of growth for datasets - so I appreciate the question is, let me kind of parse it out into theaters or parts of the world. So if we look at domestic, as you know that we have a land bank in Chicago, we continue to like the Chicago market. So it's just a matter of where our priorities are in capital allocation. So I think you can expect at some point Chicago will be on the map. Also we continue to like the potential opportunities to repurpose some of our electricity meters, if you will, in California, where we can actually buy wholesale power, which gives us an advantage in terms of power costs, by taking a records management facility and repurposing that into a data center. So, California continues to be an area that we remained focused on as potential market for further development. On Europe, as we highlighted a few calls ago that we started building Frankfurt and then sold the thing out 100% of the 27 megawatts, so Frankfurt is a market that we continue to look at further expansion to it, because it's a key market serving continental Europe. London too, as we noted, is in full development but that's also looking to be pretty buoyant. So we'll continue to look at if we need more capacity in London. And then the last aspect I would say in London is we have had a few of our customers approach us on looking at edge deployments, and where we were considering actually repurposing some of our industrial real estate footprint into data center. So if you think about, we have a land bank for our data center business, which takes us up to 445 megawatts but that's not including the 80 million square feet of industrial warehouses that we have around the world, a number of those are suitable to be repurposed into data centers. So we continue to look at that mainly for as an edge kind of deployment, which can be anywhere from, let's say, from two to six megawatts. On the Asia front, as Barry highlighted and I mentioned in my remarks, we're super excited about the joint venture that we have with Web Werks. India, we think has a lot of potential and we're already seeing pent up demand, partly it's regulatory driven and partly, it's just the growth of the economy. So I think there's a lot more for us to do in India. As you would have noted that we're now 100% sold out in Singapore. So we're working through the permitting process on finding additional capacity in that market. And there were other areas in Southeast Asia, which I think are early days that we're looking at countries that would be interesting to expansion. And I would put Latin America in the same category is that there are a number of areas in Latin America that we're starting to look at, but we're at earlier stages for those areas.\nOperator: Our next question is from Sheila McGrath of Evercore ISI.\nSheila McGrath: Yes, good morning. Bill, the short interest in the stock is down but it still looks elevated to reap. Certainly not something you can control but I was just - the concern has always been storage volume, given paper trends. Can you just give us your updated insights on how Iron Mountain is still growing storage volume, total revenue and effectively shifting to adapt your business to these changing trends?\nBill Meaney: Good morning, Sheila and thanks for the question. Yeah, I think also it is people really start understanding the durability of our business and also the ability for us to continue to grow organically, cash generation through top line growth. I think people are starting to realize that they probably overplaying the paper storage aspect of the story. So I mean to your point is that, you saw the records volume was slightly improved from Q4 into Q1. Overall, we reiterate our commitment that we expect physical storage in the business to be flat to up for the full year again on an organic basis, and then you add three points of price to it. So - and given the relatively slow growth of that business, there is not a lot of CapEx is going into it. So we feel really good because this is just effectively generating tons of cash, that we're able to plow over to invest behind some of those growth initiatives that are targeted at the $80 billion total addressable market that I mentioned before, as well as datacenter, which we've been increasing our capital allocation to over the last few years. So, I think over time, I mean, people are going to really understand that the physical volume - physical storage business is alive and well, and we're getting good price increase on top of that. And of course, as you alluded to some of the other new physical storage areas like consumer continue to deliver dividends, and then on the other aspect is the revenue growth is starting to pick up from the investments we've made over the last five years into new business areas, I think is starting to come through.\nOperator: Next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Thank you very much for taking my question. I kind of want to piggyback on the last one, just in terms of the organic storage rental, on the one hand, the guidance is going up, you guys did better. The organic storage rental growth range embedded in the guidance, though, didn't change and I'm not sure if it was just kind of it's a rounding item or the growth is really coming outside of that. And I guess related to that is the sequential change in the physical records volume was the slowest decline I've seen over a while and I was wondering, if you could point to what's going on over there? Is there more of an influx of boxes, less of an issue with destructions, just you used to give more detail on a slide that's not in there anymore, maybe you can talk to these items.\nBill Meaney: Thanks, Shlomo. I'll talk about the physical volume side and then Barry can give you our thinking around the guidance around storage. So I think on the physical volume, if you've been watching this story for a very long time, I mean first of all, that the record storage is just one aspect of our physical storage business, right. And at the end of the day, it comes down to occupancy and our ability to drive cash returns for that business. So we feel that, I wouldn't say a large diversification, but a purposeful diversification of our physical storage business, I think you can even see that our data is showing the robustness and continuity of that business, which we feel really good about. Specifically to your question on the sequential Q4 to Q1 improvement in the records management side of the business, we're really pleased with it and that's why it continues to give our confidence that overall physical storage will be flat to slightly up for the year. And part of that improvement, which you can say during a COVID timeframe is kind of interesting, is really I give a lot of credit to our global strategic accounts organization, which we set up I guess, about 12 to 18 months ago, is their degree of mining and broadening the conversation with our customers is showing real results, not just in the new areas that I highlighted in my opening remarks around digital services in SITAD, which we've had, obviously, really nice growth in that area, but they actually is part of a broader conversation they're having with our customers, which quite frankly has delivered more box to our facilities as well. So, we feel pretty good across the board. We feel good about the different conversation we're having with our customers due to some of the investments we've made in our commercial operations. And Barry, you might want to talk about that.\nBarry Hytinen: Hi, Shlomo, it's Barry. Thanks for the question. And I will say that there's an element of rounding and candidly, an element of conservatism certainly the year has started off well and is trending a little bit better than our expectations that I mentioned in the setup. I will note that that those percentages are organic. So while we have a couple of small deals that is a purely organic number. The growth is coming in quite balanced. So we're seeing improving trends on storage and service. So thank you for the question.\nOperator: Our next question is from Nate Crossett of Berenberg.\nNate Crossett: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Two quick ones, if I may. First inflation, how should we think about expense growth for the year? What are you guys seeing in terms of labor costs, input costs? And then two, just your current view on funding the growth areas of the business right now, in the past you've used TV [indiscernible] is equity/using ATM [ph] lever that you would consider using?\nBarry Hytinen: Hi, Nate. It's Barry. Thanks for the question. So, we certainly did, as I mentioned in last call, include some level of what I would say is kind of normal inflation, the levels that were being talked about at the time. We don't see anything that is outside of our expectations that were embedded in the original guidance and that's part of the reason why we were able to continue to raise the guidance for the beat that we saw in the first quarter. I'll note that with our structure in our relatively high margins on both storage and service, it does result in with inflation, the opportunity to price that much more incremental profitability for us. And as you know we kind of price comparing to other logistics companies. So in some respects, it helps a little bit with our revenue management program. In terms of funding growth, a couple of thoughts. One, obviously, we're continuing to expand EBITDA, thanks to Summit and the team's underlying performance, we will be doing a level of capital recycling this year, call it $125 million is what's embedded in the guidance. I'll note that the market there is very favorable and we continue to like cap rates. And so those would be the principal things I'd mentioned in terms of where the yield is and where the stock is. We feel very good about our ability to fund our operations within our framework and so we'll be funding from things like recycling and the growth in EBITDA.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jon Atkin of RBC.\nJon Atkin: Thanks. So, I guess a commercial question, and then more of an M&A question. I was wondering, as you think about your leasing objectives, where you see the greatest potential in your supplemental, there's obviously a very good layout of your pre-stabilized portfolio, the expansion pool, and new development. I can imagine any one of those three would be potential sources of new pre-leasing or leasing. But within those three categories, is there one or two that kind of standout as - of those categories that stand out as to where you see the most potential for these through the balance of the year?\nBill Meaney: Thanks, John. Good morning. Thanks for the question. We think about it kind of two different ways. So, if you look at say, in the US, some of our two really large campuses, which would be obviously Northern Virginia and Phoenix is a lot of our expansion and development in those sites is driven by line of sight to customer conversations that we're having, which you can imagine, because those are large campuses that attract a lot of attention from customers, both on the co-location as well as the hyper-scale side. If we look at some of our European markets, it's more just based on the dynamics and the absorption versus the level of capacity in those markets, like places like Frankfurt, London, etc. So I think it's kind of two different worlds. And then the same thing in New Jersey, it's a high reasonable levels of absorption with the right balance of supply. So I think it's a mix, there are some cases where it's purely on market dynamics. And there are other areas where we really liked the conversations we're having with a number of customers, especially around some of our large campuses.\nJon Atkin: Okay. And then if you could maybe just refresh us on going forward interest level in inorganic expansion, and so whether that's sale leaseback private read portfolios, shells that are occupied by cloud players, and so forth. I think there's been a little bit of cap rate compression recently, for instance, in the US, but just interested in any updates or thoughts on types of M&A that you would continue to entertain?\nBill Meaney: Okay. Yeah, there's kind of - I think I understand two parts of your question. So first of all, on the M&A, we feel really good about the platform that we have, as it is today, so we don't anticipate any large M&A. I mean, they're obviously - the Web Werks in India is what I would call a more of a brownfield situation where it's a smaller M&A deal that gives us a platform for further Greenfield build out in what we think is a really interesting and high growth market, just like we did EvoSwitch a few years ago in the Amsterdam market, right, which again was kind of a brownfield. So, if we're talking about those kinds of things where we do a make versus buy situation for entering into a market or expanding in a market, we will continue to look at those kinds of what I would call small M&A deals. But, large platform M&A deal, we don't see we really have the need. I think partly, we are already in 56 countries for many decades as an operator, so we feel we have good cultural fit in the countries that we operate in. And we already have a pretty good international spread across our data center business, so we feel really good. On the capital allocation question I would just reiterate with what Barry said before is, we feel that between EBITDA growth and opportunities to recycle capital, like what we're doing in our industrial portfolio where the cap rates are, we think, really low. We like that trade of trading in exposure on industrial right now and putting more capital at work in data center.\nOperator: Last question is a follow up from Sheila McGrath of Evercore.\nSheila McGrath: Yes, two quick questions. Margin improvement of 100 basis points was a positive, how should we think about that, as the year progresses? And is more of the improvement on cost of sales or SGA? And my second question is Bill, you mentioned existing own sites could potentially be repositioned as for data center. Just wondering, have you done that already or is anything underway?\nBill Meaney: No, thanks. So, Sheila, I'll answer your question on the edge data center deployments using our existing footprint. At this point, it's only a conversation. So there are a couple specific sites that we're looking at in Europe at the moment with customers but it's still early days, I would say. But I'm encouraged by the conversations we're having there and the flexibility that our industrial real estate footprint potentially gives us down the road.\nBarry Hytinen: Sheila, thanks for the question. It's Barry. Couple of things. Certainly, as we move into the second quarter, we're looking for EBITDA to be approaching 400 million, which is very nice growth rate and reflects, to some extent, of course, last year's COVID impact. And as you work through the model, you'll find another continued nice growth in EBITDA going forward. I will say, I think a notable call out, frankly, in the first quarter, is the fact that our cost of sales are actually down about $15 million, despite sales being up. And that is a testament to the team's strong progress on Project Summit. As we talked about before, Project Summit in 2021 is vastly going to be benefiting cost of sales as opposed to SG&A, just in light of the sorts of operational improvements that we talked about and highlighted, such as service delivery, changes, etc. And so you really saw that starting to come to fruition in the first quarter with the vast majority of that Summit benefit year-on-year that I called out being in cost of sales. And that's a trend that we expect to continue for the remainder of the year. Appreciate the questions, Sheila.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the conference. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bill Meaney",
            "content": "Thank you, Greer, and thank you all for taking time to join us. I hope you and your families are safe and well. We are pleased to have delivered a strong start to the year with both revenue and profitability coming in ahead of our expectations for the first quarter, despite the ongoing challenges of the pandemic and continued lockdowns in many parts of the world. Some of the key accomplishments of the quarter include, we achieved a record level of quarterly revenue, pricing continues to yield strong results as highlighted by our organic storage rental revenue growth of 1.7% year-on-year. Total organic volume grew some 2 million cubic feet versus last quarter and we continue to forecast overall volume growth to be flat to slightly positive for the year. We saw strong performance from our growth areas. For example, digital solutions is showing year-over-year organic growth of 11%, while secure IT asset disposition or SITAD has shown 30% growth. We are in line with delivering over $50 million of revenue growth from these two dynamic areas this year. Our global data center team leased nine megawatts in Q1 versus our guidance of between 25 and 30 megawatts for the full year. We continue to grow our footprint acquiring a new land parcel adjacent to our campus in Northern Virginia, which will increase our total potential capacity in that key market to 145 megawatts bringing our total potential datacenter capacity globally to 445 megawatts. Finally, adjusted EBITDA grew 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and our margin expanded 100 basis points. It should be noted that Q1 this year is even more impressive given that we are comparing it to a year ago where COVID, for the most part, was affecting very few of our customers. Whilst the impact from COVID during this quarter continues with many of the 56 countries we operate in to be in various stages of lockdown, we are proud of the consistency and stability of our core business and we continue to deliver on our strategic plan. This reflects the diversity and scale of our portfolio, the depth and breadth of our service offerings and the efficiencies that have been created through project summit. To further underline the point, our sales productivity remains strong and our mountaineers persevered, resulting in Q1 overall revenue slightly ahead of last year, whilst our traditional service revenue, which is most closely tied with being in the office was off 7%. We continue to expect to see very modest improvements in core service revenue as we progress through the year and we are not factoring in a full COVID recovery for the traditional side of the business before Q4 and perhaps for some parts of the world, even Q1 next year. In the meantime, we can see in our results and our improved guidance, our growth from new product areas will continue to deliver overall growth in our business in spite of the COVID impacts elsewhere. We remain committed to taking purposeful and bold steps to transform our entire organization, both operationally and culturally. We remain true to our plans to accelerate growth and continue our digital transformation journey, which for us includes both an internal focus as well has expanded product offerings for our customers. We are confident that our continued delivery of overall revenue growth, together with the expansion of margins due to Project Summit will enable us to continue our acceleration and cash generation which will allow us to continue to invest in our future whilst returning more and more cash to our investors. Project Summit is well on track to deliver $375 million of annual run rate adjusted EBITDA benefits exiting this year, even after investing in new growth areas. In addition to adding $375 million to our EBITDA through margin improvement, Project Summit will continue to enable us to invest in the growth areas we identified and discussed last quarter, further accelerating our growth in revenue as well as profits. Some of these areas you will recall include digital solutions, consumer storage data center and SITAD. Examples to illustrate the impact of our focus on revenue growth can be seen from recent wins in digital services in SITAD. One recent win in digital services was with a global insurance company, which was managing its exposure from a large and complicated liability claim. This customer desired end state was to streamline underwriting and claims management processes by providing digital accessibility to records to quickly identify risk exposure, reduce processing times, improve SLAs, ensure chain of custody and gain scalability for large discovery audits. Our unique solution was to integrate 440,000 of their physical boxes with their digital information to provide a single view to search across and identify relevant and required information on demand. By leveraging our insight platform, we were able to immediately improve their legal discovery efforts and automate their claims processes. Another recent win was with the Government of Canada to leverage our Image on Demand or IOD solution to process applications for immigration, refugee or citizenship status. The government experienced a backlog during COVID, as staff could not access offices and applications kept piling up. This digital solution enabled the government staff to work through the backlog. We are currently imaging more than 4000 applications on a weekly basis, which are then digitally delivered for processing by the Government of Canada's employees. Switching to SITAD, this quarter, we have secured contracts with for large global clients to provide services across the globe. These engagements cover everything from enterprise infrastructure, such as servers, routers, switches, printers, copiers, to small personal devices and specialized equipment such as card readers. Our solutions in SITAD are the only ones on the market built around a secure chain of custody where assets attract at every stage of their journey, and our customers' data is kept secure. Also, our disposition process is built with sustainability in mind. We are a leader in thinking and acting for the environment. Demand for these services is particularly strong as companies look to consolidate and transform their physical footprint to move to new hybrid collaboration models post COVID and we expect to partner with many more of our enterprise and global clients throughout 2021 and beyond. Now, let me switch gears and spend some time discussing our ESG commitments including the sustainability of our products, services and operations, as well as our efforts focused on diversity, equity and inclusion. Our Eighth Annual Corporate Social Responsibility report will be published later today. In that report, we share sustainability goals as part of our ESG commitments to reduce our environmental impact. Whilst we have been extremely successful in achieving targets that were previously said, including exceeding our science-based targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions six years ahead of schedule, we are introducing even stronger commitments to our planet, our customers, our employees and our communities. Some highlights include we are committed to achieving carbon net zero by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Climate Accord. We are proud to be ranked number 81 on Newsweek's list of America's Most Responsible Companies in 2021. By 2025, we are committed to building all of our newly constructed multi-tenant data centers to be certified to the BREEAM green building standard. In addition to contracting for renewable energy equivalent to 100% of our data center electricity load worldwide and passing through the carbon reduction benefits to our customers who avail themselves of our green power pass, we have announced our first electricity supply contract that matches our load 24/7 with local renewable generation for our facilities in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Additionally, we shared with you our recommitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, not just because it is just but also because it is key to our strategic success and being a more creative and dynamic organization, which can deliver more value in tune with our customer needs. For example, by 2025, we have committed to increasing representation of women in our global leadership team to 40% from 31% today, and people who identify as BIPOC in our US leadership team to 30% from 19%. Thanks to the true commitment of my fellow mountaineers across the globe, and with the guidance and engagement of our employee resource groups, we have made significant progress on our journey, but have a lot more to do. To further us on our journey, I'm pleased to announce that we have recently recruited Charlene Jackson as our Global Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer. Charlene brings a strong set of experience and skills as we continue building our global enterprise into an organization which is both diverse and inclusive. Finally, before handing the call over to Barry, I would like to provide a bit more information on the data center performance. As I mentioned earlier, our global data center team is off to a strong start leasing more than nine megawatts in the first quarter. As you likely saw, this included six megawatts with an existing US-based Fortune 100 technology company. We also signed a one-megawatt lease in Singapore with a leading e commerce end gaming company. The remainder of the leasing for the quarter was co-location and we continue to build our pipeline for both hyperscale and retail deployments. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we closed on our joint venture with Web Werks, and have already seen great growth prospects from that partnership. Web Werks recently announced that they have acquired a land parcel to build a standalone purpose-built Greenfield data center in Mumbai. This new data center will be designed to support 12.5 megawatts of IT capacity with a rich, interconnected ecosystem consisting of major telcos, over 150 internet service providers, and three major internet exchanges. The new facility expected to be operational by mid-2022 abuts Web Werks existing data center in Mumbai, which would result in a campus with 15 megawatts of total capacity. We also continue to grow our platform organically with the recent purchase of a land parcel adjacent to our existing Northern Virginia campus. This parcel is expected to support 32 megawatts of IT capacity at full build out. In addition, we redesigned our Manassas Campus master plan and can now support 30 megawatts of IT load at VA-2 compared to 24 megawatts previously, as well as an additional 35 megawatts of capacity at the campus. With these designs and scope changes, our NOVA campus capacity has increased more than 90% to 145 megawatts with 16 megawatts built in 72% of that leased. Our total data center potential capacity globally now is 445 megawatts and/or an increase of more than 18%, giving us a long runway for future development and growth. In closing, let me say thank you to our mountaineers and their families for their continued support and dedication in what has been a difficult and heart wrenching year for many. We and our customers count on our essential workers every day. And I personally always come back inspired after meeting with many of our teams around the globe. Our results demonstrate accelerating earnings growth, the resiliency of our business, revenue growth in new areas and the benefits of our culture. Our culture supports customer first with an innovative mindset. With that inner DNA, we will continue to climb higher together with our customers. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry. Good morning, George. Thanks for the question. So taking back, as you referred to, the last meeting, so over the last five years, we've been developing a number of new products and market approaches that really have taken us from a total addressable market where our products and services range from 10 billion to over 80 billion. So the things that we've been doubling down are consistent with that roadmap and picture that we highlighted last year, and that 80 billion, I should highlight, is also growing kind of low teens in terms of organic growth rate. So if you think about highlighted SITAD, for instance, in digital services today, I mean, I wouldn't say that we've just been doubling down on them in the last quarter, this has been a continuous build with I would say acceleration is part of Project Summit. And part of Project Summit, you're seeing the 375 million net EBITDA improvement that we are delivering and committing to. This is net of the investments that take us - that's required to actually invest in our digital services SITAD, our continued investment in data center, further acceleration in consumer, for instance. So the investment is already in there. The 375 million is a net number that's coming out. And I think you can expect, as we said today, if we just looked at SITAD in digital services this year alone that will add roughly $50 million of revenue on a year-over-year basis. So, we feel pretty good. Obviously, we just highlighted those two today, but across the board, and you can see it also in data center with nine megawatts leased in this quarter. So we feel pretty good about now aiming towards an $80 billion market in terms of revenue growth and that was part of Barry upsizing the revenue guidance for the full year. Yeah, the only thing I would add, Eric, in terms of other areas of growth for datasets - so I appreciate the question is, let me kind of parse it out into theaters or parts of the world. So if we look at domestic, as you know that we have a land bank in Chicago, we continue to like the Chicago market. So it's just a matter of where our priorities are in capital allocation. So I think you can expect at some point Chicago will be on the map. Also we continue to like the potential opportunities to repurpose some of our electricity meters, if you will, in California, where we can actually buy wholesale power, which gives us an advantage in terms of power costs, by taking a records management facility and repurposing that into a data center. So, California continues to be an area that we remained focused on as potential market for further development. On Europe, as we highlighted a few calls ago that we started building Frankfurt and then sold the thing out 100% of the 27 megawatts, so Frankfurt is a market that we continue to look at further expansion to it, because it's a key market serving continental Europe. London too, as we noted, is in full development but that's also looking to be pretty buoyant. So we'll continue to look at if we need more capacity in London. And then the last aspect I would say in London is we have had a few of our customers approach us on looking at edge deployments, and where we were considering actually repurposing some of our industrial real estate footprint into data center. So if you think about, we have a land bank for our data center business, which takes us up to 445 megawatts but that's not including the 80 million square feet of industrial warehouses that we have around the world, a number of those are suitable to be repurposed into data centers. So we continue to look at that mainly for as an edge kind of deployment, which can be anywhere from, let's say, from two to six megawatts. On the Asia front, as Barry highlighted and I mentioned in my remarks, we're super excited about the joint venture that we have with Web Werks. India, we think has a lot of potential and we're already seeing pent up demand, partly it's regulatory driven and partly, it's just the growth of the economy. So I think there's a lot more for us to do in India. As you would have noted that we're now 100% sold out in Singapore. So we're working through the permitting process on finding additional capacity in that market. And there were other areas in Southeast Asia, which I think are early days that we're looking at countries that would be interesting to expansion. And I would put Latin America in the same category is that there are a number of areas in Latin America that we're starting to look at, but we're at earlier stages for those areas. Good morning, Sheila and thanks for the question. Yeah, I think also it is people really start understanding the durability of our business and also the ability for us to continue to grow organically, cash generation through top line growth. I think people are starting to realize that they probably overplaying the paper storage aspect of the story. So I mean to your point is that, you saw the records volume was slightly improved from Q4 into Q1. Overall, we reiterate our commitment that we expect physical storage in the business to be flat to up for the full year again on an organic basis, and then you add three points of price to it. So - and given the relatively slow growth of that business, there is not a lot of CapEx is going into it. So we feel really good because this is just effectively generating tons of cash, that we're able to plow over to invest behind some of those growth initiatives that are targeted at the $80 billion total addressable market that I mentioned before, as well as datacenter, which we've been increasing our capital allocation to over the last few years. So, I think over time, I mean, people are going to really understand that the physical volume - physical storage business is alive and well, and we're getting good price increase on top of that. And of course, as you alluded to some of the other new physical storage areas like consumer continue to deliver dividends, and then on the other aspect is the revenue growth is starting to pick up from the investments we've made over the last five years into new business areas, I think is starting to come through. Thanks, Shlomo. I'll talk about the physical volume side and then Barry can give you our thinking around the guidance around storage. So I think on the physical volume, if you've been watching this story for a very long time, I mean first of all, that the record storage is just one aspect of our physical storage business, right.

            "content": "Thanks, Bill and thank you for joining us. In the first quarter, our team delivered solid performance that exceeded expectations across each of our key financial metrics. Building on the improved performance we delivered in the second half of 2020, revenue trends continue to strengthen in the first quarter. Our core physical storage business is demonstrating its resilience and momentum is building in our growth areas. We are confident in our projections and are pleased to raise our full year financial guidance. Turning to our results for the quarter. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.1 billion grew 1.2%. Total organic revenue declined 60 basis points. Organic service revenue declined 4.8%, a marked improvement from prior quarters representing our best performance since the first quarter of 2020. While our service activity is still experiencing an impact from COVID, March was the first month since February 2020 with positive organic service revenue growth. Our team continues to drive improving trends with growth in our global digital solutions business and revenue management notable call outs. Total organic storage rental revenue grew 1.7% with continued benefits from pricing, combined with a slight increase in volume. Adjusted EBITDA was $381 million. We exceeded the projections we shared on our last call, as the team delivered stronger margin flow through together with the revenue beat. First quarter EBITDA reflects progress on our Summit transformation and revenue management, offset by COVID driven impacts to the business. AFFO was $235 million or $0.81 on a per share basis. As we mentioned on our prior earnings call, AFFO reflects an increase in recurring CapEx as we catch up on some projects that were deferred during the pandemic. Our full year recurring CapEx guidance is unchanged. Turning to segment performance. In the first quarter, our global RIM business delivered revenue of $967 million, an increase of $11 million from last year. On an organic basis, revenue declined 80 basis points. The team performed well with constant currency storage rental revenue growth of 1.7% or 1.6% on an organic basis. Growth was driven by pricing and volume. While our traditional services have been impacted by the pandemic, trends continue to improve during the first quarter. We are focused on expanding our global digital solutions business and in the first quarter, we experienced strong growth building on the commercial successes we delivered in 2020. We are pleased with the continued performance in our consumer storage business. Even with normal seasonality, the business contributed nicely to our overall physical volume. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $409 million, an increase of $17 million year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 120 basis points driven by pricing and Project Summit. Taking a look at headline numbers for our global data center business, we had another strong quarter of bookings with 9 megawatts. We are well on track to deliver our full year target of 25 to 30 megawatts. Total revenue grew 6% year-over-year, in line with our projections. As I mentioned on our prior call, we expect revenue growth in the data center business will be more back half weighted as the bulk of our 2020 bookings commence in the second quarter and beyond. We continue to project all year revenue growth in the range of low-double-digits to approaching mid-teens. With our strong prior year bookings, we have good visibility. In the second quarter, we anticipate an increase in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA compared to the first quarter. In terms of margin, we expect the second quarter to be down two to three points sequentially as a result of COVID driven construction delays and one-time build out services for a specific customer. We expect margins to remain at that level in the third quarter before recovering in the fourth quarter. In late April, we formed a joint venture with Web Werks, a leading co-location data center provider in India. We made an initial investment of approximately $50 million in exchange for a non-controlling interest. As we have previously disclosed, we expect to invest an additional $100 million over the next two years, which we expect will result in a majority ownership position. Turning to Project Summit, this quarter, the team delivered $50 million of incremental year-on-year adjusted EBITDA benefit. As a reminder, we expect Summit to contribute $150 million a year-on-your benefit in 2021, with another $60 million of year-on-year benefit in 2022. Total capital expenditures were $113 million, with an investment of 85 million of growth CapEx along with 29 million of recurring CapEx. Turning to capital recycling, in the first quarter, our program generated approximately $12 million of proceeds. With the highly favorable market backdrop and our strong data center development pipeline, we remain committed to recycling approximately $125 million of industrial assets for the full year. Turning to the balance sheet. At quarter end, we had approximately $1.8 billion of liquidity. We ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of just under 5.5 times, slightly better than our projection and down from last year. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term leverage range of 4.5 to 5.5 times. For 2021, we continue to expect to end the year within our target range near the high end, which will be modestly down from year end 2020 on a pro forma basis. With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early July. As we have said before, we are fully committed to our dividend at this sustainable level. Our long-term target for payout ratio is low to mid 60s as a percentage of AFFO. Turning to our outlook. Today, we are pleased to increase our 2021 financial guidance. There are two factors driving the improved projections. Our outlook for the business continues to improve with first quarter performance better than expected and increased confidence in our key growth drivers and the underlying business trends. Second, we've also factored in the benefit from two small recently closed acquisitions as well as the Web Werks investment. And I would note that we have been able to increase our guidance despite the ongoing impact of COVID on our traditional services business and construction delays in Frankfort. For the full year 2021, we now expect revenue of $4.365 billion to $4.515 billion. We now expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.585 billion to $1.635 billion. At the midpoint, this guidance represents growth - of revenue growth of 7% and EBITDA growth of 9%. We now expect AFFO to be in the range of $955 million to $1,005 million and AFFO per share of $3.28 to $3.45. At the midpoint, this represents 10% growth for both metrics. Our guidance assumes global organic physical volume will be flat to slightly positive versus last year, our revenue management program will provide a significant benefit in 2021 and I will note that nearly all of the actions driving that benefit were in place by the end of the first quarter. For services, we are prudently assuming some measure of continued COVID impact, albeit the first quarter was another good proof point for the momentum building in our digital solutions business. While we do not typically guide quarterly, with the pandemic, we felt it would be helpful to share our expectations for the second quarter. We expect revenue to approach $1.1 billion and adjusted EBITDA to approach $400 million. We are confident in our outlook and the strength of our pipeline. We expect to grow revenue sequentially throughout the year. In summary, the year is off to a good start. I am confident in the team's ability to continue to build on our momentum. We feel well positioned. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. Hey, Eric. Good morning. It's Barry. Maybe I'll take the first one and I'll let Bill take the second one. I appreciate the question. As compared to our prior guidance, the increase of $40 million of revenue and 10 million of EBITDA is really driven by two factors as I mentioned on the call. First, it's our outlook on the business which just continues and improve, the first quarter performance I think is a testament of that. The team did very well - executed very well in the first quarter. And we're continuing to increase our confidence in our growth drivers and the underlying business trends. That's about $20 million of revenue in the guide up and probably seven - round numbers 7 million of the EBITDA. The second point is we factored in the benefit from two recently closed acquisitions, as well as the Web Werks investment. That's about combined $20 million of revenue in the year. Note that we acquired those in the second quarter, and then about call it 3 million of EBITDA. I'll remind people that the Web Werks acquisition is not consolidated, so there's no revenue that comes along with that in our financials. I would also just note that there's no change in our assumption as it relates to foreign exchange rates. So the rates that we're using and the impact of that on our growth that we had in our prior guidance is unchanged in the current guidance. So it's the underlying business performance together with the couple of small deals. Thanks for the question, Eric. Hi, Shlomo, it's Barry. Thanks for the question. And I will say that there's an element of rounding and candidly, an element of conservatism certainly the year has started off well and is trending a little bit better than our expectations that I mentioned in the setup. I will note that that those percentages are organic. So while we have a couple of small deals that is a purely organic number. The growth is coming in quite balanced. So we're seeing improving trends on storage and service. So thank you for the question. Hi, Nate. It's Barry. Thanks for the question. So, we certainly did, as I mentioned in last call, include some level of what I would say is kind of normal inflation, the levels that were being talked about at the time. We don't see anything that is outside of our expectations that were embedded in the original guidance and that's part of the reason why we were able to continue to raise the guidance for the beat that we saw in the first quarter. I'll note that with our structure in our relatively high margins on both storage and service, it does result in with inflation, the opportunity to price that much more incremental profitability for us. And as you know we kind of price comparing to other logistics companies. So in some respects, it helps a little bit with our revenue management program. In terms of funding growth, a couple of thoughts. One, obviously, we're continuing to expand EBITDA, thanks to Summit and the team's underlying performance, we will be doing a level of capital recycling this year, call it $125 million is what's embedded in the guidance. I'll note that the market there is very favorable and we continue to like cap rates. And so those would be the principal things I'd mentioned in terms of where the yield is and where the stock is. We feel very good about our ability to fund our operations within our framework and so we'll be funding from things like recycling and the growth in EBITDA. Sheila, thanks for the question. It's Barry. Couple of things. Certainly, as we move into the second quarter, we're looking for EBITDA to be approaching 400 million, which is very nice growth rate and reflects, to some extent, of course, last year's COVID impact. And as you work through the model, you'll find another continued nice growth in EBITDA going forward. I will say, I think a notable call out, frankly, in the first quarter, is the fact that our cost of sales are actually down about $15 million, despite sales being up. And that is a testament to the team's strong progress on Project Summit. As we talked about before, Project Summit in 2021 is vastly going to be benefiting cost of sales as opposed to SG&A, just in light of the sorts of operational improvements that we talked about and highlighted, such as service delivery, changes, etc. And so you really saw that starting to come to fruition in the first quarter with the vast majority of that Summit benefit year-on-year that I called out being in cost of sales. And that's a trend that we expect to continue for the remainder of the year. Appreciate the questions, Sheila."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Gillian Tiltman, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nGillian Tiltman: Thanks Sarah. Good morning everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. On today\u2019s call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We are joined here today by Bill Meany, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Barry Hytinen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open up the lines for Q&A. Today\u2019s earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today\u2019s earnings materials, the Safe Harbor language on Slide 2, and our annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliations to these measures in our supplemental financial information. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill.\nWilliam Meany: Thank you, Julian. And thank you all for taking the time to join us today. We are pleased to have delivered record performance for both the fourth quarter and the full year. These exceptional results are reflective of our broad product portfolio, synergistic business model, deep customer relationships, and committed team. Before I dive into the drivers of our strong performance, I would like to take a few moments to relay how deeply saddened we are all feeling by the devastating and recent earthquakes in Turkey and Syria. Our thoughts and prayers are with our fellow mountaineers, customers and all of their families living and working in the region. The safety and security of our employees is our number one priority. And we are committed to supporting our colleagues in the region as they navigate this challenging time. Now let me begin our discussion of our recent performance. I am proud to report that Iron Mountain has had another outstanding year. In the fourth quarter we achieved quarterly revenue of $1.28 billion yielding 11.3% total organic revenue growth and record adjusted EBITDA $472 million up 10%. For the full year, we delivered record results across the board. Revenue of $5.1 billion adjusted EBITDA of $1.8 billion, and AFFO of $1.1 billion, representing growth of 14% 12% and 10%, respectively. This performance is a direct result of our close relationships with our customers and our commitment to innovation so we can provide them with expanded products and services to meet their needs. For the full year, we delivered organic storage rental revenue growth of 9%, reflecting continued benefit of pricing combined with positive volume trends. We drove double digit organic growth in our data center business, as well as our digital services and asset lifecycle management business areas capping off another excellent year. Our continued drive to build an ever-expanding suite of synergistic and customer centric solutions, together with global reach and scale fuels our accelerated growth consistent with the Matterhorn Excellence model we unveiled last autumn. Let me share a few examples of how we've been enabling our customer\u2019s success and growth through the diverse solutions and unmatched customer service we offer. Beginning with our records management business report, we reported a substantial cross sell win with a large non-profit healthcare provider, which has been an Iron Mountain customer for more than 20 years. The win resulted in a new 10-year contract covering records management, ALM, data management, secure storage of non-records and document digitization services taking this customer from $2.5 million per year to $5 million annually. Just a few years ago, we would have been able unable to provide such a broad range of services and solutions to this long tenured customer. Today, with our broad offerings we not only cross sold the new services and solutions, but we increased our share of wallet for our records management services and solidified our position as a trusted and strategic partner. We also provided a solution for a large U.S. Bank to develop a simple and cost effective process to manage its vast inventory of over 24 million mortgage files. This partnership involves meeting stringent compliance obligations, mitigating risk and reducing cost. Also in the quarter we want new business serving the Australian Government. Through this work, we will drive considerable cost savings to one of Australia's largest government agencies. Iron Mountain will have a dedicated team to pack, enter data and transport 375,000 cartons to our new facility in Melbourne. In Digital Solutions, a key win I would like to highlight is with a branch of the U.S. federal government. As a result of the enormous success of our original project with the customer to digitize 177,000 reels of microfilm in less than the prescribed year, we have executed a sole source follow on contract to digitize another 133,000 reels of microfilm. This win is the result of the strategic development of a best-in-breed AI machine learning solution to auto classify and automate data capture. In addition, we worked with a large global medical equipment and electronics manufacturer to navigate an extensive global medical product recall. The customer needed an efficient partner to assist with the recall in order to meet regulatory requirements and avoid further legal ramifications. The customer also required rapid response and tight turnaround times and was seeking a single partner. The win includes several service offerings delivered by a single point of contact and illustrates the early success of our new commercial operating model that we introduced with Project Matterhorn. Turning to ALM, another noteworthy win this quarter was with a health insurance provider, which selected Iron Mountain as its dedicated asset lifecycle management partner. Due to the unique nature of their business, the customer has constant attrition throughout the course of the year, and consequently, they were seeking a dedicated ALM partner to provide collection, wiping, imaging, secure storage and redeployment of technology assets. The customers previous positive experience with Iron Mountain and our team, combined with our strong solutions led to mutual success. Our services resolve the challenges around collection, ease of use, and reporting and tracking. This illustrates our commercial team strength and ability to cross sell our set of solutions across the mountain range. And is another example of our increased focus and success in driving commercial engagement is part of our Matterhorn Klein. Moreover, we are especially proud to say that we renewed our largest ALM contract this quarter. This is the fourth contract renewal with this client, one of the largest technology companies in the world. We have worked with them for the past 12 years and are proud of this relationship, the continuation of which demonstrates the potential for longevity in this area of our business. We continue to be excited and encouraged by the total addressable market in the asset lifecycle management category. Despite the headwinds we have faced this year as a result of enduring COVID-19 lockdowns in China. In spite of this, our legacy ITAD business continues to perform well and as we gain momentum on our Matterhorn Klein, we continue to focus on moves to accelerate this growth. Finally, turning to our data center business, we are pleased to have finished the year with 139 megawatts of new leases signed exceeding our original booking guidance of 50 megawatts and our most recent target expressed in the third quarter of 130 megawatts. In the fourth quarter, we successfully completed 14 megawatts of leasing. This area of our business has gone from strength to strength over the past several years, and we continue to see tremendous opportunity in serving both hyperscale and colocation customers, and significant growth potential for our data center footprint. With 37% year-on-year bookings growth, excluding our large lease in Virginia 4, 5 we will continue to prioritize data centers with our capital program, more details of which Barry will provide in his remarks. One customer win in our data center business that I would like to share is a six megawatt expansion lease at our Phoenix campus with an existing Global Fortune 100 customer. The customer which has a long-term strategic relationship with Iron Mountain across service lines, and has existing capacity in several of our other locations needed space to expand in Arizona. Our customer was able to leverage our Phoenix data center for their expansion, and we look forward to supporting them in their future growth. Also in the quarter, our team announced a win for our joint venture at the Mumbai-2 data center, which is connected to our Mumbai-1 data center one of the most robust carrier hotels in the country, providing superb connectivity and flexibility for our customers. We partnered with a global content delivery network company to expand their presence in Mumbai. They required a robust network ecosystem backed by reliable power infrastructure, which we were able to provide. Another win to highlight our ability to cross sell across business segments involves our existing relationship with one of the largest German banks. This resulted in a new partnership with our data center team who leveraged their excellent network within the German Financial Network market and demonstrated proficiency and its high regulatory standards, customer buying team structures and the data center competition in Frankfurt. The customers felt confident in our team's expertise in our ability to support a highly regulated environment to meet their needs. This is yet another excellent example of our ability to listen to our customers and find ways to meet their needs. To conclude, I am incredibly proud of our dedicated team, our unmatched customer dedication and relationships and our solutions, which continue to drive our transformation and excellence. The reorganization we completed in 2022 through the initiation of Matterhorn has established a strong foundation, which is already delivering double-digit growth. It is this foundation built by Matterhorn, which will continue to fuel our growth trajectory and to realize our greatest ambitions. Turning toward 2023, this momentum will continue to drive the opportunities ahead with another year double-digit top line growth expected. Barry will speak in detail about our guidance for the year ahead. Our goals are well within sight as we climb on with Project Matterhorn and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry.\nBarry Hytinen: Thanks Bill. And thank you all for joining us today to discuss our results. Before I begin, I would like to echo Bill sentiments with regard to the tragedy of the earthquakes in Turkey and Syria. Turning to our financials in the fourth quarter, our team continued the trend of delivering strong performance exceeding expectations for both adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.28 billion grew 10.3% year-on-year or 14.2% excluding the effects of the stronger U.S. dollar. Total organic revenue grew 11.3%. Revenue was in line with the expectations we shared when we reported the third quarter in November. A key highlight in the quarter is our organic storage revenue, which grew 11% and represents a sequential improvement of 130 basis points. Total service revenue increased 17% to $510 million driven by organic growth of 12%. These results reflect the strong performance of our commercial team and their focus on selling the entire mountain range of products and solutions. Adjusted EBITDA was $472 million in new record up 10% on a reported basis and up 13% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. As compared to the rates we were using at the time of our last guidance, the dollar strengthened in November, which resulted in an incremental headwind in the fourth quarter of several million dollars to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA margin was better than we projected at 36.9% and improved 40 basis points sequentially driven by revenue management and mix. AFFO was $287 million, or $0.98 on a per share basis of $20 million and $0.06 respectively from the fourth quarter of last year. This was well ahead of our projections, partially due to the timing of a nearly $10 million cash tax item, which is now incorporated into our 2023 guidance. Now, let me briefly summarize the full year. Revenue of $5.1 billion increased 14% on a reported basis and 17% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA increased 12% year-on-year to $1.827 billion, an increase of $192 million year-on-year, exceeding the projections given on our last call. AFFO increased 10% to $1.11 billion, or $3.80 on a per share basis. I would like to briefly compare our results to our financial guidance. As we have noted throughout the year, FX rates have been more of a headwind than we had initially planned. In fact, using the same FX rates we had in our projections in February of 2022, we would have exceeded the high end of our guidance for EBITDA AFFO and AFFO per share. Now turning to segment performance. In the fourth quarter, our Global RIM business delivered revenue of $1.08 billion, an increase of $61 million from last year or 6% on a reported basis. This equates to a 10% increase excluding the effects of the stronger U.S. dollar. On an organic constant currency basis, revenue increased 11%. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $486 million, an increase of $39 million year-on-year driven by revenue management. Turning to our global data center business, we are pleased to report another successful quarter. From the total revenue perspective we delivered 15% year-on-year growth on a reported basis and 19% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. As a reminder in the second half of 2021, we provided unique fit out services for our Frankfort joint venture. In the fourth quarter of 2021 those services resulted in approximately $9 million of revenue. Excluding those fit out services on a like-for-like basis, our total data center revenue grew in excess of 27%. And we are now back to a more normalized service revenue run rate. Our data center storage revenue grew 25% year-on-year or 28% on a constant currency basis. Turning to new and expansion leasing, we completed 14 megawatts in the fourth quarter, and 139 for the full year. This is well ahead of our updated leasing projection of 130 for the full year. Excluding our large bill to suit lease in Virginia, we leased 67 megawatts for the full year. With our increasing pipeline and the depth of our customer relationships for 2023, we project leasing 80 megawatts or more for the full year. This represents 20% bookings growth. We are continuing to expand our data center platform into new markets. And as we discussed in November, we closed the Madrid data center transaction early in the fourth quarter. Turning to our asset lifecycle management business, we continue to be pleased with the results of our legacy ITAD business which grew approximately 30% for the full year. And we are happy to report that we have seen strong growth in our pipeline. For the hyperscale decommission portion of the business, we are conservatively planning the year with an expectation for continued impact from COVID-19 in China. For example, at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range, we have assumed revenue from our total ALM business is consistent year-on-year. As a reminder, the decommissioning market was performing better through the first half of 2022 and slowed down sharply following more intense lock downs in China. And as we are planning for ramping performance through the year, we anticipate the first quarter of 2023 revenue in our ALM business to be consistent with the fourth quarter of 2022. With that, we will naturally have some impact on our organic growth rate in the first two quarters of the year as we anniversary the IT renew transaction in January. Turning to capital, for the full year 2022 we invested $820 million of growth capital and $142 million of recurring. For 2023 we project capital expenditure to be approximately $850 million of growth, with the vast majority of that dedicated to datacenter development and $145 million of recurring. Turning to the balance sheet. With strong adjusted EBITDA performance, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.1 times better than our projections and an improvement versus last quarter. I think it is worth noting this marks our lowest leverage levels since 2017. As we have said before, we expect to operate within our target leverage range, which is 4.5 times to 5.5 times. For 2023 we expect to exit the year at similar levels to year end 2022. Our board of directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early April. On a trailing four quarter basis, our payout ratio is now 65% approaching our long-term target range of low to mid 60s percent. Now let me share our projections for the full year of 2023. We expect total revenue to be within the range of $5.5 billion to $5.6 billion, which represents between 8% and 10% growth year-on-year. On consistent FX rates this implies growth of 9% to 11%. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be within the range of $1.94 billion to $1.975 billion, which represents 7% year-on-year growth at the midpoint. On consistent FX rates, this implies growth of 8% at the midpoint. We expect AFFO to be within the range of $1.15 billion to $1.175 billion, which represents 5% year-on-year growth at the midpoint. On consistent FX rates, this would be 6% growth at the midpoint. We expect AFFO per share to be $3.91 to $4. This represents growth of 4% at the midpoint, and on consistent FX rates this would be 6% growth at the midpoint. Our guidance for both AFFO and AFFO per share includes the timing of the approximate $10 million cash tax item I previously mentioned from the fourth quarter of 2022 into the first quarter of 2023. This represents approximately two points of growth on both metrics. I would like to share some commentary to help investors better understand our guidance. In terms of FX we are using current rates in our projections for 2023. While the U.S. dollar has weakened some recently, we currently expect FX to be nearly a $40 million headwind to revenue for the full year. I would like to further note that at these levels FX will be a more pronounced headwind in the first half of the year. We expect revenue management will continue to be a significant benefit. And I will note the vast majority of the actions we have planned for in 2023 have already been implemented at this point. And turning to the first quarter, we expect revenue in excess of $1.3 billion, adjusted EBITDA of approximately $460 million, AFFO of approximately $270 million, and AFFO per share of approximately $0.92. To conclude, we are pleased to have delivered a strong year in 2022 and are realizing our growth ambitions that we outlined at our recent investor day. I'd like to take this opportunity to once again express my thanks to our entire team for their continued dedication, serving our customers and delivering on our collective commitments. And with that operator, will you please open the line for Q&A?\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks, good morning. Services organic revenue growth remained in the double digits at 12% year-over-year in 4Q, but decelerated from 22% growth in 3Q. Can you discuss the puts and takes you're seeing with respect to services, organic revenue growth trends?\nWilliam Meaney: Yes. No, thanks, George. So first of all, we're very pleased with the continued growth, especially where we just started Matterhorn last year. So if you look at overall in terms of the organic growth through the year and an increase in terms of total revenue growth, as we progress. So we're very pleased. To your specific question on service is one of the biggest factors in terms of when you're looking at the year-over-year comparison, if you recall, a year ago, we had the big fit-out for data center in Frankfurt. So that's the biggest factor in terms of that slight drop or that noticeable drop when you look at the year-over-year, still double-digit growth but that was the biggest factor. I don't know, Barry, if you want to add anything.\nBarry Hytinen: Yes George, the only other thing I'd add, I suppose, is that it was right in line with our expectations when we set the projections because, of course, as we signaled last quarter, we obviously knew that we had to anniversary over the fit-out services. So we're very pleased with the way services performed. And I will just tell you that as we look forward, we've got very good pipeline on things like digital solutions, our legacy IT asset disposition business is ramping, and we have as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, very nice pipeline there. And we will see some incremental benefit from revenue management. So we feel very well positioned, George. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nKevin McVeigh: Great, thanks. So it seems like FX was an incremental headwind as was ITRenew. I don't know if this is for Barry, where were the offsets? Because obviously, the revenue looked pretty good in EBITDA, but just were the offsets on the revenue management or anything else?\nBarry Hytinen: Thanks for the question, Kevin. I would say ITRenew actually performed consistent with our expectations, and I'll just provide a little more color there. As we've said before, with the lockdowns that we were experiencing or everyone is experiencing in China, we had been seeing ITRenew declining through last year. And in fact, in the fourth quarter, it stabilized was actually slightly up on a sequential basis, which we view as a positive. Now we are, I think, being prudent with our expectations for ITRenew going forward because as you've probably seen in the press, China continues to -- while the restrictions are off, they continue to have a lot of challenges with COVID there. And so we haven't seen the market develop meaningfully yet, but we are cautiously optimistic. So we are planning for the first quarter expectations for our ALM business to be consistent with the fourth quarter revenue levels and then ramping over the course of the year. As it relates to the rest of the business that you were pointing out, we had very strong contribution from revenue management, as you would have seen in the supplemental report. In fact, that ramped nicely on a sequential basis. And we feel very well positioned as it relates to revenue management as we move here through 2023 because as I mentioned in the remarks, all of our revenue management actions are essentially already in market. So we feel very, very good about how things are trending. The other thing I'd call out, which was a really nice performance was in our data center business. You saw the growth rate continue to be very strong on the storage side, high 20s and from a standpoint of bookings also ahead of our expectation. So that gives us very strong visibility into 2023 in terms of revenue generation. And I'll tell you the pipeline continues to build. So appreciate the question. Thanks, Kevin.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hey Barry. Just for the sake of precision, could you just indicate what the organic constant currency revenue growth is at the midpoint of your first quarter and 2023 guide. And it definitely seems like you're expecting faster growth for the full year kind of after first quarter or maybe compared to first quarter and just maybe go over that dynamic more unless you feel like you've already addressed that.\nBarry Hytinen: Okay. So a couple of points there for you, Andrew, as it relates to how to think about the first quarter. When I mentioned that we probably have something approaching $40 million of FX challenge for the full year, the vast majority of that is going to be in the first quarter. So I think we'll probably have something like $30-plus million, maybe even more than that of a revenue headwind from FX in the first quarter just based on where rates are now versus last year. The other thing to be thinking about is that from a standpoint of ITRenew, that will go into our organic growth rate this quarter. In fact, as you know, we closed that transaction at the end of last January. And so it's organic for February and March. And last year, I don't mind giving you this number for your modeling purposes, I may have mentioned it last year. ITRenew was about $60 million in the quarter, and then it was $65 million in the second quarter. And since I'm planning it to be essentially consistent on a sequential basis, that's about, call it, $45 million that vicinity. So I think that will have about round numbers, a couple of point impact to organic growth. But from there, if you work through the model, you're going to see organic continue to improve through the year. And really, at that point, you don't have any additional acquisition revenue of any substance in the numbers. So you're essentially very close to the constant currency growth. And I think that at that out of pencil for you on the model.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nAdam Parrington: Hi, it's Adam Parrington for Shlomo. What was the pricing lift in the quarter? And what should investors expect for 2023?\nBarry Hytinen: Thank you for the question. It was very strong, as you probably noticed. Organic revenue growth on storage was 11%. And overall, it was 11.3%. And so with volume being as we planned just slightly down on a sequential basis, by the way, up better than our projection for the full year. It was a very nice contribution, and we had 8.9% on that metric for the full year. So it shows you the ramp that we've been seeing through the year. In terms of -- for 2023, we continue to expect revenue management to be a very nice contributor and be thinking probably in at least the mid-single digit range for the whole year, if not a little bit higher in light of what we've got in market. And we feel quite good about where things are. And I guess I'll also add that from a volume perspective, since it goes a little bit to the question you were asking, from a volume perspective, we are continuing to see good trends there, and we would expect for the full year 2023 very similar projection to what we did last year. So something like consistent to slightly up. Thank you for the question.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and the Iron Mountain fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call.

            "name": "Barry Hytinen",
            "content": "Thanks Bill. And thank you all for joining us today to discuss our results. Before I begin, I would like to echo Bill sentiments with regard to the tragedy of the earthquakes in Turkey and Syria. Turning to our financials in the fourth quarter, our team continued the trend of delivering strong performance exceeding expectations for both adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.28 billion grew 10.3% year-on-year or 14.2% excluding the effects of the stronger U.S. dollar. Total organic revenue grew 11.3%. Revenue was in line with the expectations we shared when we reported the third quarter in November. A key highlight in the quarter is our organic storage revenue, which grew 11% and represents a sequential improvement of 130 basis points. Total service revenue increased 17% to $510 million driven by organic growth of 12%. These results reflect the strong performance of our commercial team and their focus on selling the entire mountain range of products and solutions. Adjusted EBITDA was $472 million in new record up 10% on a reported basis and up 13% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. As compared to the rates we were using at the time of our last guidance, the dollar strengthened in November, which resulted in an incremental headwind in the fourth quarter of several million dollars to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA margin was better than we projected at 36.9% and improved 40 basis points sequentially driven by revenue management and mix. AFFO was $287 million, or $0.98 on a per share basis of $20 million and $0.06 respectively from the fourth quarter of last year. This was well ahead of our projections, partially due to the timing of a nearly $10 million cash tax item, which is now incorporated into our 2023 guidance. Now, let me briefly summarize the full year. Revenue of $5.1 billion increased 14% on a reported basis and 17% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA increased 12% year-on-year to $1.827 billion, an increase of $192 million year-on-year, exceeding the projections given on our last call. AFFO increased 10% to $1.11 billion, or $3.80 on a per share basis. I would like to briefly compare our results to our financial guidance. As we have noted throughout the year, FX rates have been more of a headwind than we had initially planned. In fact, using the same FX rates we had in our projections in February of 2022, we would have exceeded the high end of our guidance for EBITDA AFFO and AFFO per share. Now turning to segment performance. In the fourth quarter, our Global RIM business delivered revenue of $1.08 billion, an increase of $61 million from last year or 6% on a reported basis. This equates to a 10% increase excluding the effects of the stronger U.S. dollar. On an organic constant currency basis, revenue increased 11%. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $486 million, an increase of $39 million year-on-year driven by revenue management. Turning to our global data center business, we are pleased to report another successful quarter. From the total revenue perspective we delivered 15% year-on-year growth on a reported basis and 19% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. As a reminder in the second half of 2021, we provided unique fit out services for our Frankfort joint venture. In the fourth quarter of 2021 those services resulted in approximately $9 million of revenue. Excluding those fit out services on a like-for-like basis, our total data center revenue grew in excess of 27%. And we are now back to a more normalized service revenue run rate. Our data center storage revenue grew 25% year-on-year or 28% on a constant currency basis. Turning to new and expansion leasing, we completed 14 megawatts in the fourth quarter, and 139 for the full year. This is well ahead of our updated leasing projection of 130 for the full year. Excluding our large bill to suit lease in Virginia, we leased 67 megawatts for the full year. With our increasing pipeline and the depth of our customer relationships for 2023, we project leasing 80 megawatts or more for the full year. This represents 20% bookings growth. We are continuing to expand our data center platform into new markets. And as we discussed in November, we closed the Madrid data center transaction early in the fourth quarter. Turning to our asset lifecycle management business, we continue to be pleased with the results of our legacy ITAD business which grew approximately 30% for the full year. And we are happy to report that we have seen strong growth in our pipeline. For the hyperscale decommission portion of the business, we are conservatively planning the year with an expectation for continued impact from COVID-19 in China. For example, at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range, we have assumed revenue from our total ALM business is consistent year-on-year. As a reminder, the decommissioning market was performing better through the first half of 2022 and slowed down sharply following more intense lock downs in China. And as we are planning for ramping performance through the year, we anticipate the first quarter of 2023 revenue in our ALM business to be consistent with the fourth quarter of 2022. With that, we will naturally have some impact on our organic growth rate in the first two quarters of the year as we anniversary the IT renew transaction in January. Turning to capital, for the full year 2022 we invested $820 million of growth capital and $142 million of recurring. For 2023 we project capital expenditure to be approximately $850 million of growth, with the vast majority of that dedicated to datacenter development and $145 million of recurring. Turning to the balance sheet. With strong adjusted EBITDA performance, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.1 times better than our projections and an improvement versus last quarter. I think it is worth noting this marks our lowest leverage levels since 2017. As we have said before, we expect to operate within our target leverage range, which is 4.5 times to 5.5 times. For 2023 we expect to exit the year at similar levels to year end 2022. Our board of directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early April. On a trailing four quarter basis, our payout ratio is now 65% approaching our long-term target range of low to mid 60s percent. Now let me share our projections for the full year of 2023. We expect total revenue to be within the range of $5.5 billion to $5.6 billion, which represents between 8% and 10% growth year-on-year. On consistent FX rates this implies growth of 9% to 11%. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be within the range of $1.94 billion to $1.975 billion, which represents 7% year-on-year growth at the midpoint. On consistent FX rates, this implies growth of 8% at the midpoint. We expect AFFO to be within the range of $1.15 billion to $1.175 billion, which represents 5% year-on-year growth at the midpoint. On consistent FX rates, this would be 6% growth at the midpoint. We expect AFFO per share to be $3.91 to $4. This represents growth of 4% at the midpoint, and on consistent FX rates this would be 6% growth at the midpoint. Our guidance for both AFFO and AFFO per share includes the timing of the approximate $10 million cash tax item I previously mentioned from the fourth quarter of 2022 into the first quarter of 2023. This represents approximately two points of growth on both metrics. I would like to share some commentary to help investors better understand our guidance. In terms of FX we are using current rates in our projections for 2023. While the U.S. dollar has weakened some recently, we currently expect FX to be nearly a $40 million headwind to revenue for the full year. I would like to further note that at these levels FX will be a more pronounced headwind in the first half of the year. We expect revenue management will continue to be a significant benefit. And I will note the vast majority of the actions we have planned for in 2023 have already been implemented at this point. And turning to the first quarter, we expect revenue in excess of $1.3 billion, adjusted EBITDA of approximately $460 million, AFFO of approximately $270 million, and AFFO per share of approximately $0.92. To conclude, we are pleased to have delivered a strong year in 2022 and are realizing our growth ambitions that we outlined at our recent investor day. I'd like to take this opportunity to once again express my thanks to our entire team for their continued dedication, serving our customers and delivering on our collective commitments. And with that operator, will you please open the line for Q&A? Yes George, the only other thing I'd add, I suppose, is that it was right in line with our expectations when we set the projections because, of course, as we signaled last quarter, we obviously knew that we had to anniversary over the fit-out services. So we're very pleased with the way services performed. And I will just tell you that as we look forward, we've got very good pipeline on things like digital solutions, our legacy IT asset disposition business is ramping, and we have as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, very nice pipeline there. And we will see some incremental benefit from revenue management. So we feel very well positioned, George. Thanks for the question. Thanks for the question, Kevin. I would say ITRenew actually performed consistent with our expectations, and I'll just provide a little more color there. As we've said before, with the lockdowns that we were experiencing or everyone is experiencing in China, we had been seeing ITRenew declining through last year. And in fact, in the fourth quarter, it stabilized was actually slightly up on a sequential basis, which we view as a positive. Now we are, I think, being prudent with our expectations for ITRenew going forward because as you've probably seen in the press, China continues to -- while the restrictions are off, they continue to have a lot of challenges with COVID there. And so we haven't seen the market develop meaningfully yet, but we are cautiously optimistic. So we are planning for the first quarter expectations for our ALM business to be consistent with the fourth quarter revenue levels and then ramping over the course of the year. As it relates to the rest of the business that you were pointing out, we had very strong contribution from revenue management, as you would have seen in the supplemental report. In fact, that ramped nicely on a sequential basis. And we feel very well positioned as it relates to revenue management as we move here through 2023 because as I mentioned in the remarks, all of our revenue management actions are essentially already in market. So we feel very, very good about how things are trending. The other thing I'd call out, which was a really nice performance was in our data center business. You saw the growth rate continue to be very strong on the storage side, high 20s and from a standpoint of bookings also ahead of our expectation. So that gives us very strong visibility into 2023 in terms of revenue generation. And I'll tell you the pipeline continues to build. So appreciate the question. Thanks, Kevin. Okay. So a couple of points there for you, Andrew, as it relates to how to think about the first quarter. When I mentioned that we probably have something approaching $40 million of FX challenge for the full year, the vast majority of that is going to be in the first quarter. So I think we'll probably have something like $30-plus million, maybe even more than that of a revenue headwind from FX in the first quarter just based on where rates are now versus last year. The other thing to be thinking about is that from a standpoint of ITRenew, that will go into our organic growth rate this quarter. In fact, as you know, we closed that transaction at the end of last January. And so it's organic for February and March. And last year, I don't mind giving you this number for your modeling purposes, I may have mentioned it last year. ITRenew was about $60 million in the quarter, and then it was $65 million in the second quarter. And since I'm planning it to be essentially consistent on a sequential basis, that's about, call it, $45 million that vicinity. So I think that will have about round numbers, a couple of point impact to organic growth. But from there, if you work through the model, you're going to see organic continue to improve through the year. And really, at that point, you don't have any additional acquisition revenue of any substance in the numbers. So you're essentially very close to the constant currency growth. And I think that at that out of pencil for you on the model. Thank you for the question. It was very strong, as you probably noticed. Organic revenue growth on storage was 11%. And overall, it was 11.3%. And so with volume being as we planned just slightly down on a sequential basis, by the way, up better than our projection for the full year. It was a very nice contribution, and we had 8.9% on that metric for the full year. So it shows you the ramp that we've been seeing through the year. In terms of -- for 2023, we continue to expect revenue management to be a very nice contributor and be thinking probably in at least the mid-single digit range for the whole year, if not a little bit higher in light of what we've got in market. And we feel quite good about where things are. And I guess I'll also add that from a volume perspective, since it goes a little bit to the question you were asking, from a volume perspective, we are continuing to see good trends there, and we would expect for the full year 2023 very similar projection to what we did last year. So something like consistent to slightly up. Thank you for the question."

            "content": "Thank you, Julian. And thank you all for taking the time to join us today. We are pleased to have delivered record performance for both the fourth quarter and the full year. These exceptional results are reflective of our broad product portfolio, synergistic business model, deep customer relationships, and committed team. Before I dive into the drivers of our strong performance, I would like to take a few moments to relay how deeply saddened we are all feeling by the devastating and recent earthquakes in Turkey and Syria. Our thoughts and prayers are with our fellow mountaineers, customers and all of their families living and working in the region. The safety and security of our employees is our number one priority. And we are committed to supporting our colleagues in the region as they navigate this challenging time. Now let me begin our discussion of our recent performance. I am proud to report that Iron Mountain has had another outstanding year. In the fourth quarter we achieved quarterly revenue of $1.28 billion yielding 11.3% total organic revenue growth and record adjusted EBITDA $472 million up 10%. For the full year, we delivered record results across the board. Revenue of $5.1 billion adjusted EBITDA of $1.8 billion, and AFFO of $1.1 billion, representing growth of 14% 12% and 10%, respectively. This performance is a direct result of our close relationships with our customers and our commitment to innovation so we can provide them with expanded products and services to meet their needs. For the full year, we delivered organic storage rental revenue growth of 9%, reflecting continued benefit of pricing combined with positive volume trends. We drove double digit organic growth in our data center business, as well as our digital services and asset lifecycle management business areas capping off another excellent year. Our continued drive to build an ever-expanding suite of synergistic and customer centric solutions, together with global reach and scale fuels our accelerated growth consistent with the Matterhorn Excellence model we unveiled last autumn. Let me share a few examples of how we've been enabling our customer's success and growth through the diverse solutions and unmatched customer service we offer. Beginning with our records management business report, we reported a substantial cross sell win with a large non-profit healthcare provider, which has been an Iron Mountain customer for more than 20 years. The win resulted in a new 10-year contract covering records management, ALM, data management, secure storage of non-records and document digitization services taking this customer from $2.5 million per year to $5 million annually. Just a few years ago, we would have been able unable to provide such a broad range of services and solutions to this long tenured customer. Today, with our broad offerings we not only cross sold the new services and solutions, but we increased our share of wallet for our records management services and solidified our position as a trusted and strategic partner. We also provided a solution for a large U.S. Bank to develop a simple and cost effective process to manage its vast inventory of over 24 million mortgage files. This partnership involves meeting stringent compliance obligations, mitigating risk and reducing cost. Also in the quarter we want new business serving the Australian Government. Through this work, we will drive considerable cost savings to one of Australia's largest government agencies. Iron Mountain will have a dedicated team to pack, enter data and transport 375,000 cartons to our new facility in Melbourne. In Digital Solutions, a key win I would like to highlight is with a branch of the U.S. federal government. As a result of the enormous success of our original project with the customer to digitize 177,000 reels of microfilm in less than the prescribed year, we have executed a sole source follow on contract to digitize another 133,000 reels of microfilm. This win is the result of the strategic development of a best-in-breed AI machine learning solution to auto classify and automate data capture. In addition, we worked with a large global medical equipment and electronics manufacturer to navigate an extensive global medical product recall. The customer needed an efficient partner to assist with the recall in order to meet regulatory requirements and avoid further legal ramifications. The customer also required rapid response and tight turnaround times and was seeking a single partner. The win includes several service offerings delivered by a single point of contact and illustrates the early success of our new commercial operating model that we introduced with Project Matterhorn. Turning to ALM, another noteworthy win this quarter was with a health insurance provider, which selected Iron Mountain as its dedicated asset lifecycle management partner. Due to the unique nature of their business, the customer has constant attrition throughout the course of the year, and consequently, they were seeking a dedicated ALM partner to provide collection, wiping, imaging, secure storage and redeployment of technology assets. The customers previous positive experience with Iron Mountain and our team, combined with our strong solutions led to mutual success. Our services resolve the challenges around collection, ease of use, and reporting and tracking. This illustrates our commercial team strength and ability to cross sell our set of solutions across the mountain range. And is another example of our increased focus and success in driving commercial engagement is part of our Matterhorn Klein. Moreover, we are especially proud to say that we renewed our largest ALM contract this quarter. This is the fourth contract renewal with this client, one of the largest technology companies in the world. We have worked with them for the past 12 years and are proud of this relationship, the continuation of which demonstrates the potential for longevity in this area of our business. We continue to be excited and encouraged by the total addressable market in the asset lifecycle management category. Despite the headwinds we have faced this year as a result of enduring COVID-19 lockdowns in China. In spite of this, our legacy ITAD business continues to perform well and as we gain momentum on our Matterhorn Klein, we continue to focus on moves to accelerate this growth. Finally, turning to our data center business, we are pleased to have finished the year with 139 megawatts of new leases signed exceeding our original booking guidance of 50 megawatts and our most recent target expressed in the third quarter of 130 megawatts. In the fourth quarter, we successfully completed 14 megawatts of leasing. This area of our business has gone from strength to strength over the past several years, and we continue to see tremendous opportunity in serving both hyperscale and colocation customers, and significant growth potential for our data center footprint. With 37% year-on-year bookings growth, excluding our large lease in Virginia 4, 5 we will continue to prioritize data centers with our capital program, more details of which Barry will provide in his remarks. One customer win in our data center business that I would like to share is a six megawatt expansion lease at our Phoenix campus with an existing Global Fortune 100 customer. The customer which has a long-term strategic relationship with Iron Mountain across service lines, and has existing capacity in several of our other locations needed space to expand in Arizona. Our customer was able to leverage our Phoenix data center for their expansion, and we look forward to supporting them in their future growth. Also in the quarter, our team announced a win for our joint venture at the Mumbai-2 data center, which is connected to our Mumbai-1 data center one of the most robust carrier hotels in the country, providing superb connectivity and flexibility for our customers. We partnered with a global content delivery network company to expand their presence in Mumbai. They required a robust network ecosystem backed by reliable power infrastructure, which we were able to provide. Another win to highlight our ability to cross sell across business segments involves our existing relationship with one of the largest German banks. This resulted in a new partnership with our data center team who leveraged their excellent network within the German Financial Network market and demonstrated proficiency and its high regulatory standards, customer buying team structures and the data center competition in Frankfurt. The customers felt confident in our team's expertise in our ability to support a highly regulated environment to meet their needs. This is yet another excellent example of our ability to listen to our customers and find ways to meet their needs. To conclude, I am incredibly proud of our dedicated team, our unmatched customer dedication and relationships and our solutions, which continue to drive our transformation and excellence. The reorganization we completed in 2022 through the initiation of Matterhorn has established a strong foundation, which is already delivering double-digit growth. It is this foundation built by Matterhorn, which will continue to fuel our growth trajectory and to realize our greatest ambitions. Turning toward 2023, this momentum will continue to drive the opportunities ahead with another year double-digit top line growth expected. Barry will speak in detail about our guidance for the year ahead. Our goals are well within sight as we climb on with Project Matterhorn and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry."

With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Meany: Thank you Gillian, and we appreciate everyone taking the time to join us for our third quarter results.  We are pleased to share with you another outstanding quarter, representing the durability and growth of our business model as we continue to navigate successfully through significant headwinds, including the strength of the U.S. dollar, COVID shutdowns in China, and ongoing global tensions. Our team of 25,000 dedicated Mountaineers continues to empower our customers with solutions to enable them to transform their businesses. In the third quarter on a reported basis, we delivered revenue of $1.29 billion, representing 14% total organic revenue growth. We are pleased to have achieved all time record adjusted EBITDA of $469 million. Since last year, the U.S. dollar has strengthened significantly, and excluding its impact on a like-for-like basis, this quarter our revenue was approximately $1.33 billion and EBITDA was $484 million, representing growth of 18% and 16% respectively. These results demonstrate the inherent growth and strength of our business and are further proof of why we continue to be so encouraged by the increased demand for our services across the markets in which we operate. Positive volume and revenue management trends continued to benefit us this quarter, as reflected in our organic storage rental revenue growth of 9.7%.  As we shared with you in September at our investor event, we are executing well on our new Project Matterhorn operating model, the next transformational phase of Iron Mountain\u2019s growth journey. Building off an already solid foundation, we believe Matterhorn is a cornerstone initiative that will allow us to maintain and capitalize on the positive momentum we have seen over the last several quarters.  Through our fully funded plan\u2019s ability to invest 16% of revenue over the next four years, we believe we will further strengthen Iron Mountain as a market leader across our expanded total addressable market, our diversified global footprint, and our enhanced suite of innovative solutions. Our strong double-digit organic growth is evidence of the early progress we are making on our initiatives, which gives us the momentum and confidence in our ability to deliver higher levels of profitable growth over the next several years.  Now I\u2019d like to share a few highlights of some recent customer wins while lie beneath the top and bottom line growth. Turning to our digital solutions business, we helped a global European bank evolve to a paperless branch experience to drive enhanced customer service with 360-degree customer data, traceable and audible digital records, and reduced manual efforts for their tellers. The customer has a footprint of more than 400 branches in the U.S. with each branch storing decades\u2019 worth of customer records on premises. We are partnering with the bank to digitize all customer records across their U.S. branches in under a year.  The files will be securing transferred and imaged at Iron Mountain digital supercenters indexing and tagged with critical metadata using machine learning and then placed into Insight, Iron Mountain\u2019s digital repository. Insight will be provided to over 3,500 tellers across the bank to access these digitized customer records quickly and securely. This win is just one example of how we are helping our customers evolve their businesses through digitization, resulting in quicker, easier and more secure access to their most important information for years to come. Also in digital solutions, we won a contract with a state court in Brazil from an incumbent provider. To comply with the Brazilian National Council of Justice\u2019s 100% Digital initiative, all state courts are required to convert active lawsuit documents from physical to digital by 2023. As such, they turned to Iron Mountain for help to implement and complete the conversion process within the mandated time frame whilst adhering to specific quality requirements. Whilst this is in and of itself a terrific win, we are currently exploring further opportunities with this customer. Moving to our asset life cycle management segment, I\u2019d like to share an innovative win this quarter. Our strong existing relationships and coordinated efforts led to a large asset life cycle management win to serve 700 locations in the United States and Canada for a large healthcare company. Prior to the deal, the customer had primarily engaged with us through our records business. The first phase of the partnership included retrieval of IT equipment and plans for a forthcoming data center refresh. We expect to process more than 13,000 assets in the first year. Moving onto the impact of COVID shutdowns in China on the ITRenew business, we see continued constraints in the downstream demand for recycled IT components. As a result, we expect to see similar levels of ITRenew sell-through in Q4 as in Q3. With the continued increase of the backlog of components, we remain bullish on the prospects for the business once the situation normalizes.  In our fine arts business, we are pleased to highlight a win with an internationally renowned art museum. The customer turned to our team to assist them with multiple onsite projects related to renovations the museum will undergo throughout a three-year period. Lacking the internal resources to staff these projects, they were seeking a trusted partner to support them providing additional art handling services. By leveraging our experience and successful track record of prior engagements with the customer, we were able to offer a compelling proposal that secured this very exciting initiative. In the quarter, this business grew by 17% year-over-year, which is a reflection of the strong underlying business.  Shifting to the data center business, we are pleased to have booked 7 megawatts of leasing in this quarter, bringing total bookings year-to-date to 125 megawatts. As a result, we expect to exceed our previous projection of 130 megawatts for new leases for the year.  One of the wins this quarter included a cross-sell deal with a large non-profit community health provider that needed to close down their internal data center and establish a disaster recovery site. As a long-term taped backup and records management customer of Iron Mountain, they reached out to their account team, who engaged with our data center team. As a result, the customer signed a co-location contract which included internet services and multiple cross-connects within 45 days. The convenience of having a single provider for all their physical and digital storage needs was a critical selling point in addition to Iron Mountain\u2019s rigorous data center compliance program, which is essential for the customer given the highly regulated market in which they operate. Our team\u2019s flexibility and willingness to collaborate across divisions to customize solutions for our customer provides a superior experience and ultimately is what made us stand out as their partner of choice. From a development perspective, as discussed in September at our investor event, we have continued to build our land bank in key strategic markets to support future growth with several notable expansion deals. As previously announced, we have added buildable capacity in the Phoenix, Arizona market with the purchase of adjacent land to our existing campus. Based on current design plans, the parcel can support 36 megawatts and includes a 56 MVA substation on site. This is an important expansion in this dynamic market as our current campus at 89 megawatts is nearly fully leased and/or committed. We also expanded our footprint in India with the securing of land and power for 20 megawatts of additional capacity in Mumbai. We remain excited about the growth potential in this strategic emerging market both for our data center business, as well for the enterprise as a whole. In total, we currently have 52 megawatts of buildable capacity across five markets in India. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we acquired a data center campus in Madrid, Spain, marking our entry into the Iberian market. The asset is a uniquely scaled data center campus with an existing 3 megawatt building and fully permitted expansion potential of 79 megawatts. We view Madrid as a very important European market as it is poised to capture significant growth from supply-constrained markets. With these additions to our portfolio, our total capacity is now nearly 670 megawatts.  The wins I\u2019ve shared with you today demonstrate the breadth and depth of our business, our focus on customer centricity and providing innovative, transformation solutions, and the strength of our global commercial platform driven by our Matterhorn initiative. I am very proud of our outstanding team who are the bedrock of our company and the way in which we come together to drive and deliver our growth journey. Our business model is highly profitable, our pipeline is strong, our vision is clear, and we continue to climb on. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Barry.\nBarry Hytinen: Thanks Bill, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our results. In the third quarter, our team delivered solid performance, meeting top line projections while exceeding expectations for both EBITDA and AFFO. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.29 billion grew 14% year-on-year, or 18% excluding the effects of the stronger U.S. dollar. A key highlight in the quarter is our organic storage revenue, which grew 9.7% and represents a sequential improvement of 150 basis points. Total service revenue increased 28% to $527 million, driven by organic growth of 22%. These results reflect the strong performance of our commercial team and their laser focus on selling the full suite of products and solutions across our portfolio. Adjusted EBITDA was $469 million, up 12% on a reported basis and up over 16% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. As the dollar strengthened significantly since the time of our last call, I think it will be helpful to provide a bit more context. As compared to the rates we were using in August, the stronger dollar resulted in an incremental headwind in the third quarter of approximately $10 million to revenue and $3 million to EBITDA. Under the same FX rates we were using in our August projection, third quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA would have been approximately $1.3 billion and $472 million respectively. Adjusted EBITDA margin was better than we projected and improved 120 basis points sequentially, driven by revenue management and mix.  AFFO was $288 million or $0.98 on a per-share basis, up $25 million and $0.08 respectively from the third quarter of last year. Due to the strengthening dollar, there was an approximate $3 million impact to AFFO versus the rates we used in our August projection. Now turning to segment performance, in the third quarter our global RIM business delivered revenue of $1.1 billion, an increase of $93 million from last year or 9% on a reported basis. On an organic constant currency basis, revenue increased 14%. In the third quarter, our team continued to drive accelerating organic growth both in storage and services. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $484 million, an increase of $48 million year-on-year. Turning to our global data center business, we are pleased to report another successful quarter. Our data center storage revenue grew 33% year-on-year. On a total revenue basis, we delivered 13% year-on-year growth. Now as a reminder, in the second half of 2021, we provided unique fit-out services for our Frankfurt joint venture. In the third quarter of 2021, those services resulted in approximately $14 million of revenue. Excluding those fit-out services, on a like-for-like basis our total data center revenue grew in excess of 30%.  We completed 7 megawatts of new and expansion leasing, and with the strength of our expanding pipeline, we now expect to exceed our leasing projection of 130 megawatts for the full year. As Bill detailed earlier, we are continuing to expand our data center platform into new markets. We closed the Madrid data center transaction early in the fourth quarter for an initial purchase price of $78 million, which is subject to an additional $10 million earn-out. Turning to corporate and other, revenue increased 22% on an organic basis and nearly 120% in total, driven by our ALM business and continued strength in fine arts. Within ALM, our organic IT asset disposition business continued on its strong trajectory, growing in excess of 20% year-on-year. Turning to ITRenew, revenue was down sequentially, as we projected on our last call. The business was $5 million below that projection as the lockdowns in China persisted throughout the quarter. We are projecting revenue levels for our total ALM business in the fourth quarter to be consistent with the third quarter. Turning to capital, total expenditures were $309 billion in the third quarter. We deployed $270 million of growth capex and $39 million of recurring.  Turning to the balance sheet, with strong EBITDA performance we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.2 times, an improvement versus last quarter, and I think it is worth noting this marked our lowest leverage level since 2017. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term range of 4.5 to 5.5 times, and we now expect to exit the year at 5.2 times.  Our board of directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early January. On a trailing four-quarter basis, our payout ratio is now 66%, approaching our long-term target range of low to mid 60s percent. Now let me share our projections for the fourth quarter, which incorporate recent FX rates.  We expect total revenue to be approximately $1.3 billion, which represents 12% growth year-on-year. This would be a high teens growth rate on a constant currency basis. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $470 million in the fourth quarter, which represents 9% year-on-year growth, including the negative impact of FX. We expect AFFO to be approximately $280 million, which is $0.94 on a per-share basis. As FX rates have moved significantly both this year and in the most recent quarter, we feel it would be helpful to provide a bit more context. With the FX rates that we used at the time of our August earnings release, our projections for the fourth quarter would be revenue in excess of $1.32 billion, EBITDA of approximately $480 million, AFFO of approximately $290 million, and AFFO per share of approximately $0.97. As compared to our full year guidance ranges, with our year-to-date performance and our fourth quarter projection, revenue is at the low end and adjusted EBITDA is at the midpoint. I would like to highlight that on the same FX rates we were using at the start of the year, we estimate our full-year revenue would be in excess of the midpoint of our range and adjusted EBITDA would be beyond the high end of our range. To conclude, our results reflect the strength of our business model and our teams\u2019 collective execution and focus on growth and operating leverage. I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank our entire team for their strong performance and our drive to achieve our ambitions. With that, Operator, please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, thank you for taking my question.  You mentioned last quarter that you were talking about doing a third quarter pricing increase, and it\u2019s usually something that happens, I think, more at the end of the year. Could you give us a little bit more color around the success of your ability to put through some more pricing and its implications for 2023?\nBarry Hytinen: Okay, thanks Shlomo - this is Barry. Appreciate the question. We did put in place those revenue management actions we talked about on the last call, so those went into effect in September and you see that beginning in the quarter to take hold in the results. As you would have noted, the implied growth from revenue management, it accelerated in the quarter and that\u2019s been ramping through the year, so think on our global RIM business, it was probably in the 6.5 range - that\u2019s up from about 5 earlier in the year and making steady progress. I would expect in light of the macro environment and the reception that we\u2019ve been seeing with respect to revenue management activities, that that would--we would continue naturally to be at this level as we move into 2023, so we are preparing similar revenue management actions going forward and the reception has been consistent with what we\u2019ve seen over many years. I think it demonstrates the value that we\u2019re driving for our customers. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nKevin McVeigh: Great, thanks so much. Barry, can you just--I just want to make sure I have the numbers on ITRenew. How much is in the full year guidance versus where you initially guided, and was the offset the data center deal or--because obviously you\u2019re maintaining despite, it sounds like, a little bit of run-off in IT and FX. Where\u2019s the offset on the guidance?\nBarry Hytinen: Okay, thanks Kevin, good morning. Thanks for the questions. On ITRenew, we certainly, as we\u2019ve said throughout the year, been experiencing challenges, like so many other companies that sell into China. With the COVID lockdowns that have persisted and then at one level or another throughout the second half and really throughout the year, that has been a challenge as it relates to our revenue, as Bill and I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we\u2019ve assumed that ITRenew will be and total ALM business will be pretty consistent third quarter and fourth quarter at this level. In total, ITRenew was of the order of about $45 million of revenue in the third quarter, and that was, as I said in the prepared remarks, down about $5 million, $6 million from the projection we were using at that time. Thanks for the call-out as it relates to the total business continuing to perform well.  You mentioned the data center deal - just to be clear, that business is only 3 megawatts today, so that is not a driver of revenue performance in the fourth quarter at all, although we are really bullish on that opportunity because Madrid is a market that we\u2019ve wanted to play in for some time and it\u2019s a unique market, as I\u2019m sure you know, from the standpoint of where it is with the energy grid. It\u2019s not constrained like so many other markets in Europe, and we think it is, as a market, one that has considerable opportunity. Our pipeline there is quite good, so we\u2019ll be developing that site and we feel really good about the asset. In terms of the fourth quarter and our ability to continue to deliver strong growth, that\u2019s a testament to our teams\u2019 strong performance across our operations, so in our global records business we\u2019ll continue to see benefit from revenue management, as I mentioned. We\u2019ve had very strong services performance, and we continue to see a ramping business in our data center. Thanks so much for the question, Kevin.\nOperator: Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning.  Wanted to drill into the services revenue performance. The growth was very strong in the quarter, up 22% organically. I wanted to see what the sustainability of the drivers are, if you could talk a little bit about contributions from the growth portfolio, particularly digital services, overall services revenue growth, and any other factors such as paper prices or traditional service trends that might impact the outlook for services revenue performance. Thank you.\nBill Meany: Thanks George for the question. We feel really good, as you would have noted, that over the last number of quarters, we\u2019ve been consistently showing north of 20% growth both on our IT disposal business - you know, the traditional part or the organic portion of our asset life cycle management business has consistently been 20% or better, and our digital service business continues to go from strength to strength again, north of 20%. Those are really two of the key drivers driving that overall level of service growth. If anything, we see in both of those areas, the interest in customers, whether it\u2019s helping them at the end-of-life in some of their assets, make sure that it is destroyed in a way that\u2019s secure, or in the digital service business, we see more and more customer interest and actually customer contracting on us helping them with their digital transformation. I think the current environment, we see more rather than less of both of those things, so we feel really good about being able to maintain that kind of level of growth, which is all part of the Matterhorn project that we outlined at our investor event a few weeks ago, that when you put it all together, it drives what we see over the next coming years - you know, consistent growth rates that turn into a CAGR of 10% or better.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nEric Luebchow: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I could, and probably both for Barry. Just wanted to return to your investor day from September. Maybe you could give us a little color - the $450 million of cash costs you expect to incur over three years as part of Matterhorn, a little more insight into what those costs are, where they\u2019ll be spent to help drive some of the growth rates you laid out longer term. Then secondly, just as you think about capital allocation, if you could talk about you funding plans to achieve the longer term capex guide. I know your long-term debt yields are above 7% today, and obviously the forward curve on short term rates continues to march higher, so just wondering how you\u2019re thinking about managing fixed to floating mix as you fund your elevated data center capex pipeline. Thank you. \nBarry Hytinen: Okay, thank you Eric for the questions. A couple of ones in there.  On Matterhorn, the costs that we spoke about, as you know, we\u2019re moving to a new operating model that Bill just touched on briefly, that being with a global commercial organization, also a global operations function. In those cases, that is a pretty substantial change for us in terms of the way we go to market. On the commercial side, it\u2019s really putting together an organization that is singularly focused on serving our customers on a solution basis and really developing a tremendous amount of excellence around all things commercial.  Then, we are also constructing a global operations function which is meant to serve our customers effectively and drive significant customer satisfaction and high quality service, while also creating and furthering the shared services backbone that we have to support the entire organization. As well, we are moving to a business unit function, that being, as we discussed at the investor day event, storage and asset life cycle management and data center, as you know, so those are pretty substantial changes. We think of it, as Bill mentioned, as a transformation, and with that, probably about one-third of those costs, Eric, will be maybe slightly less, will be specific to enablement to align and transform into that commercial operating function. Then the bulk of the cost will be around in fact transforming the broader operating model, which would include costs that you would expect with respect to that kind of transformation, including activities such as restructuring and furthering our transformation. Thanks for that question. I guess I\u2019ll just note, as I said at the investor event, we would expect to be approaching the run rate of that level in the fourth quarter as we continue to move into the Matterhorn model, as Bill mentioned in his prepared remarks. In terms of the funding plan, I appreciate that question as well. Just as a highlight for those that weren\u2019t able to join the investor meeting, we noted that we expect a five-year revenue CAGR of 10% and a five-year EBITDA CAGR of 10%, AFFO of 8%, and that equates to AFFO per share of, let\u2019s say, 7%, as we said in our slides this morning. With that, it\u2019s a fully funded capital plan through EBITDA expansion and leverage within our target range. You note that rates have moved up recently, and I\u2019ll just note that with--we consider ourselves in a very good position. We have $1.5 billion of liquidity and we\u2019re about 80% fixed, as you know, Eric, and so from time to time, we will continue to term out debt but in light of the very good position we\u2019re in with respect to availability on our revolver and the lowest levels of leverage we\u2019ve experienced since 2017, we can really pick our timing as it relates to that over time, so we will be funding through expansion of EBITDA and leverage within our target range.  I appreciate the questions, Eric. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Wendy Ma with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nWendy Ma: Good morning everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. For 3Q, the leasing of data centers seemed a little bit softer compared to historical levels. Could you please talk about the demand trends in your key markets given the current slowing down economic environment, and also, how should we think about the leasing activity maybe heading into 2023? Thanks.\nBill Meany: Good morning Wendy, thanks for the question. We remain really excited and very bullish about our data center businesses. As we said, if you look at--you know, we\u2019ll exceed the 130 megawatts that we had laid out or forecasted on our last call, so we continue to build past that and we see similar momentum as we go into next year, so we don\u2019t see any change in terms of our pipeline that turns into leasing activity as we start approaching 2023.  We continue--there\u2019s always a little bit of lumpiness because these are fairly large contracts when you look at quarter to quarter, but we see continued strength and momentum as we go into next year. I think we are also in key markets - that\u2019s why we\u2019ve expanded in Phoenix, where I mentioned that we\u2019re pretty much fully leased or committed on our current campus in Phoenix, and we\u2019ve expanded there. As Barry mentioned, whilst there is 3 megawatts that comes with the north of 70 megawatts of capacity that we\u2019ve purchased in the Iberian Peninsula, specifically in Madrid, is that comes with a pipeline of activity because we\u2019ve been clearly speaking to our customers and anticipating that move. We continue to see that we\u2019re going from strength to strength in that business and building really strong momentum as we go into 2023.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Steinerman : Hi. Barry, when talking about the fourth quarter revenue guide of $1.3 billion, could you tell us how that shakes out in terms of organic constant currency revenue growth, and if you could make a comment between storage and service?\nBarry Hytinen: Sure. Hi Andrew, good morning, and thanks for the questions. When we look at the fourth quarter revenue rate, that being of the order of high teens growth on a constant currency basis, and something of the order of 17%, 18%, so very strong continuation of trend. I\u2019ll note that that\u2019s basically the rate we\u2019ve been running at through the year, so it\u2019s a very good continuation of trend. From the standpoint of storage and services, as Bill mentioned in response to one of the earlier questions, our services business continues to go from strength to strength. That\u2019s thanks to things like our digital solutions and our historic IT asset disposition business, which is growing in excess of 20% - I think 25% in the most recent quarter, very strong performance. We view many of our businesses as playing in markets that are quite large, growing secularly at double-digit rates, and that we expect to continue to take market share in, so for the fourth quarter, you should expect continued strong performance from both storage and services throughout the business. The only thing I would further underline is that for ITRenew and ALM in general, we\u2019ve assumed it would be consistent on a sequential basis, so you can work into the organic if you\u2019d like from that.  Thank you for the question.\nOperator: Again, if you\u2019d like to ask a question, please press star then one. Our next question comes from Brendan Lynch with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrendan Lynch: Good morning, thanks for taking my question.  I wanted to just dig in a little bit on your power cost exposure for the DC business. I believe you\u2019re largely hedged, but maybe you could just give us a bit of color on how you hedged for this exposure and what the order of magnitude is that you expect for costs to go up for your customers specifically. Thank you.\nBarry Hytinen: Okay, maybe I\u2019ll take the first part of that, and if Bill wants to add, he can. Thank you Brendan for the question, and appreciate those points that you\u2019re asking about. I think our team has done quite an effective job with respect to hedging and getting us into a place where we\u2019re in a very good position as we work into 2023 as it relates to power. To give you a sense, Brendan, obviously this is a little bit based on forecast of next year, but we estimate that we were in excess of 95% locked in terms of pricing at this point for power; in fact, it\u2019s probably closer to 99%.  I would say the other important point is when you look at our customer base, we have the ability to directly pass power pricing onto roughly 90% of the customers, and that\u2019s either through pass-through or surcharge, for example to retail customers, and in many cases that\u2019s month to month as we\u2019ve highlighted before. For those that we don\u2019t have that direct ability, of course we have the ability to adjust pricing on renewals, and that\u2019s principally in the retail portion of our business. As you know, those are relatively shorter contracts, so we have the ability to price quite frequently or consistently with power, so it\u2019s not a huge headwind. I think the fact that the team has continued to drive gross margins to being consistent, in fact in the most recent quarter up several hundred basis points in our data center business, is a very good testament to the fact that we\u2019re managing the impact of power, which as you know is a margin drag as its increasing, so we feel very good about where we are going into next year as it relates to power. As it relates to pricing more broadly, the thing I would point you to is if you look at our mark-to-market, it has continued to improve throughout the year, and as you know, that\u2019s a lagging indicator in light of when the contracts for renewals were signed, so we continue to see a very healthy environment for pricing within data center, at least within the markets that we operate in there, generally speaking. I would say there\u2019s more demand than supply. We feel very well positioned as it relates to the assets we have and our ability to continue to price. I\u2019ll also note, of course, that construction costs are up and so when you look across the platform of our data center business, we feel very good about how the team is performing.\nBill Meany: The only thing I would add, you were asking about how we manage with the customers, because this has been a pain point for our customers. As Barry said, you can see our margins continue to improve, so as we\u2019re building out operational leverage in the business, which is first and foremost, but we\u2019ve been able to manage the price increases in line with energy costs, so it hasn\u2019t been a drag for us. But for our customers, it\u2019s been a pretty big pain point. Recently, I can say speaking to a customer--a large ecommerce customer in Asia, we actually serve them around the globe but based in Asia, and a large global financial institution, even though we have the-and they do pass the power costs to them, is having the uncertainty in the budgets is difficult with them, so we have been working with a number of those customers to actually buy power in advance, or contract forward for some power that we could give them certainty in terms of what their energy bill is going to be on a rolling 12-month basis. We have been working with our customers to try to minimize the volatility and the pain that they are experiencing, so so far, so good.\nOperator: This concludes our question and answer session and our Iron Mountain third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Barry Hytinen",
            "content": "Thanks Bill, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our results. In the third quarter, our team delivered solid performance, meeting top line projections while exceeding expectations for both EBITDA and AFFO. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.29 billion grew 14% year-on-year, or 18% excluding the effects of the stronger U.S. dollar. A key highlight in the quarter is our organic storage revenue, which grew 9.7% and represents a sequential improvement of 150 basis points. Total service revenue increased 28% to $527 million, driven by organic growth of 22%. These results reflect the strong performance of our commercial team and their laser focus on selling the full suite of products and solutions across our portfolio. Adjusted EBITDA was $469 million, up 12% on a reported basis and up over 16% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. As the dollar strengthened significantly since the time of our last call, I think it will be helpful to provide a bit more context. As compared to the rates we were using in August, the stronger dollar resulted in an incremental headwind in the third quarter of approximately $10 million to revenue and $3 million to EBITDA. Under the same FX rates we were using in our August projection, third quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA would have been approximately $1.3 billion and $472 million respectively. Adjusted EBITDA margin was better than we projected and improved 120 basis points sequentially, driven by revenue management and mix.  AFFO was $288 million or $0.98 on a per-share basis, up $25 million and $0.08 respectively from the third quarter of last year. Due to the strengthening dollar, there was an approximate $3 million impact to AFFO versus the rates we used in our August projection. Now turning to segment performance, in the third quarter our global RIM business delivered revenue of $1.1 billion, an increase of $93 million from last year or 9% on a reported basis. On an organic constant currency basis, revenue increased 14%. In the third quarter, our team continued to drive accelerating organic growth both in storage and services. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $484 million, an increase of $48 million year-on-year. Turning to our global data center business, we are pleased to report another successful quarter. Our data center storage revenue grew 33% year-on-year. On a total revenue basis, we delivered 13% year-on-year growth. Now as a reminder, in the second half of 2021, we provided unique fit-out services for our Frankfurt joint venture. In the third quarter of 2021, those services resulted in approximately $14 million of revenue. Excluding those fit-out services, on a like-for-like basis our total data center revenue grew in excess of 30%.  We completed 7 megawatts of new and expansion leasing, and with the strength of our expanding pipeline, we now expect to exceed our leasing projection of 130 megawatts for the full year. As Bill detailed earlier, we are continuing to expand our data center platform into new markets. We closed the Madrid data center transaction early in the fourth quarter for an initial purchase price of $78 million, which is subject to an additional $10 million earn-out. Turning to corporate and other, revenue increased 22% on an organic basis and nearly 120% in total, driven by our ALM business and continued strength in fine arts. Within ALM, our organic IT asset disposition business continued on its strong trajectory, growing in excess of 20% year-on-year. Turning to ITRenew, revenue was down sequentially, as we projected on our last call. The business was $5 million below that projection as the lockdowns in China persisted throughout the quarter. We are projecting revenue levels for our total ALM business in the fourth quarter to be consistent with the third quarter. Turning to capital, total expenditures were $309 billion in the third quarter. We deployed $270 million of growth capex and $39 million of recurring.  Turning to the balance sheet, with strong EBITDA performance we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.2 times, an improvement versus last quarter, and I think it is worth noting this marked our lowest leverage level since 2017. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term range of 4.5 to 5.5 times, and we now expect to exit the year at 5.2 times.  Our board of directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early January. On a trailing four-quarter basis, our payout ratio is now 66%, approaching our long-term target range of low to mid 60s percent. Now let me share our projections for the fourth quarter, which incorporate recent FX rates.  We expect total revenue to be approximately $1.3 billion, which represents 12% growth year-on-year. This would be a high teens growth rate on a constant currency basis. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $470 million in the fourth quarter, which represents 9% year-on-year growth, including the negative impact of FX. We expect AFFO to be approximately $280 million, which is $0.94 on a per-share basis. As FX rates have moved significantly both this year and in the most recent quarter, we feel it would be helpful to provide a bit more context. With the FX rates that we used at the time of our August earnings release, our projections for the fourth quarter would be revenue in excess of $1.32 billion, EBITDA of approximately $480 million, AFFO of approximately $290 million, and AFFO per share of approximately $0.97. As compared to our full year guidance ranges, with our year-to-date performance and our fourth quarter projection, revenue is at the low end and adjusted EBITDA is at the midpoint. I would like to highlight that on the same FX rates we were using at the start of the year, we estimate our full-year revenue would be in excess of the midpoint of our range and adjusted EBITDA would be beyond the high end of our range. To conclude, our results reflect the strength of our business model and our teams' collective execution and focus on growth and operating leverage. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our entire team for their strong performance and our drive to achieve our ambitions. With that, Operator, please open the line for Q&A. Okay, thanks Shlomo - this is Barry. Appreciate the question. We did put in place those revenue management actions we talked about on the last call, so those went into effect in September and you see that beginning in the quarter to take hold in the results. As you would have noted, the implied growth from revenue management, it accelerated in the quarter and that's been ramping through the year, so think on our global RIM business, it was probably in the 6.5 range - that's up from about 5 earlier in the year and making steady progress. I would expect in light of the macro environment and the reception that we've been seeing with respect to revenue management activities, that that would--we would continue naturally to be at this level as we move into 2023, so we are preparing similar revenue management actions going forward and the reception has been consistent with what we've seen over many years. I think it demonstrates the value that we're driving for our customers. Thanks for the question. Okay, thanks Kevin, good morning. Thanks for the questions. On ITRenew, we certainly, as we've said throughout the year, been experiencing challenges, like so many other companies that sell into China. With the COVID lockdowns that have persisted and then at one level or another throughout the second half and really throughout the year, that has been a challenge as it relates to our revenue, as Bill and I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've assumed that ITRenew will be and total ALM business will be pretty consistent third quarter and fourth quarter at this level. In total, ITRenew was of the order of about $45 million of revenue in the third quarter, and that was, as I said in the prepared remarks, down about $5 million, $6 million from the projection we were using at that time. Thanks for the call-out as it relates to the total business continuing to perform well.  You mentioned the data center deal - just to be clear, that business is only 3 megawatts today, so that is not a driver of revenue performance in the fourth quarter at all, although we are really bullish on that opportunity because Madrid is a market that we've wanted to play in for some time and it's a unique market, as I'm sure you know, from the standpoint of where it is with the energy grid. It's not constrained like so many other markets in Europe, and we think it is, as a market, one that has considerable opportunity. Our pipeline there is quite good, so we'll be developing that site and we feel really good about the asset. In terms of the fourth quarter and our ability to continue to deliver strong growth, that's a testament to our teams' strong performance across our operations, so in our global records business we'll continue to see benefit from revenue management, as I mentioned. We've had very strong services performance, and we continue to see a ramping business in our data center. Thanks so much for the question, Kevin. Okay, thank you Eric for the questions. A couple of ones in there.  On Matterhorn, the costs that we spoke about, as you know, we're moving to a new operating model that Bill just touched on briefly, that being with a global commercial organization, also a global operations function. In those cases, that is a pretty substantial change for us in terms of the way we go to market. On the commercial side, it's really putting together an organization that is singularly focused on serving our customers on a solution basis and really developing a tremendous amount of excellence around all things commercial.  Then, we are also constructing a global operations function which is meant to serve our customers effectively and drive significant customer satisfaction and high quality service, while also creating and furthering the shared services backbone that we have to support the entire organization. As well, we are moving to a business unit function, that being, as we discussed at the investor day event, storage and asset life cycle management and data center, as you know, so those are pretty substantial changes. We think of it, as Bill mentioned, as a transformation, and with that, probably about one-third of those costs, Eric, will be maybe slightly less, will be specific to enablement to align and transform into that commercial operating function. Then the bulk of the cost will be around in fact transforming the broader operating model, which would include costs that you would expect with respect to that kind of transformation, including activities such as restructuring and furthering our transformation. Thanks for that question. I guess I'll just note, as I said at the investor event, we would expect to be approaching the run rate of that level in the fourth quarter as we continue to move into the Matterhorn model, as Bill mentioned in his prepared remarks. In terms of the funding plan, I appreciate that question as well. Just as a highlight for those that weren't able to join the investor meeting, we noted that we expect a five-year revenue CAGR of 10% and a five-year EBITDA CAGR of 10%, AFFO of 8%, and that equates to AFFO per share of, let's say, 7%, as we said in our slides this morning. With that, it's a fully funded capital plan through EBITDA expansion and leverage within our target range. You note that rates have moved up recently, and I'll just note that with--we consider ourselves in a very good position. We have $1.5 billion of liquidity and we're about 80% fixed, as you know, Eric, and so from time to time, we will continue to term out debt but in light of the very good position we're in with respect to availability on our revolver and the lowest levels of leverage we've experienced since 2017, we can really pick our timing as it relates to that over time, so we will be funding through expansion of EBITDA and leverage within our target range.  I appreciate the questions, Eric. Sure. Hi Andrew, good morning, and thanks for the questions. When we look at the fourth quarter revenue rate, that being of the order of high teens growth on a constant currency basis, and something of the order of 17%, 18%, so very strong continuation of trend. I'll note that that's basically the rate we've been running at through the year, so it's a very good continuation of trend. From the standpoint of storage and services, as Bill mentioned in response to one of the earlier questions, our services business continues to go from strength to strength. That's thanks to things like our digital solutions and our historic IT asset disposition business, which is growing in excess of 20% - I think 25% in the most recent quarter, very strong performance. We view many of our businesses as playing in markets that are quite large, growing secularly at double-digit rates, and that we expect to continue to take market share in, so for the fourth quarter, you should expect continued strong performance from both storage and services throughout the business. The only thing I would further underline is that for ITRenew and ALM in general, we've assumed it would be consistent on a sequential basis, so you can work into the organic if you'd like from that.  Thank you for the question. Okay, maybe I'll take the first part of that, and if Bill wants to add, he can. Thank you Brendan for the question, and appreciate those points that you're asking about. I think our team has done quite an effective job with respect to hedging and getting us into a place where we're in a very good position as we work into 2023 as it relates to power. To give you a sense, Brendan, obviously this is a little bit based on forecast of next year, but we estimate that we were in excess of 95% locked in terms of pricing at this point for power; in fact, it's probably closer to 99%.  I would say the other important point is when you look at our customer base, we have the ability to directly pass power pricing onto roughly 90% of the customers, and that's either through pass-through or surcharge, for example to retail customers, and in many cases that's month to month as we've highlighted before. For those that we don't have that direct ability, of course we have the ability to adjust pricing on renewals, and that's principally in the retail portion of our business. As you know, those are relatively shorter contracts, so we have the ability to price quite frequently or consistently with power, so it's not a huge headwind. I think the fact that the team has continued to drive gross margins to being consistent, in fact in the most recent quarter up several hundred basis points in our data center business, is a very good testament to the fact that we're managing the impact of power, which as you know is a margin drag as its increasing, so we feel very good about where we are going into next year as it relates to power. As it relates to pricing more broadly, the thing I would point you to is if you look at our mark-to-market, it has continued to improve throughout the year, and as you know, that's a lagging indicator in light of when the contracts for renewals were signed, so we continue to see a very healthy environment for pricing within data center, at least within the markets that we operate in there, generally speaking. I would say there's more demand than supply. We feel very well positioned as it relates to the assets we have and our ability to continue to price. I'll also note, of course, that construction costs are up and so when you look across the platform of our data center business, we feel very good about how the team is performing."

            "name": "Bill Meany",
            "content": "Thank you Gillian, and we appreciate everyone taking the time to join us for our third quarter results.  We are pleased to share with you another outstanding quarter, representing the durability and growth of our business model as we continue to navigate successfully through significant headwinds, including the strength of the U.S. dollar, COVID shutdowns in China, and ongoing global tensions. Our team of 25,000 dedicated Mountaineers continues to empower our customers with solutions to enable them to transform their businesses. In the third quarter on a reported basis, we delivered revenue of $1.29 billion, representing 14% total organic revenue growth. We are pleased to have achieved all time record adjusted EBITDA of $469 million. Since last year, the U.S. dollar has strengthened significantly, and excluding its impact on a like-for-like basis, this quarter our revenue was approximately $1.33 billion and EBITDA was $484 million, representing growth of 18% and 16% respectively. These results demonstrate the inherent growth and strength of our business and are further proof of why we continue to be so encouraged by the increased demand for our services across the markets in which we operate. Positive volume and revenue management trends continued to benefit us this quarter, as reflected in our organic storage rental revenue growth of 9.7%.  As we shared with you in September at our investor event, we are executing well on our new Project Matterhorn operating model, the next transformational phase of Iron Mountain's growth journey. Building off an already solid foundation, we believe Matterhorn is a cornerstone initiative that will allow us to maintain and capitalize on the positive momentum we have seen over the last several quarters.  Through our fully funded plan's ability to invest 16% of revenue over the next four years, we believe we will further strengthen Iron Mountain as a market leader across our expanded total addressable market, our diversified global footprint, and our enhanced suite of innovative solutions. Our strong double-digit organic growth is evidence of the early progress we are making on our initiatives, which gives us the momentum and confidence in our ability to deliver higher levels of profitable growth over the next several years.  Now I'd like to share a few highlights of some recent customer wins while lie beneath the top and bottom line growth. Turning to our digital solutions business, we helped a global European bank evolve to a paperless branch experience to drive enhanced customer service with 360-degree customer data, traceable and audible digital records, and reduced manual efforts for their tellers. The customer has a footprint of more than 400 branches in the U.S. with each branch storing decades' worth of customer records on premises. We are partnering with the bank to digitize all customer records across their U.S. branches in under a year.  The files will be securing transferred and imaged at Iron Mountain digital supercenters indexing and tagged with critical metadata using machine learning and then placed into Insight, Iron Mountain's digital repository. Insight will be provided to over 3,500 tellers across the bank to access these digitized customer records quickly and securely. This win is just one example of how we are helping our customers evolve their businesses through digitization, resulting in quicker, easier and more secure access to their most important information for years to come. Also in digital solutions, we won a contract with a state court in Brazil from an incumbent provider. To comply with the Brazilian National Council of Justice's 100% Digital initiative, all state courts are required to convert active lawsuit documents from physical to digital by 2023. As such, they turned to Iron Mountain for help to implement and complete the conversion process within the mandated time frame whilst adhering to specific quality requirements. Whilst this is in and of itself a terrific win, we are currently exploring further opportunities with this customer. Moving to our asset life cycle management segment, I'd like to share an innovative win this quarter. Our strong existing relationships and coordinated efforts led to a large asset life cycle management win to serve 700 locations in the United States and Canada for a large healthcare company. Prior to the deal, the customer had primarily engaged with us through our records business. The first phase of the partnership included retrieval of IT equipment and plans for a forthcoming data center refresh. We expect to process more than 13,000 assets in the first year. Moving onto the impact of COVID shutdowns in China on the ITRenew business, we see continued constraints in the downstream demand for recycled IT components. As a result, we expect to see similar levels of ITRenew sell-through in Q4 as in Q3. With the continued increase of the backlog of components, we remain bullish on the prospects for the business once the situation normalizes.  In our fine arts business, we are pleased to highlight a win with an internationally renowned art museum. The customer turned to our team to assist them with multiple onsite projects related to renovations the museum will undergo throughout a three-year period. Lacking the internal resources to staff these projects, they were seeking a trusted partner to support them providing additional art handling services. By leveraging our experience and successful track record of prior engagements with the customer, we were able to offer a compelling proposal that secured this very exciting initiative. In the quarter, this business grew by 17% year-over-year, which is a reflection of the strong underlying business.  Shifting to the data center business, we are pleased to have booked 7 megawatts of leasing in this quarter, bringing total bookings year-to-date to 125 megawatts. As a result, we expect to exceed our previous projection of 130 megawatts for new leases for the year.  One of the wins this quarter included a cross-sell deal with a large non-profit community health provider that needed to close down their internal data center and establish a disaster recovery site. As a long-term taped backup and records management customer of Iron Mountain, they reached out to their account team, who engaged with our data center team. As a result, the customer signed a co-location contract which included internet services and multiple cross-connects within 45 days. The convenience of having a single provider for all their physical and digital storage needs was a critical selling point in addition to Iron Mountain's rigorous data center compliance program, which is essential for the customer given the highly regulated market in which they operate. Our team's flexibility and willingness to collaborate across divisions to customize solutions for our customer provides a superior experience and ultimately is what made us stand out as their partner of choice. From a development perspective, as discussed in September at our investor event, we have continued to build our land bank in key strategic markets to support future growth with several notable expansion deals. As previously announced, we have added buildable capacity in the Phoenix, Arizona market with the purchase of adjacent land to our existing campus. Based on current design plans, the parcel can support 36 megawatts and includes a 56 MVA substation on site. This is an important expansion in this dynamic market as our current campus at 89 megawatts is nearly fully leased and/or committed. We also expanded our footprint in India with the securing of land and power for 20 megawatts of additional capacity in Mumbai. We remain excited about the growth potential in this strategic emerging market both for our data center business, as well for the enterprise as a whole. In total, we currently have 52 megawatts of buildable capacity across five markets in India. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we acquired a data center campus in Madrid, Spain, marking our entry into the Iberian market. The asset is a uniquely scaled data center campus with an existing 3 megawatt building and fully permitted expansion potential of 79 megawatts. We view Madrid as a very important European market as it is poised to capture significant growth from supply-constrained markets. With these additions to our portfolio, our total capacity is now nearly 670 megawatts.  The wins I've shared with you today demonstrate the breadth and depth of our business, our focus on customer centricity and providing innovative, transformation solutions, and the strength of our global commercial platform driven by our Matterhorn initiative. I am very proud of our outstanding team who are the bedrock of our company and the way in which we come together to drive and deliver our growth journey. Our business model is highly profitable, our pipeline is strong, our vision is clear, and we continue to climb on. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry. Thanks George for the question. We feel really good, as you would have noted, that over the last number of quarters, we've been consistently showing north of 20% growth both on our IT disposal business - you know, the traditional part or the organic portion of our asset life cycle management business has consistently been 20% or better, and our digital service business continues to go from strength to strength again, north of 20%. Those are really two of the key drivers driving that overall level of service growth. If anything, we see in both of those areas, the interest in customers, whether it's helping them at the end-of-life in some of their assets, make sure that it is destroyed in a way that's secure, or in the digital service business, we see more and more customer interest and actually customer contracting on us helping them with their digital transformation. I think the current environment, we see more rather than less of both of those things, so we feel really good about being able to maintain that kind of level of growth, which is all part of the Matterhorn project that we outlined at our investor event a few weeks ago, that when you put it all together, it drives what we see over the next coming years - you know, consistent growth rates that turn into a CAGR of 10% or better. Good morning Wendy, thanks for the question. We remain really excited and very bullish about our data center businesses. As we said, if you look at--you know, we'll exceed the 130 megawatts that we had laid out or forecasted on our last call, so we continue to build past that and we see similar momentum as we go into next year, so we don't see any change in terms of our pipeline that turns into leasing activity as we start approaching 2023.  We continue--there's always a little bit of lumpiness because these are fairly large contracts when you look at quarter to quarter, but we see continued strength and momentum as we go into next year. I think we are also in key markets - that's why we've expanded in Phoenix, where I mentioned that we're pretty much fully leased or committed on our current campus in Phoenix, and we've expanded there. As Barry mentioned, whilst there is 3 megawatts that comes with the north of 70 megawatts of capacity that we've purchased in the Iberian Peninsula, specifically in Madrid, is that comes with a pipeline of activity because we've been clearly speaking to our customers and anticipating that move. We continue to see that we're going from strength to strength in that business and building really strong momentum as we go into 2023. The only thing I would add, you were asking about how we manage with the customers, because this has been a pain point for our customers. As Barry said, you can see our margins continue to improve, so as we're building out operational leverage in the business, which is first and foremost, but we've been able to manage the price increases in line with energy costs, so it hasn't been a drag for us. But for our customers, it's been a pretty big pain point. Recently, I can say speaking to a customer--a large ecommerce customer in Asia, we actually serve them around the globe but based in Asia, and a large global financial institution, even though we have the-and they do pass the power costs to them, is having the uncertainty in the budgets is difficult with them, so we have been working with a number of those customers to actually buy power in advance, or contract forward for some power that we could give them certainty in terms of what their energy bill is going to be on a rolling 12-month basis. We have been working with our customers to try to minimize the volatility and the pain that they are experiencing, so so far, so good."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Gillian Tiltman, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nGillian Tiltman: Thank you, Chad. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. On today\u2019s call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Barry Hytinen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open up the lines for Q&A. Today\u2019s earnings materials contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today\u2019s earnings materials, the Safe Harbor language on Slide 2 and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliations to these measures in our supplemental financial information. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Meaney: Thank you, Gillian, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our second quarter results. Our team delivered another quarter of record results, further demonstrating our resilience in pricing power as the world navigates difficult market conditions and global instability. Our dedicated team continues to develop new and innovative solutions for the ever-evolving needs of our customers. Our durable business model and strong customer relationships consistently drive value for our customers and ultimately, our shareholders. Our record second quarter results delivered our highest ever quarterly revenue of $1.29 billion, representing 13% total organic revenue growth and an all-time record for EBITDA of $455 million, in spite of significant FX headwinds. These results are further proof of why we continue to be so encouraged by the increased demand for our services across key markets. Pricing and positive volume trends continue to benefit us in this quarter as we reflected in our organic storage rental revenue growth of 8.2%. As we have been sharing with you over the past few quarters, we have been growing quickly, even faster than our own expectations. A major driver for this growth is a direct benefit from our continued innovation, which has increased the size of the total addressable market for our products and services by 12 times to $120 billion, most of which is in faster-growing sectors. Accordingly, we are forecasting revenue growth to continue to accelerate in the back half of the year, driven by strong revenue management in our Global RIM business unit, growth in our data center business, digital information management solutions and improving trends in downstream demand for our hyperscale asset life cycle management or ALM business, which we acquired through the acquisition of ITRenew in January of this year.  I now would like to take this opportunity to share a few highlights of our customer wins. To begin with, our records management business, we have had a long-standing relationship with a major global accounting organization for more than 20 years. They were in the midst of reviewing their records management program when they learned of our Smart Sort solution. We calculated that Smart Sort could help them classify and destroy co-mingled records that have various retention schedules and a much faster and more cost-efficient way than if they were to do so in-house. This led to a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the power of our tools and techniques, which resulted in a deal that closed month sooner and expanded the records management program we performed for them across not only the outsourced records but their in-house records as well. Moreover, this win has already led to other exciting conversations with the customer about digital transformation opportunities. The deal has also opened more opportunities with the customer in Europe and the Asia Pacific region. On the digital solutions side, we recently won a contract with a large insurance and financial services company in the United States. They had previously only used us for shredding services, aligned with the acceleration of the digitization initiatives, they needed solutions to help them create greater business efficiencies whilst maintaining data security for the sensitive information their company handles every day. We provided a cloud-based solution to further support their work from anywhere initiatives by delivering information to their associates wherever they are in a secure and easy-to-access manner. Our team listened to the customers\u2019 needs and tailored a near-site Digital Mailroom solution to effectively meet their needs by leveraging an Iron Mountain owned and operated record center located near the customers\u2019 headquarters. As a result, we will digitize and distribute 10 million pieces of mail annually. As part of the special handling process, we will also leverage our InSight solution for checks and other items deemed to be sensitive. Over time, we expect to leverage the full suite of InSight solutions to process all of their mail, leveraging workflow automation through the use of our embedded artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities. This innovative solution will dramatically improve mail processing times through automated routing as well as classification and governance. These wins demonstrate the merits of strong customer loyalty, coupled with our solution-oriented approach in serving our customers. We are sharply focused on understanding their job to be done in delivering solutions, which are both innovative and impactful. Now to switch gears, I\u2019d like to share a recent data restoration and migration win that led to an ALM win, thanks to a deep and trusted relationship with one of our customers, a large Australian bank. They have been growing through acquisition and as part of their integration plans have been decommissioning their data centers to move to a large cloud provider. To help enable this transition, we recognize that they would benefit from better access to their data on tapes, leading to one of our biggest data restoration and migration services contracts. This is in and of itself a great win, but it led us to an even larger opportunity to assist this long-standing customer. Based on our strong partnership, we were able to help the customer manage their decommissioned data center assets by offering an introduction to our ALM services. This win is an important entry point and shows our ability to help our customers solve multiple business challenges. It also reinforces the cross-sell opportunity in ALM. In our ALM segment, in addition to the Australian bank, this quarter, we closed a deal with another large global bank, whereby Iron Mountain will provide on-site media destruction and data center equipment recycling to 42 data centers, campus locations and branch offices. The program will also expand to corporate and user assets in multiple global locations. This customer contacted Iron Mountain in January of 2022 to inquire about our secure IT asset disposition services due to poor performance from their incumbent vendor. Our team engaged with the bank\u2019s key stakeholders to discuss their service requirements, data security policy and pain points in order to best position our solution. Our best-in-class logistics, asset processing capabilities, data security practices, transparent reporting, and strong client relationships were critical to securing the win. Moreover, our acquisition earlier this year of ITRenew and the resulting ability to in-source all asset processing capabilities in the U.S. convince this customer that we have the strongest capability set to service them. We are also pleased to report another ALM win with a large cloud customer wherein we were awarded part of a $60 million global RFP. The customer currently uses a multi-vendor approach with a vendor assigned per region. ITRenew was the largest provider to them in North America for value recovery and on-site drive destruction. Now that Iron Mountain has completed the acquisition, the customer has additionally awarded us their Irish business, along with expansion of the North American business to include shredding and recycling hard disk drives. We won this business in part due to our track record of achieving the highest value for the resale of decommissioned components, our global footprint and our excellence in asset tracking. We are very encouraged by the continued growth of IT assets contracted to us for disposal as well as the wins with new and existing clients. However, like all global businesses exposed to computing equipment, the latest COVID-19 shutdowns in China have had a negative short-term impact. This impact has been most particularly pronounced in May and June. There is a higher-than-normal backlog of material, which we hold on consignment that cannot be sold until we can deliver it to the manufacturers in China who are using the recycled components in their goods. Whilst China\u2019s zero-COVID policy makes it hard to predict when manufacturing rhythms will return to normal, we do expect to see an acceleration of our sell-through once the situation does indeed normalize. In summary, the continued growth we have seen in the upstream supply of IT equipment needing to be securely and safely recycled further increases our excitement about this sector once downstream demand for recycled IT components reverts back to its usual levels. Finally, our data center business has been extremely active this quarter, and we successfully completed 83 megawatts of leasing. This included a 72-megawatt lease for two buildings on our Northern Virginia campus. Both of these facilities are effectively stabilized as we have pre-leased 100% of the capacity to a Fortune 100 company. Today, we are happy to announce a joint venture for these assets with a subsidiary of Hana Financial, a global real estate firm. Full build-out of these two sites is expected in the third quarter of 2025, and Iron Mountain will be responsible for managing the design and development of the data center shell as well as administrating the leases. Also in this quarter, we signed a hyperscale tenant on our Phoenix, Arizona campus. With this new lease, the customer has existing capacity in three of our locations. This win increases their geographic presence with us as well as introducing the client to the Phoenix market for the first time. We\u2019ve also been active on colocation this quarter in our data center business. We had a new customer win with one of the largest managed service providers, which has existing data centers in North America and Europe, and we\u2019re looking to gain entry into strategic emerging markets such as India. To that end, we were able to accommodate this customer through our Web Werks, JV, in Mumbai for data center capacity. When we originally entered India through this JV, we operated in three markets. We have spent much of the last year focused on securing land to expand our footprint in our existing markets as well as two additional new markets now. We believe as we work through planning and permissioning on these parcels, we will have over 100 megawatts of sellable capacity in the Indian market over the next couple of years. Having personally visited India already twice this year. I and we remain very excited about \u2013 about the opportunities we are seeing in this exciting market, both for data center as well as our business more broadly. These wins show how our focus towards building an extraordinary set of synergistic and customer-centric solutions, combined with our global reach and footprint both differentiates and propels our growth forward.  As we have discussed before, we are focused on driving commercial activity, including cross-selling our solutions to our customers, and this quarter, nearly all of our data center bookings were signed with existing customers of Iron Mountain. To conclude, I am incredibly proud our team has continued to build on our growth momentum, expand our portfolio and not only meet but exceed our customers\u2019 evolving needs. This is evidenced by our outstanding and record results this morning, including our highest ever revenue and all-time record EBITDA as well as the highest rate of organic revenue growth in the last 25 years. We expect to continue to build on these results as we further the growth of our business based upon a strong global footprint, a powerful portfolio of products and services and our deep customer relationships. We have a very exciting future, and I can\u2019t wait to see all we continue to accomplish together. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Barry.\nBarry Hytinen: Thanks, Bill, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our results. In the second quarter, our team delivered strong performance across all metrics, meeting top-line projections while exceeding projections on EBITDA and AFFO. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.29 billion, grew 15% year-on-year or 18% excluding the effects of the stronger U.S. dollar. Incidentally, the dollar strengthened significantly since the time of our call in April and resulted in about $15 million of incremental revenue headwind versus our prior projections for the second quarter. A key highlight in the quarter is our organic storage revenue, which grew 8.2%, reflecting strong revenue management and data center commencements. Total service revenue increased 34% to $536 million with 21% organic growth. In total, this was driven by strength in our core service offerings, including digital solutions and our acquisition of ITRenew. Adjusted EBITDA was $455 million, up 12% on a reported basis and up 15% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. We had strong contributions from revenue growth driven by pricing and data center storage along with ongoing productivity improvements. The higher level of EBITDA was despite the significant impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and the disposition of our software escrow business last June. Combined, those two items are about $17 million of year-on-year headwind. The deconsolidation last quarter of the former OSG records business in Russia offset the benefit from ITRenew. With solid flow-through, second quarter EBITDA exceeded the expectations we shared on our last call by $5 million on a reported basis and by $10 million using the same FX rates included in our April projections. Adjusted EBITDA margin was better than we projected and improved 80 basis points sequentially versus the first quarter of 2022, driven by price and mix. AFFO was $271 million or $0.93 on a per share basis, up $25 million and $0.08, respectively, from the second quarter of last year. In both cases, we exceeded our expectations. Now turning to segment performance. In the second quarter, our Global RIM business delivered revenue of $1.1 billion, an increase of $74 million from last year or 7% on a reported basis. On an organic constant currency basis, revenue increased 11%. Constant currency storage rental revenue growth of 6.4% exceeded our expectations for the quarter. These results reflect the strong performance of our commercial team and their focus on selling the full suite of products across our portfolio. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $469 million, an increase of $45 million year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was up 120 basis points year-on-year, reflecting pricing strength and productivity.  Turning to our global data center business. Our team delivered another successful quarter of executing our strategy. On a revenue basis, we delivered 30% year-on-year growth, and a particular highlight for me is the 24% organic storage revenue growth. As we noted on our last call, we signed a 72-megawatt lease on our Virginia campus with a long-standing hyperscale customer for a near build-to-suit. As Bill noted, we have recently established a joint venture for this asset, whereby we will retain a 55% interest and generate a strong return. We completed an additional 11 megawatts of leasing in the quarter for a total of 83 megawatts. We are confident in our 130-megawatt projection for new and expansion leasing this year, thanks to the momentum from the first half of the year, combined with our strong bookings pipeline. Turning to our corporate and other business. Revenue increased 156% year-on-year, driven by our ALM business, including the ITRenew acquisition and organic growth in our Fine Arts business. For modeling purposes, let me call out a couple of minor changes we\u2019ve made to our reporting to be consistent with how we are managing the company. First, all of our ALM business is now included in corporate and other, whereas previously, our legacy IT asset disposal business was in Global RIM. Secondly, our Entertainment Services business and certain costs that support our commercial organization have been moved from corporate into Global RIM. We have updated our historical financials to allow for comparability and those will be made available on our investor relations website later today. In our asset life cycle management business, as Bill mentioned, we are very optimistic with regard to the underlying trends in this category. And importantly, our committed backlog remains strong and growing and currently sits at a record level as we speak to you today. Turning to capital recycling. In the second quarter, we generated approximately $91 million. Total capital expenditures were $188 million, of which $156 million was growth and $32 million was recurring. We continue to expect total capital expenditures for the full year to be approximately $950 million, which includes $625 million for data center development and $155 million for recurring CapEx. Turning to the balance sheet. With strong EBITDA performance, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.3 times, which reflects a sequential improvement from the first quarter. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term range of 4.5 times to 5.5 times. We continue to expect to exit the year at levels within our target range. And with our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early October. On a trailing four-quarter basis, our payout ratio is now 68%, approaching our long-term target range of low to mid-60s. Now turning to our outlook. For the full year, reflecting our performance in the first half and strong outlook, we expect to deliver revenue at the midpoint of our guidance range despite an additional $60 million of foreign exchange headwind in the second half. And for EBITDA and AFFO, with continued pricing and productivity, we expect to achieve the midpoint or beyond of our full year guidance ranges. Now, let me share our expectations for the third quarter. We expect total revenue to be approximately $1.3 billion, which represents 15% growth year-on-year. I would like to note that we have considerable FX headwinds, both year-on-year and sequentially. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $465 million in the third quarter, which represents 11% year-on-year growth. And we expect AFFO to be approximately $280 million. To conclude, the performance of our business is strong. Our team continues to drive higher levels of growth, and we thank them for their collective efforts and dedication. Our tour is strong with margin is increasing, thanks to pricing and productivity and our investments are driving considerable growth across our business. We look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming investor event on September 20, at which time we will have the opportunity to discuss our strategy to drive considerable future growth. The event will take place in Northern Virginia and include a tour of our data-centric campus. For those of you who cannot join in person, a live webcast of the presentation will be available. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instructions]. And the first question will be from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Your revenue management strategy continues to be tracking well in the storage business. Can you provide an update on how much in pricing increases are flowing through in response to the current inflationary environment and how much flexibility you have to reflect up change revenue management conditions as the year progresses?\nBarry Hytinen: Hi, George, it\u2019s Barry. Thanks for the question. The team is doing very, very well with respect to revenue management. You would have seen that our organic storage rental revenue growth on an organic basis was up over 8% in the quarter. That marked a nice acceleration even from the higher levels in the first quarter. And in our Global RIM business that was over 6% on that metric. So volume, as you would have seen on an organic basis \u2013 in total is up about 2%, but on an organic basis is very consistent with our expectations of being just slightly up, so about 50 basis points. So what you\u2019re seeing is a very strong contribution from revenue management coming through. And I\u2019ll just add on to the second part of your question and note that we are continuing to see incremental opportunities for pricing. And in fact, we will be seeing us move forward with additional pricing actions later in the third quarter that will fully benefit us as we move through the year and then give us a little bit of an incremental lift next year. So those are just in light of what\u2019s going on in the economic activity and the fact that our existing revenue management program has been so well received, we see the opportunity to continue to move higher. So you will see that going forward. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: And the next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Barry, can you talk a little bit more just about the ITRenew revenue contribution to the quarter you noted it was light. Can you give us the exact amount? It seems \u2013 at least my calculation is somewhere around $65 million. And then maybe Bill, you can talk a little bit as you talk about ITRenew in terms of what were you expecting in the quarter initially in when you had earnings in the first quarter? And how is that different? And how do you expect that to play out over the course of this year? In other words, what\u2019s your target for ITRenew, given what we\u2019re seeing from China, are you expecting to catch up? Or are you expecting some of this to kind of flow into 2023?\nBill Meaney: Thanks. I\u2019ll start, Shlomo and then I think Barry will give you a little bit more specifics in terms of how to think about it from a modeling standpoint. So I appreciate the question. similar to what \u2013 when you and I were chatting at your conference here, I guess, a couple of months \u2013 almost two months back, summer is almost gone, is that it\u2019s pretty much \u2013 as we were speaking about is that it\u2019s really a tale of two cities. So as I said in my kind of remarks talking about a number of the customer wins that we\u2019ve had around IT asset destruction and asset life cycle management, it\u2019s been a really strong quarter. And that\u2019s really where we\u2019re getting the volume of material that we then sell that gets recycled into new equipment going forward. So the \u2013 what I would call the upstream in terms of the amount that\u2019s coming to us because of our customer reach, the logistics that we have our know-how to be able to do that in a safe and secure way is that we\u2019re sitting on very strong inventories that\u2019s on consignment to us. So this is stuff that we hold on consignment and then sell on behalf of our customers and ourselves or the suppliers of the components and ourselves, to the downstream manufacturers that reuse that in new component. So the upstream bit is really performing to our expectations, and we feel really good about that. The downstream bit right now is primarily in China. And as we\u2019ve seen the lockdowns even more stronger in May and June than we expected, and they continue with the rolling lockdowns because of their zero COVID policy. So we\u2019re \u2013 it\u2019s hard to predict exactly when that will open. The good news is we have the inventory to sell. The minute it does open and every indication is that it will normalize in the foreseeable future. But the timing of that is difficult to predict. So a long way of saying is we\u2019re really pleased with the performance on how it\u2019s resonated with our customers to actually even exceed our expectations and how many customers have come to us to give us their volume of components to be disposed of either to be destroyed completely or recycled downstream. In terms of selling those components downstream, which is where we recognize most of the revenue, it\u2019s been hung up mainly because of the \u2013 well, entirely because of the COVID, zero COVID policy in China and the rolling shutdowns. And, Barry, maybe you want to talk a little bit about how we see the rest of the year shaping up.\nBarry Hytinen: Yes, sure. Thanks, Shlomo, for the question. You \u2013 a couple of things you asked. On the actual contribution, you\u2019ve calculated it correct; it was about $65 million. So that was just a touch up from the first quarter. And as we \u2013 as Bill referenced, as we said in early June in light of what we were seeing in the second half of May as well as the continued to see in June in light of the COVID shutdowns that Bill referenced. We certainly, that was below our expectations. That said, in terms of going forward, two things. One is we are planning and in the guidance that I gave you for the third quarter and the target for the full year. We have just assumed that our ITRenew contribution would be consistent going forward at that level or even maybe even a touch below that. And I think that\u2019s a conservative way to position it because as Bill mentioned, we and so many other technology-oriented companies don\u2019t know when China will reopen. But I think once it does, to his point, we have a very strong committed backlog and we have a good amount of consigned inventory that can sell through. I just didn\u2019t want to plan for it to get better. So I view that as \u2013 that\u2019s why I described that as I think, conservative because as it opens up, we will be selling through. So we feel very good about the committed backlog and the level of activity we\u2019re seeing from our upstream clients. And as that market reopens, I think we will see a very good sell-through. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The next question is from Sheila McGrath from Evercore. Please go ahead.\nSheila McGrath: Yes. Good morning. Service revenue growth was up meaningfully. I was wondering if you could help us drill down on that. What were the major drivers of the growth? Is it new businesses or a rebound of some business that had slowed down with COVID?\nBill Meaney: Good morning, Sheila. I appreciate the question. So it\u2019s really mainly new businesses, right? I mean, the business has rebounded from COVID, but we kind of saw most of that rebound, to be honest with you, towards the tail end of last year. And there are still certain countries that are kind of going through periodic shutdowns, we talked about China \u2013 we were talking about China in terms of ALM, but we see the same thing on the records management side in terms of the rolling COVID shutdowns in China. So the growth that we printed in terms of services is mainly the new areas. And I highlighted some of the wins that we\u2019re driving that on our digital transformation services. So this is really a direct result of taking ourselves from a $10 billion total addressable market for our products and services to the $120 billion [ph]. So that\u2019s where you\u2019re seeing the growth is in those new products and services that are part of that 12 times expansion of our total addressable market.\nBarry Hytinen: Sheila, its Barry. The only thing I would add on to that is specifically to build on Bill\u2019s point around digital solutions; we grew high teens in the quarter, which was the best comp we\u2019ve had on that specific line in several quarters. And in fact, it\u2019s against our hardest comp last year. So it really speaks to the fact that our digital business is taking hold and going from strength-to-strength. I\u2019ll note that we had a very strong contribution from our legacy ITAD business as well. That\u2019s in the asset life cycle management business, as you know and that business is growing at the very rates and we see considerable incremental opportunity for that to grow, in fact, just to be clear, it\u2019s accelerating in terms of its level of growth, so we feel great about that business. And then it\u2019s notable to say that our pricing continues to be up across the business that includes services. So thanks for the question, Sheila.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is from Brendan Lynch from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrendan Lynch: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to just touch on Hana Financial and the JV for some of your assets. Obviously, you\u2019ve been trying to grow data center revenue for past couple of years. So it was a little bit surprising to see a joint venture structure. Maybe you could just comment on what your considerations were there?\nBill Meaney: Good morning, Brendan. It\u2019s great to have you on the call. Let me talk about the strategic rationale of why we decided to put that into a joint venture. And then \u2013 or to do that deal that way? And then I\u2019ll ask Barry, he can give you a little bit more of the financial details. So first of all, we don\u2019t do \u2013 first, we don\u2019t do a lot of build-to-suit or powered shell. And this was for a customer that is one of our largest customers globally in a number of our sites, and they had a specific requirement for Northern Virginia. The other aspect about this particular client is it allowed us to materially expand almost 100 megawatts \u2013 roughly around 130 megawatts, 135 megawatts of IT load that we can actually support on that Northern Virginia campus by doing this partnership with this client because we were able to use that to bring in a substation on to our site and we\u2019ve completely secured the power now for the entire Northern Virginia campus. So even net of the 72 megawatts that we are actually leasing as a powered shell is that we\u2019ve actually increased the capacity of that site by another 70-megawatt is another 70 megawatts. So that was really, really important to us. And so the \u2013 and it\u2019s a great return on the powered shell. So that\u2019s really our motivation first of all for doing that kind of contract. In terms of why we joint ventured it, it really was very compelling from a financial standpoint. I\u2019ll let Barry talk a little bit about the financial aspects of the deal of bringing in a joint venture partner because I should also add, this is a 100% stabilized asset, right? So we always look at fully stabilized assets and say is that something \u2013 we\u2019re focusing most of our capital on development opportunities, not stabilized assets. So we saw that as an opportunity. But then especially when we looked at the opportunity, the financial aspects were just very compelling.\nBarry Hytinen: Yes. Hi, Brendan, thanks for joining the call. In terms of the JV, just to be clear, we\u2019ll operate it will, of course, be respond for the construction, the management et cetera. We saw it as an opportunity to leverage third party capital, which allows us to essentially use someone else\u2019s balance sheet and then use ours to go further our development pipeline. As you know, we\u2019ve got a lot of capacity to continue to build out. And as Bill mentioned, this is effectively a fully stabilized asset before we even break ground. And in light of the still very significant investor interest in data center assets, we saw it as a compelling incremental opportunity to even further improve the return that much more as the pre-lease is very attractive to the capital markets. So we\u2019ll maintain a 55% interest in it. We have traditional benefits from the joint venture structure that you\u2019d appreciate as a data center analyst, and I\u2019ll just note that we were able to sell that at a sub four and a half cap. And again, it\u2019s fully stabilized. So we view it as a compelling capital allocation opportunity. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is from Eric Luebchow from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nEric Luebchow: Hi. Great. Thank you. I\u2019ll stick with the data center topic. So kind of interested in how your sales funnel looks after such a strong start to the year, particularly with hyperscale but also on enterprise? And then \u2013 on the pricing side, it seems like data center pricing has been lifting even for the larger hyperscale deals. So I\u2019m wondering where you\u2019re seeing pricing today, particularly as supply appears to be getting tighter and tighter in a lot of markets. And then Bill, interested on \u2013 in terms of like where \u2013 which markets you might need additional land capacity or are there opportunities to do some select tuck-in M&A for no select assets to maybe get some capacity in new markets? Thank you.\nBill Meaney: Thanks, Eric. I\u2019ll start. The \u2013 I think first of all, yes, it\u2019s a great problem to have. We\u2019ve been so successful this year in terms of leasing. You\u2019re right to point out that we are making sure that we have capacity to continue to grow at these kind of rates. So the funnel that we have in front of us right now, if you think about we have 118 megawatts leased to date this year with \u2013 and we said \u2013 we gave you guidance that we\u2019ll do at least 130 megawatts this year. So we feel obviously very comfortable about that. And going into next year, we don\u2019t see any slowdown in terms of the rate of growth. I mean the 72 megawatts that we did in Northern Virginia, I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s a one-off because we continue to see in the pipeline similar types of opportunities, whether or not we\u2019ll pursue all those is we\u2019re constantly make decisions based on the specifics around that requirement. But we are lucky that we\u2019re in a situation where, yes, as I said, we don\u2019t necessarily bid it everything that comes by, so we can actually be a bit more selective. And we feel really good about the funnel. We\u2019ll give you, obviously guidance for next year as we get closer to the end of this year. But the \u2013 we feel really good in terms of having similar kinds of growth rates going into next year and beyond. In terms of where we need more capacity, obviously in Arizona, we need more capacity, and we\u2019re well on track to be able to do that. We talked about expanding our footprint in India. We just think that\u2019s a really high growth and interesting market. You can imagine that we\u2019re actually \u2013 we still have a little bit more capacity left in Frankfurt too, but Frankfurt is another market that we\u2019re regularly looking at we\u2019re well situated in expanding our campus in Amsterdam. So that\u2019s good. London, believe it or not, we\u2019re probably going to be back into the market in London again. So there\u2019s a number of markets, but as you can imagine, is that we\u2019re constantly out to expand it. But right now, I would say that our real estate plan and what we have currently under our control is we feel really good to be able to maintain these growth rates. I mean never say never in terms of acquisitions. We don\u2019t see anything on the horizon, but do we look at kind of what I call brownfield opportunities like we did with Frankfurt too or even when we entered the Amsterdam market. We constantly look at whether it\u2019s better to buy a piece of greenfield land or a brownfield asset that can be rapidly expanded. But I think you can probably think in your mind that mostly what we\u2019re looking at is expanding our land bank in terms of greenfield.\nBarry Hytinen: Eric, just to add on, this is Barry. I would say as it relates to pricing, it\u2019s been quite good, and we see that continuing to lift across our data center portfolio. You would see that in our mark-to-market has been improving. And continuing to run a little bit ahead of our expectations, and that\u2019s a little bit of a lagging indicator. So you\u2019ll see more lift there. You\u2019ve seen our new and expansion leases signing at higher levels on a per kilowatt basis, both in the quarter and versus last year, and our renewed leases are coming in better. So that, together with the fact that, churn is running kind of at or below expectations, we feel very good about what the team is doing in our data center business. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is a follow-up question from Sheila McGrath from Evercore. Please go ahead.\nSheila McGrath: Yes. It looks like you may have done some sale leaseback in the quarter, I thought let fewer buildings. Just wondering how much proceeds did you raise and if pricing has changed dramatically in the light of interest rates?\nBarry Hytinen: Hi, Sheila, it\u2019s Barry. Thanks for the question. You\u2019re right. We did do a few transactions. We had about $91 million of proceeds in the quarter. Year-to-date, that\u2019s about $96 million. I continue to expect we\u2019ll probably do for the full year, something like $150 million, maybe a touch more than that in terms of total proceeds. And notwithstanding your point about the market, we continue to find there is a tremendous appetite for industrial assets out there. And we are able to transact in \u2013 both in terms of on cap rates as well as on lease terms that are very favorable to us. And as you know, that\u2019s been part of our capital allocation strategy for some time. So we\u2019ll continue to do that is my expectation. Thanks for the question, Sheila.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session and the Iron Mountain second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. We thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation and you may now disconnect. Take care.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bill Meaney",
            "content": "Thank you, Gillian, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our second quarter results. Our team delivered another quarter of record results, further demonstrating our resilience in pricing power as the world navigates difficult market conditions and global instability. Our dedicated team continues to develop new and innovative solutions for the ever-evolving needs of our customers. Our durable business model and strong customer relationships consistently drive value for our customers and ultimately, our shareholders. Our record second quarter results delivered our highest ever quarterly revenue of $1.29 billion, representing 13% total organic revenue growth and an all-time record for EBITDA of $455 million, in spite of significant FX headwinds. These results are further proof of why we continue to be so encouraged by the increased demand for our services across key markets. Pricing and positive volume trends continue to benefit us in this quarter as we reflected in our organic storage rental revenue growth of 8.2%. As we have been sharing with you over the past few quarters, we have been growing quickly, even faster than our own expectations. A major driver for this growth is a direct benefit from our continued innovation, which has increased the size of the total addressable market for our products and services by 12 times to $120 billion, most of which is in faster-growing sectors. Accordingly, we are forecasting revenue growth to continue to accelerate in the back half of the year, driven by strong revenue management in our Global RIM business unit, growth in our data center business, digital information management solutions and improving trends in downstream demand for our hyperscale asset life cycle management or ALM business, which we acquired through the acquisition of ITRenew in January of this year.  I now would like to take this opportunity to share a few highlights of our customer wins. To begin with, our records management business, we have had a long-standing relationship with a major global accounting organization for more than 20 years. They were in the midst of reviewing their records management program when they learned of our Smart Sort solution. We calculated that Smart Sort could help them classify and destroy co-mingled records that have various retention schedules and a much faster and more cost-efficient way than if they were to do so in-house. This led to a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the power of our tools and techniques, which resulted in a deal that closed month sooner and expanded the records management program we performed for them across not only the outsourced records but their in-house records as well. Moreover, this win has already led to other exciting conversations with the customer about digital transformation opportunities. The deal has also opened more opportunities with the customer in Europe and the Asia Pacific region. On the digital solutions side, we recently won a contract with a large insurance and financial services company in the United States. They had previously only used us for shredding services, aligned with the acceleration of the digitization initiatives, they needed solutions to help them create greater business efficiencies whilst maintaining data security for the sensitive information their company handles every day. We provided a cloud-based solution to further support their work from anywhere initiatives by delivering information to their associates wherever they are in a secure and easy-to-access manner. Our team listened to the customers' needs and tailored a near-site Digital Mailroom solution to effectively meet their needs by leveraging an Iron Mountain owned and operated record center located near the customers' headquarters. As a result, we will digitize and distribute 10 million pieces of mail annually. As part of the special handling process, we will also leverage our InSight solution for checks and other items deemed to be sensitive. Over time, we expect to leverage the full suite of InSight solutions to process all of their mail, leveraging workflow automation through the use of our embedded artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities. This innovative solution will dramatically improve mail processing times through automated routing as well as classification and governance. These wins demonstrate the merits of strong customer loyalty, coupled with our solution-oriented approach in serving our customers. We are sharply focused on understanding their job to be done in delivering solutions, which are both innovative and impactful. Now to switch gears, I'd like to share a recent data restoration and migration win that led to an ALM win, thanks to a deep and trusted relationship with one of our customers, a large Australian bank. They have been growing through acquisition and as part of their integration plans have been decommissioning their data centers to move to a large cloud provider. To help enable this transition, we recognize that they would benefit from better access to their data on tapes, leading to one of our biggest data restoration and migration services contracts. This is in and of itself a great win, but it led us to an even larger opportunity to assist this long-standing customer. Based on our strong partnership, we were able to help the customer manage their decommissioned data center assets by offering an introduction to our ALM services. This win is an important entry point and shows our ability to help our customers solve multiple business challenges. It also reinforces the cross-sell opportunity in ALM. In our ALM segment, in addition to the Australian bank, this quarter, we closed a deal with another large global bank, whereby Iron Mountain will provide on-site media destruction and data center equipment recycling to 42 data centers, campus locations and branch offices. The program will also expand to corporate and user assets in multiple global locations. This customer contacted Iron Mountain in January of 2022 to inquire about our secure IT asset disposition services due to poor performance from their incumbent vendor. Our team engaged with the bank's key stakeholders to discuss their service requirements, data security policy and pain points in order to best position our solution. Our best-in-class logistics, asset processing capabilities, data security practices, transparent reporting, and strong client relationships were critical to securing the win. Moreover, our acquisition earlier this year of ITRenew and the resulting ability to in-source all asset processing capabilities in the U.S. convince this customer that we have the strongest capability set to service them. We are also pleased to report another ALM win with a large cloud customer wherein we were awarded part of a $60 million global RFP. The customer currently uses a multi-vendor approach with a vendor assigned per region. ITRenew was the largest provider to them in North America for value recovery and on-site drive destruction. Now that Iron Mountain has completed the acquisition, the customer has additionally awarded us their Irish business, along with expansion of the North American business to include shredding and recycling hard disk drives. We won this business in part due to our track record of achieving the highest value for the resale of decommissioned components, our global footprint and our excellence in asset tracking. We are very encouraged by the continued growth of IT assets contracted to us for disposal as well as the wins with new and existing clients. However, like all global businesses exposed to computing equipment, the latest COVID-19 shutdowns in China have had a negative short-term impact. This impact has been most particularly pronounced in May and June. There is a higher-than-normal backlog of material, which we hold on consignment that cannot be sold until we can deliver it to the manufacturers in China who are using the recycled components in their goods. Whilst China's zero-COVID policy makes it hard to predict when manufacturing rhythms will return to normal, we do expect to see an acceleration of our sell-through once the situation does indeed normalize. In summary, the continued growth we have seen in the upstream supply of IT equipment needing to be securely and safely recycled further increases our excitement about this sector once downstream demand for recycled IT components reverts back to its usual levels. Finally, our data center business has been extremely active this quarter, and we successfully completed 83 megawatts of leasing. This included a 72-megawatt lease for two buildings on our Northern Virginia campus. Both of these facilities are effectively stabilized as we have pre-leased 100% of the capacity to a Fortune 100 company. Today, we are happy to announce a joint venture for these assets with a subsidiary of Hana Financial, a global real estate firm. Full build-out of these two sites is expected in the third quarter of 2025, and Iron Mountain will be responsible for managing the design and development of the data center shell as well as administrating the leases. Also in this quarter, we signed a hyperscale tenant on our Phoenix, Arizona campus. With this new lease, the customer has existing capacity in three of our locations. This win increases their geographic presence with us as well as introducing the client to the Phoenix market for the first time. We've also been active on colocation this quarter in our data center business. We had a new customer win with one of the largest managed service providers, which has existing data centers in North America and Europe, and we're looking to gain entry into strategic emerging markets such as India. To that end, we were able to accommodate this customer through our Web Werks, JV, in Mumbai for data center capacity. When we originally entered India through this JV, we operated in three markets. We have spent much of the last year focused on securing land to expand our footprint in our existing markets as well as two additional new markets now. We believe as we work through planning and permissioning on these parcels, we will have over 100 megawatts of sellable capacity in the Indian market over the next couple of years. Having personally visited India already twice this year. I and we remain very excited about \u2013 about the opportunities we are seeing in this exciting market, both for data center as well as our business more broadly. These wins show how our focus towards building an extraordinary set of synergistic and customer-centric solutions, combined with our global reach and footprint both differentiates and propels our growth forward.  As we have discussed before, we are focused on driving commercial activity, including cross-selling our solutions to our customers, and this quarter, nearly all of our data center bookings were signed with existing customers of Iron Mountain. To conclude, I am incredibly proud our team has continued to build on our growth momentum, expand our portfolio and not only meet but exceed our customers' evolving needs. This is evidenced by our outstanding and record results this morning, including our highest ever revenue and all-time record EBITDA as well as the highest rate of organic revenue growth in the last 25 years. We expect to continue to build on these results as we further the growth of our business based upon a strong global footprint, a powerful portfolio of products and services and our deep customer relationships. We have a very exciting future, and I can't wait to see all we continue to accomplish together. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry. Thanks. I'll start, Shlomo and then I think Barry will give you a little bit more specifics in terms of how to think about it from a modeling standpoint. So I appreciate the question. similar to what \u2013 when you and I were chatting at your conference here, I guess, a couple of months \u2013 almost two months back, summer is almost gone, is that it's pretty much \u2013 as we were speaking about is that it's really a tale of two cities. So as I said in my kind of remarks talking about a number of the customer wins that we've had around IT asset destruction and asset life cycle management, it's been a really strong quarter. And that's really where we're getting the volume of material that we then sell that gets recycled into new equipment going forward. So the \u2013 what I would call the upstream in terms of the amount that's coming to us because of our customer reach, the logistics that we have our know-how to be able to do that in a safe and secure way is that we're sitting on very strong inventories that's on consignment to us. So this is stuff that we hold on consignment and then sell on behalf of our customers and ourselves or the suppliers of the components and ourselves, to the downstream manufacturers that reuse that in new component. So the upstream bit is really performing to our expectations, and we feel really good about that. The downstream bit right now is primarily in China. And as we've seen the lockdowns even more stronger in May and June than we expected, and they continue with the rolling lockdowns because of their zero COVID policy. So we're \u2013 it's hard to predict exactly when that will open. The good news is we have the inventory to sell. The minute it does open and every indication is that it will normalize in the foreseeable future. But the timing of that is difficult to predict. So a long way of saying is we're really pleased with the performance on how it's resonated with our customers to actually even exceed our expectations and how many customers have come to us to give us their volume of components to be disposed of either to be destroyed completely or recycled downstream. In terms of selling those components downstream, which is where we recognize most of the revenue, it's been hung up mainly because of the \u2013 well, entirely because of the COVID, zero COVID policy in China and the rolling shutdowns. And, Barry, maybe you want to talk a little bit about how we see the rest of the year shaping up. Good morning, Sheila. I appreciate the question. So it's really mainly new businesses, right? I mean, the business has rebounded from COVID, but we kind of saw most of that rebound, to be honest with you, towards the tail end of last year. And there are still certain countries that are kind of going through periodic shutdowns, we talked about China \u2013 we were talking about China in terms of ALM, but we see the same thing on the records management side in terms of the rolling COVID shutdowns in China. So the growth that we printed in terms of services is mainly the new areas. And I highlighted some of the wins that we're driving that on our digital transformation services. So this is really a direct result of taking ourselves from a $10 billion total addressable market for our products and services to the $120 billion [ph]. So that's where you're seeing the growth is in those new products and services that are part of that 12 times expansion of our total addressable market. Good morning, Brendan. It's great to have you on the call. Let me talk about the strategic rationale of why we decided to put that into a joint venture. And then \u2013 or to do that deal that way? And then I'll ask Barry, he can give you a little bit more of the financial details. So first of all, we don't do \u2013 first, we don't do a lot of build-to-suit or powered shell. And this was for a customer that is one of our largest customers globally in a number of our sites, and they had a specific requirement for Northern Virginia. The other aspect about this particular client is it allowed us to materially expand almost 100 megawatts \u2013 roughly around 130 megawatts, 135 megawatts of IT load that we can actually support on that Northern Virginia campus by doing this partnership with this client because we were able to use that to bring in a substation on to our site and we've completely secured the power now for the entire Northern Virginia campus. So even net of the 72 megawatts that we are actually leasing as a powered shell is that we've actually increased the capacity of that site by another 70-megawatt is another 70 megawatts. So that was really, really important to us. And so the \u2013 and it's a great return on the powered shell. So that's really our motivation first of all for doing that kind of contract. In terms of why we joint ventured it, it really was very compelling from a financial standpoint. I'll let Barry talk a little bit about the financial aspects of the deal of bringing in a joint venture partner because I should also add, this is a 100% stabilized asset, right? So we always look at fully stabilized assets and say is that something \u2013 we're focusing most of our capital on development opportunities, not stabilized assets. So we saw that as an opportunity. But then especially when we looked at the opportunity, the financial aspects were just very compelling. Thanks, Eric. I'll start. The \u2013 I think first of all, yes, it's a great problem to have. We've been so successful this year in terms of leasing. You're right to point out that we are making sure that we have capacity to continue to grow at these kind of rates. So the funnel that we have in front of us right now, if you think about we have 118 megawatts leased to date this year with \u2013 and we said \u2013 we gave you guidance that we'll do at least 130 megawatts this year. So we feel obviously very comfortable about that. And going into next year, we don't see any slowdown in terms of the rate of growth. I mean the 72 megawatts that we did in Northern Virginia, I wouldn't say that's a one-off because we continue to see in the pipeline similar types of opportunities, whether or not we'll pursue all those is we're constantly make decisions based on the specifics around that requirement. But we are lucky that we're in a situation where, yes, as I said, we don't necessarily bid it everything that comes by, so we can actually be a bit more selective. And we feel really good about the funnel. We'll give you, obviously guidance for next year as we get closer to the end of this year. But the \u2013 we feel really good in terms of having similar kinds of growth rates going into next year and beyond. In terms of where we need more capacity, obviously in Arizona, we need more capacity, and we're well on track to be able to do that. We talked about expanding our footprint in India. We just think that's a really high growth and interesting market. You can imagine that we're actually \u2013 we still have a little bit more capacity left in Frankfurt too, but Frankfurt is another market that we're regularly looking at we're well situated in expanding our campus in Amsterdam. So that's good. London, believe it or not, we're probably going to be back into the market in London again. So there's a number of markets, but as you can imagine, is that we're constantly out to expand it. But right now, I would say that our real estate plan and what we have currently under our control is we feel really good to be able to maintain these growth rates. I mean never say never in terms of acquisitions. We don't see anything on the horizon, but do we look at kind of what I call brownfield opportunities like we did with Frankfurt too or even when we entered the Amsterdam market. We constantly look at whether it's better to buy a piece of greenfield land or a brownfield asset that can be rapidly expanded. But I think you can probably think in your mind that mostly what we're looking at is expanding our land bank in terms of greenfield."

            "name": "Barry Hytinen",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our results. In the second quarter, our team delivered strong performance across all metrics, meeting top-line projections while exceeding projections on EBITDA and AFFO. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.29 billion, grew 15% year-on-year or 18% excluding the effects of the stronger U.S. dollar. Incidentally, the dollar strengthened significantly since the time of our call in April and resulted in about $15 million of incremental revenue headwind versus our prior projections for the second quarter. A key highlight in the quarter is our organic storage revenue, which grew 8.2%, reflecting strong revenue management and data center commencements. Total service revenue increased 34% to $536 million with 21% organic growth. In total, this was driven by strength in our core service offerings, including digital solutions and our acquisition of ITRenew. Adjusted EBITDA was $455 million, up 12% on a reported basis and up 15% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. We had strong contributions from revenue growth driven by pricing and data center storage along with ongoing productivity improvements. The higher level of EBITDA was despite the significant impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and the disposition of our software escrow business last June. Combined, those two items are about $17 million of year-on-year headwind. The deconsolidation last quarter of the former OSG records business in Russia offset the benefit from ITRenew. With solid flow-through, second quarter EBITDA exceeded the expectations we shared on our last call by $5 million on a reported basis and by $10 million using the same FX rates included in our April projections. Adjusted EBITDA margin was better than we projected and improved 80 basis points sequentially versus the first quarter of 2022, driven by price and mix. AFFO was $271 million or $0.93 on a per share basis, up $25 million and $0.08, respectively, from the second quarter of last year. In both cases, we exceeded our expectations. Now turning to segment performance. In the second quarter, our Global RIM business delivered revenue of $1.1 billion, an increase of $74 million from last year or 7% on a reported basis. On an organic constant currency basis, revenue increased 11%. Constant currency storage rental revenue growth of 6.4% exceeded our expectations for the quarter. These results reflect the strong performance of our commercial team and their focus on selling the full suite of products across our portfolio. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $469 million, an increase of $45 million year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was up 120 basis points year-on-year, reflecting pricing strength and productivity.  Turning to our global data center business. Our team delivered another successful quarter of executing our strategy. On a revenue basis, we delivered 30% year-on-year growth, and a particular highlight for me is the 24% organic storage revenue growth. As we noted on our last call, we signed a 72-megawatt lease on our Virginia campus with a long-standing hyperscale customer for a near build-to-suit. As Bill noted, we have recently established a joint venture for this asset, whereby we will retain a 55% interest and generate a strong return. We completed an additional 11 megawatts of leasing in the quarter for a total of 83 megawatts. We are confident in our 130-megawatt projection for new and expansion leasing this year, thanks to the momentum from the first half of the year, combined with our strong bookings pipeline. Turning to our corporate and other business. Revenue increased 156% year-on-year, driven by our ALM business, including the ITRenew acquisition and organic growth in our Fine Arts business. For modeling purposes, let me call out a couple of minor changes we've made to our reporting to be consistent with how we are managing the company. First, all of our ALM business is now included in corporate and other, whereas previously, our legacy IT asset disposal business was in Global RIM. Secondly, our Entertainment Services business and certain costs that support our commercial organization have been moved from corporate into Global RIM. We have updated our historical financials to allow for comparability and those will be made available on our investor relations website later today. In our asset life cycle management business, as Bill mentioned, we are very optimistic with regard to the underlying trends in this category. And importantly, our committed backlog remains strong and growing and currently sits at a record level as we speak to you today. Turning to capital recycling. In the second quarter, we generated approximately $91 million. Total capital expenditures were $188 million, of which $156 million was growth and $32 million was recurring. We continue to expect total capital expenditures for the full year to be approximately $950 million, which includes $625 million for data center development and $155 million for recurring CapEx. Turning to the balance sheet. With strong EBITDA performance, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.3 times, which reflects a sequential improvement from the first quarter. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term range of 4.5 times to 5.5 times. We continue to expect to exit the year at levels within our target range. And with our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early October. On a trailing four-quarter basis, our payout ratio is now 68%, approaching our long-term target range of low to mid-60s. Now turning to our outlook. For the full year, reflecting our performance in the first half and strong outlook, we expect to deliver revenue at the midpoint of our guidance range despite an additional $60 million of foreign exchange headwind in the second half. And for EBITDA and AFFO, with continued pricing and productivity, we expect to achieve the midpoint or beyond of our full year guidance ranges. Now, let me share our expectations for the third quarter. We expect total revenue to be approximately $1.3 billion, which represents 15% growth year-on-year. I would like to note that we have considerable FX headwinds, both year-on-year and sequentially. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $465 million in the third quarter, which represents 11% year-on-year growth. And we expect AFFO to be approximately $280 million. To conclude, the performance of our business is strong. Our team continues to drive higher levels of growth, and we thank them for their collective efforts and dedication. Our tour is strong with margin is increasing, thanks to pricing and productivity and our investments are driving considerable growth across our business. We look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming investor event on September 20, at which time we will have the opportunity to discuss our strategy to drive considerable future growth. The event will take place in Northern Virginia and include a tour of our data-centric campus. For those of you who cannot join in person, a live webcast of the presentation will be available. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. Hi, George, it's Barry. Thanks for the question. The team is doing very, very well with respect to revenue management. You would have seen that our organic storage rental revenue growth on an organic basis was up over 8% in the quarter. That marked a nice acceleration even from the higher levels in the first quarter. And in our Global RIM business that was over 6% on that metric. So volume, as you would have seen on an organic basis \u2013 in total is up about 2%, but on an organic basis is very consistent with our expectations of being just slightly up, so about 50 basis points. So what you're seeing is a very strong contribution from revenue management coming through. And I'll just add on to the second part of your question and note that we are continuing to see incremental opportunities for pricing. And in fact, we will be seeing us move forward with additional pricing actions later in the third quarter that will fully benefit us as we move through the year and then give us a little bit of an incremental lift next year. So those are just in light of what's going on in the economic activity and the fact that our existing revenue management program has been so well received, we see the opportunity to continue to move higher. So you will see that going forward. Thanks for the question. Yes, sure. Thanks, Shlomo, for the question. You \u2013 a couple of things you asked. On the actual contribution, you've calculated it correct; it was about $65 million. So that was just a touch up from the first quarter. And as we \u2013 as Bill referenced, as we said in early June in light of what we were seeing in the second half of May as well as the continued to see in June in light of the COVID shutdowns that Bill referenced. We certainly, that was below our expectations. That said, in terms of going forward, two things. One is we are planning and in the guidance that I gave you for the third quarter and the target for the full year. We have just assumed that our ITRenew contribution would be consistent going forward at that level or even maybe even a touch below that. And I think that's a conservative way to position it because as Bill mentioned, we and so many other technology-oriented companies don't know when China will reopen. But I think once it does, to his point, we have a very strong committed backlog and we have a good amount of consigned inventory that can sell through. I just didn't want to plan for it to get better. So I view that as \u2013 that's why I described that as I think, conservative because as it opens up, we will be selling through. So we feel very good about the committed backlog and the level of activity we're seeing from our upstream clients. And as that market reopens, I think we will see a very good sell-through. Thank you. Sheila, its Barry. The only thing I would add on to that is specifically to build on Bill's point around digital solutions; we grew high teens in the quarter, which was the best comp we've had on that specific line in several quarters. And in fact, it's against our hardest comp last year. So it really speaks to the fact that our digital business is taking hold and going from strength-to-strength. I'll note that we had a very strong contribution from our legacy ITAD business as well. That's in the asset life cycle management business, as you know and that business is growing at the very rates and we see considerable incremental opportunity for that to grow, in fact, just to be clear, it's accelerating in terms of its level of growth, so we feel great about that business. And then it's notable to say that our pricing continues to be up across the business that includes services. So thanks for the question, Sheila. Yes. Hi, Brendan, thanks for joining the call. In terms of the JV, just to be clear, we'll operate it will, of course, be respond for the construction, the management et cetera. We saw it as an opportunity to leverage third party capital, which allows us to essentially use someone else's balance sheet and then use ours to go further our development pipeline. As you know, we've got a lot of capacity to continue to build out. And as Bill mentioned, this is effectively a fully stabilized asset before we even break ground. And in light of the still very significant investor interest in data center assets, we saw it as a compelling incremental opportunity to even further improve the return that much more as the pre-lease is very attractive to the capital markets. So we'll maintain a 55% interest in it. We have traditional benefits from the joint venture structure that you'd appreciate as a data center analyst, and I'll just note that we were able to sell that at a sub four and a half cap. And again, it's fully stabilized. So we view it as a compelling capital allocation opportunity. Thanks for the question. Eric, just to add on, this is Barry. I would say as it relates to pricing, it's been quite good, and we see that continuing to lift across our data center portfolio. You would see that in our mark-to-market has been improving. And continuing to run a little bit ahead of our expectations, and that's a little bit of a lagging indicator. So you'll see more lift there. You've seen our new and expansion leases signing at higher levels on a per kilowatt basis, both in the quarter and versus last year, and our renewed leases are coming in better. So that, together with the fact that, churn is running kind of at or below expectations, we feel very good about what the team is doing in our data center business. Thanks. Hi, Sheila, it's Barry. Thanks for the question. You're right. We did do a few transactions. We had about $91 million of proceeds in the quarter. Year-to-date, that's about $96 million. I continue to expect we'll probably do for the full year, something like $150 million, maybe a touch more than that in terms of total proceeds. And notwithstanding your point about the market, we continue to find there is a tremendous appetite for industrial assets out there. And we are able to transact in \u2013 both in terms of on cap rates as well as on lease terms that are very favorable to us. And as you know, that's been part of our capital allocation strategy for some time. So we'll continue to do that is my expectation. Thanks for the question, Sheila."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Iron Mountain First Quarter 2022 Earnings. Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Gillian Tiltman, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Sir, Tilman, please go ahead.\nGillian Tiltman: Thank you, Brenda. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. On today's call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We are joined today by Bill Meaney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Barry Hytinen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we'll open up the lines for Q&A. Today's earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's earnings materials, the safe harbor language on Slide 2 and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliations to these measures in our supplemental financial information. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.\nWilliam Meaney: Thank you, Gillian, and thank you all for taking time to join us today. Our team delivered exceptional results for the first quarter of 2022, exceeding the expectations we provided on our last call. This record performance is reflective of our broad offerings, deep customer relationships, resilient business model, and dedicated team. Whilst we are thrilled to report these results, its important to take a moment to acknowledge the events happening in Ukraine and impacting the world at large. As we navigate this devastating conflict, we continue to prioritize our Mountaineers and their families. To that end, I am comforted to share that all 65 of our colleagues from Ukraine continue to check in with our global risk, safety and security team on a daily basis and all are safe. Some families have made the difficult decision to migrate to other countries. And I am proud of how our fellow Mountaineers in the region have offered assistance in providing comfort and resettlement. I continue to be both inspired by and grateful to all the teams in Ukraine and the surrounding countries who have united to support each other in this crisis. I visited the region twice recently and I remain humbled by the strength of our colleagues. And we remain committed to supporting our effective Mountaineers and continue to hope and pray for a rapid resolution of this war. Now if I may, let me begin our discussion of our first quarter results, a record for the company. We achieved our highest ever quarterly revenue of $1.25 billion, exceeding our expectations of $1.2 billion, yielding 10% or total organic revenue growth and an all-time record EBITDA of $431 million. We continue to be encouraged by the increased demand of our services across key markets fueling these results. As pricing and positive volume trends continue to benefit us, we delivered organic storage rental revenue growth of 6.8% in the first quarter. We drove double-digit growth in digital offerings, including data center, GDS, digital transformation services, and ALM or asset lifecycle management. As you know, we've been growing quickly and over the past two years, we have been growing faster than even our expectations. I have shared with you previously, how our continued build out of new products and services, as well as growth in these underlying markets has now taken our total addressable market to over $120 billion, accelerating us on our growth trajectory path. Turning to our ALM business, we achieved several solid wins that spanned industries, many of which were made possible through the strong combination of Iron Mountain, and the recently acquired ITRenew, which has been performing even better than we had anticipated. An example of the power of this combination can be seen in our expansion on a customer win with a large financial institution that we were originally awarded in early 2021. With the additional expertise we acquired with ITRenew, we expanded our offerings to include market leading recycling expertise, as the whole world is focused on how to better embrace the concept around a more circular economy and reduce our impact on the environment. Along with this added expertise, we now have a full set of capabilities which are truly differentiating in the eyes of not only this customer, but also most of our global customers. Another ALM win this quarter was for a task order for Iron Mountain to provide on-site media destruction and ALM services to 18 US locations, including data centers and office locations, in which all IT asset types will be included has in scope. Several key factors in awarding us the RFP included secure logistics, global footprint, partner network and existing trusted relationships. For this customer, we expect to expand services to multiple regions, including the United Kingdom, Brazil, India, and Canada. These are just some of the wins this quarter, which demonstrate the strength of our expanded ALM platform, which will directly benefit from IRMs 225,000 loyal customer base, which includes 95% of the Fortune 1000. Our continued drive in building an extraordinary set of synergistic and customer centric solutions, combined with our global reach and footprint propels our growth forward. Now let me share a few examples of how we've been empowering our customer\u2019s success and growth through our diverse digital transformation solutions or GDS offerings, coupled with our customer focus. In the first quarter, we received fully executed service orders for two large deals in the energy vertical for one of the world's largest oil and gas companies. Both projects will allow our customer to identify and access dark data to provide quicker decisions and to better manage their assets. The total value of these two deals represents more than $12 million. We are looking forward to replicating this success with other energy customers. Turning to the Asia Pacific region, I would like to highlight a large win with an Asian full service universal bank that I had the honor to visit in March. Iron Mountain will provide digitization service - services to assist our customer\u2019s local compliance requirements of digital [ph] which are anti-money laundering related requirements for a total contract value of $4 million. We are also thrilled to report a customer win that has resulted in a five year $8 million Digital Mailroom deal leveraging our content services platform or InSight. This Fortune 500 Mutual Insurance customer after handling their own mail in house for more than 100 years came to us with this opportunity which was both complex and emotional for the customer. Our success here is a direct result of our long standing strategic partnership. We also continue to grow our business with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada or IRCC, which facilitates the arrival of immigrants, provides protection to refugees and offers programming to help newcomers settle in Canada. In 2020, Iron Mountain began supporting IRCC with imaging a variety of application forms. There was an immediate need to process a backlog of applications with your staff working from home as a result of the pandemic. Today, we have processed approximately 115,000 applications, representing over 14.7 million images. Building from this initial work in Toronto, we grew the project by securing an additional contract worth $2.9 million. In addition, we recently awarded a 1.3 million RFP to expand this image initiative to Atlantic and Western Canada. This would not have been possible without our work in supporting this customer from day one, positioning Iron Mountain as a critical business partner. In our Crozier business, we are pleased to highlight our installation of a piece of art entitled just what is your position by a distinguished LA artist at the new terminal at LAX. This installation highlights our team's expertise and precision with regard to complicated installation that will now be on display for millions of travelers. Last, but surely not least, turning to our data center business. You will recall that we initially expected to lease 50 megawatts this year. By the end of Q1 however, we had already signed a total of 35 megawatts, including a single tenant of 27 megawatts for our London-2 location. We are excited about the continued demand we see across Europe, as we bring on added capacity to the market in the coming months. Since March, we have sold an additional 72 megawatt lease on our Northern Virginia campus. This is a near build-to-suit type of agreement where we are responsible for leasing on a long term basis the land, the shell and a large portion of the installed MEP or mechanical electrical plant. Iron Mountain's data center solution met the security, scalability and interconnection requirements of the customer in this critical global data center market. The lease is expected to commence and begin ramping mid-year 2024 and it \u2013 and has a term of 15 years. Finally, I would like to share with you a joint ESG and data center win. As we have said before, ESG continues to be an important focus for us, shone through many years of producing annual corporate sustainability reports outlining our commitments and progress for nearly a decade. We recently announced a design certification of our Phoenix Arizona AZP-2 data center, the first data center in North America to receive BREEAM certification. We are taking the lead on demonstrating the steps facility owners can take to ensure that their data centers are both efficient and resilient. Design for the facility has been certified under BREEAMs new construction standard, a global recognized green building certification for new developments and achieved the BREEAM excellent rating. This continued focus on building standards, together with already having long term renewable power purchasing agreements which offset at more than 100% of our data center energy requirements places us firmly on the path to reach our 2040 commitments to use 100% renewable energy, 100% of the time. To conclude, we continue to build on our growth momentum and expand our portfolio to exceed our customers evolving needs, as evidenced by our outstanding results this morning, including our highest ever revenue and all-time record EBITDA. With our strong footprint, powerful portfolio and deep customer relationships, we are confident that we will continue this momentum. The future is bright, and I can't wait to see how we can accomplish. With that. I'll turn the call over to Barry.\nBarry Hytinen: Thanks, Bill. And thank you all for joining us to discuss our results. In the first quarter, our team delivered strong performance exceeding the expectations we provided on our last call. On a reported basis revenue of $1.25 billion grew 15% year-on-year with total organic revenue up 10%. Revenue was over $20 million ahead of the expectations we shared on our last call. To me, a key highlight in the quarter is our - organic storage revenue which grew 6.8% in the quarter, reflecting our strong pricing and data center commencements. Total service revenue increased 33% to $497 million, driven equally by the ITRenew acquisition and our core service offerings. In fact, organic service revenue increased $59 million or 16%, driven by strong growth across our service lines, including digital solutions. As revenue associated with our traditional transportation services was still down 10% from pre-pandemic levels, we are even more pleased with this performance. Adjusted EBITDA was $431 million, up 13% on a reported basis and up 15% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. We have strong contributions from revenue growth, driven by pricing and data center storage, along with ongoing productivity improvements resulting in EBITDA growth of $50 million. The higher level of EBITDA was despite the impact of the stronger US dollar and the disposition of the software escrow business last June. Combined those two items are about $14 million of year-on-year headwind. Partially offsetting those, is the recent ITRenew acquisition. With solid flow through first quarter EBITDA exceeded the expectations we shared on our last call by $6 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin was better than we projected. And while it was lower year-on-year driven by the inclusion of ITRenew, our core Iron Mountain business continue to deliver improved profitability year-on-year, even with investments to fund further growth. AFFO was $264 million or $0.91 on a per share basis, up $29 million and $0.10 respectively, from the first quarter of last year. In both cases, we exceeded our expectations. Now let me spend a moment discussing the impact of the war in Ukraine. In late March, we determined it was appropriate to deconsolidate the majority of the OSG records business, which is principally doing business in Russia. As a result, we wrote down our investments to a fair value of zero and accordingly recognized a charge through the other expense line. Going forward, we will no longer be including these entities in our financial statements. Also in our other expense line this quarter, we have a gain on the MakeSpace Clutter merger as I mentioned on our last call. The deconsolidation does not impact our business in Ukraine, which continues to be included in our results. With reduced revenue and a conservative position on accounts receivable, we recognized a loss in our Ukrainian business during the first quarter. I want to echo Bill's comments. We continue to keep all of our Mountaineers in their families in our thoughts during this ongoing human tragedy. Now turning to segment performance. In the first quarter, our Global RIM business delivered revenue of $1.04 billion, an increase of $76 million from last year or 8% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis revenue increased 10%. Constant currency storage rental revenue growth of 6.4% or 4.6% on an organic basis reflects our focus on revenue management, and solid volume trends which exceeded our expectations for the quarter. I will note, that in our supplemental financial information, we have shared a reconciliation of our volume with and without the deconsolidated entities to allow for comparability going forward. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $451 million, an increase in $43 million year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 100 basis points year-on-year, reflecting continued pricing strength and productivity. Turning to our global data center business, we are very pleased with our results. On a revenue basis, we delivered 36% year-on-year growth or 33% organic growth. A particular highlight for me is the 26% organic storage revenue growth we delivered in the quarter. As Bill discussed, the team has done exceptionally well with new bookings. And with that we are raising our full year outlook on new and expansion leasing to 130 megawatts, up from our prior expectation of 50 megawatts. Now to provide some historical context to that, we leased 10 megawatts in 2018, 17 megawatts in 2019, 31 megawatts in 2020, excluding our joint venture in Frankfurt and 49 megawatts last year. With the strength of our performance in the first quarter, we now project full year data center revenue growth of at least 20% year-on-year, with even higher rates of growth for storage. With our strong prior year bookings and recent commencement, we have very good visibility to revenue. Turning to our corporate and other business, revenue increased 146% year-on-year driven by the ITRenew acquisition and organic growth in our closure business. For modeling purposes, please note that our legacy IT asset disposal business continues to grow 8% [ph] in the Global RIM segment. Total capital expenditures were $150 million, of which $115 million was growth and $35 million was recurring. In 2022, we now expect total capital expenditures to be approximately $950 million, up $100 million from our prior expectations. This reflects an increase to our data center development CapEx plans, given our strong leasing year-to-date and our very positive outlook. Turning to the balance sheet. With strong EBITDA performance, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.4 times. This is an improvement from last year and better than the projection we shared on our last call. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term range of 4.5 to 5.5 times. We continue to expect to exit the year at levels within our target range. As you may have seen in March, aligned with our growth plans, our team successfully refinanced our credit agreement which includes a $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and a $250 million term loan A facility. The amendment provides for nearly $550 million of additional borrowing, includes favorable terms and extends the maturity to March 2027. We want to thank our commercial lending group for their continued support. And with our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend at $0.62 per share to be paid in early July. On a trailing four quarter basis, our payout ratio is now 69%, approaching our long-term target range of low to mid 60%. And now turning to our outlook. We are pleased to reiterate our full year 2022 guidance. I should note that this is despite the impact of the deconsolidation and the stronger US dollar. With the closing of the ITRenew transaction, I thought it would be helpful to share our preliminary view on purchase accounting. We currently anticipate amortization of intangibles to be approximately $60 million annually. And with only two months of results in the first quarter, we amortized $10 million. Naturally these charges are included in our adjusted EPS and FFO. Now let me share our expectations for the second quarter. We expect total revenue to be approximately $1.3 billion. We estimate organic growth to be high single digits to approaching 10% in the second quarter. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $450 million and we expect AFFO to be approximately $260 million. The war in Ukraine and the deconsolidation is nearly $5 million headwind versus the second quarter of 2021 and sequentially versus the first quarter of 2022. In summary, our investments are accelerating our growth trajectory. Our customer relationships are strong, our core is performing well. And we continue to realize incremental pricing opportunities across our business. Our focus on higher growth segments, including data center, asset lifecycle management, and digital solutions are positioning us for continued success. I would like to thank our entire team for their strong contributions. We look forward to updating you on our progress following the second quarter. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question we have on the phone lines comes from Sheila McGrath of Evercore ISI. So please go ahead. I have opened your line.\nSheila McGrath: Yes. Good morning. You mentioned the addressable market for Iron Mountain expanding? I just wonder if you continue to look at M&A opportunities like ITRenew? And how would you look at financing those types of acquisitions? Would it be sale leaseback or non-core dispositions? Or would you consider common equity as making sense, given the share price gains?\nWilliam Meaney: Good morning, Sheila. Thank you for the question. So, I think the first is that we feel really good about the platform, not only the $120 billion total addressable market that we have, but the platform that we have in each of the poor - parts of the portfolio that attack that, if you will, or address that. So we don't see a need to do any, you know, large M&A type deals, like the ITRenew, because I think we now have market leading platforms pretty much in each of those - those areas that we're addressing. So we don't really see that. And we still think that we have a long ways to run in our share price.\nSheila McGrath: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nKevin McVeigh: Great, thanks so much. And congratulations on the results. Hey, the storage growth was really, really impressive, the organic, can you maybe unpack that a little bit in terms of what's kind of the pricing, the volume? And then how are you thinking about that, I guess, organically for the balance of the year?\nBarry Hytinen: Thanks, Kevin.\nKevin McVeigh: Hey, Barry.\nBarry Hytinen: We appreciate the comments. And we feel really - we feel really good about how things have been trending. If you look at our Global RIM storage rental revenue growth of 4.6% organic, the vast majority of that is prices, as you can see our organic volume is right in line with what we've been expecting. And so you know, it's been very good performance on pricing. And importantly, we continue to see more opportunity for pricing and, and that's the - on that expectation, I would advise you to think about pricing continue to be at this level or better for the remainder of the year. The other thing that really helped the total company's storage growth is our data center. You would note that our data center storage revenue was up considerably in the quarter. And they are two in light of both the team's phenomenal performance in terms of historic leasing, as well as recent deals and commencement. We expect to see considerable growth on that data center storage line, the entire year, as we were talking about last quarter. So we feel very well positioned, Kevin and appreciate the question.\nKevin McVeigh: Sure. And then just Barry, real quick. It looks like you took up the CapEx guidance. What was the free cash flow in the first quarter and how should we think about that for the full year?\nBarry Hytinen: Yeah, Kevin, I will tell you that - thanks for the question on the CapEx. I'll draw people's attention to the fact that we did increase the CapEx guidance by about $100 million versus our prior expectation. That reflects the fact that our data center development CapEx is up about $100 million. So I'm currently planning for $625 million or so of data center development CapEx for the full year. And that's reflecting the fact that the new leases that we've signed, together with continuing to be opportunistic about building the platform, you know, as you've seen, we've had phenomenal new leasing. And so it's sort of a great situation to be able to continue to invest in that business where we're seeing very nice returns. When you think about the model, I would say that you should be seeing a very considerable amount of free cash flow before discretionary in - when you work through our CAD, and we feel very good about how the - how the business is performing.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. You just Barry, it was 525 before going up to 625 on the data center, right?\nBarry Hytinen: That's correct, Kevin.\nKevin McVeigh: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have the next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Please go ahead when you're ready.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Hey, Bill, you'd miss me, if I didn't ask you this. But the RIM sequential volumes seem to have gone down about $1.7 million from 4Q to 1Q. I know last quarter, when I asked about it, there seem to be in a certain seasonality in terms of destructions and things like that from 3Q to 4Q. I'm just wondering if you could give us some more color on 4Q to 1Q, I understand that the company's got very strong pricing and being able to offset that in that way. But you know, the expectation was for the year - to end the year, you know, flat to potentially up on the volumes, I want to get some more color on, you know, the reason for kind of sequential decline? And whether you still expect bonds [ph] to be flat?\nWilliam Meaney: No, thanks. Thanks, Shlomo. Good morning. So at least I know that you're on. No. And well, first of all, the - in terms of physical volume, we said it's flat to slightly up to the year. But that's looking at our - across our portfolio of everything that we put in our warehouses around the globe, right. So in terms of managing the organic utilization of our facilities based on organic visible volume growth, we still expect that to be flat to slightly up and you know, in this quarter it was up as you see. So looking within records management, we always kind of consider that to be more flat to slightly down. And if you look at the trend, even between Q4 and Q1, and as you watch the business for a long time, you know that both Q4 and Q1, usually have a little bit of noise. And then because people tend to do their destruction programs, either at the end of the year, and some of that goes into the beginning of the year. So you'll always see a little bit noise. But I think if you look at the last say, you know, four quarters, you'll see a very consistent trend on what's happening to our physical volume around the records management. So, we feel really good where it's at. You know, it's kind of staying in that kind of flat to slightly down records management. Our other areas, in terms of physical volume storage is growing quite nicely. So overall, you know, we'd still remain kind of flat to up for the year in physical volume. And then of course, pricing takes that up.\nBarry Hytinen: Really, well. I mean, you know, we do have very strong pricing power. And, as we've always said that, you know, inflation, you know, whilst you know, we feel for folks, I mean, inflation is really hurting all of us in many different ways. For the business, it's actually a net positive because we're able to price ahead of inflation, and we have a high gross margin business, so it naturally expands the margins of the business.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have a question from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead when you're ready.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi. Barry, I just want to check on here how you think about the \u2013 of EBITDA divided by the low end of revenues and low end - the high end of EBITDA by the high end to revenues, I get 351 [ph], so above 35%. And then, you know, obviously, we just did 35 - 345, and they implied, you know, same approach for the second quarter to be 346. And so if you're looking for 351 for the year, and of course, I'm going to ask you is that the right way to think about it, you're talking about much higher than 35% EBITDA margins in the second half of the year to make 351, for the full year, and so you can imagine I'm going to ask you, why will the second half margins be notably higher than the first half this year?\nBarry Hytinen: Thanks, Andrew. You are thinking about that correctly. A couple things to think about. As we move through the year, we have improved mix coming through the business. We do naturally have, as you traditionally have seen in our business, since you followed us for so long, a level of upfront, first kind of quarter costs which ease, we have a level of improved mix going forward. We get more price as we move through the year. We also see very good flow through coming on the data center business. As I mentioned earlier, last quarter, we expect the data center margin to be slightly up year-on-year, and we see good flow through coming through in the back half there as well. And then, generally speaking, we will continue to comp with positive benefit from Project Summit and other ongoing productivity initiatives. So, you know, I would say first off, I should remind folks that in the first quarter, we did better on a margin basis than we anticipated. That's because the core Iron Mountain business performed very well in terms of productivity and pricing. And we see that trajectory continuing through the year. So sitting here, after one quarter, I feel quite good about where we are in the margin trajectory, Andrew.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have a question on the line from Nate Crossett of Berenberg. Sir, please go ahead when you're ready.\nWilliam Meaney: Operator, maybe put up the next question.\nOperator: The next question we have comes from Eric Luebchow from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead when you're ready.\nEric Luebchow: Hi. Good morning, everyone. So I was interested in the 72 megawatt data center, shell and land and MEP lease you mentioned. I imagine that's a pretty capital efficient lease structure, given its size. But maybe you could kind of give us some color on the returns you'd underwrite, to under that type of structure, the capital intensity? And then whether you're seeing more of these shell type deals versus a typical turnkey lease that you could do here in the future?\nWilliam Meaney: Hi, Nate [ph] So no, thanks for the question. Yeah, as you say, we were very pleased to sign this deal for our data center campus in Northern Virginia. There is a couple bits, we'll go into more detail on the second quarter call, because you can imagine that we just signed this agreement, as we come in. But as I said, it's - it's a near build to suit. I mean, we don't - we're not providing all the MEP. And we'll actually go into a little bit more details in terms of how the pieces come together. But besides the 72 megawatts, the other thing that we were very excited about, it allowed us to build further infrastructure on that side, bringing on a substation onto the campus, which is going to drive benefits, both in terms of upscaling the capacity, but also the cost to deliver on that on that campus. So there's a number of different pieces there that make this deal very attractive. But we'll give you more information on the second quarter call. But you're right to say that it's a very capital efficient structure. And with a great tenant on the backside for 15 years, so it allows us to finance it in a very efficient way.\nEric Luebchow: Okay, great. That's helpful. And then one more for me, Barry, you mentioned service revenue associated with kind of the legacy transport business was down about 10% from the pre-pandemic level. So, I mean, have you seen any improvement in that over the last few quarters? And do you expect that to recover back to pre-pandemic levels at some point? And if it does, kind of what will it take to get there, is it more return to office or any other kind of macro related metrics we should be looking at?\nBarry Hytinen: Thanks for the question, Eric, and appreciate the continued interest. Of course, we have seen that line continuing to perform better over the last several quarters and kind of consistently, that's been trending better. And we do - I will say, you know, if you look at our service activities, since the early days of the pandemic, we obviously were down a lot in the early days and then moved appreciably better sequentially, quarter-by-quarter. We are far in advance of return to office and I would say we continue to outpace return to office. The way I think about it is, it likely has a continued tailwind going forward. I don't think any of us expect office to be at the same level of occupancy going forward, as it was pre-pandemic. But even still, as the levels continue to rise over the coming quarters, I think that becomes a little bit of a tailwind for our service. The other thing I'll just point out is the new service offerings that we've been delivering to our customers like in IT asset disposal and digital solutions. They have been doing phenomenally well, as Bill highlighted in his prepared remarks. And we see that trend continuing. And it's really strength to strength in that line, Eric. And those are very good profitability for us as well. So we feel quite well positioned on the service line. And then you will see additional service obviously coming through with our recent ITRenew acquisition, as that business continues to build.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have the next question on the line from Shlomo from Stifel. Sir, please go ahead.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, thank you for putting me back in. Just on the storage business, the storage rental gross profit section has facilities costs going up about you know, $17 million or so sequentially. I don't know if there was a build and put in place that went in over there. Is there - can you give us a little bit more color on that because storage gross rental margin went down 110 basis points and just want to see if that's - what's driving it?\nBarry Hytinen: Yeah. Thanks, Shlomo. It's a good question. Appreciate that one. So the way to think about it is, we have both for service growth - storage rental gross margin, there's a factor of both sale leaseback, but you are specifically asking about other facility costs. And on that line, that's also where our power for data center pass through goes through, and so that was actually - naturally up both sequentially and year-on-year. Incidentally, just to give you a frame [ph] if you normalize for sale leaseback and excluded the power, we basically have storage rental gross margin up in both sequentially, as well as year-on-year by about 40, 50 basis points. So we feel quite good about the way the business is trending. And the other thing I'll say is, our guidance naturally assumes a healthy, as I mentioned last quarter, a healthy amount of inflation. And we continue to track at levels that are below what we were projecting earlier in the year. And of course, the pricing is doing better. So that's part of the reason why the profitability in the core business continues to outperform.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We now have George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. You talked about favorable traction in your ALM business. Can you elaborate on how ITRenew performed in the quarter on revenue and EBITDA relative to your initial expectations?\nBarry Hytinen: Yeah, thanks. Thanks, George. It's Barry. It performed right in line with our expectations, maybe even a little touch better than the expectations we shared on the last call. Obviously, that's just for the first two months of the acquisition. And as we see it, and that's both on revenue and a EBITDA basis. As we see it playing out for the year, I continue to project in our guidance, the same level call it around $450 million in that same profitability level that I mentioned. And as we see the business being growing considerably over time, I will tell you that one of the nice things that we see in that business is the building level of backlog, as many of our upstream clients are building their backlog for decommissioning, as we move into the later part of the year, in light of the fact that there's been some level of supply chain disruption for a new gear, we do see their backlogs building. So that is, I think, a favorable view for us going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have a question from Sheila McGrath of Evercore. So please go ahead, I have opened your line.\nSheila McGrath: Thank you. I was wondering if you could talk about rising interest rates and near term impact to Iron Mountain, where do you think you could raise debt capital for a 10 year bond now versus maybe fourth quarter?\nBarry Hytinen: You know, Sheila, hi, it's Barry, you know, the good news about our model in light of the fact that as you saw in my guidance, we expect the leverage to be kind of inside our range and essentially flattish to maybe even slightly down by the end of the year from where we are now. We were in the fact that we have no near term maturities. I really don't need any long term at this point. As you know, we did the bond in December for the ITRenew transaction, so I'm pleased with the timing of that in light of where we were able to price it. I feel very good about where we are with respect to the capital markets for you know debt and don't have any need at this point or for the next few years, really\nOperator: Thank you. We have no further questions raised. [Operator Instructions] We have had no questions registered. So I'd like to hand it back to the management team.\nWilliam Meaney: Thank you for joining us today and you can all disconnect.\nOperator: You have been removed from the call. Good bye. This does conclude today's call. Thank you again for joining. You may now disconnect your line. Thank you for attending today's presentation.",

            "content": "Thanks, Bill. And thank you all for joining us to discuss our results. In the first quarter, our team delivered strong performance exceeding the expectations we provided on our last call. On a reported basis revenue of $1.25 billion grew 15% year-on-year with total organic revenue up 10%. Revenue was over $20 million ahead of the expectations we shared on our last call.

And while it was lower year-on-year driven by the inclusion of ITRenew, our core Iron Mountain business continue to deliver improved profitability year-on-year, even with investments to fund further growth. AFFO was $264 million or $0.91 on a per share basis, up $29 million and $0.10 respectively, from the first quarter of last year. In both cases, we exceeded our expectations. Now let me spend a moment discussing the impact of the war in Ukraine. In late March, we determined it was appropriate to deconsolidate the majority of the OSG records business, which is principally doing business in Russia. As a result, we wrote down our investments to a fair value of zero and accordingly recognized a charge through the other expense line. Going forward, we will no longer be including these entities in our financial statements.

The deconsolidation does not impact our business in Ukraine, which continues to be included in our results. With reduced revenue and a conservative position on accounts receivable, we recognized a loss in our Ukrainian business during the first quarter. I want to echo Bill's comments. We continue to keep all of our Mountaineers in their families in our thoughts during this ongoing human tragedy. Now turning to segment performance. In the first quarter, our Global RIM business delivered revenue of $1.04 billion, an increase of $76 million from last year or 8% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis revenue increased 10%. Constant currency storage rental revenue growth of 6.4% or 4.6% on an organic basis reflects our focus on revenue management, and solid volume trends which exceeded our expectations for the quarter. I will note, that in our supplemental financial information, we have shared a reconciliation of our volume with and without the deconsolidated entities to allow for comparability going forward.

For modeling purposes, please note that our legacy IT asset disposal business continues to grow 8% [ph] in the Global RIM segment. Total capital expenditures were $150 million, of which $115 million was growth and $35 million was recurring. In 2022, we now expect total capital expenditures to be approximately $950 million, up $100 million from our prior expectations. This reflects an increase to our data center development CapEx plans, given our strong leasing year-to-date and our very positive outlook. Turning to the balance sheet. With strong EBITDA performance, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.4 times. This is an improvement from last year and better than the projection we shared on our last call. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term range of 4.5 to 5.5 times. We continue to expect to exit the year at levels within our target range.

And we continue to realize incremental pricing opportunities across our business. Our focus on higher growth segments, including data center, asset lifecycle management, and digital solutions are positioning us for continued success. I would like to thank our entire team for their strong contributions. We look forward to updating you on our progress following the second quarter. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. Thanks, Kevin. We appreciate the comments. And we feel really - we feel really good about how things have been trending. If you look at our Global RIM storage rental revenue growth of 4.6% organic, the vast majority of that is prices, as you can see our organic volume is right in line with what we've been expecting. And so you know, it's been very good performance on pricing. And importantly, we continue to see more opportunity for pricing and, and that's the - on that expectation, I would advise you to think about pricing continue to be at this level or better for the remainder of the year. The other thing that really helped the total company's storage growth is our data center. You would note that our data center storage revenue was up considerably in the quarter. And they are two in light of both the team's phenomenal performance in terms of historic leasing, as well as recent deals and commencement. We expect to see considerable growth on that data center storage line, the entire year, as we were talking about last quarter. So we feel very well positioned, Kevin and appreciate the question. Yeah, Kevin, I will tell you that - thanks for the question on the CapEx. I'll draw people's attention to the fact that we did increase the CapEx guidance by about $100 million versus our prior expectation. That reflects the fact that our data center development CapEx is up about $100 million. So I'm currently planning for $625 million or so of data center development CapEx for the full year. And that's reflecting the fact that the new leases that we've signed, together with continuing to be opportunistic about building the platform, you know, as you've seen, we've had phenomenal new leasing. And so it's sort of a great situation to be able to continue to invest in that business where we're seeing very nice returns. When you think about the model, I would say that you should be seeing a very considerable amount of free cash flow before discretionary in - when you work through our CAD, and we feel very good about how the - how the business is performing. That's correct, Kevin. Really, well. I mean, you know, we do have very strong pricing power. And, as we've always said that, you know, inflation, you know, whilst you know, we feel for folks, I mean, inflation is really hurting all of us in many different ways. For the business, it's actually a net positive because we're able to price ahead of inflation, and we have a high gross margin business, so it naturally expands the margins of the business. Thanks, Andrew. You are thinking about that correctly. A couple things to think about. As we move through the year, we have improved mix coming through the business. We do naturally have, as you traditionally have seen in our business, since you followed us for so long, a level of upfront, first kind of quarter costs which ease, we have a level of improved mix going forward. We get more price as we move through the year. We also see very good flow through coming on the data center business. As I mentioned earlier, last quarter, we expect the data center margin to be slightly up year-on-year, and we see good flow through coming through in the back half there as well. And then, generally speaking, we will continue to comp with positive benefit from Project Summit and other ongoing productivity initiatives. So, you know, I would say first off, I should remind folks that in the first quarter, we did better on a margin basis than we anticipated. That's because the core Iron Mountain business performed very well in terms of productivity and pricing. And we see that trajectory continuing through the year. So sitting here, after one quarter, I feel quite good about where we are in the margin trajectory, Andrew. Thanks for the question, Eric, and appreciate the continued interest. Of course, we have seen that line continuing to perform better over the last several quarters and kind of consistently, that's been trending better. And we do - I will say, you know, if you look at our service activities, since the early days of the pandemic, we obviously were down a lot in the early days and then moved appreciably better sequentially, quarter-by-quarter. We are far in advance of return to office and I would say we continue to outpace return to office. The way I think about it is, it likely has a continued tailwind going forward. I don't think any of us expect office to be at the same level of occupancy going forward, as it was pre-pandemic. But even still, as the levels continue to rise over the coming quarters, I think that becomes a little bit of a tailwind for our service. The other thing I'll just point out is the new service offerings that we've been delivering to our customers like in IT asset disposal and digital solutions. They have been doing phenomenally well, as Bill highlighted in his prepared remarks. And we see that trend continuing. And it's really strength to strength in that line, Eric. And those are very good profitability for us as well. So we feel quite well positioned on the service line. And then you will see additional service obviously coming through with our recent ITRenew acquisition, as that business continues to build. Yeah. Thanks, Shlomo. It's a good question. Appreciate that one. So the way to think about it is, we have both for service growth - storage rental gross margin, there's a factor of both sale leaseback, but you are specifically asking about other facility costs. And on that line, that's also where our power for data center pass through goes through, and so that was actually - naturally up both sequentially and year-on-year. Incidentally, just to give you a frame [ph] if you normalize for sale leaseback and excluded the power, we basically have storage rental gross margin up in both sequentially, as well as year-on-year by about 40, 50 basis points. So we feel quite good about the way the business is trending. And the other thing I'll say is, our guidance naturally assumes a healthy, as I mentioned last quarter, a healthy amount of inflation. And we continue to track at levels that are below what we were projecting earlier in the year. And of course, the pricing is doing better. So that's part of the reason why the profitability in the core business continues to outperform. Yeah, thanks. Thanks, George. It's Barry. It performed right in line with our expectations, maybe even a little touch better than the expectations we shared on the last call. Obviously, that's just for the first two months of the acquisition. And as we see it, and that's both on revenue and a EBITDA basis. As we see it playing out for the year, I continue to project in our guidance, the same level call it around $450 million in that same profitability level that I mentioned. And as we see the business being growing considerably over time, I will tell you that one of the nice things that we see in that business is the building level of backlog, as many of our upstream clients are building their backlog for decommissioning, as we move into the later part of the year, in light of the fact that there's been some level of supply chain disruption for a new gear, we do see their backlogs building. So that is, I think, a favorable view for us going forward. You know, Sheila, hi, it's Barry, you know, the good news about our model in light of the fact that as you saw in my guidance, we expect the leverage to be kind of inside our range and essentially flattish to maybe even slightly down by the end of the year from where we are now. We were in the fact that we have no near term maturities. I really don't need any long term at this point. As you know, we did the bond in December for the ITRenew transaction, so I'm pleased with the timing of that in light of where we were able to price it. I feel very good about where we are with respect to the capital markets for you know debt and don't have any need at this point or for the next few years, really"

            "name": "William Meaney",
            "content": "Thank you, Gillian, and thank you all for taking time to join us today. Our team delivered exceptional results for the first quarter of 2022, exceeding the expectations we provided on our last call. This record performance is reflective of our broad offerings, deep customer relationships, resilient business model, and dedicated team. Whilst we are thrilled to report these results, its important to take a moment to acknowledge the events happening in Ukraine and impacting the world at large. As we navigate this devastating conflict, we continue to prioritize our Mountaineers and their families. To that end, I am comforted to share that all 65 of our colleagues from Ukraine continue to check in with our global risk, safety and security team on a daily basis and all are safe. Some families have made the difficult decision to migrate to other countries. And I am proud of how our fellow Mountaineers in the region have offered assistance in providing comfort and resettlement. I continue to be both inspired by and grateful to all the teams in Ukraine and the surrounding countries who have united to support each other in this crisis. I visited the region twice recently and I remain humbled by the strength of our colleagues. And we remain committed to supporting our effective Mountaineers and continue to hope and pray for a rapid resolution of this war. Now if I may, let me begin our discussion of our first quarter results, a record for the company. We achieved our highest ever quarterly revenue of $1.25 billion, exceeding our expectations of $1.2 billion, yielding 10% or total organic revenue growth and an all-time record EBITDA of $431 million. We continue to be encouraged by the increased demand of our services across key markets fueling these results. As pricing and positive volume trends continue to benefit us, we delivered organic storage rental revenue growth of 6.8% in the first quarter. We drove double-digit growth in digital offerings, including data center, GDS, digital transformation services, and ALM or asset lifecycle management. As you know, we've been growing quickly and over the past two years, we have been growing faster than even our expectations. I have shared with you previously, how our continued build out of new products and services, as well as growth in these underlying markets has now taken our total addressable market to over $120 billion, accelerating us on our growth trajectory path. Turning to our ALM business, we achieved several solid wins that spanned industries, many of which were made possible through the strong combination of Iron Mountain, and the recently acquired ITRenew, which has been performing even better than we had anticipated. An example of the power of this combination can be seen in our expansion on a customer win with a large financial institution that we were originally awarded in early 2021. With the additional expertise we acquired with ITRenew, we expanded our offerings to include market leading recycling expertise, as the whole world is focused on how to better embrace the concept around a more circular economy and reduce our impact on the environment. Along with this added expertise, we now have a full set of capabilities which are truly differentiating in the eyes of not only this customer, but also most of our global customers. Another ALM win this quarter was for a task order for Iron Mountain to provide on-site media destruction and ALM services to 18 US locations, including data centers and office locations, in which all IT asset types will be included has in scope. Several key factors in awarding us the RFP included secure logistics, global footprint, partner network and existing trusted relationships. For this customer, we expect to expand services to multiple regions, including the United Kingdom, Brazil, India, and Canada. These are just some of the wins this quarter, which demonstrate the strength of our expanded ALM platform, which will directly benefit from IRMs 225,000 loyal customer base, which includes 95% of the Fortune 1000. Our continued drive in building an extraordinary set of synergistic and customer centric solutions, combined with our global reach and footprint propels our growth forward. Now let me share a few examples of how we've been empowering our customer's success and growth through our diverse digital transformation solutions or GDS offerings, coupled with our customer focus. In the first quarter, we received fully executed service orders for two large deals in the energy vertical for one of the world's largest oil and gas companies. Both projects will allow our customer to identify and access dark data to provide quicker decisions and to better manage their assets. The total value of these two deals represents more than $12 million. We are looking forward to replicating this success with other energy customers. Turning to the Asia Pacific region, I would like to highlight a large win with an Asian full service universal bank that I had the honor to visit in March. Iron Mountain will provide digitization service - services to assist our customer's local compliance requirements of digital [ph] which are anti-money laundering related requirements for a total contract value of $4 million. We are also thrilled to report a customer win that has resulted in a five year $8 million Digital Mailroom deal leveraging our content services platform or InSight. This Fortune 500 Mutual Insurance customer after handling their own mail in house for more than 100 years came to us with this opportunity which was both complex and emotional for the customer. Our success here is a direct result of our long standing strategic partnership. We also continue to grow our business with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada or IRCC, which facilitates the arrival of immigrants, provides protection to refugees and offers programming to help newcomers settle in Canada. In 2020, Iron Mountain began supporting IRCC with imaging a variety of application forms. There was an immediate need to process a backlog of applications with your staff working from home as a result of the pandemic. Today, we have processed approximately 115,000 applications, representing over 14.7 million images. Building from this initial work in Toronto, we grew the project by securing an additional contract worth $2.9 million. In addition, we recently awarded a 1.3 million RFP to expand this image initiative to Atlantic and Western Canada. This would not have been possible without our work in supporting this customer from day one, positioning Iron Mountain as a critical business partner. In our Crozier business, we are pleased to highlight our installation of a piece of art entitled just what is your position by a distinguished LA artist at the new terminal at LAX. This installation highlights our team's expertise and precision with regard to complicated installation that will now be on display for millions of travelers. Last, but surely not least, turning to our data center business. You will recall that we initially expected to lease 50 megawatts this year. By the end of Q1 however, we had already signed a total of 35 megawatts, including a single tenant of 27 megawatts for our London-2 location. We are excited about the continued demand we see across Europe, as we bring on added capacity to the market in the coming months. Since March, we have sold an additional 72 megawatt lease on our Northern Virginia campus. This is a near build-to-suit type of agreement where we are responsible for leasing on a long term basis the land, the shell and a large portion of the installed MEP or mechanical electrical plant. Iron Mountain's data center solution met the security, scalability and interconnection requirements of the customer in this critical global data center market. The lease is expected to commence and begin ramping mid-year 2024 and it \u2013 and has a term of 15 years. Finally, I would like to share with you a joint ESG and data center win. As we have said before, ESG continues to be an important focus for us, shone through many years of producing annual corporate sustainability reports outlining our commitments and progress for nearly a decade. We recently announced a design certification of our Phoenix Arizona AZP-2 data center, the first data center in North America to receive BREEAM certification. We are taking the lead on demonstrating the steps facility owners can take to ensure that their data centers are both efficient and resilient. Design for the facility has been certified under BREEAMs new construction standard, a global recognized green building certification for new developments and achieved the BREEAM excellent rating. This continued focus on building standards, together with already having long term renewable power purchasing agreements which offset at more than 100% of our data center energy requirements places us firmly on the path to reach our 2040 commitments to use 100% renewable energy, 100% of the time. To conclude, we continue to build on our growth momentum and expand our portfolio to exceed our customers evolving needs, as evidenced by our outstanding results this morning, including our highest ever revenue and all-time record EBITDA. With our strong footprint, powerful portfolio and deep customer relationships, we are confident that we will continue this momentum. The future is bright, and I can't wait to see how we can accomplish. With that. I'll turn the call over to Barry. Good morning, Sheila. Thank you for the question. So, I think the first is that we feel really good about the platform, not only the $120 billion total addressable market that we have, but the platform that we have in each of the poor - parts of the portfolio that attack that, if you will, or address that. So we don't see a need to do any, you know, large M&A type deals, like the ITRenew, because I think we now have market leading platforms pretty much in each of those - those areas that we're addressing. So we don't really see that. And we still think that we have a long ways to run in our share price. No, thanks. Thanks, Shlomo. Good morning. So at least I know that you're on. No. And well, first of all, the - in terms of physical volume, we said it's flat to slightly up to the year. But that's looking at our - across our portfolio of everything that we put in our warehouses around the globe, right. So in terms of managing the organic utilization of our facilities based on organic visible volume growth, we still expect that to be flat to slightly up and you know, in this quarter it was up as you see. So looking within records management, we always kind of consider that to be more flat to slightly down. And if you look at the trend, even between Q4 and Q1, and as you watch the business for a long time, you know that both Q4 and Q1, usually have a little bit of noise. And then because people tend to do their destruction programs, either at the end of the year, and some of that goes into the beginning of the year. So you'll always see a little bit noise. But I think if you look at the last say, you know, four quarters, you'll see a very consistent trend on what's happening to our physical volume around the records management. So, we feel really good where it's at. You know, it's kind of staying in that kind of flat to slightly down records management. Our other areas, in terms of physical volume storage is growing quite nicely. So overall, you know, we'd still remain kind of flat to up for the year in physical volume. And then of course, pricing takes that up. Operator, maybe put up the next question. Hi, Nate [ph] So no, thanks for the question. Yeah, as you say, we were very pleased to sign this deal for our data center campus in Northern Virginia. There is a couple bits, we'll go into more detail on the second quarter call, because you can imagine that we just signed this agreement, as we come in. But as I said, it's - it's a near build to suit. I mean, we don't - we're not providing all the MEP. And we'll actually go into a little bit more details in terms of how the pieces come together. But besides the 72 megawatts, the other thing that we were very excited about, it allowed us to build further infrastructure on that side, bringing on a substation onto the campus, which is going to drive benefits, both in terms of upscaling the capacity, but also the cost to deliver on that on that campus. So there's a number of different pieces there that make this deal very attractive. But we'll give you more information on the second quarter call. But you're right to say that it's a very capital efficient structure. And with a great tenant on the backside for 15 years, so it allows us to finance it in a very efficient way. Thank you for joining us today and you can all disconnect."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Gillian Tiltman, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nGillian Tiltman: Thanks, Rocco. Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On today's call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Barry Hytinen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we'll open up the lines for Q&A. Today's earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's earnings materials, the Safe Harbor Language on Slide 2, and our annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliations to these measures in our supplemental financial information. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.\nWilliam Meaney: Thank you, Gillian. And thank you all for joining us today. We are pleased to report another outstanding year for Iron Mountain. We achieved record revenue and adjusted EBITDA in both the fourth quarter and the full year. Our record results are a testament to the devotion and hard work of our team and our resilient and growing business model. In the fourth quarter we achieved revenue of 1.4 -- $1.42 billion, yielding 8.7% total organic revenue growth and record adjusted EBITDA of $525 million up 11%. For the full year we delivered record results across the board, revenue of $5.5 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $2 billion, and AFFO of $1.2 billion. I'll now discuss some ways in which we have been working with our customers, which has led to this growth. Let's begin with our records management business. A win of note was with one of the largest health systems in the US awarding Iron Mountain a contract to significantly enhance its management of records across 140 hospitals and 2,600 care sites. Building on a strong long-term relationship with the customer, we are now implementing a rigorous compliance program that will reduce the cost and meet records retention requirements leading to a more efficient service. This win is particularly representative of our focus on cross-selling through Matterhorn as this customer is utilizing a variety of our products and services across our business lines, including digital services along with traditional records management and shredding. Another win showing Iron Mountain's cross-selling power occurred with a Hungarian industrial gas supplier. We are helping this customer to create space at its facilities by storing and then digitizing its records. We are also exploring opportunities to deploy our digital mailroom solution as our partnerships develop, thereby expanding this relationship across our product suite. The last win to highlight in our records management business is a new contract with the Swiss Division of a British multinational asset management company to relocate its physical records to one site and digitize them over time. In addition to freeing up physical space, our solution will ensure our customers' records are stored safely and compliantly, and enables more efficient access to the digitized information. Moving now to some wins in our digital solutions business, we won a contract from a large aerospace customer to deploy our InSight platform to manage and translate invoices from 22 languages into English. The customer chose our solution ahead of competing proposals, thanks to InSight's embedded AI engine, which gives it the ability to not only store, but to automatically classify a range of documents in a highly secure manner. Another win this quarter was with a Canadian government agency. This agency, which manages workplace compensation claims has been a customer of our records management services for more than 15 years. Our successful delivery of digital mailroom and imaging on demand solutions during the COVID pandemic has led to a new Master Services Agreement for digitizing services worth more than $10 million over the contract length. We will preserve, scan around 47,000 rolls of microfilm to produce 240 million images on our InSight platform, helping the agency to process compensation claims faster than ever and delivering a solid recurring revenue stream to drive our growth. In Brazil, a major television network that has been a records management customer for almost 25 years has asked us to manage the indexing and digitization of 50,000 boxes of records stored at its locations in Iron Mountain's facilities in the country. Our InSight platform is at the heart of our solution, enabling the customer to manage requests to digitize from all parts of the business in one place effectively and efficiently. Finally, the Hong Kong division of a major multinational bank has chosen Iron Mountain to be its partner in a major transformation of its finance operations. This customer manages a large volume of finance documents and has outsourced this work to Iron Mountain with a goal of streamlining the process of checking and scanning these files. We see the potential to scale the solution for the bank in other locations including Singapore, India, the US, United Kingdom, and the United Arab Emirates. Now let's turn to our data center business. We continue to be pleased with the growth trajectory of our data center business, which has only accelerated with the rapid adoption of AI-enabled services. We are pleased to have signed 124 megawatts well ahead of our initial plan for the year. We continue to see tremendous opportunity in serving both hyperscale and co-location customers and significant growth potential for our footprint. An example in the quarter, we signed a seven-year agreement to provide capacity at our New Jersey data center for an automated trading technology company that is expanding in the US. Our reputation for compliance and sustainability were key to winning this business and it was important for our customer to receive 100% traceable and verifiable energy and carbon records in support of its sustainability goals. Also in the U.S., we were pleased to win a data center deal with a secure cloud storage company that is growing rapidly across North America. Our reliability and close relationships since first doing business with this customer a year ago helped to seal this new deal as did the strategic location of our facility in Northern Virginia. Moving to India, we continue to see strong demand for capacity. We closed a data center contract with a major bank in the country in the fourth quarter. This customer chose our Mumbai facility specifically and Iron Mountain more broadly for our ability to provide a secure data center for its large domestic branch platform close to its headquarters. Turning to our Asset Lifecycle Management business, or ALM, we secured a significant contract with a global financial services company. Our ability to integrate our secure ALM services with the customer\u2019s existing business management platform was critical and has enabled them to streamline how they order, complete and report on their IT asset disposition activities. Our solution was an excellent demonstration of how deeply we understand the needs of our customers, especially in the highly regulated world of financial services. Staying with ALM business, in the quarter we won a contract with a U.S. vehicle insurance company that has been an existing customer of ours for many years. Having shifted its employees to a remote working model, our customer needed to partner with the capacity to retrieve over 37,000 devices from more than 240 locations nationwide, then process, refurbish, and return them for distribution. Our solution provides our customer with better visibility of its IT assets and enables them to manage this activity more efficiently. I should also highlight the synergy between our ALM and data center business when it comes to data center renewal and decommissioning. We are now in a position to not only provide co-location and cloud migration services, but we can also securely and responsibly dispose of obsolete IT equipment. An example of such an opportunity in this quarter was a major win with one of the world's leading producers of business process management software. We managed the secure decommissioning of over 40 data centers globally, sanitized the IT assets and remarketed them to deliver a significant return in value. Also in the quarter, we were awarded a contract by one of the oldest financial institutions in the US for a similar data center decommissioning project. Both wins demonstrate that Iron Mountain is uniquely positioned to minimize risk and maximize savings as a single source partner for these activities. Finally, let me take a moment to highlight our acquisition of Regency Technologies. Regency's team makes a great addition to the leadership of our rapidly growing ALM business and gives us additional capabilities to serve this fast growing sector at the heart of the circular economy. Furthermore, this acquisition together with the momentum we have been building in ALM through the strengthening of component pricing and cross selling sets us up well for continued success. To conclude, I would like to thank our team for their resilience, hard work and dedication as we continue our Matterhorn clime and continue to serve over 225,000 customers. We are thrilled to progress ahead of expectations and it is due to the commitment of our Mountaineers. As we look to 2024 and beyond, the momentum we have built will continue to drive the opportunities ahead with another year of double digit top line growth expected. Barry will speak in detail about our financial guidance for the year ahead. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry.\nBarry Hytinen: Thanks, Bill. And thank you all for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results and our outlook for 2024. Turning to our financials, in the fourth quarter our team continued the trend of delivering record performance on all of our key financial metrics. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.42 billion grew 11% year-on-year or 10% on a constant currency basis, reflecting a new quarterly record. On an organic basis, total organic revenue grew 8.7%. A key highlight in the quarter is our organic storage revenue, which grew 10.4% as a result of strong performance in both our records management and our data center businesses. Total service revenue increased 8% to $549 million. This was driven by Global RIM at 10% on a reported basis and 9% on an organic basis. Project Matterhorn's focus on selling our entire range of products and services has driven these strong results and are a testament to our commercial team's efforts. Adjusted EBITDA was $525 million, a new record, up 11% on a reported basis and 10% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin was better than we projected at 37% and improved 100 basis points sequentially, driven by strong mix and cost productivity across all of our businesses. As we've stated in our earnings press release, effective in the fourth quarter of 2023, our AFFO definition has been updated to exclude amortization of capitalized commissions. In light of the growth of our data center business, we conducted a benchmarking analysis of other companies in the industry and as such, have aligned our AFFO reporting accordingly, which provides investors better insight into the funds available to support the growth of our business. AFFO was $328 million or $1.11 on a per share basis, up $29 million and $0.09 respectively from the fourth quarter of last year. To allow for comparison to our guidance and consensus, we are reporting our prior methodology as well. On our previous calculation, AFFO was $317 million or $1.07 on a per share basis. This was $7 million better than our AFFO guidance and $0.02 better than our guidance on a per share basis. Now, let me briefly summarize the full year. Revenue of $5.5 billion increased 7% on a reported basis and 8% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA increased 7% year-on-year to $1.96 billion, an increase of $135 million. AFFO increased over 5% to $1.2 billion or $4.12 on a per share basis. On our previous calculation, AFFO was $1.168 billion or $3.97 on a per share basis. And now turning to segment performance for the quarter. Our global RIM business delivered revenue of $1.19 billion, an increase of $108 million from last year or 10% on a reported basis. On an organic constant currency basis, revenue increased 8.5%. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $534 million, an increase of $48 million year-on-year. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA margin was 44.7%, up 100 basis points sequentially, driven by strong services mix and productivity. Our data center business continues to grow and deliver strong performance. From a total revenue perspective, we delivered 32% year-on-year growth on a reported basis and 30% year-on-year growth on a constant currency basis. Our data center storage revenue grew 34% year-on-year or 32% on a constant currency basis, driven by new development coming online. Data center EBITDA was up approximately $10 million year-on-year and EBITDA margin was up 80 basis points sequentially. Moreover, pricing trends have continued to be strong and we have seen returns expanding 100 basis points to 150 basis points in advance of higher interest rates. Turning to new and expansion leasing, we completed 4 megawatts in the Q4. For the full year, we leased 124 megawatts, exceeding the projection we provided on our last call. Nearly 100% of those leases resulted from cross selling, which you know is a key initiative in our Project Matterhorn plan. Our pipeline is at record levels. We are expanding our relationships with key hyperscale clients and our team is executing well. So we are pleased to project new and expansion leasing of 100 megawatts for 2024. Incidentally, that represents a 25% increase from our initial 2023 projection at this time last year. Turning to our Asset Lifecycle Management business. In the fourth quarter, we delivered improved performance for both revenue and EBITDA, achieving the expectations we set on our last call. Our team drove strong operating productivity and we saw component pricing beginning to trend up modestly on a sequential basis. Similar to data center, cross selling activity has been particularly strong in our ALM business with nearly all deals coming in as a result of it. We completed our acquisition of Regency Technologies early in January. This acquisition strengthens our ability to serve an expanding ALM customer base and broadens our capability in the category, especially in the enterprise segment. Regency brings robust remarketing and recycling capabilities to better serve our customers and help them achieve their environmental and data security goals. We have long admired the leadership at Regency and are thrilled to welcome their entire organization to our team. Turning to capital, for the full year 2023, we invested $1.2 billion of growth $140 million of recurring, consistent with the expectation we shared on our last call. For 2024, we are planning for capital expenditure to be approximately $1.35 billion of growth and approaching $150 billion of recurring. Given our strong pre lease activity, the vast majority of our growth capital will be dedicated to data center development. Turning to the balance sheet, with strong adjusted EBITDA performance, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.1 times and our leverage remains at its lowest level in a decade. For 2024, we expect to exit the year at similar levels to year end 2023. Our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.65 per share to be paid in early April. And on a trailing four quarter basis, our payout ratio is now 62%, in line with our long term target range of low to mid-60s percent. Now, let me provide an update on our progress as to the Project Matterhorn growth objectives we shared at our Investor Day in September of 2022. You will recall that we introduced [tighter] (ph) targets for growth between the period of 2021 through 2026 of approximately 10% for revenue, approximately 10% for adjusted EBITDA and approximately 8% for AFFO. Two years into our Matterhorn journey, we are well on track, even ahead of those commitments, having achieved 13% annual revenue growth from 2021 to the end of 2023 on a constant currency basis. We have achieved 11% annual adjusted EBITDA growth and in excess of 10% annual AFFO growth. The dollar has been particularly strong over this period and despite this, we have been delivering on our commitments on a reported basis as well. Now let me share our projections for the full year 2024. We expect total revenue to be within the range of $6 billion to $6.15 billion, which represents year-on-year growth of 11% at the midpoint. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be within the range of $2.175 billion to $2.225 billion, which represents year-on-year growth of 12% at the midpoint. We expect AFFO to be within the range of $1.3 billion to $1.335 billion, which represents year-on-year growth of 9% at the midpoint. And we expect AFFO per share for the full year to be $4.39 to $4.51 and this represents year-on-year growth of 8% at the midpoint. In terms of foreign exchange, we are using a forecast based on those of several major financial institutions. Compared to 2023, this results in a full year FX headwind of $25 million to revenue and approximately $10 billion to EBITDA and AFFO. Turning to the first quarter, we expect revenue of approximately $1.45 billion, adjusted EBITDA in excess of $510 billion and AFFO of approximately $310 billion and AFFO per share of approximately $1.05. To conclude, we are pleased to have delivered a strong year in 2023. I am confident that we will build on our momentum and continue to drive strong growth in 2024. We are well on track to achieve our Project Matterhorn goals. I'd like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to our entire team for delivering a successful year and their continued dedication to serving our clients. And with that, operator, will you please open the line for Q&A?\nOperator: Absolutely. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. In the ALM business, you mentioned component prices trended up quarter-over-quarter. Can you elaborate on how ALM volumes and component prices performed on a year-over-year basis in the quarter? And what assumptions for component prices you're factoring into your 2024 guidance?\nWilliam Meaney: Good morning, George. Thanks for the question. So let me kind of answer the kind of the higher level on the strategic where we see the trends going and then Barry can go to the next level and give you a little bit more specifics in terms of the numbers. But on the -- to your macro point in terms of the trends on the component prices, it's very much in line what you see in terms of the analyst reports right now and you can see that coming through in the Q4 and building into Q1. So we expect the component prices to continue to strengthen during the course of the year. And you can see that broadly in the semiconductor and memory business for the original manufacturers as well. So we're very much benefiting from the same trends you're seeing in the industry for the OEMs, as well as for the reused or the recycled market. In terms of volume, actually throughout the year as we've been reporting on the last few quarters is we continue to see increase in volume, although when that turned into revenue, it was muted because of the low component prices that we started off the year and kind of worked through the rest of the year. But the trends that we saw in Q4 -- that showed up in Q4 continue -- we continue to see building in Q1 and we're very much tracking what you're seeing in the broader OEM market for memory, disks and CPUs, GPUs. Barry?\nBarry Hytinen: Yes. Hey, George. Good morning. Thank you for that question. I'll give you a little bit more detail on how we're thinking about ALM in total. So in 2023, in light of those trends that Bill was mentioning, we delivered $177 million revenue from ALM. Now for our guidance at the midpoint, we're assuming about $355 million of total revenue for ALM. I'll note that Regency brings in $115 million right there. So it's sort of $240 million against the $177 million. I think if you look at what we did in the fourth quarter, what you'll find is just at the fourth quarter run rate, we'd be in excess of $200 million, $205 million, $206 million and that's assuming no improvement from all the enterprise bookings we've been doing over the last half as Bill was referring to, as well as and what will likely be a continued improving environment on component pricing. So whereas last year, we were faced with really significant challenges of component pricing continuing to decline earlier in the year and then staying at those trough levels, we have assumed a modest amount of pricing benefit on component pricing as we move through the year. Really, we didn't assume much of any change from the fourth quarter to the first quarter that may prove conservative. And then we assumed a fairly slow ramp, slower than what all the industry prognostications are for component pricing. So when I look at the incremental increase we have in the guidance for our organic ALM business, George, it's about $35 million, which -- we'll see how the year goes, but I feel very good about where we're positioned. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Thank you very much. Could you talk a little bit about the pricing environment and how that contributed to revenue growth in the quarter and how much you're expecting that to be a contribution to guidance in 2024? We're seeing kind of an uptake in some of the RIM organic revenue growth and I was wondering how much of that might be directly pricing versus anything else?\nBarry Hytinen: Hi, Shlomo, this is Barry. Thank you for that question. So what you would see in our results and as you're pointing to and thank you for that is that, our global RIM storage rental revenue was up 8% -- over 8% in the quarter on an organic basis and for the full year it was about 8.5%. So we have very strong storage rental revenue growth in 2023 and that's with positive volume trends and good mix and revenue management. And the way we think about revenue management of course as we talked about before is about value. Our ability to provide our customers with value added services, such as our ability to provide digitization on demand rapidly whenever they need it, Smart Sort and a host of other value added services. So -- and then incidentally, our service revenue also stepped up nicely in the Q4 on Global RIM as well. And so, our expectation for the new year embedded in the guidance, Shlomo, is about -- round numbers, call it 6-ish percent growth for Global RIM at the midpoint, which in light of the revenue management actions we have as a anniversary from last year as well as additional revenue management actions this year, very good trajectory we think on services, inclusive of digital services continue to ramp through the year. We feel very good about that projection and I think it does imply an opportunity for us to certainly achieve the midpoint on the Global RIM number at 6%. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Nate Crossett with BNP. Please go ahead.\nNate Crossett: Hey, good morning. Maybe one related to that previous question is, I know you don't give a formal guide, but what are you expecting in terms of overall RIM volumes for Q1 and the remainder of this year? And then if I could just ask one on data center pricing and leasing. How much of that 100 megawatt guide is kind of already in the pipeline? And I think cash mark to market was 5% for 2023. How do you see that playing out this year? Thank you.\nWilliam Meaney: So Nate, I'll take the pipeline question on the data center and then Barry -- I'll let Barry take your question on the pricing. So on the pipeline as you would expect, especially with the hyperscale, you know the market extremely well is that, we have a very strong pipeline going into the year. So yes, when we set our targets, yes, I mean, you can assume that we have a pretty big pipeline that stands behind that. And if you look at the way we set our targets, it's very consistent with what we laid out on Investor Day. It's where -- you think about couple of years ago, we were in the 60s. So you see that our targets are continuing to show that we are growing the business north of 20% a year. And obviously some of these big contracts can either put you well ahead or at the targets that we set. But we're very comfortable that we're continuing to build momentum in the business and we're maintaining these 20% plus growth rates on a very quickly or very rapidly growing base. So I think you can assume that like anything else is that, we have a pretty good pipeline. In fact, across most of our businesses, we maintain a pretty strong pipeline behind our targets.\nBarry Hytinen: Nate, thanks for the question. It's Barry. A couple of responses on the physical volume, much as we have forecasted the last few years, we're planning this year the same way, which is for our physical volume to be slightly up for the year and also for the Q1 [indiscernible] about that. And so, the vast majority of the growth that I mentioned for Global RIM will be driven off of services as well as revenue management of course. As it relates to your question about mark to market on data center, clearly trends have been good with respect to mark to market over the last really five, six quarters. And from what we're seeing, we continue to expect that to be trending upward, and we have high visibility on that. And frankly, in the co-lo space, it's trending up even higher. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Brendan Lynch with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrendan Lynch: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe on Matterhorn, you highlighted some recent wins there, but I'd imagine it's a very long sales cycle for a lot of the engagements that you have. Maybe you could talk a little bit about where you see yourselves in the overall process with individual customers and, how much additional benefit you expect to see stemming from the Matterhorn initiatives over the next four to five years?\nWilliam Meaney: Thanks, Brendon. You're right. I mean they're typically longer than our traditional sales cycles. If you think about the services that we were selling five, six years ago when our service revenue was down in the 40s, right, and so obviously 10 times that today just on digital and when I'm talking about digital services now that portion of the service business. Now it's more than 10 times that size. It is definitely because it's much more of a solution orientation. That being said, so we maintain much bigger pipelines to back up that growth. But as you can see, we're continuing to grow that business in double digit territory. So the -- but the -- on the other side, the flip side is more and more of these services are recurring or multiyear projects. So has that built even though the sales cycle is longer, is the -- also the revenue that comes in is around longer, if you will. So it's -- if we look at it right now, it's approaching 30%, 40% of the revenue that were coming in is truly recurring and/or very long multiyear projects. So at one level, yes, it's a longer sales cycle. Another level, it allows us to continue to build momentum and drive growth in that business because each year we're replacing less than we were before.\nBarry Hytinen: The only thing I'd add, Brendan, it's Barry, is that, our cross selling opportunity is very large at this business, right? We have well over 200,000 clients, most of them are measured in decades of duration and we are seeing our cross selling efforts continue to expand. We increased significantly year-on-year, but there's a lot more opportunity. And when I think about the services that Bill just mentioned as well as things like Asset Lifecycle Management, really those are services that we can be offering and nearly all of our customers need. And so we think it -- Matterhorn, we are -- as you heard me say, we reiterated our targets today and we're in fact running ahead. So we feel very good about where we're at.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Kevin McVeigh with UBS. Please go ahead.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. Thanks so much. Hey, it looks like the total volumes increased in time to the storage, but the retention slipped a little bit. What drove that kind of acceleration there, because it looks like a nice outcome?\nWilliam Meaney: Yes. So Kevin, I would say, if you look at our retention rates over the last 15 or so years, you would see, because that data is available, that it's very much in line and it can wobble few basis points here or there quarter-to-quarter. But we are very pleased with our retention and our customer satisfaction scores. And thank you for the point, volume has been quite good and that speaks to our commercial team's ability to continue to win new business. And, frankly, if you look at the storage revenue growth that the team is putting up, it's I think quite impressive, including the acceleration. So thank you for the question.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nEric Luebchow: Great. Thank you. I just wanted to touch on data centers and capital allocation. So, you talked about pricing continuing to ramp in the data center ecosystem and we've seen demand outstripping supply. So maybe you could touch on where your targeted development yields are for the $1.3 billion of CapEx, the majority of which is data centers. And if you [indiscernible] opportunities to accelerate that 100 megawatts of leasing even further, maybe touch on some other funding sources like joint ventures, that could maybe give you additional capital to attack the hyperscale opportunity? Thank you.\nWilliam Meaney: Thanks Eric for the question. So in terms of the returns that we're getting and Barry touched upon in his script is, you should think about interest rates or the cost of capital have moved up, but our pricing has moved up about 100 basis points, 150 basis points ahead of that. So we're actually getting higher returns, even in a higher interest rate environment than we were before. So the pricing has moved up quite nicely, even more if you look at the non-hyperscale portion, but I'm talking more about the hyperscale customers in and of themselves. And that's partly driven by the traction we're getting in the market. And then the other part of it is the scarcity. I mean, especially with the growth in AI, as you know, AI actually absorbs a lot of power and that's what we're selling effectively is capacity or access to power. So I think we're really happy with the way that the pricing is evolving in the business. In terms of your other question, in other words, yes, and it kind of goes to the pipeline. Yes, we feel very comfortable about the target for this year, which is more than 20% ahead, close to 25% ahead than what we targeted last year. So the continued momentum and growth in the business and the -- could we do more than that? Yes. We have a fully funded plan, so we don't see any shortage of capital. And remember, the one of the advantages that we have, not just because of the cross selling of Matterhorn that having the full information services suite. But the other part of it is that, our records management business is a 70% plus gross margin business that generates a lot of cash and that gives us deeper pockets than some of the pure play data center places -- players in terms of being able to both deliver our dividend and -- growth and dividend to our shareholders as well as putting capital to work in data center as I said. And it just so happens that 225,000 plus customer base is a cross selling opportunity for us.\nBarry Hytinen: Eric, the only thing I guess I would add there is that, just building on Bill's point there is, in terms of the growth in the EBITDA that we're generating, and so over $230 million at the midpoint nearly $240 million with our leverage target range, we have a lot of capacity and that together with the cash flow of the business puts us in a position where we can issue the strong guidance that we did, invest heavily in our data center development and, of course, that's the nature of having prelease so much of our business. If you look at the amount of construction we have underway versus the prelease, it's very high, think high 95% or so. And so we'll continue to ramp our development in data center to keep up with the contracts that we've signed and all the while maintaining our leverage year-on-year at the same level. So we feel very good about where we're at. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jon Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Atkin: Thanks. I'm just interested in Regency, any kind of early learnings now that you're a little bit into having acquired it, thoughts about how to achieve top line synergies and other growth paths that you could see in that segment more generally?\nWilliam Meaney: Thanks Jon for the question. As I said in my script and also Barry is that, we're really excited about the Regency acquisition, not just because of the footprint that it gives us, it gives us stronger even scale within the United States, but also the leadership team. So very strong leaders that we're really happy to kind of continue to build out the organizational structure under Mark Kidd. So we're -- so first of all, the leaders that we got with that business, we're very excited about. The second thing is they have a lot of customers that both overlap, but they also have a lot of customers that don't. So for instance, they have a very good both federal and local government portfolio businesses and that's a business that we're already in deep collaboration in terms of how we can expand that using Iron Mountain's muscle with our 26,000 Mountaineers around the globe on how they can actually tap into that. And then they also have some expertise, especially around the end user devices, which already we're doing a lot in end user devices that highlighted some of the wins on my -- in my opening remarks. But the -- they have even further capabilities, which I think is going to give us a lot more to do on the back end in terms of the way we serve customers and the efficiency that we could process their equipment.\nBarry Hytinen: Yes. Jon, the only thing I guess I would add is that, when we knew this as part of the deal, but just to underscore it, there's considerable capacity for processing at Regency. And as Bill mentioned, they add to our capabilities, they have got eight facilities around the U.S, which really broadens our reach and ability to serve clients quickly. And this is a team there that has been building a business very profitably, I might add, for decades. And so they -- to underscore Bill's point, they really know what they're doing, and I think the combination is an excellent one. So thanks for that question.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is a follow-up from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. If you don't mind, I'm going to get a little more into the weeds. Barry, just on -- we saw some interesting gross margin changes like just on a sequential basis. We saw the services margin go up from 260 basis points. It seems like the costs were contained while the revenue increased. But on the storage side, you have all other storage costs going up by $11.5 million, pushed the gross margin down by about 80 basis points sequentially. I know these things move around quarter-to-quarter, but maybe you can give us a little bit of insight as to what's in that all other storage costs that moved up $11.5 million this quarter.\nBarry Hytinen: Yes, sure thing, Shlomo. I'll take the services point first. As I alluded to in the prepared remarks, we had very good mix within our services. And as you know, when we're doing services especially as we're continuing to see larger and larger deals, the mix of those can move around and the timing of them. And so we had anticipated a little lower margin mix in the services portfolio. Some of those deals pushed into the first quarter here in terms of when we win them and into the New Year. But we then won some deals and we're able to provide service on some higher margins. So that's part of it. And together with the fact that candidly our team here does a great job driving productivity across our services organization. As it relates to the storage gross margin, I'm glad you asked that question, because there's an item that I want to make sure we all understand. That storage gross margin, of course, is the combination of all of our storage businesses. So when you think about the Records Management Physical Storage Business, that's a very high gross margin business and continued to perform very well. We're very pleased with the margins in that business in light of revenue management, et cetera and the volume trends over the last several years. It's been trending really well. The factor that can affect the actual rate though and also affects your all other storage costs, which I'll come to, is data center. As you know, as you'd see from our peer companies that are public as well as some of the other companies in the data center space, the gross margins on data center generally as an industry are lower than our records management business. And so while our data center gross margin actually expanded both sequentially and year-on-year, the mix in fact because data center grew, I think the storage revenue was up 35% or so year-on-year in the quarter that has a mix element. And so, you can have a situation where our gross margins are improving on both businesses, yet the contribution creates the rate going down slightly. As it relates to all other storage costs, that's -- one of the big drivers there, of course, is and it goes to data center is the power. And so, as we're having more and more client commencements, they start drawing more power in there that also has an effect on gross margin, but doesn't change our EBITDA dollars. So good questions and I hope that clears that up. We feel very, very good about the gross margins in the company.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Tong: Hi. Thanks. A quick follow-up. It looks like your dividend payout ratio has dipped below the 65% LTM target, which is where you raised the dividend earlier. Can you talk about your thoughts on raising the dividend again now that the payout ratio is below the threshold?\nWilliam Meaney: Yes. No, thanks George. And you're right. We're maintaining as a Board and as a company that our target payout ratio is kind of in the low 60s, 60% to 65% and we are kind of trending [indiscernible] we are in that range now. So this is, obviously, a decision for the Board, but I think you could expect the way we're trending in the guidance we've given you for the year, it's a natural forcing function that the board will be considering and. I think it's -- as you can just kind of see the mathematics of it, it looks like we're running into another increase in the near future and not too distant future, I should say.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session and the Iron Mountain fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Barry Hytinen",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill. And thank you all for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results and our outlook for 2024. Turning to our financials, in the fourth quarter our team continued the trend of delivering record performance on all of our key financial metrics. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.42 billion grew 11% year-on-year or 10% on a constant currency basis, reflecting a new quarterly record. On an organic basis, total organic revenue grew 8.7%. A key highlight in the quarter is our organic storage revenue, which grew 10.4% as a result of strong performance in both our records management and our data center businesses. Total service revenue increased 8% to $549 million. This was driven by Global RIM at 10% on a reported basis and 9% on an organic basis. Project Matterhorn's focus on selling our entire range of products and services has driven these strong results and are a testament to our commercial team's efforts. Adjusted EBITDA was $525 million, a new record, up 11% on a reported basis and 10% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin was better than we projected at 37% and improved 100 basis points sequentially, driven by strong mix and cost productivity across all of our businesses. As we've stated in our earnings press release, effective in the fourth quarter of 2023, our AFFO definition has been updated to exclude amortization of capitalized commissions. In light of the growth of our data center business, we conducted a benchmarking analysis of other companies in the industry and as such, have aligned our AFFO reporting accordingly, which provides investors better insight into the funds available to support the growth of our business. AFFO was $328 million or $1.11 on a per share basis, up $29 million and $0.09 respectively from the fourth quarter of last year. To allow for comparison to our guidance and consensus, we are reporting our prior methodology as well. On our previous calculation, AFFO was $317 million or $1.07 on a per share basis. This was $7 million better than our AFFO guidance and $0.02 better than our guidance on a per share basis. Now, let me briefly summarize the full year. Revenue of $5.5 billion increased 7% on a reported basis and 8% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA increased 7% year-on-year to $1.96 billion, an increase of $135 million. AFFO increased over 5% to $1.2 billion or $4.12 on a per share basis. On our previous calculation, AFFO was $1.168 billion or $3.97 on a per share basis. And now turning to segment performance for the quarter. Our global RIM business delivered revenue of $1.19 billion, an increase of $108 million from last year or 10% on a reported basis. On an organic constant currency basis, revenue increased 8.5%. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $534 million, an increase of $48 million year-on-year. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA margin was 44.7%, up 100 basis points sequentially, driven by strong services mix and productivity. Our data center business continues to grow and deliver strong performance. From a total revenue perspective, we delivered 32% year-on-year growth on a reported basis and 30% year-on-year growth on a constant currency basis. Our data center storage revenue grew 34% year-on-year or 32% on a constant currency basis, driven by new development coming online. Data center EBITDA was up approximately $10 million year-on-year and EBITDA margin was up 80 basis points sequentially. Moreover, pricing trends have continued to be strong and we have seen returns expanding 100 basis points to 150 basis points in advance of higher interest rates. Turning to new and expansion leasing, we completed 4 megawatts in the Q4. For the full year, we leased 124 megawatts, exceeding the projection we provided on our last call. Nearly 100% of those leases resulted from cross selling, which you know is a key initiative in our Project Matterhorn plan. Our pipeline is at record levels. We are expanding our relationships with key hyperscale clients and our team is executing well. So we are pleased to project new and expansion leasing of 100 megawatts for 2024. Incidentally, that represents a 25% increase from our initial 2023 projection at this time last year. Turning to our Asset Lifecycle Management business. In the fourth quarter, we delivered improved performance for both revenue and EBITDA, achieving the expectations we set on our last call. Our team drove strong operating productivity and we saw component pricing beginning to trend up modestly on a sequential basis. Similar to data center, cross selling activity has been particularly strong in our ALM business with nearly all deals coming in as a result of it. We completed our acquisition of Regency Technologies early in January. This acquisition strengthens our ability to serve an expanding ALM customer base and broadens our capability in the category, especially in the enterprise segment. Regency brings robust remarketing and recycling capabilities to better serve our customers and help them achieve their environmental and data security goals. We have long admired the leadership at Regency and are thrilled to welcome their entire organization to our team. Turning to capital, for the full year 2023, we invested $1.2 billion of growth $140 million of recurring, consistent with the expectation we shared on our last call. For 2024, we are planning for capital expenditure to be approximately $1.35 billion of growth and approaching $150 billion of recurring. Given our strong pre lease activity, the vast majority of our growth capital will be dedicated to data center development. Turning to the balance sheet, with strong adjusted EBITDA performance, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.1 times and our leverage remains at its lowest level in a decade. For 2024, we expect to exit the year at similar levels to year end 2023. Our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.65 per share to be paid in early April. And on a trailing four quarter basis, our payout ratio is now 62%, in line with our long term target range of low to mid-60s percent. Now, let me provide an update on our progress as to the Project Matterhorn growth objectives we shared at our Investor Day in September of 2022. You will recall that we introduced [tighter] (ph) targets for growth between the period of 2021 through 2026 of approximately 10% for revenue, approximately 10% for adjusted EBITDA and approximately 8% for AFFO. Two years into our Matterhorn journey, we are well on track, even ahead of those commitments, having achieved 13% annual revenue growth from 2021 to the end of 2023 on a constant currency basis. We have achieved 11% annual adjusted EBITDA growth and in excess of 10% annual AFFO growth. The dollar has been particularly strong over this period and despite this, we have been delivering on our commitments on a reported basis as well. Now let me share our projections for the full year 2024. We expect total revenue to be within the range of $6 billion to $6.15 billion, which represents year-on-year growth of 11% at the midpoint. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be within the range of $2.175 billion to $2.225 billion, which represents year-on-year growth of 12% at the midpoint. We expect AFFO to be within the range of $1.3 billion to $1.335 billion, which represents year-on-year growth of 9% at the midpoint. And we expect AFFO per share for the full year to be $4.39 to $4.51 and this represents year-on-year growth of 8% at the midpoint. In terms of foreign exchange, we are using a forecast based on those of several major financial institutions. Compared to 2023, this results in a full year FX headwind of $25 million to revenue and approximately $10 billion to EBITDA and AFFO. Turning to the first quarter, we expect revenue of approximately $1.45 billion, adjusted EBITDA in excess of $510 billion and AFFO of approximately $310 billion and AFFO per share of approximately $1.05. To conclude, we are pleased to have delivered a strong year in 2023. I am confident that we will build on our momentum and continue to drive strong growth in 2024. We are well on track to achieve our Project Matterhorn goals. I'd like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to our entire team for delivering a successful year and their continued dedication to serving our clients. And with that, operator, will you please open the line for Q&A? Yes. Hey, George. Good morning. Thank you for that question. I'll give you a little bit more detail on how we're thinking about ALM in total. So in 2023, in light of those trends that Bill was mentioning, we delivered $177 million revenue from ALM. Now for our guidance at the midpoint, we're assuming about $355 million of total revenue for ALM. I'll note that Regency brings in $115 million right there. So it's sort of $240 million against the $177 million. I think if you look at what we did in the fourth quarter, what you'll find is just at the fourth quarter run rate, we'd be in excess of $200 million, $205 million, $206 million and that's assuming no improvement from all the enterprise bookings we've been doing over the last half as Bill was referring to, as well as and what will likely be a continued improving environment on component pricing. So whereas last year, we were faced with really significant challenges of component pricing continuing to decline earlier in the year and then staying at those trough levels, we have assumed a modest amount of pricing benefit on component pricing as we move through the year. Really, we didn't assume much of any change from the fourth quarter to the first quarter that may prove conservative. And then we assumed a fairly slow ramp, slower than what all the industry prognostications are for component pricing. So when I look at the incremental increase we have in the guidance for our organic ALM business, George, it's about $35 million, which -- we'll see how the year goes, but I feel very good about where we're positioned. Thank you. Hi, Shlomo, this is Barry. Thank you for that question. So what you would see in our results and as you're pointing to and thank you for that is that, our global RIM storage rental revenue was up 8% -- over 8% in the quarter on an organic basis and for the full year it was about 8.5%. So we have very strong storage rental revenue growth in 2023 and that's with positive volume trends and good mix and revenue management. And the way we think about revenue management of course as we talked about before is about value. Our ability to provide our customers with value added services, such as our ability to provide digitization on demand rapidly whenever they need it, Smart Sort and a host of other value added services. So -- and then incidentally, our service revenue also stepped up nicely in the Q4 on Global RIM as well. And so, our expectation for the new year embedded in the guidance, Shlomo, is about -- round numbers, call it 6-ish percent growth for Global RIM at the midpoint, which in light of the revenue management actions we have as a anniversary from last year as well as additional revenue management actions this year, very good trajectory we think on services, inclusive of digital services continue to ramp through the year. We feel very good about that projection and I think it does imply an opportunity for us to certainly achieve the midpoint on the Global RIM number at 6%. Thanks very much. Nate, thanks for the question. It's Barry. A couple of responses on the physical volume, much as we have forecasted the last few years, we're planning this year the same way, which is for our physical volume to be slightly up for the year and also for the Q1 [indiscernible] about that. And so, the vast majority of the growth that I mentioned for Global RIM will be driven off of services as well as revenue management of course. As it relates to your question about mark to market on data center, clearly trends have been good with respect to mark to market over the last really five, six quarters. And from what we're seeing, we continue to expect that to be trending upward, and we have high visibility on that. And frankly, in the co-lo space, it's trending up even higher. Thank you. The only thing I'd add, Brendan, it's Barry, is that, our cross selling opportunity is very large at this business, right? We have well over 200,000 clients, most of them are measured in decades of duration and we are seeing our cross selling efforts continue to expand. We increased significantly year-on-year, but there's a lot more opportunity. And when I think about the services that Bill just mentioned as well as things like Asset Lifecycle Management, really those are services that we can be offering and nearly all of our customers need. And so we think it -- Matterhorn, we are -- as you heard me say, we reiterated our targets today and we're in fact running ahead. So we feel very good about where we're at. Eric, the only thing I guess I would add there is that, just building on Bill's point there is, in terms of the growth in the EBITDA that we're generating, and so over $230 million at the midpoint nearly $240 million with our leverage target range, we have a lot of capacity and that together with the cash flow of the business puts us in a position where we can issue the strong guidance that we did, invest heavily in our data center development and, of course, that's the nature of having prelease so much of our business. If you look at the amount of construction we have underway versus the prelease, it's very high, think high 95% or so. And so we'll continue to ramp our development in data center to keep up with the contracts that we've signed and all the while maintaining our leverage year-on-year at the same level. So we feel very good about where we're at. Thanks. Yes. Jon, the only thing I guess I would add is that, when we knew this as part of the deal, but just to underscore it, there's considerable capacity for processing at Regency. And as Bill mentioned, they add to our capabilities, they have got eight facilities around the U.S, which really broadens our reach and ability to serve clients quickly. And this is a team there that has been building a business very profitably, I might add, for decades. And so they -- to underscore Bill's point, they really know what they're doing, and I think the combination is an excellent one. So thanks for that question. Yes, sure thing, Shlomo. I'll take the services point first. As I alluded to in the prepared remarks, we had very good mix within our services. And as you know, when we're doing services especially as we're continuing to see larger and larger deals, the mix of those can move around and the timing of them. And so we had anticipated a little lower margin mix in the services portfolio. Some of those deals pushed into the first quarter here in terms of when we win them and into the New Year. But we then won some deals and we're able to provide service on some higher margins. So that's part of it. And together with the fact that candidly our team here does a great job driving productivity across our services organization. As it relates to the storage gross margin, I'm glad you asked that question, because there's an item that I want to make sure we all understand. That storage gross margin, of course, is the combination of all of our storage businesses. So when you think about the Records Management Physical Storage Business, that's a very high gross margin business and continued to perform very well. We're very pleased with the margins in that business in light of revenue management, et cetera and the volume trends over the last several years. It's been trending really well. The factor that can affect the actual rate though and also affects your all other storage costs, which I'll come to, is data center. As you know, as you'd see from our peer companies that are public as well as some of the other companies in the data center space, the gross margins on data center generally as an industry are lower than our records management business. And so while our data center gross margin actually expanded both sequentially and year-on-year, the mix in fact because data center grew, I think the storage revenue was up 35% or so year-on-year in the quarter that has a mix element. And so, you can have a situation where our gross margins are improving on both businesses, yet the contribution creates the rate going down slightly. As it relates to all other storage costs, that's -- one of the big drivers there, of course, is and it goes to data center is the power. And so, as we're having more and more client commencements, they start drawing more power in there that also has an effect on gross margin, but doesn't change our EBITDA dollars. So good questions and I hope that clears that up. We feel very, very good about the gross margins in the company."

            "content": "Thank you, Gillian. And thank you all for joining us today. We are pleased to report another outstanding year for Iron Mountain. We achieved record revenue and adjusted EBITDA in both the fourth quarter and the full year. Our record results are a testament to the devotion and hard work of our team and our resilient and growing business model. In the fourth quarter we achieved revenue of 1.4 -- $1.42 billion, yielding 8.7% total organic revenue growth and record adjusted EBITDA of $525 million up 11%. For the full year we delivered record results across the board, revenue of $5.5 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $2 billion, and AFFO of $1.2 billion. I'll now discuss some ways in which we have been working with our customers, which has led to this growth. Let's begin with our records management business. A win of note was with one of the largest health systems in the US awarding Iron Mountain a contract to significantly enhance its management of records across 140 hospitals and 2,600 care sites. Building on a strong long-term relationship with the customer, we are now implementing a rigorous compliance program that will reduce the cost and meet records retention requirements leading to a more efficient service. This win is particularly representative of our focus on cross-selling through Matterhorn as this customer is utilizing a variety of our products and services across our business lines, including digital services along with traditional records management and shredding. Another win showing Iron Mountain's cross-selling power occurred with a Hungarian industrial gas supplier. We are helping this customer to create space at its facilities by storing and then digitizing its records. We are also exploring opportunities to deploy our digital mailroom solution as our partnerships develop, thereby expanding this relationship across our product suite. The last win to highlight in our records management business is a new contract with the Swiss Division of a British multinational asset management company to relocate its physical records to one site and digitize them over time. In addition to freeing up physical space, our solution will ensure our customers' records are stored safely and compliantly, and enables more efficient access to the digitized information. Moving now to some wins in our digital solutions business, we won a contract from a large aerospace customer to deploy our InSight platform to manage and translate invoices from 22 languages into English. The customer chose our solution ahead of competing proposals, thanks to InSight's embedded AI engine, which gives it the ability to not only store, but to automatically classify a range of documents in a highly secure manner. Another win this quarter was with a Canadian government agency. This agency, which manages workplace compensation claims has been a customer of our records management services for more than 15 years. Our successful delivery of digital mailroom and imaging on demand solutions during the COVID pandemic has led to a new Master Services Agreement for digitizing services worth more than $10 million over the contract length. We will preserve, scan around 47,000 rolls of microfilm to produce 240 million images on our InSight platform, helping the agency to process compensation claims faster than ever and delivering a solid recurring revenue stream to drive our growth. In Brazil, a major television network that has been a records management customer for almost 25 years has asked us to manage the indexing and digitization of 50,000 boxes of records stored at its locations in Iron Mountain's facilities in the country. Our InSight platform is at the heart of our solution, enabling the customer to manage requests to digitize from all parts of the business in one place effectively and efficiently. Finally, the Hong Kong division of a major multinational bank has chosen Iron Mountain to be its partner in a major transformation of its finance operations. This customer manages a large volume of finance documents and has outsourced this work to Iron Mountain with a goal of streamlining the process of checking and scanning these files. We see the potential to scale the solution for the bank in other locations including Singapore, India, the US, United Kingdom, and the United Arab Emirates. Now let's turn to our data center business. We continue to be pleased with the growth trajectory of our data center business, which has only accelerated with the rapid adoption of AI-enabled services. We are pleased to have signed 124 megawatts well ahead of our initial plan for the year. We continue to see tremendous opportunity in serving both hyperscale and co-location customers and significant growth potential for our footprint. An example in the quarter, we signed a seven-year agreement to provide capacity at our New Jersey data center for an automated trading technology company that is expanding in the US. Our reputation for compliance and sustainability were key to winning this business and it was important for our customer to receive 100% traceable and verifiable energy and carbon records in support of its sustainability goals. Also in the U.S., we were pleased to win a data center deal with a secure cloud storage company that is growing rapidly across North America. Our reliability and close relationships since first doing business with this customer a year ago helped to seal this new deal as did the strategic location of our facility in Northern Virginia. Moving to India, we continue to see strong demand for capacity. We closed a data center contract with a major bank in the country in the fourth quarter. This customer chose our Mumbai facility specifically and Iron Mountain more broadly for our ability to provide a secure data center for its large domestic branch platform close to its headquarters. Turning to our Asset Lifecycle Management business, or ALM, we secured a significant contract with a global financial services company. Our ability to integrate our secure ALM services with the customer's existing business management platform was critical and has enabled them to streamline how they order, complete and report on their IT asset disposition activities. Our solution was an excellent demonstration of how deeply we understand the needs of our customers, especially in the highly regulated world of financial services. Staying with ALM business, in the quarter we won a contract with a U.S. vehicle insurance company that has been an existing customer of ours for many years. Having shifted its employees to a remote working model, our customer needed to partner with the capacity to retrieve over 37,000 devices from more than 240 locations nationwide, then process, refurbish, and return them for distribution. Our solution provides our customer with better visibility of its IT assets and enables them to manage this activity more efficiently. I should also highlight the synergy between our ALM and data center business when it comes to data center renewal and decommissioning. We are now in a position to not only provide co-location and cloud migration services, but we can also securely and responsibly dispose of obsolete IT equipment. An example of such an opportunity in this quarter was a major win with one of the world's leading producers of business process management software. We managed the secure decommissioning of over 40 data centers globally, sanitized the IT assets and remarketed them to deliver a significant return in value. Also in the quarter, we were awarded a contract by one of the oldest financial institutions in the US for a similar data center decommissioning project. Both wins demonstrate that Iron Mountain is uniquely positioned to minimize risk and maximize savings as a single source partner for these activities. Finally, let me take a moment to highlight our acquisition of Regency Technologies. Regency's team makes a great addition to the leadership of our rapidly growing ALM business and gives us additional capabilities to serve this fast growing sector at the heart of the circular economy. Furthermore, this acquisition together with the momentum we have been building in ALM through the strengthening of component pricing and cross selling sets us up well for continued success. To conclude, I would like to thank our team for their resilience, hard work and dedication as we continue our Matterhorn clime and continue to serve over 225,000 customers. We are thrilled to progress ahead of expectations and it is due to the commitment of our Mountaineers. As we look to 2024 and beyond, the momentum we have built will continue to drive the opportunities ahead with another year of double digit top line growth expected. Barry will speak in detail about our financial guidance for the year ahead. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry. Good morning, George. Thanks for the question. So let me kind of answer the kind of the higher level on the strategic where we see the trends going and then Barry can go to the next level and give you a little bit more specifics in terms of the numbers. But on the -- to your macro point in terms of the trends on the component prices, it's very much in line what you see in terms of the analyst reports right now and you can see that coming through in the Q4 and building into Q1. So we expect the component prices to continue to strengthen during the course of the year. And you can see that broadly in the semiconductor and memory business for the original manufacturers as well. So we're very much benefiting from the same trends you're seeing in the industry for the OEMs, as well as for the reused or the recycled market. In terms of volume, actually throughout the year as we've been reporting on the last few quarters is we continue to see increase in volume, although when that turned into revenue, it was muted because of the low component prices that we started off the year and kind of worked through the rest of the year. But the trends that we saw in Q4 -- that showed up in Q4 continue -- we continue to see building in Q1 and we're very much tracking what you're seeing in the broader OEM market for memory, disks and CPUs, GPUs. Barry? So Nate, I'll take the pipeline question on the data center and then Barry -- I'll let Barry take your question on the pricing. So on the pipeline as you would expect, especially with the hyperscale, you know the market extremely well is that, we have a very strong pipeline going into the year. So yes, when we set our targets, yes, I mean, you can assume that we have a pretty big pipeline that stands behind that. And if you look at the way we set our targets, it's very consistent with what we laid out on Investor Day. It's where -- you think about couple of years ago, we were in the 60s. So you see that our targets are continuing to show that we are growing the business north of 20% a year. And obviously some of these big contracts can either put you well ahead or at the targets that we set. But we're very comfortable that we're continuing to build momentum in the business and we're maintaining these 20% plus growth rates on a very quickly or very rapidly growing base. So I think you can assume that like anything else is that, we have a pretty good pipeline. In fact, across most of our businesses, we maintain a pretty strong pipeline behind our targets. Thanks, Brendon. You're right. I mean they're typically longer than our traditional sales cycles. If you think about the services that we were selling five, six years ago when our service revenue was down in the 40s, right, and so obviously 10 times that today just on digital and when I'm talking about digital services now that portion of the service business. Now it's more than 10 times that size. It is definitely because it's much more of a solution orientation. That being said, so we maintain much bigger pipelines to back up that growth. But as you can see, we're continuing to grow that business in double digit territory. So the -- but the -- on the other side, the flip side is more and more of these services are recurring or multiyear projects. So has that built even though the sales cycle is longer, is the -- also the revenue that comes in is around longer, if you will. So it's -- if we look at it right now, it's approaching 30%, 40% of the revenue that were coming in is truly recurring and/or very long multiyear projects. So at one level, yes, it's a longer sales cycle. Another level, it allows us to continue to build momentum and drive growth in that business because each year we're replacing less than we were before. Yes. So Kevin, I would say, if you look at our retention rates over the last 15 or so years, you would see, because that data is available, that it's very much in line and it can wobble few basis points here or there quarter-to-quarter. But we are very pleased with our retention and our customer satisfaction scores. And thank you for the point, volume has been quite good and that speaks to our commercial team's ability to continue to win new business. And, frankly, if you look at the storage revenue growth that the team is putting up, it's I think quite impressive, including the acceleration. So thank you for the question. Thanks Eric for the question. So in terms of the returns that we're getting and Barry touched upon in his script is, you should think about interest rates or the cost of capital have moved up, but our pricing has moved up about 100 basis points, 150 basis points ahead of that. So we're actually getting higher returns, even in a higher interest rate environment than we were before. So the pricing has moved up quite nicely, even more if you look at the non-hyperscale portion, but I'm talking more about the hyperscale customers in and of themselves. And that's partly driven by the traction we're getting in the market. And then the other part of it is the scarcity. I mean, especially with the growth in AI, as you know, AI actually absorbs a lot of power and that's what we're selling effectively is capacity or access to power. So I think we're really happy with the way that the pricing is evolving in the business. In terms of your other question, in other words, yes, and it kind of goes to the pipeline. Yes, we feel very comfortable about the target for this year, which is more than 20% ahead, close to 25% ahead than what we targeted last year. So the continued momentum and growth in the business and the -- could we do more than that? Yes. We have a fully funded plan, so we don't see any shortage of capital. And remember, the one of the advantages that we have, not just because of the cross selling of Matterhorn that having the full information services suite. But the other part of it is that, our records management business is a 70% plus gross margin business that generates a lot of cash and that gives us deeper pockets than some of the pure play data center places -- players in terms of being able to both deliver our dividend and -- growth and dividend to our shareholders as well as putting capital to work in data center as I said. And it just so happens that 225,000 plus customer base is a cross selling opportunity for us. Thanks Jon for the question. As I said in my script and also Barry is that, we're really excited about the Regency acquisition, not just because of the footprint that it gives us, it gives us stronger even scale within the United States, but also the leadership team. So very strong leaders that we're really happy to kind of continue to build out the organizational structure under Mark Kidd. So we're -- so first of all, the leaders that we got with that business, we're very excited about. The second thing is they have a lot of customers that both overlap, but they also have a lot of customers that don't. So for instance, they have a very good both federal and local government portfolio businesses and that's a business that we're already in deep collaboration in terms of how we can expand that using Iron Mountain's muscle with our 26,000 Mountaineers around the globe on how they can actually tap into that. And then they also have some expertise, especially around the end user devices, which already we're doing a lot in end user devices that highlighted some of the wins on my -- in my opening remarks. But the -- they have even further capabilities, which I think is going to give us a lot more to do on the back end in terms of the way we serve customers and the efficiency that we could process their equipment. Yes. No, thanks George. And you're right. We're maintaining as a Board and as a company that our target payout ratio is kind of in the low 60s, 60% to 65% and we are kind of trending [indiscernible] we are in that range now. So this is, obviously, a decision for the Board, but I think you could expect the way we're trending in the guidance we've given you for the year, it's a natural forcing function that the board will be considering and. I think it's -- as you can just kind of see the mathematics of it, it looks like we're running into another increase in the near future and not too distant future, I should say."

In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results, and we've included the reconciliations to these measures in our supplemental financial information. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.\nWilliam Meaney: Thank you, Gillian, and thank you all for taking the time to join us today to discuss another record quarterly results. Once again, our Mountaineers have gone above and beyond in their efforts to serve our customers with innovative solutions that support their businesses, putting our customers first runs deep in all we do and sits at the core of Iron Mountain. This legacy, combined with our dedication to not only protect but to elevate the power of our customers' assets and work continues to drive our execution and growth. Turning to our results. We delivered record third quarter performance once again achieving our highest ever quarterly revenue of $1.4 billion which to put that in context, is an increase of over $100 million year-over-year and record EBITDA of $500 million. The strength in these results is a direct result of the positive momentum we are building from Project Matterhorn. We are more than a year into our growth journey and are pleased with our enhanced operating model, which is empowering our commercial organization to cross-sell our products and services. In the third quarter, we delivered organic storage rental revenue growth of 10% as a result of continued revenue management success and improved volume trends and drove over 20% organic growth in our data center business. Let's begin by turning to some of our customer wins, which played a significant role in our ability to achieve these record results. In our records management business, we had a public sector win this quarter in the U.K. with a new contract worth nearly $2 million. This new project is with an important government agency and has been an Iron Mountain customer for 18 years. In that time, our relationship has expanded from an off-site records management provider to an integral partner at our customers highly secure site, which indicates the trust and confidence our customers have in us. By relocating and digitizing important records securely, our customer can make faster and more informed decisions that are critical due to the sensitive nature of its work, whilst also freeing up on-site space. As a public sector organization, the value for each dollar they spend is a key concern for this customer, and we continue to demonstrate that Iron Mountain is the partner of choice for their digital transformation journey. In Digital Solutions, this business continues to gain momentum, especially with our ability to provide higher value, technology-enabled solutions to new and existing Iron Mountain customers. Customer wins for our digital solutions are underpinned by three key differentiators. First, our unique ability to provide a unified end-to-end solution for our customers across their physical and digital assets. Second, our proven capabilities to operate at scale in complex regulated environments and industries. Last, but importantly, our ability to drive business outcomes for our customers, leveraging our artificial intelligence platform, which translates unstructured data into actionable insights. For example, we have been awarded a contract by the TV and film production distribution division of a major technology company, with a story history dating back almost 100 years, we are leveraging our InSight platform to digitize, archive and preserve over 200,000 legal records containing the media rights for distribution and licensing of thousands of film in titles and TV episodes. With all this data available through one cloud-based digital platform, we can help our customers identify and develop new business opportunities by leveraging its rich intellectual property. This latest deal builds on a growing portfolio of solutions we are providing for this global customers' different business units, including records management and IT asset disposition. The multifaceted long-standing relationship we have with this customer truly highlights the success of Project Matterhorn and our cross-selling efforts. Now let's turn to our continued success in winning government business around the world. We are supporting government agencies in Europe to digitize public services as part of an initiative to make their economies and societies more sustainable and resilient following the COVID-19 pandemic. This quarter, we won a two-year deal to digitize around 10 million files to accelerate a backlog of pension payments for one national government Social Security Administration agency. In awarding Iron Mountain this contract, the customer recognized the specialist nature of our solution, including our AI and human in the loop capabilities and our ability to quickly scale operationally to deliver this project within the required time frame. Also in the public sector, we are pleased to be working with the U.S. citizen and Immigration Services to help drive efficiency and reduce the backlog of applicants awaiting adjudication decisions to become U.S. citizens. Over the last 10 years, we have been a proud partner with this important government agency. Having been entrusted with over 500,000 cubic feet of files in high-density tapes, our digitization solutions will enable remote adjudicators to have faster access to vital data, helping them make overall immigration decisions. Turning to our asset life cycle management business. Consistent with the projections we shared last quarter, pricing has been stable, having hit a low level last February. Whilst industry projections are for significant price improvements in late 2023 and throughout 2024, we have continued to take a prudent perspective and are only assuming marginal incremental pricing improvement for the remainder of the year. Our pipeline is robust, and we have delivered solid results this quarter that were in line with our expectations. Also, we are excited to share that we have signed an agreement to acquire Regency Technologies subject to customary closing conditions as we continue our roll-up of the ALM market. Regency is a little over $100 million annual revenue business in the ALM space based in Ohio. The long-term customer relationships that Regency brings to Iron Mountain are an excellent strategic fit to our ALM business. Regency will add operational scale as we continue our growth journey in this fast-growing sector. As the world's need for both secure and more circular solutions for end-of-life IT assets becomes more vital, we are pleased to add to our capability in this category. With that, let us turn our discussion to some individual wins within the ALM space this quarter. I am pleased to share a particularly exciting win for our ALM business with a large global technology company. The deep relationship and trust we have built with this customer over many years was instrumental in Iron Mountain securing the significant deal serving multiple business lines and geographies for the customer. These geographies include India, where our presence and ability to service the customer was a decisive differentiator alongside our global footprint, the expertise and responsiveness of our ALM team and our reputation for data security and chain of custody. Also in ALM, we have signed a long-term contract with a private U.S. insurance company that has been a long-time customer of our U.S. Secure Shredding and Destruction services. Last year, we began supporting this customer with one-off IT asset destruction projects, which demonstrated the value of remarketing thousands of these assets. The agreement we have now reached positions us as our customers strategic partner for its future end-to-end IT asset management needs. By supporting the requirements of an organization with over 37,000 leased IT assets that need returning from remote employees, we are extending the value of the solutions we bring and have changed our customers' perception of what Iron Mountain can offer. Finally, we have a particularly exciting win to share. We have secured a significant five-year ALM contract to support a leading pharmaceutical retailer in the U.S. to advance its commitment to zero waste by 2030. Iron Mountain will provide a circular economy solution by removing and recycling thousands of tons of pharmaceutical stock bottles and pill bottles from thousands of its retail outlets across the U.S. We are providing this leading retailer with an advanced recycling solution turning plastic into raw materials. This will enable the creation of new virgin plastic, helping this retailer meet their environmental goals. This is made possible by the scale of our physical presence, our highly experienced ALM team and a reporting platform for all of the confidential weights that we have managed for this customer since 2014. We are pleased to be able to extend the value of our partnership with this new contract. Moving on to our data center business. Our pipeline continues to expand with positive pricing trends. The continuing strong demand for data center capacity, continues to be driven by digital transformation and most recently, the explosive demand for AI. Supporting the growth and expansion needs of our customers is paramount to our collaborative partnerships, and we are pleased to provide this required capacity to our customers in the markets in which they are keen to operate. From a leasing perspective, in the third quarter, we signed 65 megawatts. This means that through the end of the third quarter, we have already signed 120 megawatts far beyond our original projection, for the year of 80 megawatts. In the quarter, 60 megawatts were signed across two leases to a single Fortune 500 technology company at our campus in Northern Virginia. The deal provides this hyperscale customer with capacity across two buildings on our 142-acre, 276-megawatt campus and represents, the largest revenue deal in Iron Mountain data center's history. We have also won a deal to provide nearly three megawatts of capacity at our Frankfurt data center for an existing North American cloud services customer looking to expand their European footprint. Our sales teams work closely with the customers' technical team to agree on a strategic solution that meets the customers' unique infrastructure needs. Given the strong customer demand in our data center business, we are continuing to expand the reach of our platform. To that end, I am pleased to announce a couple of capacity additions. First, we are repurposing a previous records management facility in Miami to data center use. Miami is a key market, where a number of our customers, are looking for edge deployments and this newly repurposed facility will add 16 megawatts to our data center portfolio. Furthermore, we have acquired additional land and power this quarter, growing our total data center capacity to 860 megawatts, up 80 megawatts from last quarter. In summary, the hard work dedication and execution of our Mountaineers continues to deliver strong results for our loyal customers and ultimately, our company shareholders. Through our Matterhorn initiative fueled by our enhanced operating model, our team continues to achieve record sales growth by selling our entire mountain range of products and services to our long-standing 225,000 customers. Even in a tumultuous geopolitical climate, the resilience and strength of our business model, combined with the dedication and customer-first passion of our mountaineers continues to drive us ever higher. I would also like to express my deepest gratitude to our team for their hard work and continued focus as we continue our growth journey. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry.\nBarry Hytinen: Thanks, Bill, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our results today. In the third quarter, our team achieved strong performance across all metrics, including another record for revenue and EBITDA. Revenue grew to $1.4 billion, up 8% year-on-year on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis, in line with our projection. Our key highlight in the quarter is our organic storage rental revenue, which grew 10%. This reflects continued strong contributions from revenue management, data center commencements and positive volume trends. Total service revenue was $530 million, consistent year-over-year on a constant currency basis and slightly improved on a sequential basis. As we discussed last quarter, service revenue includes the impact of component price declines versus the prior year. Excluding our ALM business, total company constant currency revenue growth would have been 9%. Our team delivered a new record for adjusted EBITDA at $500 million, up 7% year-on-year. This was modestly ahead of our guidance for the quarter despite the U.S. dollar strengthening significantly. On the same foreign exchange rates we used in August, we would have achieved $504 million of adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter ahead of our projection. EBITDA growth was driven by continued strength in revenue management and strong data center commencements. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 36%, up 100 basis points sequentially and ahead of our projections by 50 basis points. Upside was driven by productivity across our operations, including improving trends in our ALM business. AFFO was $290 million or $0.99 on a per share basis, up $2 million and $0.01 on a per share basis from the third quarter of last year. Both of these were in line with the projections we shared on our last call. On the same foreign exchange rates, we were using in August, AFFO would have been $294 million, or $1 on a per share basis, both ahead of our projections. And now turning to segment performance. In the third quarter, our global RIM business achieved revenue of $1.18 billion, an increase of $92 million year-on-year or 8%. Revenue management and positive volume trends, contribute to strong organic storage rental revenue growth of 8%. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA, was $517 million, an increase of $33 million year-on-year. Turning to our global data center business. The team delivered revenue of $128 million, an increase of over $27 million year-on-year. Organic storage rental revenue growth was strong at 22%, driven by commencements and improved pricing. Data center adjusted EBITDA was $53 million, up over $10 million or 25% year-on-year. Turning to new and expansion leasing. We signed 65 megawatts in the quarter, bringing total bookings year-to-date to 120 megawatts. As Bill mentioned, we signed two leases with a client for a total of 60 megawatts. The leases are expected to commence in phases from late 2024 through mid-2025 and have a 15-year term. With the strength of our leasing, I'll note that our weighted average lease expiration is now 8.1 years, which is up a full three years from the third quarter of 2022. As we've talked about before, one of the key elements of our Matterhorn growth plan is to expand cross-selling. Our team is doing a great job in this regard. For example, 95% of the megawatts booked in the quarter, were a result of cross-selling activity. Market-to-market was up over 11% in the quarter, reflecting the continuing trend of strong and improving pricing, while churn was only 1%. Turning to asset life cycle management. In the third quarter, revenue was consistent on a sequential basis, in line with the projections we gave on our last call. We are seeing positive momentum across all three verticals of our ALM business, hyperscale, enterprise and OEM. ALM bookings have been running ahead of our projections.  And similar to data center, our commercial teams are doing a great job with our cross-selling initiative. For example, of the new ALM deals we signed in the quarter, nearly all of them were cross-sell wins. I think this is an early validation of our strategy and supports our long-term view that we can gain considerable market share by leveraging our deep customer relationships and expanding ALM capabilities. Now, I would like to spend a moment addressing component pricing. As expected, pricing was consistent with the second quarter on a sequential basis. At this point, in the fourth quarter, there are indications that component pricing is beginning to recover. For example, since the end of the third quarter, we have seen the pricing for memory rising week over week with it now up nearly 15% on a sequential basis. As we've mentioned on our last call, industry analysts have been forecasting rising prices by late this year, with continued recovery in 2024. Turning to our pending acquisition of Regency Technologies. As Bill mentioned, we are very pleased to have signed this deal. We've known Regency for years and have always been impressed with the strength of their team, range of capabilities and focus on sustainability, productivity and customer service. We see this acquisition as an excellent strategic fit furthering our ability to serve our expanding ALM customer base. The purchase price is $200 million with $125 million to be paid at close and the remainder due in 2025. Subject to performance, there is also an earn-out, which could be payable in 2027. On a trailing four-quarter basis, Regency has revenue in excess of $100 million. We are acquiring the business at an approximate 7.5 times EBITDA multiple. We expect the deal to close late this year or early in 2024. We expect this will be immediately accretive to AFFO and have no impact on our leverage calculation. Turning to capital. In the third quarter, we invested $322 million, of which $287 million was growth and $35 million was recurring. Turning to the balance sheet. With strong EBITDA performance, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.1 times. We expect to exit 2023 at this level. I think it is worth noting that this marks our lowest leverage level in a decade. Our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.65 per share, to be paid in early January. We remain dedicated to our disciplined approach to capital allocation as we are funding our growth objectives while continuing to drive meaningful shareholder returns. And now turning to our projections. For the full year, reflecting our year-to-date performance and strong outlook, we are pleased to reiterate our full year guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue of approximately $1.44 billion, which represents 12.5% growth year-over-year as revenue management actions and improving trends in ALM accelerate our growth. I would like to call out using the same foreign exchange rates we had in August, fourth quarter revenue would have been $25 million higher in this projection. Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $520 million or 10% growth. AFFO of approximately $310 million, which is 8% growth and AFFO per share of approximately $1.05, which is 7% growth from the prior year. With the same FX rates we were using in August, this projection would be approximately adjusted EBITDA of $528 million, AFFO of $318 million and AFFO per share of $1.07. In conclusion, we are pleased to report another record quarter of results. Our team is executing well, driving considerable growth of revenue and EBITDA aligned with our Matterhorn plans. I would like to take the opportunity to thank our entire team for their efforts to support our customers and drive our growth. And with that, operator, will you please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Revenue management is continuing to drive healthy price realization in storage and services. Can you elaborate on, how you expect price actions to trend as inflation normalizes and discuss client sensitivity to pricing increases in the services business, compared to the storage business?\nWilliam Meaney: Yes. Thanks, George and good morning. So, I think that you can expect and you can see that through the course of the year, even as inflation has come off, is that we're continuing to be able to use revenue management across the board in our - especially in our records management business, and that's really based on how our customers value the services. So, we don't see any change in that trend. And in fact, in terms of customer retention, you've seen even a slight improvement in that during that period of time. So, just as the customers really understand the value that we're applying, and we're actually using revenue management to tap into that. So, we don't see any change in that trend.\nBarry Hytinen: And George, it's Barry. Just to add on to that, I would say, as you think about the fourth quarter, we have revenue management actions that have been put in place in the third quarter that, will power another $20 million or $25 million of sequential growth even going forward here, in the fourth quarter. So that's part of the model, as you think about third quarter and fourth quarter.\nOperator: The next question comes from Nate Crossett of BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nNate Crossett: Hi. Good morning. Just a question on organic service revenue growth. Commentary sounded pretty positive on component pricing. So do you expect that, that metric will be positive in 4Q? And then just on Regency. Maybe you can talk about how the organic growth has been for that business year-to-date? And then lastly, just your expectation of RIM volumes heading into 4Q and next year? Thank you.\nWilliam Meaney: Thanks, Nate. Let me answer the question on Regency and then Barry will take your other two points. So on Regency, you can imagine they went through probably a similar growth profile that we saw in ALM. And they also have kind of, I would say, hit the low point probably about four months ago. And since then, they're actually growing kind of mid-single digits over the last, say, two, three, four months. And that's - they probably recovered a little bit faster than our business, but that's where the complementary mix of the two businesses is there, both in terms of the customers that they serve, and they do a lot more on the downstream processing, than the business that we have at Iron Mountain that we've acquired through IT renews. So, it's a good complementary fit. But we also see that they've actually, over the last few months, been growing single digits. Obviously, the business will continue to ramp, hence the pricing across the board starts improving.\nBarry Hytinen: Nate, hi it's Barry. Thanks for those questions. On volume, as you saw in the quarter, we continue to grow volume, both in global records as well as in the corporate and other. And as you know, because you cover the company for so long, our expectation over the horizon is for volume to continue to be consistent to slightly up year in and year out. So, we are pleased with the volume continuing to trend at or even a little bit, better actually than our projections. And we continue to see that, both in the quarter coming as well as into the New Year. So very good and positive trends on the volume side. As it relates to service revenue, yes, we do expect service revenue to be up year-on-year, as I've talked about before, the second quarter was the hardest comp for our ALM business, because in light of what was going on in the prior year, that's when revenue for ALM was about $83 million in total. In the third quarter of last year, it was $60 million. And it was $56 million in the fourth quarter. And this year, it's $42 million in the second quarter and in the third quarter. And as Bill and I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we expect our ALM business to be in the, let's say, low 50s. So that helps - with the standpoint of turning around the comp that, you'll see for the total company. The other thing is, just in light of project revenue. For example, in our digital and our global records services, we have incremental project revenue in the fourth quarter and some commencements, on some longer-term digital contracts occurring here in the fourth quarter, which will help our additional service revenue, and is favorable as it relates to the third quarter. As you know, some of that project revenue can be a little bit lumpy quarter-to-quarter. And that's one of the reasons, why we are bullish on the sequential improvement in total revenue in the fourth quarter. So you'll see a little bit of an acceleration, thanks to ALM getting better and easier comp as well as the trending. We - as Bill mentioned last thing, since you asked about component pricing, we've only factored in what I would call a marginal modest improvement in pricing. And certainly, we are pleased to see pricing on memory rising, as much as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, but it's - we and the whole industry have been through a lot there. So we'll kind of be prudent and watch it before baking in too much into our numbers. Thanks, Nate.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jon Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Atkin: Thanks. I was wondering if you could maybe put a finer point on helping us think about the impact of pricing actions in the room segment versus volume, kind of what the relative impacts were. And then for the ALM segment, I think you I talked about trying to get to $900 million in 2026. Is that still a number to think about? Or given the M&A that you've done with Regency and just the organic growth, any different way to think about that target?\nWilliam Meaney: No. Thanks, Jon. So I'll - let me take the ALM and then I'll let Barry talk a little bit more about pricing and volume trends. So on the ALM side, yes, we haven't backed off from our multiyear target that we shared at Investor Day, a little over a year ago. We still see the $900 million as a reasonable target in terms of the business trends, because one thing that we have continued to see is incoming volume. So if you look both year-over-year and year-to-date and sequentially is we do see volume continuing to grow and to ramp. And as Barry said, that we've seen now pricing starting to come back, whilst it's early green shoots, but 15% improvement in memory pricing, which you probably recall from our call last time is the bulk of the components that we sell on is - it shows that we're moving in the right direction to get back towards the type of pricing that we saw couple of years ago. So, if you put that all together and now with the additional capabilities that we're getting from the Regency acquisition is that both - they do a lot more on the downstream processing, which quite frankly, will not only allow us to harvest more value from the products that we're recycling from our customers, but it will also allow us to kind of expand, improve or accelerate our expansion into the OEM channels that we mentioned before. So I think you put that all together is that we feel very good about the targets that we laid out at our Investor Day.\nBarry Hytinen: And John, it's Barry. Thanks for the question on revenue management in the quarter within our global RIM business. I would tell you if you look at the storage rental revenue growth there on an organic constant currency basis was 8%, so it was quite strong. And volume was modestly positive as you would see in our disclosures. So the vast majority of that was revenue management, although as we've talked about the last few quarters, we are seeing some positive mix in terms of driving top line revenue growth as well. So majority of its revenue management, a little - some mix and some improving volume trends. And going forward, as I mentioned in one of the earlier comments, we will see relatively speaking, incremental revenue management actions driving the business fourth quarter versus third.\nOperator: The next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I really want to focus just a little bit more on the ALM business trajectory. Just - what are you seeing in terms of like volumes coming in? I understand that the pricing is still low, but recovering. But just absolute volumes, how is that doing? And then also just understanding the Regency acquisition, like you said that it's $100 million of TTM revenue, but obviously, it was in a downward slope similar to what you guys were seeing. Is there a run rate that you can provide to us that we can think about that in terms of how to model that thing? And then maybe just keep focusing on a little bit more, what they add to Iron Mountain? What do you mean in terms of the downstream processing? What exactly is it that they do that you do not do?\nWilliam Meaney: Okay. So, Shlomo, let me talk a little bit about the - what we see on the volume trends, and then I'll let Barry put it together in terms of how you should think about modeling that going forward in terms of the business. I'll also come and pick up your point about what exactly Regency ads. So in terms of the volume trends, if you look at the enterprise side of our business, is there, the synergies, and as Barry said in his remarks, almost 100% cross-selling in terms of our ALM business. Is there you see almost triple-digit year-on-year increases in terms of volume that we're getting from our enterprise customers. So in the enterprise segment, we're seeing a really, really good volume. If you look at the hyperscale, which is the part of the business, that we acquired through IT renewal is the one that's most been impacted by what we see on the pricing of the components, which, as we said, is now just starting to move back north in the right direction. Is there, we actually see year-on - if you put year-to-date volume trends of incoming equipment, is we actually see double-digit - strong double-digit growth year-on-year, year-to-date incoming volume. And so the thing that's been muting that incoming volume, quite frankly, has been the pricing, but the good news is the pricing has started to improve. And Barry can help you think through how do you think about putting those two together as we project going forward. The last thing coming to Regency. So I'm glad you picked up on that because I probably should be more explicit on that. So Regency, first of all, they are adding a couple of customers into the portfolio that, quite frankly, we didn't have both in government sector and retail, which I think is really interesting in terms - because a lot of the equipment gets recycled by people dropping off at their retailers. So I think that's a really good capability there. But more importantly, is they actually are able to recycle a lot of what I would call the things that can't be reused directly into IT equipment. So things like we mentioned the plastics for pharmaceutical retailer. They do a lot more of that than we have historically. And the other thing, the other aspect is over the last couple of calls, we mentioned how we had signed up OEM relationships where these are laptop tablet manufacturers that are looking for people when their equipment comes off lease and needs to be recycled is they come to us and other people to actually resell - to refurbish and resell those products. And Regency has much more capability than we do in that area. They built up not only more expertise in refurbishing tablets and laptops than we have, but they also have a very nice e-commerce platform and where they can actually resell those. So they will really accelerate those - accelerate the sales for those channels that we mentioned on the last couple of calls, signing up the OEM manufacturers. So I think their capability will be a nice complementary fit to the contracts that we had already signed.\nBarry Hytinen: So Shlomo, it's Barry. I appreciate the question. Specifically, on how to model Regency, just as a reminder, we are expecting it to close kind of around year-end or early next year for when you want to add it to your model. We noted that it's in excess of $100 million of revenue, Shlomo, and I expect them to exit the year at that level in excess of $100 million, and we see the opportunity for it to be growing into the new year. But of course, we'll give guidance for next year on our next call. But we feel very good about the stability of the business that it's been generating revenue and EBITDA at the levels it's been for some time. And as Bill alluded to, it did not see the sort of trough that our ALM business did on the hyperscale side. It's much more of an enterprise IT asset disposition sort of player. And in that enterprise and government services that it does its - didn't see the level of trough that we did, and it's come back nicely. And so we feel very good about the stability of the business at this point and feel like we're getting a very good, very synergistic deal as Bill mentioned, they have a fair bit of incremental capacity. And so we can get synergy off of bringing Iron Mountain Enterprise clients to Regency for service going forward. I would say - I'll just note that you can work through the math on this that it's sort of in the low mid-20s of an EBITDA margin business. We think that, that has opportunity to expand as relative pricing in the broader market expands and through incremental capacity utilization of the footprint of what they have there. We've been very impressed with the team at Regency for a long time. They've built a very good business with critically important relationships to clients. And we've got a very strong focus on sustainability. So we feel very good about Regency. And as I zoom out to broader ALM, Shlomo, I would say, just to reiterate a point Bill made, the volume is clearly kind of doing well. We are seeing incremental bookings, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, particularly on the enterprise side, on teams having good wins on the hyperscale side as well. And our OEM relationships continue to extend. That's an area that was a focus - has been a focus for us this year. We signed some very important relationships in that area of the market. Of course, it has - the nature of those relationships is that they take a little longer to get to revenue generating, but we are well on our way in the OEM vertical as well. So I appreciate the comment, Shlomo.\nOperator: The next question comes from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nEric Luebchow: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So Barry, I just wanted to touch on the balance sheet, obviously, a big move in interest rates recently. So I just wanted to touch on your deployment of CapEx and the sources and uses of capital. It does look like data center CapEx, as you've mentioned before, maybe you could touch on the trajectory there, that's probably going to continue to lift higher based on the leasing you've done year-to-date. And then maybe you could talk about your kind of achieve development yields on data center deals. It looks like those continue to move higher and how comfortable you are in terms of the excess returns you're getting over your current cost of capital for what's in your data center pipeline? Thank you.\nWilliam Meaney: So Eric, I'll take the - I'll talk about the yields that we're getting it. And then Barry can talk about the balance sheet impact and how we're thinking about financing it going forward. So I think on the yields, as you probably - were kind of foreshadowing in the nature of your question. We have seen yields moved up and in Barry's prepared remarks and I think also in mind. I talked about the price improvement or the strength of pricing around data center as demand continues to ramp. So historically, if you think about the journey that you've watched us on, Eric, is a few years ago, we would have said, hyperscale or kind of 7 to 8. I think on the most recent calls, we said hyperscale. These are cash-on-cash returns have been 8 to 9. And now you can expect that they are 9 plus. So we're - and these are all pre-leverage, cash-on-cash returns. So the returns are even with the ramp in the cost to build - well, the cost of build is obviously built in, but in terms of the cost of financing is well ahead after you put the data center together and lease it up is well ahead of our cost of capital. So we feel really good about the returns we're getting even in the higher interest rate environment.\nBarry Hytinen: Hey, Eric, it's Barry. A couple of things there. We would expect CapEx for the whole company to be probably right around $1.3 billion for the year. That's up some from our prior view because, as you point out, the team continues to do very, very well on data center, and we have a lot of construction to do to service the contracts that the team has signed. It's an interesting point about our business within data center, and we're operating now 225 megawatts, which is nearly all leased. And then we're under construction on another 260 megawatts, of which again, like 90% plus, 93% of it is pre-leased. So we are really constructing to contract as opposed to spec. And so it is a situation where you will see us continue to be gradually rising the data center CapEx as we work to build into the contracts that we've signed. And I think it's - read it to the team and the customer wins that we've been having that we've been able to extend our lease expirations to eight plus years on the backs of higher pricing and those returns improving. So it's - we are feeling very good about where we're positioned with data center and the growth thereof, Eric. You're going to see a lot of growth going forward as we build into those leases. Thanks.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Brendan Lynch of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrendan Lynch: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to dig in on the opportunity in Miami to convert storage facility to a data center. One, are you fully scrapping the existing facility and just using the land? Or are you actually using the existing infrastructure? And what do you see as the other opportunities throughout your portfolio to convert other facilities for data center purposes?\nWilliam Meaney: Good morning, Brendan. Thanks for the question. So the - yes, so in Miami, you probably can imagine, yes, we are actually scrapping the building. So we're reusing the land in that particular case because it's the way that we could get the most data center capacity into that facility, otherwise we would have been leaving much opportunity on the table. So it's a better use or a better way of actually tapping into that market. But it still gives us kind of - if you look at an all-in basis, probably a 15% reduction in cost to build. And obviously, the speed at which we can enter the market is much faster because trying to find the right location of land in Miami and secure the power can be challenging. So we think both in terms of speed and then 15% cost improvement, which is significant, is really important. And if you look more broadly of the 90 million square feet of industrial real estate that we have around the globe that's associated with our records management business is - think about that's probably in the order of 15% to 20% of the properties are under evaluation on any given day as we look at it. So we're constantly screening about 15% to 20% of our locations and looking at what customers' requirements are and in some cases, having discussions with customers and thinking about which of those sites might be next. And these are generally fit in very nicely for what I call these kind of edge deployments or secondary cities like Miami, right? So this won't be the last one that we - the first and the last. This will be the first of many, we feel as we continue to go forward.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and the Iron Mountain third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Barry Hytinen",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our results today. In the third quarter, our team achieved strong performance across all metrics, including another record for revenue and EBITDA. Revenue grew to $1.4 billion, up 8% year-on-year on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis, in line with our projection. Our key highlight in the quarter is our organic storage rental revenue, which grew 10%. This reflects continued strong contributions from revenue management, data center commencements and positive volume trends. Total service revenue was $530 million, consistent year-over-year on a constant currency basis and slightly improved on a sequential basis. As we discussed last quarter, service revenue includes the impact of component price declines versus the prior year. Excluding our ALM business, total company constant currency revenue growth would have been 9%. Our team delivered a new record for adjusted EBITDA at $500 million, up 7% year-on-year. This was modestly ahead of our guidance for the quarter despite the U.S. dollar strengthening significantly. On the same foreign exchange rates we used in August, we would have achieved $504 million of adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter ahead of our projection. EBITDA growth was driven by continued strength in revenue management and strong data center commencements. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 36%, up 100 basis points sequentially and ahead of our projections by 50 basis points. Upside was driven by productivity across our operations, including improving trends in our ALM business. AFFO was $290 million or $0.99 on a per share basis, up $2 million and $0.01 on a per share basis from the third quarter of last year. Both of these were in line with the projections we shared on our last call. On the same foreign exchange rates, we were using in August, AFFO would have been $294 million, or $1 on a per share basis, both ahead of our projections. And now turning to segment performance. In the third quarter, our global RIM business achieved revenue of $1.18 billion, an increase of $92 million year-on-year or 8%. Revenue management and positive volume trends, contribute to strong organic storage rental revenue growth of 8%. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA, was $517 million, an increase of $33 million year-on-year. Turning to our global data center business. The team delivered revenue of $128 million, an increase of over $27 million year-on-year. Organic storage rental revenue growth was strong at 22%, driven by commencements and improved pricing. Data center adjusted EBITDA was $53 million, up over $10 million or 25% year-on-year. Turning to new and expansion leasing. We signed 65 megawatts in the quarter, bringing total bookings year-to-date to 120 megawatts. As Bill mentioned, we signed two leases with a client for a total of 60 megawatts. The leases are expected to commence in phases from late 2024 through mid-2025 and have a 15-year term. With the strength of our leasing, I'll note that our weighted average lease expiration is now 8.1 years, which is up a full three years from the third quarter of 2022. As we've talked about before, one of the key elements of our Matterhorn growth plan is to expand cross-selling. Our team is doing a great job in this regard. For example, 95% of the megawatts booked in the quarter, were a result of cross-selling activity. Market-to-market was up over 11% in the quarter, reflecting the continuing trend of strong and improving pricing, while churn was only 1%. Turning to asset life cycle management. In the third quarter, revenue was consistent on a sequential basis, in line with the projections we gave on our last call. We are seeing positive momentum across all three verticals of our ALM business, hyperscale, enterprise and OEM. ALM bookings have been running ahead of our projections.  And similar to data center, our commercial teams are doing a great job with our cross-selling initiative. For example, of the new ALM deals we signed in the quarter, nearly all of them were cross-sell wins. I think this is an early validation of our strategy and supports our long-term view that we can gain considerable market share by leveraging our deep customer relationships and expanding ALM capabilities. Now, I would like to spend a moment addressing component pricing. As expected, pricing was consistent with the second quarter on a sequential basis. At this point, in the fourth quarter, there are indications that component pricing is beginning to recover. For example, since the end of the third quarter, we have seen the pricing for memory rising week over week with it now up nearly 15% on a sequential basis. As we've mentioned on our last call, industry analysts have been forecasting rising prices by late this year, with continued recovery in 2024. Turning to our pending acquisition of Regency Technologies. As Bill mentioned, we are very pleased to have signed this deal. We've known Regency for years and have always been impressed with the strength of their team, range of capabilities and focus on sustainability, productivity and customer service. We see this acquisition as an excellent strategic fit furthering our ability to serve our expanding ALM customer base. The purchase price is $200 million with $125 million to be paid at close and the remainder due in 2025. Subject to performance, there is also an earn-out, which could be payable in 2027. On a trailing four-quarter basis, Regency has revenue in excess of $100 million. We are acquiring the business at an approximate 7.5 times EBITDA multiple. We expect the deal to close late this year or early in 2024. We expect this will be immediately accretive to AFFO and have no impact on our leverage calculation. Turning to capital. In the third quarter, we invested $322 million, of which $287 million was growth and $35 million was recurring. Turning to the balance sheet. With strong EBITDA performance, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.1 times. We expect to exit 2023 at this level. I think it is worth noting that this marks our lowest leverage level in a decade. Our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.65 per share, to be paid in early January. We remain dedicated to our disciplined approach to capital allocation as we are funding our growth objectives while continuing to drive meaningful shareholder returns. And now turning to our projections. For the full year, reflecting our year-to-date performance and strong outlook, we are pleased to reiterate our full year guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue of approximately $1.44 billion, which represents 12.5% growth year-over-year as revenue management actions and improving trends in ALM accelerate our growth. I would like to call out using the same foreign exchange rates we had in August, fourth quarter revenue would have been $25 million higher in this projection. Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $520 million or 10% growth. AFFO of approximately $310 million, which is 8% growth and AFFO per share of approximately $1.05, which is 7% growth from the prior year. With the same FX rates we were using in August, this projection would be approximately adjusted EBITDA of $528 million, AFFO of $318 million and AFFO per share of $1.07. In conclusion, we are pleased to report another record quarter of results. Our team is executing well, driving considerable growth of revenue and EBITDA aligned with our Matterhorn plans. I would like to take the opportunity to thank our entire team for their efforts to support our customers and drive our growth. And with that, operator, will you please open the line for Q&A. And George, it's Barry. Just to add on to that, I would say, as you think about the fourth quarter, we have revenue management actions that have been put in place in the third quarter that, will power another $20 million or $25 million of sequential growth even going forward here, in the fourth quarter. So that's part of the model, as you think about third quarter and fourth quarter. Nate, hi it's Barry. Thanks for those questions. On volume, as you saw in the quarter, we continue to grow volume, both in global records as well as in the corporate and other. And as you know, because you cover the company for so long, our expectation over the horizon is for volume to continue to be consistent to slightly up year in and year out. So, we are pleased with the volume continuing to trend at or even a little bit, better actually than our projections. And we continue to see that, both in the quarter coming as well as into the New Year. So very good and positive trends on the volume side. As it relates to service revenue, yes, we do expect service revenue to be up year-on-year, as I've talked about before, the second quarter was the hardest comp for our ALM business, because in light of what was going on in the prior year, that's when revenue for ALM was about $83 million in total. In the third quarter of last year, it was $60 million. And it was $56 million in the fourth quarter. And this year, it's $42 million in the second quarter and in the third quarter. And as Bill and I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we expect our ALM business to be in the, let's say, low 50s. So that helps - with the standpoint of turning around the comp that, you'll see for the total company. The other thing is, just in light of project revenue. For example, in our digital and our global records services, we have incremental project revenue in the fourth quarter and some commencements, on some longer-term digital contracts occurring here in the fourth quarter, which will help our additional service revenue, and is favorable as it relates to the third quarter. As you know, some of that project revenue can be a little bit lumpy quarter-to-quarter. And that's one of the reasons, why we are bullish on the sequential improvement in total revenue in the fourth quarter. So you'll see a little bit of an acceleration, thanks to ALM getting better and easier comp as well as the trending. We - as Bill mentioned last thing, since you asked about component pricing, we've only factored in what I would call a marginal modest improvement in pricing. And certainly, we are pleased to see pricing on memory rising, as much as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, but it's - we and the whole industry have been through a lot there. So we'll kind of be prudent and watch it before baking in too much into our numbers. Thanks, Nate. And John, it's Barry. Thanks for the question on revenue management in the quarter within our global RIM business. I would tell you if you look at the storage rental revenue growth there on an organic constant currency basis was 8%, so it was quite strong. And volume was modestly positive as you would see in our disclosures. So the vast majority of that was revenue management, although as we've talked about the last few quarters, we are seeing some positive mix in terms of driving top line revenue growth as well. So majority of its revenue management, a little - some mix and some improving volume trends. And going forward, as I mentioned in one of the earlier comments, we will see relatively speaking, incremental revenue management actions driving the business fourth quarter versus third. So Shlomo, it's Barry. I appreciate the question. Specifically, on how to model Regency, just as a reminder, we are expecting it to close kind of around year-end or early next year for when you want to add it to your model. We noted that it's in excess of $100 million of revenue, Shlomo, and I expect them to exit the year at that level in excess of $100 million, and we see the opportunity for it to be growing into the new year. But of course, we'll give guidance for next year on our next call. But we feel very good about the stability of the business that it's been generating revenue and EBITDA at the levels it's been for some time. And as Bill alluded to, it did not see the sort of trough that our ALM business did on the hyperscale side. It's much more of an enterprise IT asset disposition sort of player. And in that enterprise and government services that it does its - didn't see the level of trough that we did, and it's come back nicely. And so we feel very good about the stability of the business at this point and feel like we're getting a very good, very synergistic deal as Bill mentioned, they have a fair bit of incremental capacity. And so we can get synergy off of bringing Iron Mountain Enterprise clients to Regency for service going forward. I would say - I'll just note that you can work through the math on this that it's sort of in the low mid-20s of an EBITDA margin business. We think that, that has opportunity to expand as relative pricing in the broader market expands and through incremental capacity utilization of the footprint of what they have there. We've been very impressed with the team at Regency for a long time. They've built a very good business with critically important relationships to clients. And we've got a very strong focus on sustainability. So we feel very good about Regency. And as I zoom out to broader ALM, Shlomo, I would say, just to reiterate a point Bill made, the volume is clearly kind of doing well. We are seeing incremental bookings, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, particularly on the enterprise side, on teams having good wins on the hyperscale side as well. And our OEM relationships continue to extend. That's an area that was a focus - has been a focus for us this year. We signed some very important relationships in that area of the market. Of course, it has - the nature of those relationships is that they take a little longer to get to revenue generating, but we are well on our way in the OEM vertical as well. So I appreciate the comment, Shlomo. Hey, Eric, it's Barry. A couple of things there. We would expect CapEx for the whole company to be probably right around $1.3 billion for the year. That's up some from our prior view because, as you point out, the team continues to do very, very well on data center, and we have a lot of construction to do to service the contracts that the team has signed. It's an interesting point about our business within data center, and we're operating now 225 megawatts, which is nearly all leased. And then we're under construction on another 260 megawatts, of which again, like 90% plus, 93% of it is pre-leased. So we are really constructing to contract as opposed to spec. And so it is a situation where you will see us continue to be gradually rising the data center CapEx as we work to build into the contracts that we've signed. And I think it's - read it to the team and the customer wins that we've been having that we've been able to extend our lease expirations to eight plus years on the backs of higher pricing and those returns improving. So it's - we are feeling very good about where we're positioned with data center and the growth thereof, Eric. You're going to see a lot of growth going forward as we build into those leases. Thanks."

            "content": "Thank you, Gillian, and thank you all for taking the time to join us today to discuss another record quarterly results. Once again, our Mountaineers have gone above and beyond in their efforts to serve our customers with innovative solutions that support their businesses, putting our customers first runs deep in all we do and sits at the core of Iron Mountain. This legacy, combined with our dedication to not only protect but to elevate the power of our customers' assets and work continues to drive our execution and growth. Turning to our results. We delivered record third quarter performance once again achieving our highest ever quarterly revenue of $1.4 billion which to put that in context, is an increase of over $100 million year-over-year and record EBITDA of $500 million. The strength in these results is a direct result of the positive momentum we are building from Project Matterhorn. We are more than a year into our growth journey and are pleased with our enhanced operating model, which is empowering our commercial organization to cross-sell our products and services. In the third quarter, we delivered organic storage rental revenue growth of 10% as a result of continued revenue management success and improved volume trends and drove over 20% organic growth in our data center business. Let's begin by turning to some of our customer wins, which played a significant role in our ability to achieve these record results. In our records management business, we had a public sector win this quarter in the U.K. with a new contract worth nearly $2 million. This new project is with an important government agency and has been an Iron Mountain customer for 18 years. In that time, our relationship has expanded from an off-site records management provider to an integral partner at our customers highly secure site, which indicates the trust and confidence our customers have in us. By relocating and digitizing important records securely, our customer can make faster and more informed decisions that are critical due to the sensitive nature of its work, whilst also freeing up on-site space. As a public sector organization, the value for each dollar they spend is a key concern for this customer, and we continue to demonstrate that Iron Mountain is the partner of choice for their digital transformation journey. In Digital Solutions, this business continues to gain momentum, especially with our ability to provide higher value, technology-enabled solutions to new and existing Iron Mountain customers. Customer wins for our digital solutions are underpinned by three key differentiators. First, our unique ability to provide a unified end-to-end solution for our customers across their physical and digital assets. Second, our proven capabilities to operate at scale in complex regulated environments and industries. Last, but importantly, our ability to drive business outcomes for our customers, leveraging our artificial intelligence platform, which translates unstructured data into actionable insights. For example, we have been awarded a contract by the TV and film production distribution division of a major technology company, with a story history dating back almost 100 years, we are leveraging our InSight platform to digitize, archive and preserve over 200,000 legal records containing the media rights for distribution and licensing of thousands of film in titles and TV episodes. With all this data available through one cloud-based digital platform, we can help our customers identify and develop new business opportunities by leveraging its rich intellectual property. This latest deal builds on a growing portfolio of solutions we are providing for this global customers' different business units, including records management and IT asset disposition. The multifaceted long-standing relationship we have with this customer truly highlights the success of Project Matterhorn and our cross-selling efforts. Now let's turn to our continued success in winning government business around the world. We are supporting government agencies in Europe to digitize public services as part of an initiative to make their economies and societies more sustainable and resilient following the COVID-19 pandemic. This quarter, we won a two-year deal to digitize around 10 million files to accelerate a backlog of pension payments for one national government Social Security Administration agency. In awarding Iron Mountain this contract, the customer recognized the specialist nature of our solution, including our AI and human in the loop capabilities and our ability to quickly scale operationally to deliver this project within the required time frame. Also in the public sector, we are pleased to be working with the U.S. citizen and Immigration Services to help drive efficiency and reduce the backlog of applicants awaiting adjudication decisions to become U.S. citizens. Over the last 10 years, we have been a proud partner with this important government agency. Having been entrusted with over 500,000 cubic feet of files in high-density tapes, our digitization solutions will enable remote adjudicators to have faster access to vital data, helping them make overall immigration decisions. Turning to our asset life cycle management business. Consistent with the projections we shared last quarter, pricing has been stable, having hit a low level last February. Whilst industry projections are for significant price improvements in late 2023 and throughout 2024, we have continued to take a prudent perspective and are only assuming marginal incremental pricing improvement for the remainder of the year. Our pipeline is robust, and we have delivered solid results this quarter that were in line with our expectations. Also, we are excited to share that we have signed an agreement to acquire Regency Technologies subject to customary closing conditions as we continue our roll-up of the ALM market. Regency is a little over $100 million annual revenue business in the ALM space based in Ohio. The long-term customer relationships that Regency brings to Iron Mountain are an excellent strategic fit to our ALM business. Regency will add operational scale as we continue our growth journey in this fast-growing sector. As the world's need for both secure and more circular solutions for end-of-life IT assets becomes more vital, we are pleased to add to our capability in this category. With that, let us turn our discussion to some individual wins within the ALM space this quarter. I am pleased to share a particularly exciting win for our ALM business with a large global technology company. The deep relationship and trust we have built with this customer over many years was instrumental in Iron Mountain securing the significant deal serving multiple business lines and geographies for the customer. These geographies include India, where our presence and ability to service the customer was a decisive differentiator alongside our global footprint, the expertise and responsiveness of our ALM team and our reputation for data security and chain of custody. Also in ALM, we have signed a long-term contract with a private U.S. insurance company that has been a long-time customer of our U.S. Secure Shredding and Destruction services. Last year, we began supporting this customer with one-off IT asset destruction projects, which demonstrated the value of remarketing thousands of these assets. The agreement we have now reached positions us as our customers strategic partner for its future end-to-end IT asset management needs. By supporting the requirements of an organization with over 37,000 leased IT assets that need returning from remote employees, we are extending the value of the solutions we bring and have changed our customers' perception of what Iron Mountain can offer. Finally, we have a particularly exciting win to share. We have secured a significant five-year ALM contract to support a leading pharmaceutical retailer in the U.S. to advance its commitment to zero waste by 2030. Iron Mountain will provide a circular economy solution by removing and recycling thousands of tons of pharmaceutical stock bottles and pill bottles from thousands of its retail outlets across the U.S. We are providing this leading retailer with an advanced recycling solution turning plastic into raw materials. This will enable the creation of new virgin plastic, helping this retailer meet their environmental goals. This is made possible by the scale of our physical presence, our highly experienced ALM team and a reporting platform for all of the confidential weights that we have managed for this customer since 2014. We are pleased to be able to extend the value of our partnership with this new contract. Moving on to our data center business. Our pipeline continues to expand with positive pricing trends. The continuing strong demand for data center capacity, continues to be driven by digital transformation and most recently, the explosive demand for AI. Supporting the growth and expansion needs of our customers is paramount to our collaborative partnerships, and we are pleased to provide this required capacity to our customers in the markets in which they are keen to operate. From a leasing perspective, in the third quarter, we signed 65 megawatts. This means that through the end of the third quarter, we have already signed 120 megawatts far beyond our original projection, for the year of 80 megawatts. In the quarter, 60 megawatts were signed across two leases to a single Fortune 500 technology company at our campus in Northern Virginia. The deal provides this hyperscale customer with capacity across two buildings on our 142-acre, 276-megawatt campus and represents, the largest revenue deal in Iron Mountain data center's history. We have also won a deal to provide nearly three megawatts of capacity at our Frankfurt data center for an existing North American cloud services customer looking to expand their European footprint. Our sales teams work closely with the customers' technical team to agree on a strategic solution that meets the customers' unique infrastructure needs. Given the strong customer demand in our data center business, we are continuing to expand the reach of our platform. To that end, I am pleased to announce a couple of capacity additions. First, we are repurposing a previous records management facility in Miami to data center use. Miami is a key market, where a number of our customers, are looking for edge deployments and this newly repurposed facility will add 16 megawatts to our data center portfolio. Furthermore, we have acquired additional land and power this quarter, growing our total data center capacity to 860 megawatts, up 80 megawatts from last quarter. In summary, the hard work dedication and execution of our Mountaineers continues to deliver strong results for our loyal customers and ultimately, our company shareholders. Through our Matterhorn initiative fueled by our enhanced operating model, our team continues to achieve record sales growth by selling our entire mountain range of products and services to our long-standing 225,000 customers. Even in a tumultuous geopolitical climate, the resilience and strength of our business model, combined with the dedication and customer-first passion of our mountaineers continues to drive us ever higher. I would also like to express my deepest gratitude to our team for their hard work and continued focus as we continue our growth journey. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry. Yes. Thanks, George and good morning. So, I think that you can expect and you can see that through the course of the year, even as inflation has come off, is that we're continuing to be able to use revenue management across the board in our - especially in our records management business, and that's really based on how our customers value the services. So, we don't see any change in that trend. And in fact, in terms of customer retention, you've seen even a slight improvement in that during that period of time. So, just as the customers really understand the value that we're applying, and we're actually using revenue management to tap into that. So, we don't see any change in that trend. Thanks, Nate. Let me answer the question on Regency and then Barry will take your other two points. So on Regency, you can imagine they went through probably a similar growth profile that we saw in ALM. And they also have kind of, I would say, hit the low point probably about four months ago. And since then, they're actually growing kind of mid-single digits over the last, say, two, three, four months. And that's - they probably recovered a little bit faster than our business, but that's where the complementary mix of the two businesses is there, both in terms of the customers that they serve, and they do a lot more on the downstream processing, than the business that we have at Iron Mountain that we've acquired through IT renews. So, it's a good complementary fit. But we also see that they've actually, over the last few months, been growing single digits. Obviously, the business will continue to ramp, hence the pricing across the board starts improving. No. Thanks, Jon. So I'll - let me take the ALM and then I'll let Barry talk a little bit more about pricing and volume trends. So on the ALM side, yes, we haven't backed off from our multiyear target that we shared at Investor Day, a little over a year ago. We still see the $900 million as a reasonable target in terms of the business trends, because one thing that we have continued to see is incoming volume. So if you look both year-over-year and year-to-date and sequentially is we do see volume continuing to grow and to ramp. And as Barry said, that we've seen now pricing starting to come back, whilst it's early green shoots, but 15% improvement in memory pricing, which you probably recall from our call last time is the bulk of the components that we sell on is - it shows that we're moving in the right direction to get back towards the type of pricing that we saw couple of years ago. So, if you put that all together and now with the additional capabilities that we're getting from the Regency acquisition is that both - they do a lot more on the downstream processing, which quite frankly, will not only allow us to harvest more value from the products that we're recycling from our customers, but it will also allow us to kind of expand, improve or accelerate our expansion into the OEM channels that we mentioned before. So I think you put that all together is that we feel very good about the targets that we laid out at our Investor Day. Okay. So, Shlomo, let me talk a little bit about the - what we see on the volume trends, and then I'll let Barry put it together in terms of how you should think about modeling that going forward in terms of the business. I'll also come and pick up your point about what exactly Regency ads. So in terms of the volume trends, if you look at the enterprise side of our business, is there, the synergies, and as Barry said in his remarks, almost 100% cross-selling in terms of our ALM business. Is there you see almost triple-digit year-on-year increases in terms of volume that we're getting from our enterprise customers. So in the enterprise segment, we're seeing a really, really good volume. If you look at the hyperscale, which is the part of the business, that we acquired through IT renewal is the one that's most been impacted by what we see on the pricing of the components, which, as we said, is now just starting to move back north in the right direction. Is there, we actually see year-on - if you put year-to-date volume trends of incoming equipment, is we actually see double-digit - strong double-digit growth year-on-year, year-to-date incoming volume. And so the thing that's been muting that incoming volume, quite frankly, has been the pricing, but the good news is the pricing has started to improve. And Barry can help you think through how do you think about putting those two together as we project going forward. The last thing coming to Regency. So I'm glad you picked up on that because I probably should be more explicit on that. So Regency, first of all, they are adding a couple of customers into the portfolio that, quite frankly, we didn't have both in government sector and retail, which I think is really interesting in terms - because a lot of the equipment gets recycled by people dropping off at their retailers. So I think that's a really good capability there. But more importantly, is they actually are able to recycle a lot of what I would call the things that can't be reused directly into IT equipment. So things like we mentioned the plastics for pharmaceutical retailer. They do a lot more of that than we have historically. And the other thing, the other aspect is over the last couple of calls, we mentioned how we had signed up OEM relationships where these are laptop tablet manufacturers that are looking for people when their equipment comes off lease and needs to be recycled is they come to us and other people to actually resell - to refurbish and resell those products. And Regency has much more capability than we do in that area. They built up not only more expertise in refurbishing tablets and laptops than we have, but they also have a very nice e-commerce platform and where they can actually resell those. So they will really accelerate those - accelerate the sales for those channels that we mentioned on the last couple of calls, signing up the OEM manufacturers. So I think their capability will be a nice complementary fit to the contracts that we had already signed. So Eric, I'll take the - I'll talk about the yields that we're getting it. And then Barry can talk about the balance sheet impact and how we're thinking about financing it going forward. So I think on the yields, as you probably - were kind of foreshadowing in the nature of your question. We have seen yields moved up and in Barry's prepared remarks and I think also in mind. I talked about the price improvement or the strength of pricing around data center as demand continues to ramp. So historically, if you think about the journey that you've watched us on, Eric, is a few years ago, we would have said, hyperscale or kind of 7 to 8. I think on the most recent calls, we said hyperscale. These are cash-on-cash returns have been 8 to 9. And now you can expect that they are 9 plus. So we're - and these are all pre-leverage, cash-on-cash returns. So the returns are even with the ramp in the cost to build - well, the cost of build is obviously built in, but in terms of the cost of financing is well ahead after you put the data center together and lease it up is well ahead of our cost of capital. So we feel really good about the returns we're getting even in the higher interest rate environment. Good morning, Brendan. Thanks for the question. So the - yes, so in Miami, you probably can imagine, yes, we are actually scrapping the building. So we're reusing the land in that particular case because it's the way that we could get the most data center capacity into that facility, otherwise we would have been leaving much opportunity on the table. So it's a better use or a better way of actually tapping into that market. But it still gives us kind of - if you look at an all-in basis, probably a 15% reduction in cost to build. And obviously, the speed at which we can enter the market is much faster because trying to find the right location of land in Miami and secure the power can be challenging. So we think both in terms of speed and then 15% cost improvement, which is significant, is really important. And if you look more broadly of the 90 million square feet of industrial real estate that we have around the globe that's associated with our records management business is - think about that's probably in the order of 15% to 20% of the properties are under evaluation on any given day as we look at it. So we're constantly screening about 15% to 20% of our locations and looking at what customers' requirements are and in some cases, having discussions with customers and thinking about which of those sites might be next. And these are generally fit in very nicely for what I call these kind of edge deployments or secondary cities like Miami, right? So this won't be the last one that we - the first and the last. This will be the first of many, we feel as we continue to go forward."

Our team has once again exceeded expectations with performance reflective of our strong legacy of customer service, our laser focus on execution, and our dedication to finding innovative solutions to serve our customers as they evolve their businesses. I'm excited to share that in the second quarter we achieved our highest ever quarterly revenue of $1.36 billion and record EBITDA of $476 million. This performance is ahead of the expectations we provided last quarter. The enhanced operation model we created through Project Matterhorn has continued to prove successful as our commercial team is empowered to sell the entire Mountain range of products and solutions across our portfolio. We are pleased with the high quality and wide range of our offerings today which positions us to be a nimble partner to serve our customers' needs. To highlight some of our results in the second quarter, we delivered organic storage rental revenue growth of 11% and drove high-teens organic growth in both our data center and digital services businesses. We are also pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has increased our quarterly dividend per share to $0.65 or $2.60 per share annualized, commencing with our third quarter dividend to be paid in October. As we have said before, when our AFFO payout ratio reached the mid to low 60s as a percentage, we would increase the dividend. Our payout ratio at the end of the second quarter was just under 64%. I would like to begin our broader discussion of some of the customer wins, which led to our record second quarter results. Let me start with records management, where our success was derived from both new and existing customers. One significant win we would like to highlight this quarter was with a large not-for-profit hospital system, faced with rising lease costs, despite a shrinking storage footprint, the customer turned to us for an alternative to storing in their own space. Our Smart Sort solution will address their needs over the next three years. It will deliver cost efficiency and optimize storage space for the customer before they transfer their records to an Iron Mountain facility for secure future management. This win exemplifies our commitment to solving our customers' problems and providing them with tailored solutions. The COVID-19 pandemic has led organizations around the world to reassess their current real estate portfolios in order to accommodate remote and hybrid work. Our customers are optimizing their real estate to accommodate changing working practices, we are able to offer solutions that demonstrate the breadth of our portfolio and the value of partnering with Iron Mountain across our products and services. One example is a customer who chose our Clean Start solution to remove and relocate records, office equipment, and IT assets from more than 60 offices across North America that are being closed or decommissioned over the next two years. Thanks to our Asset Lifecycle Management solutions, we are also helping this customer to decommission IT assets from these offices securely and sustainably. We continue to see growing momentum for our digital business with customers turning to us for solutions in areas such as public sector, industry focused solutions, and end-to-end business process management. For example, we are proud to be supporting the digitization of real estate mortgage records held by the Helinick Land Registry in Greece under a two year contract worth $35 million. We demonstrated our understanding of the public sector in Greece and of the European Commission's recovery and resilience facility, which is funding this project through the Greek government to support European economies as they transform the way they support their citizens. This is a breakthrough deal that will provide further opportunities to support similar digitization projects elsewhere in Europe. Another example of how our digital business is enabling us to develop and deliver transformational solutions for our largest customers is with one of the biggest financial service companies in the United States. This customer is outsourcing its noncore services and has selected Iron Mountain to manage all of its records. Our end-to-end solution ensures a secure chain of custody regardless of media format for this customer, leveraging our image on demand service and InSight platform to integrate seamlessly with their customer success management system. This game changing deal demonstrates the power of partnering with Iron Mountain to accelerate our customer's digital transformation. Staying with our Digital Solutions business, our 25 year relationship with a Fortune 500 gas and electric utility company continues to be a powerful example of how our customers turn to Iron Mountain because of the range of solutions we can provide. To ensure our customer is compliant with all legal and regulatory requirements we are digitizing around 20 million images from 8,000 boxes stored with Iron Mountain over the next three years. Having provided records management and data management services since 1998, our customer was confident in our Digital Solutions secure chain of custody, information governance expertise, and ability to scale up quickly to deliver this project. To conclude with records management, on 29th June we acquired the controlling interest in Clutter, a tech enabled on demand consumer storage company. We were previously a minority investor in Clutter and provided storage and operational services through a commercial partnership. This acquisition makes us the industry leader in valet self-storage services in North America. Turning to asset lifecycle management, we continue to see muted pricing for the largest part of this business, which relies on reselling used memory, hard drives and CPUs we receive from hyperscalers. That being said, pricing is stabilized, and we do expect to see an improvement as we head into next year. Moreover, you will recall that our ALM business has three components: hyperscale decommissioning, which is highly dependent on component pricing; enterprise ITAD or IT asset disposition; and original equipment manufacturers or OEMs. In these later categories, we are seeing marked growth and traction. For example, in the enterprise segment, our focus on cross selling the Mountain range of products has driven bookings up a 175% versus second quarter last year. For the OEM segment, you will recall that we signed our first MSA or Master Services Agreement in this area last quarter and we have added another MSA with a second OEM this quarter. Turning to specific wins in the ALM area, a good example of our cross selling appeal comes from the health care industry. A customer which has benefited from Iron Mountain's records management solutions for many years has asked us to manage the recovery, decommissioning, disposal and/or recycling of IT assets at over 2,000 locations in the United States. The strength of our relationship and our customers inherent trust in Iron Mountain has resulted in an ALM contract and renewal of our existing services for the next five years. Also in ALM, our team secured a contract with a leading software and technology company to help them decommission racks of servers and nonessential IT equipment from their data center. Opportunities like this where we are able to extend the value we provide to customs has been significantly enhanced, thanks to the industry knowledge and expertise we have gained through our acquisition and integration of IT renew. We remain very excited about ALM, whilst component pricing remains a drag for part of the business, the growth we are achieving in the services side of the business shows how Iron Mountain's brand strength around security, and reliability are a differentiator in this fast growing area. Moving to our data center business, through the first half of the year we leased 55 megawatts, which includes 2.7 megawatts this quarter. As we said in May the first quarter was particularly strong as we signed some deals earlier than expected. Due to our strong pipeline we now feel confident we will exceed our original projection of 80 megawatts in 2023. This confidence is thanks to our teams delivering record new sales in the first half as well as the size of our late-stage pipeline from some of our largest customers as they add new capacity with the growth of AI. For example, we are well positioned with nearly 120 megawatts of unleased capacity on our Nova campus with our fully secured. In this very important market, we are pleased to note that pricing is moving up appreciably. Staying with our business, I would like to highlight a win that demonstrates the exciting opportunities to expand our solutions and services for customers with a footprint in India and the value of our joint venture with Web Werks in the country. As we've discussed before, India is a key focus for our company's growth and our progress there is a major win for our business. In the second quarter, we closed a deal with a multinational media processing company to provide almost 1 megawatt of storage capacity at our Mumbai data center with the potential to add a further 5 megawatts at this facility and extra capacity at other locations in India. Our data centers team's experience of handling high-density racks, Iron Mountain's wider understanding of the media industry and our expansion plans in Mumbai helped us to convince our customer that we are their best long-term partner as their capacity needs grow. Finally, I would like to mention an example of the success we are enjoying in our Crozier Fine Arts business as we build out one of the few globally integrated logistics, storage, and top-quality services businesses in the art world. Recently, we partnered with a major art gallery in the United Kingdom to support an exhibition by well-known artists. This involves detailed planning and preparations to pack and transports 61 fragile sculptures from the US, Mexico, and Continental Europe. We are proud of the unique expertise that our Crozier teams provide for our customers and to be associated with important exhibitions like this one. To conclude, we are proud of the record results we delivered this quarter as this is evidence that our strategy is working. As we continue to leverage the potential of our entire Mountain range, expand our footprint of storage and services, and deliver tailored innovative solutions for each of our customers, I could not be more grateful for the hard work of our mountaineers. Our Matterhorn program is showing the way and delivering consistently strong sales growth, whilst fueling AFFO growth and our dividend. We are more energized than ever to continue reaching new peaks. And I\u2019m excited for the bright future ahead. With that, I will turn the call over to Barry.\nBarry Hytinen: Thanks, Bill, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our results. In the second quarter, our team achieved solid performance across all metrics, exceeding the projections we shared in May. Revenue grew to a record $1.36 billion, up 5% year-on-year on a reported basis and 6% on an organic and constant currency basis. Revenue was above the expectations we provided on our last call driven by outperformance in both our Global RIM and data center businesses. For me, a key highlight in the quarter is our organic storage rental revenue, which grew 11%. I'll note, this performance was on top of a stronger year-on-year comp and represents an acceleration in rate of growth. This reflects strong contributions from revenue management, data center commences, and positive volume trends. Total service revenue was $527 million, down 1% on a constant currency basis. This was consistent with our projections, which factored in the previously discussed year-on-year component price declines. Importantly, component pricing was consistent in the second quarter on a sequential basis. While this represents a significant headwind year-on-year, we are pleased that pricing has stabilized. As a reminder, that affects our IT renew business most prominently. Excluding our ALM business, service revenue was up 8% on a constant currency basis. This would have resulted in total company revenue growth of 9%. Adjusted EBITDA was $476 million, a new record, up 5% year-on-year with revenue management and strong data center commencements being the key drivers. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 35%, in line with our expectations, driven by revenue management and mix. AFFO was $277 million or $0.94 on per share basis, up $6 million and $0.01 respectively from the second quarter of last year. This was well ahead of the expectations we shared on our last call. Now turning to segment performance. In the second quarter, our Global RIM business achieved revenue of $1.16 billion, an increase of $89 million year-on-year, reflecting organic revenue growth of 9%. Revenue management and positive volume trends contribute to strong organic storage rental revenue growth of 9.2%. We delivered organic service revenue growth of 9.3%, driven by Digital Solutions, which were up 20% year-on-year and continued strength in core offerings. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $499 million, an increase of $30 million year-on-year. Turning to our global data center business, the team deliver [Technical Difficulty] From a total revenue perspective we achieved 17% growth on an organic basis. Organic storage rental revenue growth was particularly strong at 22%, driven by commencements and improved pricing. As we projected, data center services were down year-on-year, given the fit out work we were performing in the first half of last year. As a reminder, the second quarter of 2022 represented the last quarter of these specific fit out services. We will have a more normalized comp on this line going forward. Data center adjusted EBITDA was $54 million, representing 27% growth. Turning to new and expansion leasing, we signed 2.7 megawatts in the quarter, bringing total bookings year-to-date to 55 megawatts. As Bill mentioned, we are well on track to achieve our leasing projection for the full year of 80 megawatts. And in fact, with the strength of our building pipeline, we have line of sight to exceed this projection. Turning to asset life cycle management, in the second quarter, revenue grew 4% on a sequential basis, slightly ahead of the projections we gave on our last call. We are seeing positive momentum across all three verticals of our ALM business, which include: hyperscale decommissioning; enterprise ITAD, and OEM. You will recall that China was mostly free of restrictions in the first half of last year, but it returned to tight lockdowns in the second half. As a result, as we anniversary the second quarter comparisons going forward will be much more favorable. While we are diversifying away from China, it is the largest market into which we sell components today. At the beginning of this year, as lockdowns eased, while component volumes increased, pricing declined to record low levels. Industry analysts project March improvement in pricing by the fourth quarter and even more significantly in 2024. To be prudent we have not factored any pricing improvement into our outlook for 2023. Turning to capital. In the second quarter we invested $320 million, of which $287 million was growth and $33 million was recurring. In 2023, we now expect total capital expenditures to be approximately $1.2 billion, up $200 million from our prior expectations. This reflects an increase to our data center development plans given our strong leasing year-to-date and building pipeline that I mentioned. Turning to the balance sheet. With strong EBITDA performance we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.1 times, reflecting a meaningful improvement from last year. We have remained at this leverage level for the past three quarters and at March our lowest leverage level since 2017. Importantly, we expect to exit 2023 at this level even with our increased investment in data center. Turning to our dividend. On a trailing four quarter basis our payout ratio was now 63.9% and approximately 400 basis point improvement from this time last year. As you saw earlier today, we are pleased to announce that our board of directors has authorized an increase to our quarterly dividend of 5%, bringing it to $0.65 per share to be paid in early October. This is consistent with our long term commentary that as our payout ratio settles into the mid to low 60s as a percentage of AFFO, you should expect the dividend to rise. We remain dedicated to our disciplined approach to capital allocation as we are funding our growth objectives, while continuing to drive meaningful shareholder returns. And now, turning to our projections. For the full year, reflecting our performance in the first half and strong outlook, we are pleased to reiterate our full year guidance. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in excess of $1.4 billion, adjusted EBITDA of approaching $500 million, AFFO of approximately $290 million and AFFO per share of approximately $0.99. I would like to provide a bit more context for our guidance. In terms of revenue, our third quarter projection equates to growth of 9% as compared to prior year. To frame that, I would recommend investors consider the following points. First, the prior year comparable in our ALM business is much easier in the third and fourth quarters of this year as compared to the first half. Second, we have incremental revenue management actions, which will go into effect in the third and fourth quarters, and will provide a nice tailwind. Lastly, if you consider the underlying trends in the rest of the business, growth has been accelerating for several quarters now our Matterhorn efforts are driving performance. For example, excluding our ALM business, the rest of the business's growth rate was 8% in the first quarter, 9% in the second quarter and our projection is for 10% in the third quarter. And just as a reminder, the fourth quarter of 2022 is our easiest growth comparable this year. To conclude, our team continues to execute well and remains focused on driving our growth agenda. We have a growing and well diversified pipeline and we are positioned to achieve our objectives. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our entire team for their efforts and contributions. And with that, operator, would you please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: We\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. In the ALM business, performance was impacted by component price declines. And you noted that you saw signs of stabilization in component prices. Can you elaborate a little bit more on that? What trend specifically did you see on component prices, and how would you deconstruct ALM growth between pricing and volumes?\nBarry Hytinen: Okay. Hi, George. This is Barry. Thank you for the question. Yes, let me help you with that. From a standpoint of the way the decommissioning and component price business has been unfolding this year. As you know, early this year, late last year and into early this year, component pricing was dropping quite appreciably. And by about the February time frame, it had reached over essentially all time record lows. And that's really across the gambit of component pricing from memory to CPUs, all the various components that we're selling. And, that has obviously been a significant impact for both Iron Mountain, but also for many other players in the technology industry. I think importantly what you've seen, and I'm sure you would have been following this, many of the OEMs have significantly reduced their production of new components, which is now limiting supply in the marketplace. And of course, used component pricing tends to directly correlate and follow with new. And so, what we've seen here since the component pricing hit the lows in the kind of February timeframe is, importantly, pricing has been very consistent. In fact, some components have been ticking up. We've seen that in certain elements of memory among other component pricing. So, what we've worked into our outlook though, George, is that, we are keeping component pricing in our outlook for this year at this record level low levels. And our thought process is, that's a prudent way to plan. When you look at industry analysts, then there's -- this is publicly available data, there are many estimates that project for component pricing to begin to lift as we move through the remainder of 2023 and in fact have very, very sharp increases in most component pricing next year in light of supply and demand expectations. As I said, we're not baking that into our 2023 outlook for prudent reasons. We are anticipating that our total ALM business will be up just a few million dollars on a sequential basis in the third quarter. And then will be up again in the fourth quarter, but that speaks to the points that Bill made in his prepared remarks that, for example, in our enterprise ITAD business, bookings are up a tremendous amount in the second quarter year-on-year. We are winning more decommissioning business across that decommissioning vertical. And of course, our OEM teams have been winning very important wins for us, which I think set us up very well for the intermediate and longer term in the broader asset lifecycle management space. Volume on a sequential basis was essentially equivalent, George, which we felt good about. And I would say the forward pipeline as it relates to volume in light of what I've just mentioned is favorable for us. So we feel that we are now getting through the hardest comps of the year. As you know, last year, we were $72 million, -- $71 million, $72 million of revenue in the first quarter with ALM, we were $83 million in the second quarter. That dropped quite appreciably to $60 million in the third and $55 million or so in the fourth. So that goes to my point about the comps get easier with pricing being flat to up, we feel well positioned. Thanks, George.\nOperator: The next question comes from Nate Crossett of BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nNate Crossett: Thank you. So is it fair to say, I guess, that the service revenue growth year-over-year, like, this is the low quarter in 2Q? And that we should expect maybe it to trend out from here? And then maybe just comment on storage rental growth that still remains very strong. Can you maybe just speak to recent customer conversations and your ability to push price?\nBarry Hytinen: Okay. Thanks, Nate. This is Barry. Couple things there. So, on services, yes, you are thinking about that right, because really when you look at the total company's service revenue growth, it was completely impacted by the fact that the ALM business was essentially half that which it was in the prior year. And at that some $40 million of revenue, that's a big drag on the service in total because, as you know, all of the ALM revenue essentially is on the service line. And I'll give you a point that if you look at Global RIM, for example, our service revenue there was up over 9%. And so, the total company's service revenue will be improving. It should be positive in the third quarter, of course, and furthermore in the fourth quarter because, frankly, by then ALM no longer is a drag on our service revenue. In fact, I think it may even -- there's a chance it may be accretive to growth rate in service by the fourth quarter. In terms of storage rental revenue growth, we have had -- as your question alludes to, strong performance there and our revenue management actions have been very well received. We are, of course, very focused on driving value for our customers and making sure that they understand the significant value that Iron Mountain provides, both in terms of our core offerings of records and -- but also all the other offerings that we can cross sell around things such as enterprise IT asset disposition, data center services, among other. And so, in terms of where you should expect storage rental revenue growth, volume has been trending very consistent with our expectations. It's been modestly positive and we continue to expect that positive outlook. And from a revenue standpoint, total revenue standpoint, you should expect it to continue to be comping quite well. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we do have some incremental revenue management actions in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And that helps the growth rate, particularly in the fourth quarter, Nate, because as you may remember, last year more of our revenue management actions were shifted into the third quarter just from a timing of what we were doing last year. And this year, it's a little bit spread out. So these new revenue management actions that I alluded to today on the call, that's incremental to our prior plans and will be, as I said, a nice tailwind to growth rate. So thank you for the question, Nate.\nWilliam Meaney: Yes. And just one thing I would add for Nate on the storage trend sort of volume, you probably picked up from some of the wins we highlighted is that, as companies are shifting their use of space as the workforce is more remote or hybrid. That's yielding both increased volume for our storage facilities as they clean out or decide that they want to have it depoed rather than in an office that people don't visit as much or at all anymore. As well as, as Barry pointed out, [indiscernible] behind this 175% year-over-year increase in ITAD bookings, both because as companies are kind of cleaning out, it's a tailwind both on the storage in the ITAD business.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Steinerman of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nAlex Hess: Yes. Hi. This is Alex Hess on for Andrew Steinerman. Maybe just to dig in on Global RIM for a second. Can you remind us what percent of storage revenues are in some manner CPI linked with -- maybe what the price floor and lease terms look like nowadays? And then just quickly on Clutter, how does that factor into your outlook and maybe some thoughts around that business, which we understand had some cash flow issues as a standalone company on its own. Thanks guys.\nBarry Hytinen: Okay. Hi, Alex. It's Barry. Thanks for those questions. For proprietary and confidential reasons, we don't generally characterize our contracts too specifically. But what I'll say is, certainly as you know, you follow the company for such a long time, we have a very large number of customers, 200 -- call it, 200,000 plus client relationships. The vast majority of those are on our standard, if you will, paper that allows us to affect revenue management actions. And as I said before, we are very aligned with driving value.at times of essentially our choosing and is not, if you will, linked to any sort of indices. There are some, what I would describe as more bespoke contracts with some of our largest clients, which may have specific agreements around escalators and the like, but that is the -- that is a small number of total contracts. With respect to Clutter, appreciate that question. As just to help others who may not be as familiar with Clutter. Clutter is a business that we have had a minority stake in for a while now and it was a form of a joint venture. We own about 25% of the company prior to the transaction that we mentioned this morning. And that's on the valet self-storage. So it is a business that we have been providing, if you will, back end services too for some time in storing a fair bit of the volume that Clutter had been bringing in from consumers. And what Clutter's focus had been on is building a brand and aggregating consumer demand, principally in, as Bill mentioned, tech enabled manner. On a net basis, when all is said and done, we'll pay a little over some $20 million to buy the business will also contribute various of our assets. So you'll see that through our other expense and income line on the P&L. And from a standpoint, for your modeling purposes, revenue on a quarterly basis, this being the incremental revenue that Iron Mountain will recognize now because, of course, we were recognizing revenue from what we were doing for services to Clutter previously. We'll recognize maybe a bit over $10 million. It'll be an excess of $10 million on a quarterly basis, likely to be growing as we move into the New Year. And from an EBITDA standpoint and you would have seen this from our prior filings because, of course, we were absorbing our minority interest in Clutter through our P&L. As I said, they've been building their brand for some time. So it is -- Clutter has been absorbing a modest EBITDA loss on a quarterly basis, thinks something in the vicinity of a couple of $1 million a quarter over time and perhaps by, let's say, 2024, we expect to be able to drive that to breakeven and ultimately to generating positive EBITDA out of the Clutter Enterprise itself as we drive operating synergies by combining the two businesses together. I'll just note, of course, Iron Mountain had been generating positive EBITDA on the relationship previously. So the incremental negative drag that I just referenced is purely off of the brand building elements of the clutter enterprise itself. The last thing I'll note is -- Alex is, of course, we reiterated our guidance and feel very good about it, despite absorbing that little drag there from Clutter that we will absorb here in the second half. So appreciate the questions.\nOperator: The next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Thank you very much. Could you talk a little bit about the gross margin trends? They were --look like they were down particularly in the services, down like 200 basis points year-over-year. Does that have to do with something from ALM or something else? I saw the labor costs were up almost 10% year-over-year. And, also, I thought maybe you could just comment. Bill, I always add you about talking about the underlying trends in the volumes in the wind business. If you could just comment on that, are you getting more positive trends in the historical mature markets than what we've seen before. You mentions, like, that hospital contract. Is that something that was going to lead to more positive volume trends in an area that historically been a little bit more of a weaker trends.\nWilliam Meaney: Okay. Let me start with the labor costs and the trends in terms of the volume. So I think, first, starting off on the volume trends is, as I was saying to Nate -- to Nate's question is that, overall, the volume, as you can see, is flat, slightly up. So it's trending in the right direction. And I wouldn't say this is a -- it's going to be a massive change. But what we see, if you think about 730 million cubic feet, so it's a very large base that we're operating on, is the trends that we see both in some of the new storage areas, but as well as what we see in people going into a hybrid or remote working aspect. It really is getting a lot more traction for our Smart Sort and Clean Start type solutions, which uncover more storage, also the services that we can provide being depoed. In other words, we can serve their employees anywhere they are. They don't have to come to the office to actually get information back, whether we give it back to them physically or image on demand. And then it's also uncovering, as we say, is driving a lot of the increased bookings that we see in the enterprise ALM side of the business and fueling that 175% growth that we see. So overall, we feel really good about where the trends are, but you can imagine, on 730 million cubic feet around the world, is that -- even what I call quite macro trends that I described are --don't change the overall trajectory like massively, but it is definitely a tailwind for that business. And on labor costs, before I hand it back to Barry is, you're right, labor costs is up. Some of it is as we go into new areas in terms -- as we ramp, or some of the projects that we ramp on, then obviously we're bringing labor in ahead of time. And the other part is making sure that our mountaineers around the world are well looked after, because we really do see the -- it's the core to us. We're a business services company. And the first impression that our customers have is our mountaineers, and we want to make sure that they and their families are well looked after. And the inflation environment globally has been challenging for a number of our colleagues.\nBarry Hytinen: Yeah. Shlomo, this is Barry. Maybe I'll just pick up there on [Technical Difficulty] you would have seen a similar increase in the first quarter when we made the actions as it relates to improved wages that Bill was just referring to. And then, I would point out on a sequential basis, labor was up about 2%, while service revenue was up 5% on a sequential basis, reflecting the [Technical Difficulty] down year-on-year. As your question alluded to, that has all to do with our component pricing, IT renew, because when you think about it, we are still processing a considerable amount of volume, yet we are recognizing a much lower price. And so, if you excluded the impact of component pricing, actually service gross margins were up quite nicely, which speaks to the ongoing trend in the rest of the core and frankly to the productivity that the team is driving in asset lifecycle management. So when you think about what could happen with our gross margins as pricing recovers, we've got a lot of operating leverage in that business. So I feel good about the forward look if the industry projections are anywhere close to accurate for where pricing will be next year, I think we're going to see a really nice lift there. So thanks, Shlomo.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jon Atkin of RBC. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Atkin: Thank you. Couple of questions. First, just interested in how to kind of frame the exposure in your data center business to [indiscernible] where there's a lease in in Phoenix. And then, interested in just the data center development pipeline and kind of the opportunities ahead and your thoughts about bringing in third-party capital to maybe co-invest. There was obviously a recent transaction in India and in other countries where third-party capital is [indiscernible] in the development projects of some of the established players and your thoughts on pursuing that route from a capital standpoint? Thanks.\nWilliam Meaney: Okay. Thanks, Jon. I'll start with the -- what we see on the data center horizon and the I\u2019ll turn it over to Barry. I think first of all, we're really pleased with how our data center business continues to grow. And also, as you know, I know you cover the industry extremely closely is that, pricing is up markedly, like as we look in markets like Northern Virginia on a triple net basis as we see around the hyperscale segment, pricing up some 40% so the returns continue to grow and keep pace. I think in terms of -- looking at the size of our pipeline, Barry mentioned [Technical Difficulty] million on top of the $1 billion that we already had for investment capital in 2023. Based on the strength of that pipeline and the success that we're having, pretty much across the globe is that -- I mean, you're right that we're always kind of conscious of in terms of how we fund our projects. That being said, we're actually fortunate that we have the records management business and our other services business, which is like a financial beast. I mean, it just generates a tremendous amount of cash that not only fuels the dividend, but it also fuels a lot of the development capital into our data centers. So I wouldn't say that we're in a situation where kind of a company that is solely in the date center space that has only to itself to look for in terms of how it funds itself going forward to drive a lot of the development. We actually have a growing, but some people will consider a mature business in terms of the amount of capital we have to put into that because it\u2019s a very scaled high operating leverage business and we are able to use funds and profitability from that to fund a big part of our development. That being said, as you know, that we've done -- we have taken third-party capital a couple of times already, and we typically do that on stabilized or near stabilized assets and tap into funds that where people are looking for relatively low yielding, but long maturity or duration type assets. And we'll continue to do that as some of our portfolio stabilizes. I can imagine that we would recycle capital when the opportunity presents itself. But overall, if you look at the plan that we laid out last September in terms of our Investor Day, we're probably a little bit ahead of that in data center just because of the growth that we've been seeing in the first half of this year and what we see in the pipeline. But we feel pretty good about that we have a fully funded plan in terms of the way we're doing it now. But if there's opportunities, as I say, to take third-party capital, especially around stabilized assets, generally that boost our returns long term and we will do that.\nBarry Hytinen: Hey, Jon. It\u2019s Barry. Thanks for the question. We for natural and perhaps obvious reasons we don't tend to comment on individual clients. But as you noted, there are some things out there in the public domain as well as in their filings that would confirm that they are client of ours in Arizona. That's obviously a very long-standing relationship that goes back to prior to our ownership of one of the data centers that we purchased there. I mentioned that intently because, of course, it's a long standing contract with pricing that goes back quite a ways and, frankly, is sort of a -- almost a build to suit type of situation for them where it would not be [Technical Difficulty] let me put it this way. In Arizona, we are essentially a 100% [Technical Difficulty] we are 100% lease now in Scottsdale on what we're under construction for in our second facility, phase 5 and 6, were 100% -- 5 and 8, we're 100% leased as well in terms of prelease. So it's not a particularly large revenue client, Jon. And beyond that, I wouldn't want to comment, but you would see in the filings the relative amount of, let's say, credit that we have between the two entities. And I feel very confident that in light of where we see pricing, and I'll just -- maybe I should just add this. That in general, on hyperscale pricing today, we're seeing on a triple net basis pricing up about 40%. And so, we feel very good about where data center is trending on a macro basis and where we are. And one last point, just build on thing Bill was mentioning. And when you look at our, I think there's a unique part of our data center story is, we're operating about 220 megawatts. We're nearly fully leased on that. And we're under construction on about another 200 megawatts. And the thing to think about that is, we're not building to [Technical Difficulty] anything, and we're 91% prelease on everything that we have [Technical Difficulty] doing a phenomenal job, and we're working hard to figure out which other facilities to start construction on as the pipeline continues to build quite appreciably. So we feel really good about where our data center business is trending, Jon. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin McVeigh of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. Thanks so much, and thanks for the disclosures. Hey, Barry, can we unpack the guidance a little bit? I just want to make sure understand, because it seems like you reiterated the full year. But if I think about the puts and takes, it sounds like the pricing is a lot better. The CapEx is going up a lot. And, again, that may not be revenue that comes in. It looks like the Q2 is a little better. It looks like the Clutter is going to have some incremental revenue modestly. Is that offset the ALM business, or is it just a little bit of conservatism? And just, as you put that all together, how should we think about cash flow for the full year, not operating, but just what the use of cash should be, particularly given the step-up in the CapEx.\nBarry Hytinen: Okay. Thanks Kevin. Appreciate that. You're right that our revenue management program is doing very, very well. And obviously, our storage rental revenue growth has been growing. And as I mentioned, some of our growth rates are actually accelerating that being one of those. And that's thanks to both our Global RIM teams, as well as our data center teams, because commencements has been very strong. You referenced that CapEx is up, as I mentioned, that's going to build out our data center portfolio that's already preleased. So we are endeavoring to meet all customer demand, which continues to ramp. In terms of -- you are right, Clutter adds a relatively small amount of revenue. We probably are a touch more conservative with ALM in the back half, Kevin, than where we were at the beginning of the year because, of course, at the beginning of the year component pricing was still -- was still coming down. And now it's stabilized we've recognized that those stable levels of pricing. As I said, that may prove to be conservative as we move through the year, but we are only halfway through. So we tend to try to not get ahead of ourselves, Kevin. In terms of cash generation and the compilation of the incremental CapEx. Here\u2019s what I'd underscore. We have reiterated our leverage expectations that we will be at 5.1 times at year end, which is consistent with where we are today, and at a multiyear level low. So we feel really good about the cash generation of the business. We're generating incrementally higher returns in data center on that CapEx investment. Returns on hyperscale have moved from kind of the seven, eight level to more like eight, nine, and retail cash on levered returns are also quite firm. And so, we're blending into that low double digit vicinity on a combined basis. We feel really good about where things are trending, Kevin, so appreciate your questions.\nOperator: The next question comes from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nEric Luebchow: Hi. Thanks for the questions. Two, if I could. So, just wanted to touch again on the data center pipeline. Any requirements you see that you think are tied to this wave of generative AI demand we're hearing about in the industry? And does that change at all how you design your data center for some of the higher densities that are required for these types of deployments? And then secondly, on the hyperscale ALM business. I know you talked about China COVID shutdowns impacting that business. Has there been any move to kind of diversify your end markets to resale beyond China to help reduce the concentration there? Thank you.\nWilliam Meaney: Thanks, Eric. So, yes, on the trends that we're seeing, I mean, and you've been following this industry for [EON's] (ph). I think you see the same thing I did -- we have, right? I mean, maybe a year ago we saw -- still very high growth in high scale, but they're probably a little bit more conservative. And now there's another wave of really accelerated growth because they're trying to keep pace with the amount of compute power is required to really run a lot of these large language models associated with the AI programs. And so, we have seen a -- it's not just type, but we actually see virtually all of our largest hyperscale customers coming to us looking for more capacity. And that's why we were speaking with such confidence that we'll exceed our original full year guidance in terms of the amount of leasing activity we expect. It's just -- it is very, very strong. Now in terms of the type of deployment, you're also right that the density that they're looking for is much higher. And I think I'm right to say probably year, year and a half ago we didn't have any customers coming to us and asking us to water cool in racks to actually support some of these higher densities. And now we are seeing a number of deployments that are requiring that kind of design. Luckily, I mean, we built our designs to be flexible. And of course, for these large deployments, we're actually doing the design to meet the customer, very specific customer requirements. So we're able to accommodate the higher density quite easily. But you're right. I mean, with the density that some folks are looking at and the amount of power they want to put in a rack, we are cooling using different methods and specifically some water cooling in rack to support the requirements.\nBarry Hytinen: And Eric, it's, Barry. As it relates to diversifying away from China, as we've talked about before, that certainly is a focus of the team. We have added to our organization in ALM and specifically around diversifying the downstream channels, we are making steady progress, but it is slow because, of course, as we've said before, China is the main market for us in that regard. But we are looking at and branching into throughout Southeast Asia there are opportunities we think over the intermediate term in India. We certainly have been selling more components into the U.S. and Europe as well, and that's a key focus, as well as the Mid-East. So there is -- there are opportunities there, and we are building that -- those channels The other thing I'll just build on and link the two questions is, when you think about hyperscale decommissioning, we generally are decommissioning data centers that were put into service, let's say, five years prior. And so -- on average. And the thing about AI in this very significant ramp in terms of hyperscale data center development right now is, it will provide even another leg to our hyperscale decommissioning growth five years on. Historically I've had some questions about like, well, how does the decommissioning business continue to ramp over time? And of course, the things that we'll be decommissioning this year are components that were put in place about five years ago. And next year, we'll be decommissioning things that were put in place four years ago. And as those data center platforms have grown, it provides that much larger of a platform for us to decommission in the future. And I think it shouldn't be lost on us that of this AI growth is going to drive another substantial leg up in the opportunity for hyperscale decommissioning in the future. And as the leader in that space, we feel quite good about the future.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Brendan Lynch of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrendan Lynch: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask on the storage -- excuse me, the retention rate in the Global RIM business, it looks like you contracted about 100 basis points year-over-year and it's at, probably the lowest level in the past few years. I understand that the storage business has generated really strong growth, driven by price, but maybe you could kind of square some of those dynamics there as well.\nBarry Hytinen: Okay. Hi, Brendan. It\u2019s a -- thanks for the question. When you look at that metric, I'll just remind you that it is on a trailing four quarter basis. So what you've got going on there is -- what you've got going on there is an element of COVID still because we were naturally seeing client fell little bit less activity of switching and/or disruption, what have you, during the COVID period and even in the period after we all felt like COVID was over, if you will. And so, that's a little bit of catching up. But if you look back on that metric over, let\u2019s say, the last 15 years and that data is available in our historic disclosure, you'd find that we're in a very tight band and not outside our normal levels from a pre COVID standpoint. I appreciate the question. I will tell you that we feel we feel -- we are -- our customer relationships are very good. We can -- as you linked it to revenue management, I would say our focus on revenue management is continuing to educate our customers on the very significant value we drive for them day in and day out. And the fact that our volume continues to trend positively, I think, should give you a very good indicator there of how we're doing with our customers.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and the Iron Mountain Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Barry Hytinen",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our results. In the second quarter, our team achieved solid performance across all metrics, exceeding the projections we shared in May. Revenue grew to a record $1.36 billion, up 5% year-on-year on a reported basis and 6% on an organic and constant currency basis. Revenue was above the expectations we provided on our last call driven by outperformance in both our Global RIM and data center businesses. For me, a key highlight in the quarter is our organic storage rental revenue, which grew 11%. I'll note, this performance was on top of a stronger year-on-year comp and represents an acceleration in rate of growth. This reflects strong contributions from revenue management, data center commences, and positive volume trends. Total service revenue was $527 million, down 1% on a constant currency basis. This was consistent with our projections, which factored in the previously discussed year-on-year component price declines. Importantly, component pricing was consistent in the second quarter on a sequential basis. While this represents a significant headwind year-on-year, we are pleased that pricing has stabilized. As a reminder, that affects our IT renew business most prominently. Excluding our ALM business, service revenue was up 8% on a constant currency basis. This would have resulted in total company revenue growth of 9%. Adjusted EBITDA was $476 million, a new record, up 5% year-on-year with revenue management and strong data center commencements being the key drivers. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 35%, in line with our expectations, driven by revenue management and mix. AFFO was $277 million or $0.94 on per share basis, up $6 million and $0.01 respectively from the second quarter of last year. This was well ahead of the expectations we shared on our last call. Now turning to segment performance. In the second quarter, our Global RIM business achieved revenue of $1.16 billion, an increase of $89 million year-on-year, reflecting organic revenue growth of 9%. Revenue management and positive volume trends contribute to strong organic storage rental revenue growth of 9.2%. We delivered organic service revenue growth of 9.3%, driven by Digital Solutions, which were up 20% year-on-year and continued strength in core offerings. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $499 million, an increase of $30 million year-on-year. Turning to our global data center business, the team deliver [Technical Difficulty] From a total revenue perspective we achieved 17% growth on an organic basis. Organic storage rental revenue growth was particularly strong at 22%, driven by commencements and improved pricing. As we projected, data center services were down year-on-year, given the fit out work we were performing in the first half of last year. As a reminder, the second quarter of 2022 represented the last quarter of these specific fit out services. We will have a more normalized comp on this line going forward. Data center adjusted EBITDA was $54 million, representing 27% growth. Turning to new and expansion leasing, we signed 2.7 megawatts in the quarter, bringing total bookings year-to-date to 55 megawatts. As Bill mentioned, we are well on track to achieve our leasing projection for the full year of 80 megawatts. And in fact, with the strength of our building pipeline, we have line of sight to exceed this projection. Turning to asset life cycle management, in the second quarter, revenue grew 4% on a sequential basis, slightly ahead of the projections we gave on our last call. We are seeing positive momentum across all three verticals of our ALM business, which include: hyperscale decommissioning; enterprise ITAD, and OEM. You will recall that China was mostly free of restrictions in the first half of last year, but it returned to tight lockdowns in the second half. As a result, as we anniversary the second quarter comparisons going forward will be much more favorable. While we are diversifying away from China, it is the largest market into which we sell components today. At the beginning of this year, as lockdowns eased, while component volumes increased, pricing declined to record low levels. Industry analysts project March improvement in pricing by the fourth quarter and even more significantly in 2024. To be prudent we have not factored any pricing improvement into our outlook for 2023. Turning to capital. In the second quarter we invested $320 million, of which $287 million was growth and $33 million was recurring. In 2023, we now expect total capital expenditures to be approximately $1.2 billion, up $200 million from our prior expectations. This reflects an increase to our data center development plans given our strong leasing year-to-date and building pipeline that I mentioned. Turning to the balance sheet. With strong EBITDA performance we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.1 times, reflecting a meaningful improvement from last year. We have remained at this leverage level for the past three quarters and at March our lowest leverage level since 2017. Importantly, we expect to exit 2023 at this level even with our increased investment in data center. Turning to our dividend. On a trailing four quarter basis our payout ratio was now 63.9% and approximately 400 basis point improvement from this time last year. As you saw earlier today, we are pleased to announce that our board of directors has authorized an increase to our quarterly dividend of 5%, bringing it to $0.65 per share to be paid in early October. This is consistent with our long term commentary that as our payout ratio settles into the mid to low 60s as a percentage of AFFO, you should expect the dividend to rise. We remain dedicated to our disciplined approach to capital allocation as we are funding our growth objectives, while continuing to drive meaningful shareholder returns. And now, turning to our projections. For the full year, reflecting our performance in the first half and strong outlook, we are pleased to reiterate our full year guidance. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in excess of $1.4 billion, adjusted EBITDA of approaching $500 million, AFFO of approximately $290 million and AFFO per share of approximately $0.99. I would like to provide a bit more context for our guidance. In terms of revenue, our third quarter projection equates to growth of 9% as compared to prior year. To frame that, I would recommend investors consider the following points. First, the prior year comparable in our ALM business is much easier in the third and fourth quarters of this year as compared to the first half. Second, we have incremental revenue management actions, which will go into effect in the third and fourth quarters, and will provide a nice tailwind. Lastly, if you consider the underlying trends in the rest of the business, growth has been accelerating for several quarters now our Matterhorn efforts are driving performance. For example, excluding our ALM business, the rest of the business's growth rate was 8% in the first quarter, 9% in the second quarter and our projection is for 10% in the third quarter. And just as a reminder, the fourth quarter of 2022 is our easiest growth comparable this year. To conclude, our team continues to execute well and remains focused on driving our growth agenda. We have a growing and well diversified pipeline and we are positioned to achieve our objectives. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our entire team for their efforts and contributions. And with that, operator, would you please open the line for Q&A. Okay. Hi, George. This is Barry. Thank you for the question. Yes, let me help you with that. From a standpoint of the way the decommissioning and component price business has been unfolding this year. As you know, early this year, late last year and into early this year, component pricing was dropping quite appreciably. And by about the February time frame, it had reached over essentially all time record lows. And that's really across the gambit of component pricing from memory to CPUs, all the various components that we're selling. And, that has obviously been a significant impact for both Iron Mountain, but also for many other players in the technology industry. I think importantly what you've seen, and I'm sure you would have been following this, many of the OEMs have significantly reduced their production of new components, which is now limiting supply in the marketplace. And of course, used component pricing tends to directly correlate and follow with new. And so, what we've seen here since the component pricing hit the lows in the kind of February timeframe is, importantly, pricing has been very consistent. In fact, some components have been ticking up. We've seen that in certain elements of memory among other component pricing. So, what we've worked into our outlook though, George, is that, we are keeping component pricing in our outlook for this year at this record level low levels. And our thought process is, that's a prudent way to plan. When you look at industry analysts, then there's -- this is publicly available data, there are many estimates that project for component pricing to begin to lift as we move through the remainder of 2023 and in fact have very, very sharp increases in most component pricing next year in light of supply and demand expectations. As I said, we're not baking that into our 2023 outlook for prudent reasons. We are anticipating that our total ALM business will be up just a few million dollars on a sequential basis in the third quarter. And then will be up again in the fourth quarter, but that speaks to the points that Bill made in his prepared remarks that, for example, in our enterprise ITAD business, bookings are up a tremendous amount in the second quarter year-on-year. We are winning more decommissioning business across that decommissioning vertical. And of course, our OEM teams have been winning very important wins for us, which I think set us up very well for the intermediate and longer term in the broader asset lifecycle management space. Volume on a sequential basis was essentially equivalent, George, which we felt good about. And I would say the forward pipeline as it relates to volume in light of what I've just mentioned is favorable for us. So we feel that we are now getting through the hardest comps of the year. As you know, last year, we were $72 million, -- $71 million, $72 million of revenue in the first quarter with ALM, we were $83 million in the second quarter. That dropped quite appreciably to $60 million in the third and $55 million or so in the fourth. So that goes to my point about the comps get easier with pricing being flat to up, we feel well positioned. Thanks, George. Okay. Thanks, Nate. This is Barry. Couple things there. So, on services, yes, you are thinking about that right, because really when you look at the total company's service revenue growth, it was completely impacted by the fact that the ALM business was essentially half that which it was in the prior year. And at that some $40 million of revenue, that's a big drag on the service in total because, as you know, all of the ALM revenue essentially is on the service line. And I'll give you a point that if you look at Global RIM, for example, our service revenue there was up over 9%. And so, the total company's service revenue will be improving. It should be positive in the third quarter, of course, and furthermore in the fourth quarter because, frankly, by then ALM no longer is a drag on our service revenue. In fact, I think it may even -- there's a chance it may be accretive to growth rate in service by the fourth quarter. In terms of storage rental revenue growth, we have had -- as your question alludes to, strong performance there and our revenue management actions have been very well received. We are, of course, very focused on driving value for our customers and making sure that they understand the significant value that Iron Mountain provides, both in terms of our core offerings of records and -- but also all the other offerings that we can cross sell around things such as enterprise IT asset disposition, data center services, among other. And so, in terms of where you should expect storage rental revenue growth, volume has been trending very consistent with our expectations. It's been modestly positive and we continue to expect that positive outlook. And from a revenue standpoint, total revenue standpoint, you should expect it to continue to be comping quite well. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we do have some incremental revenue management actions in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And that helps the growth rate, particularly in the fourth quarter, Nate, because as you may remember, last year more of our revenue management actions were shifted into the third quarter just from a timing of what we were doing last year. And this year, it's a little bit spread out. So these new revenue management actions that I alluded to today on the call, that's incremental to our prior plans and will be, as I said, a nice tailwind to growth rate. So thank you for the question, Nate. Okay. Hi, Alex. It's Barry. Thanks for those questions. For proprietary and confidential reasons, we don't generally characterize our contracts too specifically. But what I'll say is, certainly as you know, you follow the company for such a long time, we have a very large number of customers, 200 -- call it, 200,000 plus client relationships. The vast majority of those are on our standard, if you will, paper that allows us to affect revenue management actions. And as I said before, we are very aligned with driving value.at times of essentially our choosing and is not, if you will, linked to any sort of indices. There are some, what I would describe as more bespoke contracts with some of our largest clients, which may have specific agreements around escalators and the like, but that is the -- that is a small number of total contracts. With respect to Clutter, appreciate that question. As just to help others who may not be as familiar with Clutter. Clutter is a business that we have had a minority stake in for a while now and it was a form of a joint venture. We own about 25% of the company prior to the transaction that we mentioned this morning. And that's on the valet self-storage. So it is a business that we have been providing, if you will, back end services too for some time in storing a fair bit of the volume that Clutter had been bringing in from consumers. And what Clutter's focus had been on is building a brand and aggregating consumer demand, principally in, as Bill mentioned, tech enabled manner. On a net basis, when all is said and done, we'll pay a little over some $20 million to buy the business will also contribute various of our assets. So you'll see that through our other expense and income line on the P&L. And from a standpoint, for your modeling purposes, revenue on a quarterly basis, this being the incremental revenue that Iron Mountain will recognize now because, of course, we were recognizing revenue from what we were doing for services to Clutter previously. We'll recognize maybe a bit over $10 million. It'll be an excess of $10 million on a quarterly basis, likely to be growing as we move into the New Year. And from an EBITDA standpoint and you would have seen this from our prior filings because, of course, we were absorbing our minority interest in Clutter through our P&L. As I said, they've been building their brand for some time. So it is -- Clutter has been absorbing a modest EBITDA loss on a quarterly basis, thinks something in the vicinity of a couple of $1 million a quarter over time and perhaps by, let's say, 2024, we expect to be able to drive that to breakeven and ultimately to generating positive EBITDA out of the Clutter Enterprise itself as we drive operating synergies by combining the two businesses together. I'll just note, of course, Iron Mountain had been generating positive EBITDA on the relationship previously. So the incremental negative drag that I just referenced is purely off of the brand building elements of the clutter enterprise itself. The last thing I'll note is -- Alex is, of course, we reiterated our guidance and feel very good about it, despite absorbing that little drag there from Clutter that we will absorb here in the second half. So appreciate the questions. Yeah. Shlomo, this is Barry. Maybe I'll just pick up there on [Technical Difficulty] you would have seen a similar increase in the first quarter when we made the actions as it relates to improved wages that Bill was just referring to. And then, I would point out on a sequential basis, labor was up about 2%, while service revenue was up 5% on a sequential basis, reflecting the [Technical Difficulty] down year-on-year. As your question alluded to, that has all to do with our component pricing, IT renew, because when you think about it, we are still processing a considerable amount of volume, yet we are recognizing a much lower price. And so, if you excluded the impact of component pricing, actually service gross margins were up quite nicely, which speaks to the ongoing trend in the rest of the core and frankly to the productivity that the team is driving in asset lifecycle management. So when you think about what could happen with our gross margins as pricing recovers, we've got a lot of operating leverage in that business. So I feel good about the forward look if the industry projections are anywhere close to accurate for where pricing will be next year, I think we're going to see a really nice lift there. So thanks, Shlomo. Hey, Jon. It's Barry. Thanks for the question. We for natural and perhaps obvious reasons we don't tend to comment on individual clients. But as you noted, there are some things out there in the public domain as well as in their filings that would confirm that they are client of ours in Arizona. That's obviously a very long-standing relationship that goes back to prior to our ownership of one of the data centers that we purchased there. I mentioned that intently because, of course, it's a long standing contract with pricing that goes back quite a ways and, frankly, is sort of a -- almost a build to suit type of situation for them where it would not be [Technical Difficulty] let me put it this way. In Arizona, we are essentially a 100% [Technical Difficulty] we are 100% lease now in Scottsdale on what we're under construction for in our second facility, phase 5 and 6, were 100% -- 5 and 8, we're 100% leased as well in terms of prelease. So it's not a particularly large revenue client, Jon. And beyond that, I wouldn't want to comment, but you would see in the filings the relative amount of, let's say, credit that we have between the two entities. And I feel very confident that in light of where we see pricing, and I'll just -- maybe I should just add this. That in general, on hyperscale pricing today, we're seeing on a triple net basis pricing up about 40%. And so, we feel very good about where data center is trending on a macro basis and where we are. And one last point, just build on thing Bill was mentioning. And when you look at our, I think there's a unique part of our data center story is, we're operating about 220 megawatts. We're nearly fully leased on that. And we're under construction on about another 200 megawatts. And the thing to think about that is, we're not building to [Technical Difficulty] anything, and we're 91% prelease on everything that we have [Technical Difficulty] doing a phenomenal job, and we're working hard to figure out which other facilities to start construction on as the pipeline continues to build quite appreciably. So we feel really good about where our data center business is trending, Jon. Thank you. Okay. Thanks Kevin. Appreciate that. You're right that our revenue management program is doing very, very well. And obviously, our storage rental revenue growth has been growing. And as I mentioned, some of our growth rates are actually accelerating that being one of those. And that's thanks to both our Global RIM teams, as well as our data center teams, because commencements has been very strong. You referenced that CapEx is up, as I mentioned, that's going to build out our data center portfolio that's already preleased. So we are endeavoring to meet all customer demand, which continues to ramp. In terms of -- you are right, Clutter adds a relatively small amount of revenue. We probably are a touch more conservative with ALM in the back half, Kevin, than where we were at the beginning of the year because, of course, at the beginning of the year component pricing was still -- was still coming down. And now it's stabilized we've recognized that those stable levels of pricing. As I said, that may prove to be conservative as we move through the year, but we are only halfway through. So we tend to try to not get ahead of ourselves, Kevin. In terms of cash generation and the compilation of the incremental CapEx. Here's what I'd underscore. We have reiterated our leverage expectations that we will be at 5.1 times at year end, which is consistent with where we are today, and at a multiyear level low. So we feel really good about the cash generation of the business. We're generating incrementally higher returns in data center on that CapEx investment. Returns on hyperscale have moved from kind of the seven, eight level to more like eight, nine, and retail cash on levered returns are also quite firm. And so, we're blending into that low double digit vicinity on a combined basis. We feel really good about where things are trending, Kevin, so appreciate your questions. And Eric, it's, Barry. As it relates to diversifying away from China, as we've talked about before, that certainly is a focus of the team. We have added to our organization in ALM and specifically around diversifying the downstream channels, we are making steady progress, but it is slow because, of course, as we've said before, China is the main market for us in that regard. But we are looking at and branching into throughout Southeast Asia there are opportunities we think over the intermediate term in India. We certainly have been selling more components into the U.S. and Europe as well, and that's a key focus, as well as the Mid-East. So there is -- there are opportunities there, and we are building that -- those channels The other thing I'll just build on and link the two questions is, when you think about hyperscale decommissioning, we generally are decommissioning data centers that were put into service, let's say, five years prior. And so -- on average. And the thing about AI in this very significant ramp in terms of hyperscale data center development right now is, it will provide even another leg to our hyperscale decommissioning growth five years on. Historically I've had some questions about like, well, how does the decommissioning business continue to ramp over time? And of course, the things that we'll be decommissioning this year are components that were put in place about five years ago. And next year, we'll be decommissioning things that were put in place four years ago. And as those data center platforms have grown, it provides that much larger of a platform for us to decommission in the future. And I think it shouldn't be lost on us that of this AI growth is going to drive another substantial leg up in the opportunity for hyperscale decommissioning in the future. And as the leader in that space, we feel quite good about the future. Okay. Hi, Brendan. It's a -- thanks for the question. When you look at that metric, I'll just remind you that it is on a trailing four quarter basis. So what you've got going on there is -- what you've got going on there is an element of COVID still because we were naturally seeing client fell little bit less activity of switching and/or disruption, what have you, during the COVID period and even in the period after we all felt like COVID was over, if you will. And so, that's a little bit of catching up. But if you look back on that metric over, let's say, the last 15 years and that data is available in our historic disclosure, you'd find that we're in a very tight band and not outside our normal levels from a pre COVID standpoint. I appreciate the question. I will tell you that we feel we feel -- we are -- our customer relationships are very good. We can -- as you linked it to revenue management, I would say our focus on revenue management is continuing to educate our customers on the very significant value we drive for them day in and day out. And the fact that our volume continues to trend positively, I think, should give you a very good indicator there of how we're doing with our customers."

            "name": "William Meaney",
            "content": "Thank you, Gillian, and thank you all for taking time to join us today for our discussion of our record second quarter results. Our team has once again exceeded expectations with performance reflective of our strong legacy of customer service, our laser focus on execution, and our dedication to finding innovative solutions to serve our customers as they evolve their businesses. I'm excited to share that in the second quarter we achieved our highest ever quarterly revenue of $1.36 billion and record EBITDA of $476 million. This performance is ahead of the expectations we provided last quarter. The enhanced operation model we created through Project Matterhorn has continued to prove successful as our commercial team is empowered to sell the entire Mountain range of products and solutions across our portfolio. We are pleased with the high quality and wide range of our offerings today which positions us to be a nimble partner to serve our customers' needs. To highlight some of our results in the second quarter, we delivered organic storage rental revenue growth of 11% and drove high-teens organic growth in both our data center and digital services businesses. We are also pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has increased our quarterly dividend per share to $0.65 or $2.60 per share annualized, commencing with our third quarter dividend to be paid in October. As we have said before, when our AFFO payout ratio reached the mid to low 60s as a percentage, we would increase the dividend. Our payout ratio at the end of the second quarter was just under 64%. I would like to begin our broader discussion of some of the customer wins, which led to our record second quarter results. Let me start with records management, where our success was derived from both new and existing customers. One significant win we would like to highlight this quarter was with a large not-for-profit hospital system, faced with rising lease costs, despite a shrinking storage footprint, the customer turned to us for an alternative to storing in their own space. Our Smart Sort solution will address their needs over the next three years. It will deliver cost efficiency and optimize storage space for the customer before they transfer their records to an Iron Mountain facility for secure future management. This win exemplifies our commitment to solving our customers' problems and providing them with tailored solutions. The COVID-19 pandemic has led organizations around the world to reassess their current real estate portfolios in order to accommodate remote and hybrid work. Our customers are optimizing their real estate to accommodate changing working practices, we are able to offer solutions that demonstrate the breadth of our portfolio and the value of partnering with Iron Mountain across our products and services. One example is a customer who chose our Clean Start solution to remove and relocate records, office equipment, and IT assets from more than 60 offices across North America that are being closed or decommissioned over the next two years. Thanks to our Asset Lifecycle Management solutions, we are also helping this customer to decommission IT assets from these offices securely and sustainably. We continue to see growing momentum for our digital business with customers turning to us for solutions in areas such as public sector, industry focused solutions, and end-to-end business process management. For example, we are proud to be supporting the digitization of real estate mortgage records held by the Helinick Land Registry in Greece under a two year contract worth $35 million. We demonstrated our understanding of the public sector in Greece and of the European Commission's recovery and resilience facility, which is funding this project through the Greek government to support European economies as they transform the way they support their citizens. This is a breakthrough deal that will provide further opportunities to support similar digitization projects elsewhere in Europe. Another example of how our digital business is enabling us to develop and deliver transformational solutions for our largest customers is with one of the biggest financial service companies in the United States. This customer is outsourcing its noncore services and has selected Iron Mountain to manage all of its records. Our end-to-end solution ensures a secure chain of custody regardless of media format for this customer, leveraging our image on demand service and InSight platform to integrate seamlessly with their customer success management system. This game changing deal demonstrates the power of partnering with Iron Mountain to accelerate our customer's digital transformation. Staying with our Digital Solutions business, our 25 year relationship with a Fortune 500 gas and electric utility company continues to be a powerful example of how our customers turn to Iron Mountain because of the range of solutions we can provide. To ensure our customer is compliant with all legal and regulatory requirements we are digitizing around 20 million images from 8,000 boxes stored with Iron Mountain over the next three years. Having provided records management and data management services since 1998, our customer was confident in our Digital Solutions secure chain of custody, information governance expertise, and ability to scale up quickly to deliver this project. To conclude with records management, on 29th June we acquired the controlling interest in Clutter, a tech enabled on demand consumer storage company. We were previously a minority investor in Clutter and provided storage and operational services through a commercial partnership. This acquisition makes us the industry leader in valet self-storage services in North America. Turning to asset lifecycle management, we continue to see muted pricing for the largest part of this business, which relies on reselling used memory, hard drives and CPUs we receive from hyperscalers. That being said, pricing is stabilized, and we do expect to see an improvement as we head into next year. Moreover, you will recall that our ALM business has three components: hyperscale decommissioning, which is highly dependent on component pricing; enterprise ITAD or IT asset disposition; and original equipment manufacturers or OEMs. In these later categories, we are seeing marked growth and traction. For example, in the enterprise segment, our focus on cross selling the Mountain range of products has driven bookings up a 175% versus second quarter last year. For the OEM segment, you will recall that we signed our first MSA or Master Services Agreement in this area last quarter and we have added another MSA with a second OEM this quarter. Turning to specific wins in the ALM area, a good example of our cross selling appeal comes from the health care industry. A customer which has benefited from Iron Mountain's records management solutions for many years has asked us to manage the recovery, decommissioning, disposal and/or recycling of IT assets at over 2,000 locations in the United States. The strength of our relationship and our customers inherent trust in Iron Mountain has resulted in an ALM contract and renewal of our existing services for the next five years. Also in ALM, our team secured a contract with a leading software and technology company to help them decommission racks of servers and nonessential IT equipment from their data center. Opportunities like this where we are able to extend the value we provide to customs has been significantly enhanced, thanks to the industry knowledge and expertise we have gained through our acquisition and integration of IT renew. We remain very excited about ALM, whilst component pricing remains a drag for part of the business, the growth we are achieving in the services side of the business shows how Iron Mountain's brand strength around security, and reliability are a differentiator in this fast growing area. Moving to our data center business, through the first half of the year we leased 55 megawatts, which includes 2.7 megawatts this quarter. As we said in May the first quarter was particularly strong as we signed some deals earlier than expected. Due to our strong pipeline we now feel confident we will exceed our original projection of 80 megawatts in 2023. This confidence is thanks to our teams delivering record new sales in the first half as well as the size of our late-stage pipeline from some of our largest customers as they add new capacity with the growth of AI. For example, we are well positioned with nearly 120 megawatts of unleased capacity on our Nova campus with our fully secured. In this very important market, we are pleased to note that pricing is moving up appreciably. Staying with our business, I would like to highlight a win that demonstrates the exciting opportunities to expand our solutions and services for customers with a footprint in India and the value of our joint venture with Web Werks in the country. As we've discussed before, India is a key focus for our company's growth and our progress there is a major win for our business. In the second quarter, we closed a deal with a multinational media processing company to provide almost 1 megawatt of storage capacity at our Mumbai data center with the potential to add a further 5 megawatts at this facility and extra capacity at other locations in India. Our data centers team's experience of handling high-density racks, Iron Mountain's wider understanding of the media industry and our expansion plans in Mumbai helped us to convince our customer that we are their best long-term partner as their capacity needs grow. Finally, I would like to mention an example of the success we are enjoying in our Crozier Fine Arts business as we build out one of the few globally integrated logistics, storage, and top-quality services businesses in the art world. Recently, we partnered with a major art gallery in the United Kingdom to support an exhibition by well-known artists. This involves detailed planning and preparations to pack and transports 61 fragile sculptures from the US, Mexico, and Continental Europe. We are proud of the unique expertise that our Crozier teams provide for our customers and to be associated with important exhibitions like this one. To conclude, we are proud of the record results we delivered this quarter as this is evidence that our strategy is working. As we continue to leverage the potential of our entire Mountain range, expand our footprint of storage and services, and deliver tailored innovative solutions for each of our customers, I could not be more grateful for the hard work of our mountaineers. Our Matterhorn program is showing the way and delivering consistently strong sales growth, whilst fueling AFFO growth and our dividend. We are more energized than ever to continue reaching new peaks. And I'm excited for the bright future ahead. With that, I will turn the call over to Barry. Yes. And just one thing I would add for Nate on the storage trend sort of volume, you probably picked up from some of the wins we highlighted is that, as companies are shifting their use of space as the workforce is more remote or hybrid. That's yielding both increased volume for our storage facilities as they clean out or decide that they want to have it depoed rather than in an office that people don't visit as much or at all anymore. As well as, as Barry pointed out, [indiscernible] behind this 175% year-over-year increase in ITAD bookings, both because as companies are kind of cleaning out, it's a tailwind both on the storage in the ITAD business. Okay. Let me start with the labor costs and the trends in terms of the volume. So I think, first, starting off on the volume trends is, as I was saying to Nate -- to Nate's question is that, overall, the volume, as you can see, is flat, slightly up. So it's trending in the right direction. And I wouldn't say this is a -- it's going to be a massive change. But what we see, if you think about 730 million cubic feet, so it's a very large base that we're operating on, is the trends that we see both in some of the new storage areas, but as well as what we see in people going into a hybrid or remote working aspect. It really is getting a lot more traction for our Smart Sort and Clean Start type solutions, which uncover more storage, also the services that we can provide being depoed. In other words, we can serve their employees anywhere they are. They don't have to come to the office to actually get information back, whether we give it back to them physically or image on demand. And then it's also uncovering, as we say, is driving a lot of the increased bookings that we see in the enterprise ALM side of the business and fueling that 175% growth that we see. So overall, we feel really good about where the trends are, but you can imagine, on 730 million cubic feet around the world, is that -- even what I call quite macro trends that I described are --don't change the overall trajectory like massively, but it is definitely a tailwind for that business. And on labor costs, before I hand it back to Barry is, you're right, labor costs is up. Some of it is as we go into new areas in terms -- as we ramp, or some of the projects that we ramp on, then obviously we're bringing labor in ahead of time. And the other part is making sure that our mountaineers around the world are well looked after, because we really do see the -- it's the core to us. We're a business services company. And the first impression that our customers have is our mountaineers, and we want to make sure that they and their families are well looked after. And the inflation environment globally has been challenging for a number of our colleagues. Okay. Thanks, Jon. I'll start with the -- what we see on the data center horizon and the I'll turn it over to Barry. I think first of all, we're really pleased with how our data center business continues to grow. And also, as you know, I know you cover the industry extremely closely is that, pricing is up markedly, like as we look in markets like Northern Virginia on a triple net basis as we see around the hyperscale segment, pricing up some 40% so the returns continue to grow and keep pace. I think in terms of -- looking at the size of our pipeline, Barry mentioned [Technical Difficulty] million on top of the $1 billion that we already had for investment capital in 2023. Based on the strength of that pipeline and the success that we're having, pretty much across the globe is that -- I mean, you're right that we're always kind of conscious of in terms of how we fund our projects. That being said, we're actually fortunate that we have the records management business and our other services business, which is like a financial beast. I mean, it just generates a tremendous amount of cash that not only fuels the dividend, but it also fuels a lot of the development capital into our data centers. So I wouldn't say that we're in a situation where kind of a company that is solely in the date center space that has only to itself to look for in terms of how it funds itself going forward to drive a lot of the development. We actually have a growing, but some people will consider a mature business in terms of the amount of capital we have to put into that because it's a very scaled high operating leverage business and we are able to use funds and profitability from that to fund a big part of our development. That being said, as you know, that we've done -- we have taken third-party capital a couple of times already, and we typically do that on stabilized or near stabilized assets and tap into funds that where people are looking for relatively low yielding, but long maturity or duration type assets. And we'll continue to do that as some of our portfolio stabilizes. I can imagine that we would recycle capital when the opportunity presents itself. But overall, if you look at the plan that we laid out last September in terms of our Investor Day, we're probably a little bit ahead of that in data center just because of the growth that we've been seeing in the first half of this year and what we see in the pipeline. But we feel pretty good about that we have a fully funded plan in terms of the way we're doing it now. But if there's opportunities, as I say, to take third-party capital, especially around stabilized assets, generally that boost our returns long term and we will do that. Thanks, Eric. So, yes, on the trends that we're seeing, I mean, and you've been following this industry for [EON's] (ph). I think you see the same thing I did -- we have, right? I mean, maybe a year ago we saw -- still very high growth in high scale, but they're probably a little bit more conservative. And now there's another wave of really accelerated growth because they're trying to keep pace with the amount of compute power is required to really run a lot of these large language models associated with the AI programs. And so, we have seen a -- it's not just type, but we actually see virtually all of our largest hyperscale customers coming to us looking for more capacity. And that's why we were speaking with such confidence that we'll exceed our original full year guidance in terms of the amount of leasing activity we expect. It's just -- it is very, very strong. Now in terms of the type of deployment, you're also right that the density that they're looking for is much higher. And I think I'm right to say probably year, year and a half ago we didn't have any customers coming to us and asking us to water cool in racks to actually support some of these higher densities. And now we are seeing a number of deployments that are requiring that kind of design. Luckily, I mean, we built our designs to be flexible. And of course, for these large deployments, we're actually doing the design to meet the customer, very specific customer requirements. So we're able to accommodate the higher density quite easily. But you're right. I mean, with the density that some folks are looking at and the amount of power they want to put in a rack, we are cooling using different methods and specifically some water cooling in rack to support the requirements."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Gillian Tiltman, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nGillian Tiltman: Thank you, Sarah. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On today's call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Barry Hytinen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  After prepared remarks, we'll open up the lines for Q&A. Today's earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.\nWilliam Meaney: Thank you, Gillian, and thank you all for taking the time to join us today. Our team delivered another quarter of record results for the first quarter of 2023, exceeding our expectations. This performance reflects the resonance of our expanded product portfolio, our unmatched customer relationships and the strength of our dedicated team.  On a reported basis, in the first quarter, we achieved our highest ever quarterly revenue of $1.31 billion, yielding 7.5% total organic revenue growth and EBITDA of $461 million. We continue to be encouraged by the increased demand for our services across key markets fueling these results as well as the success of Project Matterhorn, enabling our commercial teams to offer our customers access to the widest range of solutions in our company's history. We delivered organic storage rental revenue growth of 11% in the first quarter, and we drove high-teens organic growth in both our data center and digital services businesses.  As we introduced last year with Project Matterhorn, our steady build-out of new products and services as well as growth in these underlying markets continues to accelerate us on our growth trajectory path. I would like to take this opportunity to highlight how we have been serving our customers with our solutions-based approach and our offerings across the Mountain range. Beginning with records management, we won significant new business in the United Kingdom with a major global industrial and aerospace company signing a contract valued at GBP 40 million. Following more than a year of conversations, the team entered into a bespoke 10-year agreement, providing the customer with several hundred thousand cubic feet of secure physical data storage, document digitization and management across multiple secure locations, radio frequency identification tagging for additional security and a dedicated on-site team of experts working to Iron Mountain's industry-leading standards.  I am pleased we could offer such a comprehensive solution that allows the customer to both digitize their data and protect their business. We are now discussing additional opportunities with the same customer in other European countries, North America and Asia. In total, the potential contract value over 10 years is approximated to be GBP 90 million.  Another win that highlights our ability to sell the entire Mountain range involves a state historical society, which turned to both Iron Mountain and our Fine Art Storage Business Crozier for help in preserving the history of its cultural heritage center, which is home to its underground archives in museum. With budget as a key consideration for this customer, our unique solution was focused on reducing costs, whilst leveraging our expertise and innovation to challenge the customer to think differently.  Our combined art, library, archives and logistics expertise enabled our team to deliver a solution that met the state's needs. Also in the quarter, a financial services company based in Australia, a long-standing customer of Iron Mountain turned to us for help with their compliance issues after being impressed by the information we presented at a Policy Center webinar back in 2021.  Our suite of digital enablement solutions and software, including the InSight platform will provide the customer with increased visibility into its archives, digital copy as selected records, auto generation of metadata and auto reduction of personal identifiable information. Success stories such as this highlight the value we provide customers and not only moving data from physical to digital storage, but also improving the methods and capability to utilize the data.  Another digital win was with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. The U.S. Congress has requested that the VA advanced the production of complete and accurate veteran records in a timely fashion, driving the need for digitization of historical veteran documents, which are often dispersed across multiple storage locations. The customer required an experienced digital partner to increase their scanning capacity and also provide facility oversight, chain of custody logistics and secure storage. The unique aspects provided by our high security Boyers, Pennsylvania facility, combined with the skill of our staff were key contributing factors to winning the deal. This is just the beginning of our work to aid in the delivery of medical records to enhance patient care of veterans.  Also in Digital Solutions, we had a key win with an existing customer His Majesty's Courts and tribunal service on a digital mailroom solution to automate the indexing and classification elements of the mail room function. The service, which will reduce the cost and time of processing court applications will be delivered from our location where we have a well-established digitization and BPO facility.  Turning to asset lifecycle management, or ALM, we divide this business into 3 verticals. The first of these is the hyperscale decommissioning business that we acquired from ITRenew. Our volumes grew in excess of 30% in this vertical year-over-year, reflecting our market-leading platform, the strength of our existing customer relationships and our ability to win more new logos. Revenue is down, however, reflecting the record-low pricing the market has seen since the end of 2022 on both new and used components.  In our enterprise ITAD vertical, we've been gratified to see more synergies with our existing customers. Since we have relationships with over 225,000 customers across our wider business, the opportunity to cross-sell our enterprise ITAD services has never been greater.  The last of these verticals is the technology manufacturers. Here, we are winning business, both in terms of servers as well as end-user devices. We have invested in our sales force and obtained specific expertise in the OEM space setting us up for success. This indirect relationship to decommission end-user product is a huge market opportunity. Examples of recent wins in the ALM business include a contract with an existing global asset management company to perform on-site hard disk and solid state disk ratio and destruction whilst maximizing value from data center and corporate end-user assets.  Continuing with ALM, a large global risk management company sought services to decommission to complete in 2 partial data centers. A combination of our strong existing relationship and performance, including guidance from a dedicated program manager, our remarketing solutions and capabilities and the ease of the use of our ALM portal contributed to the win.  Finally, let's turn to our Data Center business. We are pleased to have finished the first quarter of 2023 with 52 megawatts of new leases signed with a single hyperscale customer signing 2 deals for a total of 44 megawatts. You will recall that our guidance for the year is 80-plus megawatts. So to have least over half of our target in the first quarter alone is a triumph of our team.  In terms of the co-location wins this past quarter, one win I would like to highlight is with an existing U.S. federal home loan customer who sought to expand into a new data center market for disaster recovery options and selected our VA2 data center in Manassas, Virginia. The customer was impressed with the tour of our Virginia campus and the custom solution we developed to meet their needs. With their positive past experience with our data center services, we've bundled this expanded solution with a renewal at another of our data center sites.  Also in the quarter, our team announced the win with a fleet management company, which for years has explored moving their internal on-site data center infrastructure to co-location. Our ability to provide a custom solution in our VA2 data center, including direct internet access, smart hands and cross connects resulted in a powerful solution for them and the continuation of an important relationship that has the potential to expand to a disaster recovery solution at our New Jersey data center.  Also noteworthy is a substantial win with an existing major semiconductor chip manufacturer who's taking advantage of all the Mountain range has to offer. The customer was seeking a data center partner to host their internal development cloud environment, and our data center and commercial sales teams work closely to deliver a solution at our Arizona site, leveraging the customer's existing relationship.  All 3 of these wins that I have noted are with long-standing customers, demonstrating our ability to source premium co-location deals with customers with whom we have had trusted relationships for decades. To conclude, we are more enthusiastic than ever about the growth in our business and our ability to offer our customers expanded and innovative solutions to meet their ever-evolving needs. Project Matterhorn is bearing fruit, and we continue to make great strides as our team climbs towards the highest peaks of our journey.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry.\nBarry Hytinen: Thanks, Bill, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our results. In the first quarter, our team continued to deliver strong performance, exceeding the expectations we provided on our last call. We achieved an all-time record quarterly revenue of $1.31 billion, representing 5% growth on a reported basis. Organically, revenue grew 7.5%. Revenue was ahead of the expectations we shared on our last call as Global RIM and our data center businesses both outperformed. A key highlight in the quarter is our organic storage revenue growth of 11%. This marks an acceleration both sequentially and year-on-year. This reflects strong contributions from revenue management, data center commencements and positive volume trends. Total service revenue increased 2% to $504 million or 4% on a constant currency basis. Consistent with the commentary we shared on our last call, the year-on-year impact from the start of the more intense lockdowns in China impacted our ITRenew business.  Excluding ITRenew, service revenue was up 11% on an organic constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was $461 million, a new first quarter record. This represents growth of 7% year-on-year and 9% on a constant currency basis driven by revenue management and strong contributions from data center. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.1%, an improvement of 60 basis points year-on-year with revenue management and mix being the key drivers.  AFFO was $284 million or $0.97 on a per share basis, up $20 million and $0.06, respectively from the first quarter of last year. This was well ahead of the expectations we shared on our last call, partially the result of the timing of some maintenance CapEx items between the first and second quarters.  Now turning to segment performance. In the first quarter, our Global RIM business delivered revenue of $1.13 billion, an increase of $78 million from last year. On an organic basis, revenue increased 11%. Organic storage rental revenue growth of 9.4% reflects our focus on revenue management and solid volume trends. We reported organic service revenue growth of 13.6%, with that performance driven by digital solutions and core offerings.  Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $478 million, an increase of $29 million year-on-year. Turning to our global data center business. We achieved revenue of $112 million, an increase of $15 million year-on-year. From a total revenue perspective, we delivered 17% growth on an organic basis. Organic storage revenue growth was particularly strong at 24%, driven by commencements and improved pricing. As we projected, data center services were down year-on-year given the fit-out work we were performing in the first half of last year. Data center adjusted EBITDA was $51 million, representing 21% growth.  Turning to new and expansion leasing. We had a very strong quarter with the team signing 52 megawatts. We expanded our relationship with a long-standing customer with a 40-megawatt contract. Later in the quarter, we extended this relationship further with another 4 megawatts. Both of these have an initial term of 7 years with multiple renewal options. We signed new deals across our portfolio with key wins in Scottsdale, Phoenix, Frankfurt and London. In total, we signed 22 new logos within our data center business with strong cross-selling activity.  Turning to asset lifecycle management. In the first quarter, ALM volume was ahead of our expectations, while component pricing was down significantly year-on-year. Importantly, we are now seeing pricing for components stabilizing. Given the current environment that Bill described, we are planning for ALM revenue to be consistent in the second quarter with the first quarter. And with the pipeline activity we are seeing, we are well positioned for improving trends in the back half of the year, driven by volume and new bookings.  In particular, our OEM business is developing well with the team growing our pipeline and delivering key new wins. For example, we recently signed a deal with one of the largest technology end-user device manufacturers to partner with them in the decommissioning needs of their customers.  Turning to capital. In the first quarter, we invested $302 million, of which $274 million was growth and $28 million was recurring. Turning to the balance sheet. With strong EBITDA performance, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.1x, reflecting a significant improvement from last year, this marks our lowest leverage level since 2017. We expect to operate within our target leverage range, which is 4.5 to 5.5x.  Our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early July. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, our payout ratio is now 64%, settling into our long-term target range of low to mid-60s percent. Now turning to our outlook.  With strong performance in the quarter, we are well on track for the year, and we are pleased to reiterate our full year guidance. For the second quarter, we expect revenue of approximately $1.35 billion, adjusted EBITDA of approximately $475 million, AFFO of approximately $270 million and AFFO per share of approximately $0.92. In summary, our team is executing well on our Matterhorn growth initiatives. We are investing in our business. We remain focused on driving increased levels of cross-selling and exceeding the expectations of our customers.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank our entire team for their continued dedication and commitment to Iron Mountain and our customers.  With that, operator, would you please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.\nGeorge Tong: Organic revenue growth for the services businesses decelerated to 2% in the quarter. Can you elaborate on the factors behind the deceleration in services organic revenue growth? And discuss initiatives or factors that could drive a re-acceleration in growth in the coming quarters?\nWilliam Meaney: George, thanks for the question. So yes, I think overall, if you think about it in the traditional areas, our service revenue growth was quite strong. If you look at just in the RIM business is our Global Organic RIM services grew at 14%, again on an organic and constant currency basis. So very, very strong growth. If you look it on the ALM side, which is where you see the downdraft is, as I've said in my comments, is volume in this quarter was up some 30% year-over-year. So we're actually seeing the synergies -- the commercial synergies that we have as a company and as Barry mentioned, we just signed a new OEM customer as well.  So we see really good traction on the volume side. But on the pricing side, if you probably have seen in the electronics industry, some of the components are down 70%. So whilst we still have positive gross margins on that business, is the revenue is heavily impacted by what we've been seeing across the semiconductor industry in terms of record-low pricing.  So I think that it's really a two world. So as I say, from a -- even ALM business on a volume basis has shown traction, but it is a downdraft in terms of the overall service revenue. But the traditional areas, I would say, in terms of RIM, also, if we look at our digital services, we're also up year-over-year in the high teens, really good progression.\nBarry Hytinen: Yes, George, it's Barry. Thanks again for the question. The only thing I would -- only a couple of things I would add is I think the team, to Bill's point on our Global RIM is doing phenomenally well. And I think that's the way I would point you to look at the services because, of course, the ALM business is masking our total growth there in terms of what's happening with respect to the core. And at that 14% growth rate that Bill spoke about, that is up against some really big comps. So it's -- I mean, it's a very strong performance, and it is driven by the point that he made, the digital solutions as well as other core offerings, which are all growing for us.  The other thing I'd kind of call out is it's a small factor, but as you know, we were doing fit-out services in data center in the first half of last year. We completed that in the second quarter. And so that makes the year-on-year comp hard just as we explained it would be. So that is another factor that's weighing on that services total growth rate that you were pointing to. I think as you move through and get into the -- see us getting into the back half, you'll see that growth rate accelerating meaningfully as we get beyond the challenges with respect to ALM and the pipeline that Bill was speaking about really comes to fruition and then we also get beyond that data center services comp in the first two quarters. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.\nKevin McVeigh: Congratulations on the momentum. Barry, it looks like typically, and I'm just going off the last 2 years, so maybe it's not fair, you can help me with this. But the sequential EBITDA lift in the last 2 years have been $24 million to $25 million, it looks like the Q2 is going to be about $14 million. So when we think about puts and takes in the back half of the year, is that more project benefit from Matterhorn that allows you to reaffirm the EBITDA guidance? Is it better pricing? Maybe just help us understand the seasonality a little bit if I'm thinking about that right.\nBarry Hytinen: Yes. Thanks, Kevin. Appreciate the question. We feel very good about where we're trending. In fact, the first quarter came in right in line, if not a little bit better than what we were expecting in our guidance for the second quarter is similarly and that is despite the fact that we've adjusted our expectations for ALM down some in the second quarter. And the reason we're able to achieve the numbers that we're putting up in the second -- that we're projecting for the second quarter and our confidence in the back half is because of a couple of things you just pointed out.  We are seeing even better revenue management projections in the business. We have, as you've seen in our Global RIM business, we have very strong storage rental growth on an organic basis, almost 9.5%, which marked an acceleration sequentially and year-on-year. Our total organic storage rental growth was over 11%, which was also very strong.  And I will tell you that in light of the fact that we are going to see more revenue management activities we've recently passed some here even in the second quarter, and we'll be passing more as we move through the year, together with the fact that data center pricing continues to improve, and that's an industry phenomenon. You will see, together with that, our commencements are very strong in the back half. So data center will be accelerating as we get into the back half. And as you know, there's very strong visibility on that business. So it's a high confidence point that I'm making there.  So we feel very good about where we are. In terms of -- you mentioned the specifics around second versus the -- quarter versus second half. I'll just note that in light of the timing of the U.S. dollar strength, we still have an FX headwind in the second quarter. In the first quarter, that was almost $30 million of topline. But as we said on the last call, and I'll reiterate, that becomes much more muted, in fact, may even be a slight tailwind in the back half.  We also get through a few items that are in the first half from an EBITDA standpoint. As you know, we did some sale leasebacks last year and we comp over those as we move into the back half and with our productivity initiatives and additional commercial investments we've made, we get to a more favorable comp in the back half from those as well.  So I'll tell you, Kevin, we feel very well positioned about accelerating business even with more muted expectations around ALM.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jon Atkin with RBC Capital Markets.\nJonathan Atkin: Towards the beginning, you pointed out a number of wins with government agencies and large enterprises and so forth. And I was curious to maybe get a little bit more color on what's kind of the tone of discussion around sales cycle compared to what you're accustomed to? And then the competitive set that you faced with those deals to the extent that you faced with these bake-offs or just kind of the decision to go with you is really more of a bilateral discussion, but maybe a little bit about the competitive dynamics and sales cycle would be helpful for both government and enterprise?\nWilliam Meaney: Okay. Well, thanks, Jon, for the question. So the -- and I was actually involved in a couple of these, so I could probably give you more color on them. The sales cycles, for instance, the aerospace company that we talked about was like over a year, but this is a company that we've been doing bits of work for decades, right? So it's a natural conversation that they start talking about, well, they want to actually do something different. And this speaks of case, they actually had an in-house vendor for part of it but that company wasn't able to do the full range of services. As I said, they were looking for someone to really takeover of full outsourcing and they're very sensitive, right? Because if one of these things goes missing, aircraft around the world get grounded. So they were very, very sensitive about the security and the reliability of their vendor.  And then the other side of it, obviously, they've known us for decades in different areas that are very sensitive to them. And we were able to bring a full range of services that we're able to do, not just the storage, not just the digitization, but also to give them the tools that they could visualize what was both stored physically and what was digitized and they could do that in a consolidated basis. In other words, they could do that and see that anywhere in the world.  So that was a huge win for them. Now you can say the sales cycle was like over a year. I think I've been visiting with the sales team at customer for over a year but it's been part of an ongoing conversation, and that's the power of having the 225,000 customers that we've had decades and decades of relationship.  The government one, which I mentioned, which -- 2 of them, one was in the U.K. and one was in the -- with the United States government. For the folks that have been following the company for quite some time, we've been talking about the government sector as being our huge potential for Iron Mountain. And it was slow-going at the beginning because government contracts, as I'm sure you're aware, have very long lead times. But both of those have been customers that we've actually been working for the last 2 or 3 years with -- so again, we were -- there was a big investment, I would say, starting 5, 6 years ago with both the VA and with the British government in certain segments. But that's again now starting to become more of a normal course.  So one level is the conversation started 5 years ago, but now it's just a regular course of business that some of these things are as short as 3 or 4 months' lead time where they come up with a statement of work and because we already have a track record, and we're able to do that.\nOperator: Next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Barry, you alluded a few times on the call to good revenue management and improving revenue management. Can you talk a little bit about what the pricing lift in the quarter was and what investors should expect for 2023? And you guys had very good revenue management last year. Is the revenue management straight out being able to raise prices now? Or is there some kind of favorable mix going on? Maybe you could just give a little more color there.\nBarry Hytinen: Okay. So thanks for that question. I think our team is doing a phenomenal job with revenue management. It's been a real standout. When you look at Global RIM in terms of its storage rental organic growth that was almost 9.5%. And as you know, we saw good solid volume trends. It was up about $2.5 million on a cube on a trailing 12-month basis.  So as you can gather from that, the vast majority of the growth was driven by revenue management. And importantly, we feel very well positioned in terms of the whole year. And I'll tell you that in terms of the total storage rental growth rate that we put up 11%, which is, of course, benefited by data center commencements with what we see on data center commencements through the remainder of the year.  Together with the revenue management activities we've already put in place and additional that we have going into market over the next few months, I feel very confident that we are going to continue to see total company organic storage rental growth of this order, I think, 9%, 10%, 11%.  And that the environment for revenue management continues to be strong. We will have relatively more revenue management this year, Shlomo, than we did last year. And that is a factor of both what we're wrapping from last year as well as the activities we've had in this year.  Importantly, we continue to see excellent customer retention, and I think that just demonstrates that we are bringing forward very significant value for our clients in these areas. In terms of mix, I would say we continue, as we talked about before, to expand the revenue management program beyond just storage. So you are seeing improving revenue management trends in our services, and that's generally across all line service in our core offerings and so we feel like it's on the right trajectory, Shlomo.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nate Crossett with BNP Paribas.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is . Maybe you can just remind us on the funding plan for development this year? What does the pricing look like for any debt needed? Would you do asset or company level financing? And then I also wanted your updated thoughts on the dividend here with the payout, the lowest it's been in a while.\nWilliam Meaney: I appreciate the question. Let me take your last question on the dividend, and then I'll let Barry comment on the funding plan. And as you know, our plan from -- when we talked about Investor Day, it's a fully funded plan, but I'll let Barry comment on that more.  On the dividend, you're right to point out is we are now in that zone when we said kind of low to mid 60% payout ratio, which becomes a natural forcing function for increasing our dividend. So that's something that we're now starting to settle into that range. So you can expect that it will just become a natural course of events as we get to that payout range, which on the REIT guidance rules just force as a natural increase in the dividend. So I think we're now in that area. So I think when we start getting into the back half of the year, and we start drifting down to the low 60s, then I think you can expect just a natural progression in the dividend.\nBarry Hytinen: Thanks for the question. When you work through our guidance, as Bill mentioned, as we discussed at the Investor Day, we have a fully funded plan for this year and going forward. And as you know, we will be a routine debt issuer, and while the market has clearly been moved up in terms of rate over the last couple of years with the Fed moves, I would say it's become much more -- it's an improved market as compared to where it was over the last couple of quarters, and we see generally a favorable outlook from a standpoint of issuance. And I think from a standpoint of where we could issue today, that's improved some versus the last couple of quarters.  And to your point, there's a lot of interest in asset-level financing, whether it be for construction or otherwise. And so we're looking at all those options and making sure that we have the best plan for our shareholders. But it's not something that we have to do, as you see, we have plenty of liquidity, but you should expect us to be an issuer on a routine basis. I want to just kind of continue to see what's out there from a market perspective. Clearly, rates are a little bit higher than where they were a couple of years ago, but we still see them being very attractive and partly because pricing in data center has continued to lift and we see continued improvements.  In fact, year-on-year, net new retail-type data center deals we're seeing up like 20%, pretty much consistently across our entire portfolio, and that's trending more toward, I think, by the end of the year, early next year going to be about like 30%. And so that is a pretty significant move.  And then importantly, on hyperscale side, I think the whole industry is generally seeing cash-on-cash unlevered returns moving up, I think something like where a lot of folks were writing in the high 7s or mid-7s, I'm seeing a lot of stuff that's in the 8s, if not even higher. And so I think that's a good trajectory for the industry. It's healthy and it supports the point that I was making earlier. So we feel really good.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.\nAlex Hess: This is Alex Hess on for Andrew Steinerman. I wanted to ask briefly about the ITRenew callout. You highlighted that services revenue growth would have been 11% organic, excluding ITRenew, which implies a pretty sharp deterioration quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year in that business, if my math is right. Could you maybe break that out into what degree that was driven by pricing versus ability to sell through into end markets? And any other dynamics that sort of give you confidence that, that will eventually recover?\nWilliam Meaney: Thanks Hess for the question. I'll start, and then I'll ask Barry to comment and really kind of talk about how we see that trending as we go forward into the year. So as I said in my comments, actually, if we just looked at volume holding pricing constant, is, quite frankly, Q1 would have been a great year for the ITRenew asset that we acquired because the ITRenew, as you know, was really focused at hyperscale. And if we look at that segment alone, I mean, we made very good progress in terms of expanding across our customer portfolio on the enterprise.  But if we just look at hyperscale, which is the ITRenew asset is volume was up 30-plus percent year-over-year. So the volume growth was really good. However -- and I'm sure you're probably seeing this in some of the other companies that you follow, anything that touches the electronics industry when you start seeing what's happened to the chip manufacturers, the memory manufacturers, et cetera, is the pricing has gone down substantially in that area. So we're talking about for a number of components down over 70%.  So you're right to point out, if we look at sequentially Q4 to Q1 is we have seen a drop of revenue on the ITRenew portion of the business or the hyperscale portion of the business even absent -- even -- in spite of the fact that volumes are up 30% year-over-year. So now the good news is that we do see stabilization on those prices, and we see a number of the memory manufacturers and the chip manufacturers, CPU manufacturers, we see them taking capacity out of the market, which gives us further confidence that we've seen kind of a stabilization of prices, which we've seen, I would say, starting towards the end of February going into March.  So we don't see right now that the prices are going to go down further. So that's the good news. But we don't expect that the -- I would say, the chip/memory CPU market is really going to start firming up until we get into the early parts of next year. But Barry?\nBarry Hytinen: Alex, I appreciate the question. I'll give you a little bit more of the detail, which you could find in our filings. So in the fourth quarter of last year, our total ALM business was about $56 million. And in the first quarter, it was $41 million. And so -- and that compares against $70 million last year. Now as I talked about previously, the second quarter of last year was in light of the timing of lockdowns and the pricing trends by the end of the year, second quarter was the peak for our ALM business at $83 million of revenue. We've assumed in our guidance for the second quarter that revenue is consistent with the first quarter this year. So that is a drag on, of course, the services growth rate in the first quarter, and it will be again in the second quarter.  At the -- if you wanted to sort of sensitize our guidance, I would tell you at the low end of our range, which I did not anticipate this is what's going to happen, but just at the low end, we would assume that it just is flat at this level of revenue for the whole year. I really don't see that happening in light of the very strong pipeline opportunities we have in the trends we're seeing in the business. But that's conservative posture for the low end.  What we think is probably going to happen is we will be slight to -- slightly up sequentially. We're running a little bit ahead here already in the second quarter of the projection I'm giving you. And then in the second half, the way we're planning is for the third quarter to be essentially flat year-on-year. So that implies a little bit of a lift and another lift in the fourth quarter. But I will tell you that we have pretty strong confidence in our ability to do that. And I called out 1 deal on -- in the prepared remarks around OEM, and maybe I'll give you a little bit more color. This is a situation where we're dealing with one of the largest manufacturers of devices in the world.  There are several of those, as you know, and we're approaching all of them because what we're finding with large multinationals is very similar to our core enterprise clients. These companies are looking for a partner who can work with them everywhere they do business all around the world. They're currently using a lot of point players in very specific markets on a local basis, and they'd like to have more uniform standards and consistency, and we can provide them with the sorts of services they're looking for things like data [indiscernible], recycling, remarketing. Ultimately, we'll be working with them on things like asset tracking and storage, IT asset management, things of that nature.  So it's -- another example of how our team is continuing to diversify and grow our ALM business and it bolsters our confidence. And just to reiterate, this is a huge market ALM. We really like the space. It's very fragmented, and we think we're in a very good position to take a tremendous amount of share over time. We're working through what everyone in the industry is working through right now, which is pretty low component pricing. We feel good about the opportunity.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo.\nEric Luebchow: So I wanted to touch on the data center demand. So you're more than 60% towards your leasing goal for the full year, so a really strong start to the year. And if you look -- it looks like your in-place and development portfolios are pretty highly leased up. So maybe you could talk about your ability to accommodate additional demand, whether through future development of your land holdings, additional expansions? And then if leasing continues to trend at a high level, could you accelerate some of your data center CapEx this year beyond what you initially guided to?\nWilliam Meaney: Thanks, Eric. And I'll ask Barry to talk about how we think about being flexible or responsive on the CapEx side. But I think generally, yes, we've had a really good start, as you point out the year. We reiterated the 80 megawatts plus for the full year, even though that we've achieved more than half of that in the first quarter because I think as you can appreciate, especially with hyperscale, there's a little bit -- the timing is never fully under your control.  So I would say that we -- some of that -- the new leases that we signed in Q1 were things that we expected in Q2. So I kind of think of it as 2 halves of the year rather than quarter by quarter, just especially when you're talking about hyperscale clients and we had 1 hyperscale client in Q1 that signed up in 2 different contracts for 44 megawatts. In terms of having enough capacity for further expansion, you see we're holding like up to 747 megawatts of land, which is a big uptick from where we were a year ago, but we are making really good progress. So we're constantly -- we're not standing still in that regard.  I mean just in the last couple of months, I visited both our Northern Virginia campus with a potential customer and now done 2 trips with our Indian team since the beginning of the year. So both of those markets continue to develop. And we're not standing still in making sure that we have more land and more capacity to meet our growth. But if you think about just year-on-year, the uptick that we have in terms of the land bank that we have and sitting on 747 megawatts is that we feel good for the next number of quarters that we can accommodate the demand. But Barry, you might want to talk about how we think about the flexibility around CapEx.\nBarry Hytinen: Thanks, Eric. It's good to talk to you this morning. I appreciate those kind words. We -- obviously, the team is doing really well and continuing strength and strength in terms of new signings and also margin performance in our data center business. So hats off to our team there. In terms of data center capital, as you know, this year, we had penciled to deploy about $850 million of growth CapEx and with the vast majority of that going to data center. Year-on-year, we put a considerable incremental amount of CapEx into data center in the first quarter. I think we do have the benefit of so much being pre-leased and the team continue to sell that, yes, it is conceivable to me that we will be, over time, ramping our CapEx for data center and it's sort of a bit of a high-class problem, so to speak, as the team continues to sell through our pipeline plans.  So we have ample capacity to do so in terms of deploying additional capital. We were always planning to spend from a timing standpoint, more CapEx, relatively speaking, in the first half this year than we did last year. As you recall, last year, it was a little bit more shaped towards the back half in terms of data center deployment where deploying a considerable amount here in the first half, we'll continue that trend in the second quarter. And after we get through midyear and see how the additional pipeline looks, which is quite strong, I'll note, at this time.  As we see how that is at midyear, we may talk to you about a little bit more, but that would be a very positive development in terms of continuing to see really high levels of organic growth rates driven by commencements. As you know, we're very pre-leased in terms of our underdevelopment. I think we're now pressing over 90% in terms of pre-leased in terms of what's under construction. So it's a good place to be.  The only other thing I guess I'll call out is that churn has been relatively low, and we continue to expect it to be relatively low for the full year. So thank you, Eric, for your questions.\nOperator: Next question comes from Brendan Lynch with Barclays.\nBrendan Lynch: I wanted to discuss a little bit about Project Matterhorn. I understand it's still very early days, but you called out some large multiple vertical wins. I'm wondering how you expect that type of contract to trend in your revenue mix over the long term as Project Matterhorn gains more momentum. Do you expect to see a lot more of these large multi-vertical wins relative to kind of the legacy revenue mix, which might have been more of a fragmented customer base?\nWilliam Meaney: No. Thanks, Brendan. It really is -- first and foremost, Project Matterhorn has being customer-centric. So what we try to do is make sure we bring full range of Mountain range of services that we have to, to our customers. And if you probably got picked up on a sense is there is a big service component in some of these wins, especially around the digital side. But it's also a big co-location and physical storage. So it's almost -- if you think about even the aerospace company that I've referenced a couple of times in the Q&A and also in my remarks, is there is everything from physical storage to digitization to visualization of their assets. So there is a -- it's a full breadth of the different types of storage solutions we have.  But I think you can expect like and even if you look at our physical -- our organic storage rental revenue growth of 11%, a part of that is, as we said, 9.5% of that growth rate came from our traditionalized physical storage business a bit, but a big part of that came from our data center growth as well. So we see kind of a -- we still see storage. It's one of the most profitable part of our business. We still see that whether it's data center storage or physical document storage and other types of physical storage driving a big part of the growth of the business. But when we actually go talk to a customer, and it's really about helping the customers solve their problem, then it's usually a hybrid set of solutions, which quite frankly, differentiates us when -- even on a data center deal or a physical storage deal.  They really see Iron Mountain as someone that can be a one-stop shopper relatively few stops to actually solve the problem that they're trying to solve rather than what we're trying to sell.\nBarry Hytinen: Brendan, I'll just add, as we talked about before, one of our key initiatives within Matterhorn is cross-selling. And if you go back to what I mentioned in the prepared remarks and our data center team signed 22 new logos within data center in the quarter and when we segment that on a megawatt basis, 75% of that was cross-sell from our existing client base, those 225,000 clients. So I think that's a good indicator of what we are trying to drive with our Matterhorn initiatives around cross-selling.\nOperator: Our next question is a follow-up from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Bill, I thought you had missed it if I don't ask you about the underlying volumes in RIM. So I'm going to ask you now if you can provide a little bit of more color on the breakout like RIM adjacent businesses, consumer and other, just how are the underlying factors playing out and maybe talk a little bit about developed markets versus emerging markets as well?\nWilliam Meaney: Thanks, I appreciate you coming back on. So no, so it's pretty much the same trend that we've seen. So if you think about on the record business on that side is in places like North America that are mature, I would say, it's flat to slightly down in terms of volume. Eastern Europe and some of the emerging markets, it's continued positive volume trend. And as you and I've talked about, it's really about the maturing of the markets. But at the same time, every single customer around the world is continuing to send us new, what I would call, document storage as we come into our facilities. But the growth areas, our combination is, as we've discussed before, is whether it's kind of in Eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific as well as some of the new storage areas that we're doing for our customers. So expanding what their needs are around physical storage.  So the business, as you noticed, is that -- continue to build positive volume. We continue to have very high utilization across our industrial real estate footprint. So really hats off to the team as they're continuing to provide what is a key platform or a key need for our customers around the whole physical storage pain point that our customers have across the industry. Even the aerospace company that I keep referring to is a big part of that, was providing secure physical storage, which before we weren't doing for them, but because we bundled it with a solution of really end-to-end solution around their information management and digitization of some of those assets, and we can do that seamlessly by storing those documents in our facilities for them. Even in a mature market like the United Kingdom had unlocked new storage opportunities.  So it's really part of now a broader conversation of the Mountain range that we have with our customers. And you can see the numbers, it continues to kind of move forward. So thanks for the question.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session in the Iron Mountain First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

            "name": "Barry Hytinen",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our results. In the first quarter, our team continued to deliver strong performance, exceeding the expectations we provided on our last call. We achieved an all-time record quarterly revenue of $1.31 billion, representing 5% growth on a reported basis. Organically, revenue grew 7.5%. Revenue was ahead of the expectations we shared on our last call as Global RIM and our data center businesses both outperformed. A key highlight in the quarter is our organic storage revenue growth of 11%. This marks an acceleration both sequentially and year-on-year. This reflects strong contributions from revenue management, data center commencements and positive volume trends. Total service revenue increased 2% to $504 million or 4% on a constant currency basis. Consistent with the commentary we shared on our last call, the year-on-year impact from the start of the more intense lockdowns in China impacted our ITRenew business.  Excluding ITRenew, service revenue was up 11% on an organic constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was $461 million, a new first quarter record. This represents growth of 7% year-on-year and 9% on a constant currency basis driven by revenue management and strong contributions from data center. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.1%, an improvement of 60 basis points year-on-year with revenue management and mix being the key drivers.  AFFO was $284 million or $0.97 on a per share basis, up $20 million and $0.06, respectively from the first quarter of last year. This was well ahead of the expectations we shared on our last call, partially the result of the timing of some maintenance CapEx items between the first and second quarters.  Now turning to segment performance. In the first quarter, our Global RIM business delivered revenue of $1.13 billion, an increase of $78 million from last year. On an organic basis, revenue increased 11%. Organic storage rental revenue growth of 9.4% reflects our focus on revenue management and solid volume trends. We reported organic service revenue growth of 13.6%, with that performance driven by digital solutions and core offerings.  Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $478 million, an increase of $29 million year-on-year. Turning to our global data center business. We achieved revenue of $112 million, an increase of $15 million year-on-year. From a total revenue perspective, we delivered 17% growth on an organic basis. Organic storage revenue growth was particularly strong at 24%, driven by commencements and improved pricing. As we projected, data center services were down year-on-year given the fit-out work we were performing in the first half of last year. Data center adjusted EBITDA was $51 million, representing 21% growth.  Turning to new and expansion leasing. We had a very strong quarter with the team signing 52 megawatts. We expanded our relationship with a long-standing customer with a 40-megawatt contract. Later in the quarter, we extended this relationship further with another 4 megawatts. Both of these have an initial term of 7 years with multiple renewal options. We signed new deals across our portfolio with key wins in Scottsdale, Phoenix, Frankfurt and London. In total, we signed 22 new logos within our data center business with strong cross-selling activity.  Turning to asset lifecycle management. In the first quarter, ALM volume was ahead of our expectations, while component pricing was down significantly year-on-year. Importantly, we are now seeing pricing for components stabilizing. Given the current environment that Bill described, we are planning for ALM revenue to be consistent in the second quarter with the first quarter. And with the pipeline activity we are seeing, we are well positioned for improving trends in the back half of the year, driven by volume and new bookings.  In particular, our OEM business is developing well with the team growing our pipeline and delivering key new wins. For example, we recently signed a deal with one of the largest technology end-user device manufacturers to partner with them in the decommissioning needs of their customers.  Turning to capital. In the first quarter, we invested $302 million, of which $274 million was growth and $28 million was recurring. Turning to the balance sheet. With strong EBITDA performance, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.1x, reflecting a significant improvement from last year, this marks our lowest leverage level since 2017. We expect to operate within our target leverage range, which is 4.5 to 5.5x.  Our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early July. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, our payout ratio is now 64%, settling into our long-term target range of low to mid-60s percent. Now turning to our outlook.  With strong performance in the quarter, we are well on track for the year, and we are pleased to reiterate our full year guidance. For the second quarter, we expect revenue of approximately $1.35 billion, adjusted EBITDA of approximately $475 million, AFFO of approximately $270 million and AFFO per share of approximately $0.92. In summary, our team is executing well on our Matterhorn growth initiatives. We are investing in our business. We remain focused on driving increased levels of cross-selling and exceeding the expectations of our customers.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank our entire team for their continued dedication and commitment to Iron Mountain and our customers.  With that, operator, would you please open the line for Q&A. Yes, George, it's Barry. Thanks again for the question. The only thing I would -- only a couple of things I would add is I think the team, to Bill's point on our Global RIM is doing phenomenally well. And I think that's the way I would point you to look at the services because, of course, the ALM business is masking our total growth there in terms of what's happening with respect to the core. And at that 14% growth rate that Bill spoke about, that is up against some really big comps. So it's -- I mean, it's a very strong performance, and it is driven by the point that he made, the digital solutions as well as other core offerings, which are all growing for us.  The other thing I'd kind of call out is it's a small factor, but as you know, we were doing fit-out services in data center in the first half of last year. We completed that in the second quarter. And so that makes the year-on-year comp hard just as we explained it would be. So that is another factor that's weighing on that services total growth rate that you were pointing to. I think as you move through and get into the -- see us getting into the back half, you'll see that growth rate accelerating meaningfully as we get beyond the challenges with respect to ALM and the pipeline that Bill was speaking about really comes to fruition and then we also get beyond that data center services comp in the first two quarters. Thanks for the question. Yes. Thanks, Kevin. Appreciate the question. We feel very good about where we're trending. In fact, the first quarter came in right in line, if not a little bit better than what we were expecting in our guidance for the second quarter is similarly and that is despite the fact that we've adjusted our expectations for ALM down some in the second quarter. And the reason we're able to achieve the numbers that we're putting up in the second -- that we're projecting for the second quarter and our confidence in the back half is because of a couple of things you just pointed out.  We are seeing even better revenue management projections in the business. We have, as you've seen in our Global RIM business, we have very strong storage rental growth on an organic basis, almost 9.5%, which marked an acceleration sequentially and year-on-year. Our total organic storage rental growth was over 11%, which was also very strong.  And I will tell you that in light of the fact that we are going to see more revenue management activities we've recently passed some here even in the second quarter, and we'll be passing more as we move through the year, together with the fact that data center pricing continues to improve, and that's an industry phenomenon. You will see, together with that, our commencements are very strong in the back half. So data center will be accelerating as we get into the back half. And as you know, there's very strong visibility on that business. So it's a high confidence point that I'm making there.  So we feel very good about where we are. In terms of -- you mentioned the specifics around second versus the -- quarter versus second half. I'll just note that in light of the timing of the U.S. dollar strength, we still have an FX headwind in the second quarter. In the first quarter, that was almost $30 million of topline. But as we said on the last call, and I'll reiterate, that becomes much more muted, in fact, may even be a slight tailwind in the back half.  We also get through a few items that are in the first half from an EBITDA standpoint. As you know, we did some sale leasebacks last year and we comp over those as we move into the back half and with our productivity initiatives and additional commercial investments we've made, we get to a more favorable comp in the back half from those as well.  So I'll tell you, Kevin, we feel very well positioned about accelerating business even with more muted expectations around ALM. Okay. So thanks for that question. I think our team is doing a phenomenal job with revenue management. It's been a real standout. When you look at Global RIM in terms of its storage rental organic growth that was almost 9.5%. And as you know, we saw good solid volume trends. It was up about $2.5 million on a cube on a trailing 12-month basis.  So as you can gather from that, the vast majority of the growth was driven by revenue management. And importantly, we feel very well positioned in terms of the whole year. And I'll tell you that in terms of the total storage rental growth rate that we put up 11%, which is, of course, benefited by data center commencements with what we see on data center commencements through the remainder of the year.  Together with the revenue management activities we've already put in place and additional that we have going into market over the next few months, I feel very confident that we are going to continue to see total company organic storage rental growth of this order, I think, 9%, 10%, 11%.  And that the environment for revenue management continues to be strong. We will have relatively more revenue management this year, Shlomo, than we did last year. And that is a factor of both what we're wrapping from last year as well as the activities we've had in this year.  Importantly, we continue to see excellent customer retention, and I think that just demonstrates that we are bringing forward very significant value for our clients in these areas. In terms of mix, I would say we continue, as we talked about before, to expand the revenue management program beyond just storage. So you are seeing improving revenue management trends in our services, and that's generally across all line service in our core offerings and so we feel like it's on the right trajectory, Shlomo. Thanks for the question. When you work through our guidance, as Bill mentioned, as we discussed at the Investor Day, we have a fully funded plan for this year and going forward. And as you know, we will be a routine debt issuer, and while the market has clearly been moved up in terms of rate over the last couple of years with the Fed moves, I would say it's become much more -- it's an improved market as compared to where it was over the last couple of quarters, and we see generally a favorable outlook from a standpoint of issuance. And I think from a standpoint of where we could issue today, that's improved some versus the last couple of quarters.  And to your point, there's a lot of interest in asset-level financing, whether it be for construction or otherwise. And so we're looking at all those options and making sure that we have the best plan for our shareholders. But it's not something that we have to do, as you see, we have plenty of liquidity, but you should expect us to be an issuer on a routine basis. I want to just kind of continue to see what's out there from a market perspective. Clearly, rates are a little bit higher than where they were a couple of years ago, but we still see them being very attractive and partly because pricing in data center has continued to lift and we see continued improvements.  In fact, year-on-year, net new retail-type data center deals we're seeing up like 20%, pretty much consistently across our entire portfolio, and that's trending more toward, I think, by the end of the year, early next year going to be about like 30%. And so that is a pretty significant move.  And then importantly, on hyperscale side, I think the whole industry is generally seeing cash-on-cash unlevered returns moving up, I think something like where a lot of folks were writing in the high 7s or mid-7s, I'm seeing a lot of stuff that's in the 8s, if not even higher. And so I think that's a good trajectory for the industry. It's healthy and it supports the point that I was making earlier. So we feel really good. Alex, I appreciate the question. I'll give you a little bit more of the detail, which you could find in our filings. So in the fourth quarter of last year, our total ALM business was about $56 million. And in the first quarter, it was $41 million. And so -- and that compares against $70 million last year. Now as I talked about previously, the second quarter of last year was in light of the timing of lockdowns and the pricing trends by the end of the year, second quarter was the peak for our ALM business at $83 million of revenue. We've assumed in our guidance for the second quarter that revenue is consistent with the first quarter this year. So that is a drag on, of course, the services growth rate in the first quarter, and it will be again in the second quarter.  At the -- if you wanted to sort of sensitize our guidance, I would tell you at the low end of our range, which I did not anticipate this is what's going to happen, but just at the low end, we would assume that it just is flat at this level of revenue for the whole year. I really don't see that happening in light of the very strong pipeline opportunities we have in the trends we're seeing in the business. But that's conservative posture for the low end.  What we think is probably going to happen is we will be slight to -- slightly up sequentially. We're running a little bit ahead here already in the second quarter of the projection I'm giving you. And then in the second half, the way we're planning is for the third quarter to be essentially flat year-on-year. So that implies a little bit of a lift and another lift in the fourth quarter. But I will tell you that we have pretty strong confidence in our ability to do that. And I called out 1 deal on -- in the prepared remarks around OEM, and maybe I'll give you a little bit more color. This is a situation where we're dealing with one of the largest manufacturers of devices in the world.  There are several of those, as you know, and we're approaching all of them because what we're finding with large multinationals is very similar to our core enterprise clients. These companies are looking for a partner who can work with them everywhere they do business all around the world. They're currently using a lot of point players in very specific markets on a local basis, and they'd like to have more uniform standards and consistency, and we can provide them with the sorts of services they're looking for things like data [indiscernible], recycling, remarketing. Ultimately, we'll be working with them on things like asset tracking and storage, IT asset management, things of that nature.  So it's -- another example of how our team is continuing to diversify and grow our ALM business and it bolsters our confidence. And just to reiterate, this is a huge market ALM. We really like the space. It's very fragmented, and we think we're in a very good position to take a tremendous amount of share over time. We're working through what everyone in the industry is working through right now, which is pretty low component pricing. We feel good about the opportunity. Thanks, Eric. It's good to talk to you this morning. I appreciate those kind words. We -- obviously, the team is doing really well and continuing strength and strength in terms of new signings and also margin performance in our data center business. So hats off to our team there. In terms of data center capital, as you know, this year, we had penciled to deploy about $850 million of growth CapEx and with the vast majority of that going to data center. Year-on-year, we put a considerable incremental amount of CapEx into data center in the first quarter. I think we do have the benefit of so much being pre-leased and the team continue to sell that, yes, it is conceivable to me that we will be, over time, ramping our CapEx for data center and it's sort of a bit of a high-class problem, so to speak, as the team continues to sell through our pipeline plans.  So we have ample capacity to do so in terms of deploying additional capital. We were always planning to spend from a timing standpoint, more CapEx, relatively speaking, in the first half this year than we did last year. As you recall, last year, it was a little bit more shaped towards the back half in terms of data center deployment where deploying a considerable amount here in the first half, we'll continue that trend in the second quarter. And after we get through midyear and see how the additional pipeline looks, which is quite strong, I'll note, at this time.  As we see how that is at midyear, we may talk to you about a little bit more, but that would be a very positive development in terms of continuing to see really high levels of organic growth rates driven by commencements. As you know, we're very pre-leased in terms of our underdevelopment. I think we're now pressing over 90% in terms of pre-leased in terms of what's under construction. So it's a good place to be.  The only other thing I guess I'll call out is that churn has been relatively low, and we continue to expect it to be relatively low for the full year. So thank you, Eric, for your questions. Brendan, I'll just add, as we talked about before, one of our key initiatives within Matterhorn is cross-selling. And if you go back to what I mentioned in the prepared remarks and our data center team signed 22 new logos within data center in the quarter and when we segment that on a megawatt basis, 75% of that was cross-sell from our existing client base, those 225,000 clients. So I think that's a good indicator of what we are trying to drive with our Matterhorn initiatives around cross-selling."

            "name": "William Meaney",
            "content": "Thank you, Gillian, and thank you all for taking the time to join us today. Our team delivered another quarter of record results for the first quarter of 2023, exceeding our expectations. This performance reflects the resonance of our expanded product portfolio, our unmatched customer relationships and the strength of our dedicated team.  On a reported basis, in the first quarter, we achieved our highest ever quarterly revenue of $1.31 billion, yielding 7.5% total organic revenue growth and EBITDA of $461 million. We continue to be encouraged by the increased demand for our services across key markets fueling these results as well as the success of Project Matterhorn, enabling our commercial teams to offer our customers access to the widest range of solutions in our company's history. We delivered organic storage rental revenue growth of 11% in the first quarter, and we drove high-teens organic growth in both our data center and digital services businesses.  As we introduced last year with Project Matterhorn, our steady build-out of new products and services as well as growth in these underlying markets continues to accelerate us on our growth trajectory path. I would like to take this opportunity to highlight how we have been serving our customers with our solutions-based approach and our offerings across the Mountain range. Beginning with records management, we won significant new business in the United Kingdom with a major global industrial and aerospace company signing a contract valued at GBP 40 million. Following more than a year of conversations, the team entered into a bespoke 10-year agreement, providing the customer with several hundred thousand cubic feet of secure physical data storage, document digitization and management across multiple secure locations, radio frequency identification tagging for additional security and a dedicated on-site team of experts working to Iron Mountain's industry-leading standards.  I am pleased we could offer such a comprehensive solution that allows the customer to both digitize their data and protect their business. We are now discussing additional opportunities with the same customer in other European countries, North America and Asia. In total, the potential contract value over 10 years is approximated to be GBP 90 million.  Another win that highlights our ability to sell the entire Mountain range involves a state historical society, which turned to both Iron Mountain and our Fine Art Storage Business Crozier for help in preserving the history of its cultural heritage center, which is home to its underground archives in museum. With budget as a key consideration for this customer, our unique solution was focused on reducing costs, whilst leveraging our expertise and innovation to challenge the customer to think differently.  Our combined art, library, archives and logistics expertise enabled our team to deliver a solution that met the state's needs. Also in the quarter, a financial services company based in Australia, a long-standing customer of Iron Mountain turned to us for help with their compliance issues after being impressed by the information we presented at a Policy Center webinar back in 2021.  Our suite of digital enablement solutions and software, including the InSight platform will provide the customer with increased visibility into its archives, digital copy as selected records, auto generation of metadata and auto reduction of personal identifiable information. Success stories such as this highlight the value we provide customers and not only moving data from physical to digital storage, but also improving the methods and capability to utilize the data.  Another digital win was with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. The U.S. Congress has requested that the VA advanced the production of complete and accurate veteran records in a timely fashion, driving the need for digitization of historical veteran documents, which are often dispersed across multiple storage locations. The customer required an experienced digital partner to increase their scanning capacity and also provide facility oversight, chain of custody logistics and secure storage. The unique aspects provided by our high security Boyers, Pennsylvania facility, combined with the skill of our staff were key contributing factors to winning the deal. This is just the beginning of our work to aid in the delivery of medical records to enhance patient care of veterans.  Also in Digital Solutions, we had a key win with an existing customer His Majesty's Courts and tribunal service on a digital mailroom solution to automate the indexing and classification elements of the mail room function. The service, which will reduce the cost and time of processing court applications will be delivered from our location where we have a well-established digitization and BPO facility.  Turning to asset lifecycle management, or ALM, we divide this business into 3 verticals. The first of these is the hyperscale decommissioning business that we acquired from ITRenew. Our volumes grew in excess of 30% in this vertical year-over-year, reflecting our market-leading platform, the strength of our existing customer relationships and our ability to win more new logos. Revenue is down, however, reflecting the record-low pricing the market has seen since the end of 2022 on both new and used components.  In our enterprise ITAD vertical, we've been gratified to see more synergies with our existing customers. Since we have relationships with over 225,000 customers across our wider business, the opportunity to cross-sell our enterprise ITAD services has never been greater.  The last of these verticals is the technology manufacturers. Here, we are winning business, both in terms of servers as well as end-user devices. We have invested in our sales force and obtained specific expertise in the OEM space setting us up for success. This indirect relationship to decommission end-user product is a huge market opportunity. Examples of recent wins in the ALM business include a contract with an existing global asset management company to perform on-site hard disk and solid state disk ratio and destruction whilst maximizing value from data center and corporate end-user assets.  Continuing with ALM, a large global risk management company sought services to decommission to complete in 2 partial data centers. A combination of our strong existing relationship and performance, including guidance from a dedicated program manager, our remarketing solutions and capabilities and the ease of the use of our ALM portal contributed to the win.  Finally, let's turn to our Data Center business. We are pleased to have finished the first quarter of 2023 with 52 megawatts of new leases signed with a single hyperscale customer signing 2 deals for a total of 44 megawatts. You will recall that our guidance for the year is 80-plus megawatts. So to have least over half of our target in the first quarter alone is a triumph of our team.  In terms of the co-location wins this past quarter, one win I would like to highlight is with an existing U.S. federal home loan customer who sought to expand into a new data center market for disaster recovery options and selected our VA2 data center in Manassas, Virginia. The customer was impressed with the tour of our Virginia campus and the custom solution we developed to meet their needs. With their positive past experience with our data center services, we've bundled this expanded solution with a renewal at another of our data center sites.  Also in the quarter, our team announced the win with a fleet management company, which for years has explored moving their internal on-site data center infrastructure to co-location. Our ability to provide a custom solution in our VA2 data center, including direct internet access, smart hands and cross connects resulted in a powerful solution for them and the continuation of an important relationship that has the potential to expand to a disaster recovery solution at our New Jersey data center.  Also noteworthy is a substantial win with an existing major semiconductor chip manufacturer who's taking advantage of all the Mountain range has to offer. The customer was seeking a data center partner to host their internal development cloud environment, and our data center and commercial sales teams work closely to deliver a solution at our Arizona site, leveraging the customer's existing relationship.  All 3 of these wins that I have noted are with long-standing customers, demonstrating our ability to source premium co-location deals with customers with whom we have had trusted relationships for decades. To conclude, we are more enthusiastic than ever about the growth in our business and our ability to offer our customers expanded and innovative solutions to meet their ever-evolving needs. Project Matterhorn is bearing fruit, and we continue to make great strides as our team climbs towards the highest peaks of our journey.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry. George, thanks for the question. So yes, I think overall, if you think about it in the traditional areas, our service revenue growth was quite strong. If you look at just in the RIM business is our Global Organic RIM services grew at 14%, again on an organic and constant currency basis. So very, very strong growth. If you look it on the ALM side, which is where you see the downdraft is, as I've said in my comments, is volume in this quarter was up some 30% year-over-year. So we're actually seeing the synergies -- the commercial synergies that we have as a company and as Barry mentioned, we just signed a new OEM customer as well.  So we see really good traction on the volume side. But on the pricing side, if you probably have seen in the electronics industry, some of the components are down 70%. So whilst we still have positive gross margins on that business, is the revenue is heavily impacted by what we've been seeing across the semiconductor industry in terms of record-low pricing.  So I think that it's really a two world. So as I say, from a -- even ALM business on a volume basis has shown traction, but it is a downdraft in terms of the overall service revenue. But the traditional areas, I would say, in terms of RIM, also, if we look at our digital services, we're also up year-over-year in the high teens, really good progression. Okay. Well, thanks, Jon, for the question. So the -- and I was actually involved in a couple of these, so I could probably give you more color on them. The sales cycles, for instance, the aerospace company that we talked about was like over a year, but this is a company that we've been doing bits of work for decades, right? So it's a natural conversation that they start talking about, well, they want to actually do something different. And this speaks of case, they actually had an in-house vendor for part of it but that company wasn't able to do the full range of services. As I said, they were looking for someone to really takeover of full outsourcing and they're very sensitive, right? Because if one of these things goes missing, aircraft around the world get grounded. So they were very, very sensitive about the security and the reliability of their vendor.  And then the other side of it, obviously, they've known us for decades in different areas that are very sensitive to them. And we were able to bring a full range of services that we're able to do, not just the storage, not just the digitization, but also to give them the tools that they could visualize what was both stored physically and what was digitized and they could do that in a consolidated basis. In other words, they could do that and see that anywhere in the world.  So that was a huge win for them. Now you can say the sales cycle was like over a year. I think I've been visiting with the sales team at customer for over a year but it's been part of an ongoing conversation, and that's the power of having the 225,000 customers that we've had decades and decades of relationship.  The government one, which I mentioned, which -- 2 of them, one was in the U.K. and one was in the -- with the United States government. For the folks that have been following the company for quite some time, we've been talking about the government sector as being our huge potential for Iron Mountain. And it was slow-going at the beginning because government contracts, as I'm sure you're aware, have very long lead times. But both of those have been customers that we've actually been working for the last 2 or 3 years with -- so again, we were -- there was a big investment, I would say, starting 5, 6 years ago with both the VA and with the British government in certain segments. But that's again now starting to become more of a normal course.  So one level is the conversation started 5 years ago, but now it's just a regular course of business that some of these things are as short as 3 or 4 months' lead time where they come up with a statement of work and because we already have a track record, and we're able to do that. I appreciate the question. Let me take your last question on the dividend, and then I'll let Barry comment on the funding plan. And as you know, our plan from -- when we talked about Investor Day, it's a fully funded plan, but I'll let Barry comment on that more.  On the dividend, you're right to point out is we are now in that zone when we said kind of low to mid 60% payout ratio, which becomes a natural forcing function for increasing our dividend. So that's something that we're now starting to settle into that range. So you can expect that it will just become a natural course of events as we get to that payout range, which on the REIT guidance rules just force as a natural increase in the dividend. So I think we're now in that area. So I think when we start getting into the back half of the year, and we start drifting down to the low 60s, then I think you can expect just a natural progression in the dividend. Thanks Hess for the question. I'll start, and then I'll ask Barry to comment and really kind of talk about how we see that trending as we go forward into the year. So as I said in my comments, actually, if we just looked at volume holding pricing constant, is, quite frankly, Q1 would have been a great year for the ITRenew asset that we acquired because the ITRenew, as you know, was really focused at hyperscale. And if we look at that segment alone, I mean, we made very good progress in terms of expanding across our customer portfolio on the enterprise.  But if we just look at hyperscale, which is the ITRenew asset is volume was up 30-plus percent year-over-year. So the volume growth was really good. However -- and I'm sure you're probably seeing this in some of the other companies that you follow, anything that touches the electronics industry when you start seeing what's happened to the chip manufacturers, the memory manufacturers, et cetera, is the pricing has gone down substantially in that area. So we're talking about for a number of components down over 70%.  So you're right to point out, if we look at sequentially Q4 to Q1 is we have seen a drop of revenue on the ITRenew portion of the business or the hyperscale portion of the business even absent -- even -- in spite of the fact that volumes are up 30% year-over-year. So now the good news is that we do see stabilization on those prices, and we see a number of the memory manufacturers and the chip manufacturers, CPU manufacturers, we see them taking capacity out of the market, which gives us further confidence that we've seen kind of a stabilization of prices, which we've seen, I would say, starting towards the end of February going into March.  So we don't see right now that the prices are going to go down further. So that's the good news. But we don't expect that the -- I would say, the chip/memory CPU market is really going to start firming up until we get into the early parts of next year. But Barry? Thanks, Eric. And I'll ask Barry to talk about how we think about being flexible or responsive on the CapEx side. But I think generally, yes, we've had a really good start, as you point out the year. We reiterated the 80 megawatts plus for the full year, even though that we've achieved more than half of that in the first quarter because I think as you can appreciate, especially with hyperscale, there's a little bit -- the timing is never fully under your control.  So I would say that we -- some of that -- the new leases that we signed in Q1 were things that we expected in Q2. So I kind of think of it as 2 halves of the year rather than quarter by quarter, just especially when you're talking about hyperscale clients and we had 1 hyperscale client in Q1 that signed up in 2 different contracts for 44 megawatts. In terms of having enough capacity for further expansion, you see we're holding like up to 747 megawatts of land, which is a big uptick from where we were a year ago, but we are making really good progress. So we're constantly -- we're not standing still in that regard.  I mean just in the last couple of months, I visited both our Northern Virginia campus with a potential customer and now done 2 trips with our Indian team since the beginning of the year. So both of those markets continue to develop. And we're not standing still in making sure that we have more land and more capacity to meet our growth. But if you think about just year-on-year, the uptick that we have in terms of the land bank that we have and sitting on 747 megawatts is that we feel good for the next number of quarters that we can accommodate the demand. But Barry, you might want to talk about how we think about the flexibility around CapEx. No. Thanks, Brendan. It really is -- first and foremost, Project Matterhorn has being customer-centric. So what we try to do is make sure we bring full range of Mountain range of services that we have to, to our customers. And if you probably got picked up on a sense is there is a big service component in some of these wins, especially around the digital side. But it's also a big co-location and physical storage. So it's almost -- if you think about even the aerospace company that I've referenced a couple of times in the Q&A and also in my remarks, is there is everything from physical storage to digitization to visualization of their assets. So there is a -- it's a full breadth of the different types of storage solutions we have.  But I think you can expect like and even if you look at our physical -- our organic storage rental revenue growth of 11%, a part of that is, as we said, 9.5% of that growth rate came from our traditionalized physical storage business a bit, but a big part of that came from our data center growth as well. So we see kind of a -- we still see storage. It's one of the most profitable part of our business. We still see that whether it's data center storage or physical document storage and other types of physical storage driving a big part of the growth of the business. But when we actually go talk to a customer, and it's really about helping the customers solve their problem, then it's usually a hybrid set of solutions, which quite frankly, differentiates us when -- even on a data center deal or a physical storage deal.  They really see Iron Mountain as someone that can be a one-stop shopper relatively few stops to actually solve the problem that they're trying to solve rather than what we're trying to sell. Thanks, I appreciate you coming back on. So no, so it's pretty much the same trend that we've seen. So if you think about on the record business on that side is in places like North America that are mature, I would say, it's flat to slightly down in terms of volume. Eastern Europe and some of the emerging markets, it's continued positive volume trend. And as you and I've talked about, it's really about the maturing of the markets. But at the same time, every single customer around the world is continuing to send us new, what I would call, document storage as we come into our facilities. But the growth areas, our combination is, as we've discussed before, is whether it's kind of in Eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific as well as some of the new storage areas that we're doing for our customers. So expanding what their needs are around physical storage.  So the business, as you noticed, is that -- continue to build positive volume. We continue to have very high utilization across our industrial real estate footprint. So really hats off to the team as they're continuing to provide what is a key platform or a key need for our customers around the whole physical storage pain point that our customers have across the industry. Even the aerospace company that I keep referring to is a big part of that, was providing secure physical storage, which before we weren't doing for them, but because we bundled it with a solution of really end-to-end solution around their information management and digitization of some of those assets, and we can do that seamlessly by storing those documents in our facilities for them. Even in a mature market like the United Kingdom had unlocked new storage opportunities.  So it's really part of now a broader conversation of the Mountain range that we have with our customers. And you can see the numbers, it continues to kind of move forward. So thanks for the question."

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gillian Tiltman, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nGillian Tiltman: Thank you, Chuck. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. On today's call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We're joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Barry Hytinen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we'll open the lines for Q&A. Today's earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's earnings materials, the safe harbor language on Slide 2 and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliations to these measures in our supplemental financial information. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.\nWilliam Meaney: Thank you, Gillian, and thank you all for taking time to join us today to discuss our third quarter results. We delivered another excellent quarter, with record results across all financial metrics of revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. This is a direct result of the portfolio based momentum we have built, which will continue to deliver sustained double-digit growth. During the quarter, we achieved our highest ever quarterly revenue of $1.6 billion, up 12% from the prior year. We also set a new adjusted EBITDA record of $568 million, up 14%. In addition, AFFO per share on a normalized basis was $1.12, up 10% compared to the prior year. Given our strong performance year-to-date, we are now on track to achieve the high end of our full year 2024 guidance range. I'll now turn to an update of our key achievements during the quarter, which are grounded in the following strategic priorities: driving continued revenue growth in our physical storage records management business; delivering differentiated digital solutions, which give truly transformative results to our customers in terms of revenue, cost and cybersecurity; providing asset life cycle management capabilities, which are both economic and environmentally sustainable; and supplying differentiated data center offerings through our global scale and customer trust. Now let me highlight some important wins from the quarter that showcase how we demonstrate the power of our platform. Let's begin with our Records and Information Management business. In Australia, a large government department was looking for a partner that could provide a number of services. We earned their trust and signed a seven year contract delivering storage, digital solutions and asset life cycle management services. Turning to our digital solutions business. This quarter, we launched our InSight Digital Experience, or DXP, a SaaS based platform. DXP allows customers to automate the generation of metadata as well as having the ability to access, manage, govern and monetize physical and digital information. We launched this enhanced platform on August 1, and we have already booked 24 recurring revenue deals. I'll speak to two existing customer wins where we cross sold our DXP offering. Let's start with the customer in Mexico. Due to new requirements in the country for all pension information to be digitized, a longstanding customer turned to Iron Mountain to swiftly gain compliance. We have secured a DXP contract with this large financial services company to sort, digitize and manage their pension records over the next 12 months, comprising more than 50 million images. Secondly, in the U.S., a large healthcare company that has an existing records management and ALM customer will leverage our DXP platform to manage a complex set of multi-format records. By digitizing and migrating this data into our DXP platform, our customer will be able to manage their records more effectively, including the elimination of ineligible claims. This is an example, how the power of our DXP platform drives value for our customers and our unique ability to support their physical and digital information management needs. Turning to our asset life cycle management business. We are pleased with the progress we are making to expand our capabilities and geographic footprint. In Australia, a telecommunications provider needed services for the secured destruction and disposal of e-waste and IT assets. Given our nationwide scale, this customer determined that we are the right partner by handling a high volume of IT hardware efficiently. As a result, Iron Mountain was awarded a recurring contract for these services. In the U.S., our expanded footprint and capabilities following our acquisition of Regency Technologies has resulted in a significant ALM contract with a global technology company. Under this agreement, we will be managing all IT asset disposition services for our customers' U.S. operations, in addition to the records management services that we already provide. The strength of our logistics capabilities was a major factor in winning this contract. Consistent with our strategy to significantly grow our presence in the large and fragmented enterprise asset life cycle management space, we are pleased to announce the acquisition of Wisetek, an end-to-end IT asset disposition company, which will provide us with an expanded footprint across Europe and the United States. We also completed the acquisition of APCD, a leading Australian IT asset disposition specialist. These acquisitions will enable us to continue to expand our reach across a number of categories. Turning to our data center business. I would like to share two examples that demonstrate the continued demand for capacity at our campuses across the world. In Virginia, our team won a second 2 megawatt deal with a global technology company, building on a similar deal with this customer at our data center in Pennsylvania earlier this year. In Arizona, we are supporting a global fintech provider to migrate from an internal data center in a 1.5 megawatt deal with scope for further expansion. Our compliance program was a deciding factor for this highly regulated customer. The leasing achieved in the first three quarters brings us to 106 megawatts compared to the increased guidance for the year of 130 megawatts. To conclude, I'll leave you with three key takeaways. Our strategy is built on the strength of our portfolio of growth businesses, including digital solutions, data center and asset life cycle management, each growing at a CAGR of 20% plus. This coupled with the mid to high-single digit growth of our records management business will continue to deliver consolidated growth in excess of 10% for years to come. This growth is sustained and resilient given it is based upon a portfolio of products and services that meet the current and future needs of our customer base of nearly 250,000 customers, including 95% of the Fortune 1000. And the cornerstone of this strategy is our company's DNA of placing our customers' needs and well-being at the heart of how we serve them. This is all thanks to our dedicated team of Mountaineers. With that, I'll turn it over to Barry to provide more details on our financial results and outlook.\nBarry Hytinen: Thanks, Bill, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our results. In the third quarter, our team delivered strong performance across all of our key financial metrics, including revenue, EBITDA and AFFO. Results for each of those were ahead of the projections we provided on our last call. Our team drove solid performance across all of our business segments, each of which I will discuss in more detail before turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. During the third quarter, we achieved record revenue of $1.56 billion, up 12% on a reported basis, driven by 9% storage growth and 17% service growth. We delivered strong organic growth in the quarter, up 10%. Total storage revenue in the quarter was $936 million, up $77 million year-on-year. We drove 9% organic storage growth, two-thirds of which was driven by revenue management trends in our global RIM business and one-third from our data center business. Total service revenue was $622 million, up $92 million from last year. Organic service revenue growth accelerated to 10% year-on-year. I will note, this represents our best quarterly growth rate for organic service revenue in the last two years. Revenue was driven by strong performance in our ALM and global RIM businesses. Reported service revenue growth at 17.4% reflects the inclusion of our Regency Technologies acquisition. Adjusted EBITDA was $568 million, a new record, up 14% year-on-year, driven by strong growth in our Global RIM, ALM and data center businesses. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.5%, up 50 basis points year-on-year, which reflects improved margins across all of our businesses. AFFO was $332 million, up $31 million, which represents growth in excess of 10% for the third quarter of last year -- from the third quarter of last year. Reported AFFO on a per share basis was $1.13, up $0.11 from last year. AFFO per share included a $0.01 benefit due to our GAAP share count in the quarter. Normalizing for that, AFFO per share was up 10% to $1.12, which is comparable to the projection we provided on our last call of $1.10. The outperformance to our guidance was driven by higher adjusted EBITDA. As expected, the strength of the U.S. dollar continued to be a headwind, increasingly so toward the end of the quarter. On a constant currency basis, revenue was up 13% and AFFO was up 11%. Now turning to segment performance. I'll start with our global RIM business, which achieved revenue of $1.26 billion, an increase of $78 million year-on-year. Organic storage was up in excess of 7%, driven by revenue management and consistent volume. Organic service revenue was also up 7%, with contributions from digital and core services. A key highlight is the performance of our digital business. The team launched the digital experience platform that Bill mentioned, while also delivering their best bookings quarter yet. Consistent with our Matterhorn plan, the vast majority of the digital wins were the result of cross selling. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $569 million, an increase of $52 million year-on-year. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA margin was up 120 basis points sequentially and 140 basis points from last year. Margin expansion was driven by operating leverage and revenue management. Turning to our global data center business. The team delivered revenue of $153 million, an increase of $26 million year-on-year. From a total revenue perspective, we achieved 20% organic growth. We delivered storage rental revenue growth of 22% from the third quarter of last year. As expected, service revenue was down slightly this quarter due to the customer specific installation work we had last year. As a reminder, installation revenue tends to be at low to breakeven margins. Data center adjusted EBITDA was $67 million, representing strong growth of 26%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 43.6%, an increase of 190 basis points from the third quarter of last year and up 40 basis points sequentially. Margin expansion was driven by pricing, recent commencements and operating leverage. Turning to new and expansion leasing. We signed 9 megawatts in the quarter, bringing total bookings year-to-date to 106 megawatts, and we expect to finish the year with 130 megawatts of new leases signed in 2024. Consistent with the strength and expanding nature of our hyperscale customer relationships, together with the outlook for long-term secular growth in the data center industry, we are pleased to announce that we have acquired a development site in Richmond, Virginia. When fully built out, the campus will operate with greater than 200 megawatts of capacity. As this transaction closed in the fourth quarter, it is not included in our supplemental. With this new market, our total data center capacity rises to in excess of 1.1 gigawatts, an increase of over 20%. Turning to asset life cycle management. Total ALM revenue in the quarter was $102 million, an increase of $61 million or 145% year-on-year. On an organic basis, our ALM team delivered strong double-digit growth, which was driven by data center decommissioning and expansion in our enterprise business. Regency Technologies performed very well this quarter with revenue of $36 million. Leveraging Regency's capabilities, capturing synergies related to the deal and improved efficiencies in our data center decommissioning resulted in considerable improvement in ALM profitability. Our focus on cross selling is delivering great results. For example, over 95% of our ALM bookings this quarter were cross sell wins. Regarding the ALM acquisitions that Bill referenced, we closed APCD in August, and it contributed $3 million to revenue. We closed Wisetek in late September, so we had no income statement contribution in the quarter from that acquisition. Turning to capital allocation. We remain committed to our strategy, that is balanced between funding our growth initiatives, while delivering meaningful returns to our shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $415 million, with $373 million of growth and $41 million of recurring. Turning to the balance sheet. With strong EBITDA performance, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.0 times, which is again the lowest level we have achieved since prior to the company's REIT conversion in 2014. For me, a highlight in the quarter was the significant improvement in our cash cycle, with the third quarter having the best performance in that metric in over a decade. Our team drove days sales outstanding down by over five days from the third quarter of last year. Also, we improved days payable by two days. Turning to our dividend. Our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.715 per share to be paid in early January. And now turning to our projections. For the full year, we are on track to achieve the high end of our guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue of approximately $1.6 billion, adjusted EBITDA of approximately $595 million, AFFO of approximately $358 million and AFFO per share of approximately $1.21. In conclusion, our third quarter results represent another milestone on our growth plan. We operate in very large categories, with a total addressable market in excess of $150 billion annually and growing. Iron Mountain has long-standing relationships with nearly 250,000 clients, many measured in decades of duration. And in the vast majority of those relationships, we are only penetrated with a small fraction of our total product offering. We are driving value for our customers, and we are highly focused on cross selling and expanding market share across our businesses. I would like to thank all of my fellow Mountaineers for their efforts to serve our clients and grow our company. And with that, operator, would you please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. In your ALM business, can you talk a little bit more about trends that you're seeing in the data center and enterprise side of the business, including how much contribution you're seeing from volumes and pricing?\nWilliam Meaney: Good morning, George. Thanks for the question. Let me talk about the overall trends. And Barry, I'll ask to comment a little bit on the pricing trends. So as you, I think, alluded to, is that we see good growth or very strong growth coming out of the data center decommissioning (ph), especially where a lot of the hyperscalers are renewing their equipment to take advantage of the latest GPU. So we continue to see strength in that trend. But that's not to ignore the strength in the growth, the volumetric trends that we see also in the enterprise side. But you're right to assume that we see good growth in the hyperscale segment due to the refresh of some of their equipment to take advantage of AI.\nBarry Hytinen: And George, it's Barry. I would say from a pricing standpoint, we continue to see -- expect it to trend as I've been discussing throughout the year. It was up some on a year-year basis and trending. However, the spreads between new and second hand of the year have been a little bit variable based on the specific component. So with memory, for example, being a little wider than normal and some of those others being a little tighter. As I've said before, we're not really predicating our guidance on a really meaningful increase in component pricing. And just to give you a perspective on this, our total ALM business was $102 million of revenue, almost $103 million actually in the quarter. As I mentioned, Regency was $36 million, and then we had about $3 million from APCD, which means our organic revenue in the quarter on ALM was about $64 million, and that compares to last year at $42 million. So we are -- to Bill's point, the volume is driving a lot of increase. And with that volume, together with the synergies from our Regency deal, we're seeing the ALM profitability to be up a lot. So we're very pleased with the way our ALM business is trending, George.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Jonathan Atkin with RBC. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Atkin: Thank you. I wanted to ask about CapEx requirements to kind of fuel the growth going forward. Give us a sense as to how to maybe frame that for the next year? I assume a lot of that would be data centers, but any color on that would be helpful. Thank you.\nBarry Hytinen: Hi, Jon. It's Barry. You are correct that in light of the strong growth we continue to see in leasing, we will be continuing to invest significantly in data center growth capital. And in fact, we'll probably be somewhere in the vicinity of a couple of hundred million dollars more growth capital than we were previously expecting earlier in the year in light of the signings. And as you probably saw in our supplemental, we are advancing pretty heavily in some of the construction of all the pre-leased assets. As I've said before, important note is nearly everything that we have under construction is already pre-leased on very, very favorable terms. So our total guidance for capital this year is probably approaching $1.8 billion and with about approaching $150 million of that being recurring. The vast, vast majority of the growth is for data center. And I think you should probably expect something of that order or so going forward in light of the signings that we've had and the amount of capacity we'll be bringing online under those pre-leased agreements. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Thank you very much. Could you talk a little bit about kind of the pacing of when you expect some of the construction to come on board? It wasn't a ton of sequential revenue growth in the data center business. And obviously, there was a huge signing quarter relative to what we saw in the last couple of quarters. So I want to know if you could just give us -- I know it's lumpy on the signings side. And obviously, you have to put something into commission that you're actually -- the customers using it in order to generate revenue. Can you give us a little bit of an idea of how we should think about that pacing into the fourth quarter? And then in general, over the next year or so, how are -- how is that looking -- are you looking to bring a lot of new capacity or new data centers actually into service?\nWilliam Meaney: Yeah. Thanks, Shlomo for the question. So there's a few pieces in there. So let me start, first of all, about the signing this quarter, the 9 megawatts. And as you alluded to, and I think we said in the last call, there was some that kind of we expected in Q3 last time that landed in Q2. We still feel very good with the pipeline that we have to land at 130 megawatts or maybe a little bit better for the year because of lumpiness of some of these large hyperscale contracts that you mentioned. But we're really pleased with the -- these two contracts that we signed or the two that I mentioned on the call, for instance, because these are more co-lo (ph), which obviously attract very high margins. So we feel really good about the overall guidance for the year. I think in terms of the revenue growth and the pickup that you mentioned is the commencements are actually driving this. So we actually see an acceleration of revenue growth, both year-over-year and sequentially as we head into the fourth quarter, which is really going to set us up well as we get the momentum to continue to carry this strong double-digit or in center case, north of 20% CAGR in the growth of that business as we go into 2025. And that's reinforced by the fact that we announced it since the close of the quarter, but in Q4, we've already purchased more land to build out a campus in Richmond, Virginia that Barry mentioned in his remarks. So we feel really good about the setup as we go into 2025. The fourth quarter will be very strong. And I don't know, Barry, if you want to add anything.\nBarry Hytinen: Sure. Well, the only other color I suppose I would provide is, you would see in the supplemental that we did commence into revenue generating and finished construction, if you will, on quite a few megawatts. But the vast majority of that was right at the end of the quarter. So it really contributed almost very de minimis amount of revenue to the headline results. And so that's one of the reasons why we have a high degree of visibility to something in the neighborhood of probably $20 million plus or more of incremental data center revenue in the fourth quarter versus the third. That incidentally is up from our prior guidance, so reflecting the fact that our team is doing a great job with keeping construction on budget and on time. And as you would see in the supplemental, we've got quite a few commencements coming over the next couple, three, four quarters. So you should be anticipating ramping levels of data center revenue from us going forward. And I'll just point out that, as we said before, the returns we've been writing have been improving. Pricing, obviously, in data center has been getting better for quite some time now. And so that's one of the reasons why you're seeing the margins step up sequentially, and we expect that trend to continue. So we feel quite good about where we are. Next question?\nOperator: Your next question will come from Nate Crossett with BNP. Please go ahead.\nNathan Crossett: Hi. Good morning. I was wondering if you could give us your expectation for RIM volumes in 4Q? And maybe into next year, what should we expect for RIM pricing? And then one on the Richmond land, is that power provisioned already and maybe when can we see start developments on that site?\nWilliam Meaney: Thanks, Nate. Let me start with the Richmond land. Yes, that is power provided. And as we said, that will be north of 200 megawatts of critical IT load, so we're really pleased with that expansion. And I'll let Barry talk about the RIM volume and pricing.\nBarry Hytinen: Sure. Hi, Nate. As you would see in the supplemental, we continue to expand our total physical volume in the quarter and we expect that trend to continue certainly in the fourth quarter and going into next year. The team is doing a great job capturing market share and growing our physical volume. Pricing, revenue management, we were clearly focused, as I mentioned, on driving value for our clients and with that value. And I think we're really on provider that can serve clients, especially our larger clients in the ways that we do. And we're offering new offerings that make the value that much higher, things like Smartstore, Image on Demand, our DXP platform among numerous other offerings that drive value for clients. So you would see that the total revenue in global RIM on the storage side was up a little over 7% organic in the quarter, and that was very much in line, in fact, a little bit ahead of what we were expecting as the team continues to do very well driving that value. Thank you. And I would say you mentioned about for next year. Our long-term outlook continues to be that our physical volume will be flattish to slightly up. I see no reason why, at this point, that would be any different next year. And similarly, I think as long as we're continuing to drive value for clients as we are, you should be anticipating our revenue management opportunities to be of the same order that we've been speaking about for some time, which is that mid to upper-single digit. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Kevin McVeigh with UBS. Please go ahead.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. Thanks so much. Good morning, I guess, hey, Barry, I think you talked to kind of revenue and EBITDA at the upper end of the range last quarter too. It looks like you beat by a little bit in the quarter. Any thoughts as to just why it was reaffirmed as opposed to not take it up with one quarter left in the year? Was that FX? Any puts and takes on that?\nBarry Hytinen: Hi, Kevin, so good morning. Really appreciate the question. Appreciate the kind words. I would say, we have been saying all year long that what our year guidance was, and we've just taken it to the high end. And frankly, if you work through the guide, you'd find that we're probably going to be a little bit above the high end for revenue and EBITDA based on our fourth quarter projection. And then AFFO and AFFO per share kind of works out to right at the high end of the guidance. Of course, you are right, FX has been a headwind to us all year, probably at least as much of a headwind in the fourth quarter as it was in the third quarter in light of the dollar strength. And I know that it may sound a little bit -- just getting into the weeds, but that may sound a little counter to what you expect when you look at, say, the pound and the euro. But don't forget, we have a fair amount of exposure in Latin America. We've got a great business there. And incidentally, our Latin America business is doing phenomenally well, really growing bookings in our digital business, taking off dramatically in LatAm. But with that, we are exposed to the Argentine peso, the Chilean currencies or the Brazilian real. And so all of those you would see have had a really tough go versus the dollar. So that's disproportionately impacting our revenue and our EBITDA. But look, we feel really good about where we are and our outlook is very favorable. And as we said before, we are running well ahead of our long-term target for a CAGR of 10% that we issued at Investor Day. We're probably running 200 basis points, 300 basis points or more above that for the first few years of that target, and we continue to expect to be at or above those levels and driving considerable profitability. And that is based on -- our growth portfolio that Bill spoke about, we expect that growth portfolio to continue to grow it in excess of 20% for a long period of time. That's ALM, digital and data center, coupled together with the strength of our global RIM business. Next question?\nOperator: Next question will come from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi, everybody. Question on InSight. You caught my ear with the 22 wins on the InSight DXP platform. I wanted to know if Iron Mountain is getting revenues for InSight? I know kind of initially that wasn't the strategy, more of a cross sell. So if you're not getting much revenues, what's kind of a typical revenues you're getting from new storage contracts that are bundled with the InSight capability? And if 22 a large number of InSight wins, like, why should we understand this to be important?\nWilliam Meaney: Thanks, Andrew. I appreciate the question. So first of all, it's 24, but who's counting, but just -- first of all, we don\u2019t do anything for free. So these are -- when I say highly profitable, these are the typical kind of double-digit service contracts that you're used to watching us. Think of these things, depending on the length of the contract, depending on how much productivity we build in during the length of the contract, but think of them somewhere between 20% and 40% gross margin contracts. The nice thing about these with the DXP platform, not only are we tracking those contracts, I mean, you've been watching the company for a long time, when we start off our digital business is that we were doing relatively little in the area of workflow, much more feeding their data links by the digitization of physical documents. This DXP platform, not only part of it is -- there is a digitization part. But more importantly, when I'm talking about the 20% to 40% margin, depending on the length of the contract, and how much productivity we can build during that course is lots of times, it's taking in data that's completely digital, it's foreign digitally. And we're putting that into our SaaS platform, creating metadata automatically and putting workflow around that. So I think I highlighted the savings bond example. Recently, that was the precursor to DXP, where we took 2 billion microfiche images of historical savings bonds where they couldn't find the owners. And 96% of them we were able to process with the precursor of DXP, which we called InSight and without a person in the loop and identify the owner. So it's that kind of power in this platform. And of course, we've taken it the next step further, and it's a fully SaaS-based platform. But we like the profitability of this business. We really like the growth of the business. And generally, I think you know me well enough. I don't do anything for free.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nEric Luebchow: Thanks. Appreciate you taking the question. Maybe you could just touch on kind of some of your longer-term aspirations with ALM. I know at your Investor Day a couple of years ago, you talked about getting to $900 million or so of revenues by 2026, that's obviously a pretty massive ramp from where you're currently at. So I just wanted to confirm if that's still your stated goal? And maybe how you can kind of bridge from where you're at today, call it, just north of $400 million in annualized revenue to that number, whether it comes from component pricing, volume or incremental M&A that you may or may not do? Thank you.\nWilliam Meaney: Let me -- thanks, Eric. I appreciate the question. So I think, yes, we still very much have line of sight to the targets that we set out on Investor Day. Now obviously, that's a combination of organic growth. And as Barry pointed out, we had very, very strong organic growth this quarter. We continue \u2013 although, it was up over 50% this quarter, we continue to guide that we can maintain over 20% growth because there's obviously some fluctuation in the pricing of components over time, and we saw that 1.5 years or 2 years ago. But if you look at the volumetric trends that we see in that business, whether it be on enterprise, whether it be on hyperscale data centers or even enterprise data centers decommissioned is the amount of volume because people have a different need as they refresh their equipment than maybe they had 10 years ago, both environmentally and from a security standpoint. We see the volumetric trends. So that's a really strong double-digit growth business. And in addition, we \u2013 like, the acquisitions we highlighted that we did in Q3, we see that there's a number of these acquisitions that we'll continue to build. So we feel really good about the targets that we outlined on Investor Day. I don't know, Barry, if you want to add anything.\nBarry Hytinen: I think, Eric, the top line target that we provided for the whole company was 10%, and we're obviously running, as I mentioned earlier, a couple of hundred -- 200 basis points, 300 basis points ahead of that. I think our growth portfolio continues to outperform and our global RIM business, also is considerably ahead of where our projections were at that time in the scenario that you're referring to. I'd just underscore, ALM is a really big category. And the TAM there is immense. We're already one of the, if not, the largest player. And I think both from an organic and inorganic standpoint, we can become the market leader in that space. And you saw us doing that both on the organic side as well as with a couple of recent complementary deal. So we feel quite good about ALM. It is very much on track with our strategy for cross selling and driving more value for our clients. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next question will come from Brendan Lynch with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrendan Lynch: Great. Thank you for taking my question. I want to stick with the ALM theme. Can you just give us some more details around Wisetek and APCD in terms of their geography and their product offering, maybe the customer focus between enterprise and hyperscale? And also the appetite you have for larger acquisitions, instead maybe some of these bolt-ons?\nWilliam Meaney: Thanks, Brendan for the question. So let me -- I'll talk a little bit about the categories and geographies they bring. So Wisetek really helps us expand our portfolio, primarily, in Europe and North America. So they have good presence in both markets. In addition, they also bring strong customer relationships, both on the enterprise, but also we picked up a new hyperscale customer the acquisition of Wisetek, which was great. This is a customer that we have a relationship in some of our other businesses already. But having -- picking up the hyperscale relationship on the ALM side, in addition through the Wisetek acquisition was really great. I think also, obviously, the acquisition we did in Australia does build out our capabilities in Australia, which has always been a strong and important market for Iron Mountain, but it allows us to actually broaden our portfolio of services for our customers there. I don't know, Barry, if you want to talk a little bit more about\u2026\nBarry Hytinen: Hi, Brendan. Good morning. We didn't really disclose financial terms on these couple of smaller deals, but I will tell you that, combined, they probably represent in the vicinity of $75 million, $80 million run rate revenue and they -- Wisetek is based in Ireland that has decent sized operations as Bill was mentioning both in Europe as well as U.S. and a little bit in Asia. APCD, as I mentioned, is based in Australia. And the thing about Australia is that's a large data center market, as I know you know, because you follow the data center industry so well. So that is an underpenetrated opportunity for us, both in terms of enterprise as well as decommissioning. And so we feel very good about these opportunities. You've seen what we've been able to do, even still early on with our Regency acquisition. I think all of these create more scale, more capability and more reach for us to serve our global client base much more effectively. And as you mentioned, are we open to larger deals? The thing about this is there's really -- I mean, we're already the larger player. So actually, you get past us and a couple of others that are, say, half our size, they -- all the players that are in space are relatively small, Brendan? So you're thinking like $100 million revenue or less. And so, I don't think you should anticipate anything large in that space. And -- but frankly, we're doing quite well on the organic side, and we're very happy to welcome the team from Wisetek and APCD to our company. So thank you for the questions.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and the Iron Mountain third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Barry Hytinen",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our results. In the third quarter, our team delivered strong performance across all of our key financial metrics, including revenue, EBITDA and AFFO. Results for each of those were ahead of the projections we provided on our last call. Our team drove solid performance across all of our business segments, each of which I will discuss in more detail before turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. During the third quarter, we achieved record revenue of $1.56 billion, up 12% on a reported basis, driven by 9% storage growth and 17% service growth. We delivered strong organic growth in the quarter, up 10%. Total storage revenue in the quarter was $936 million, up $77 million year-on-year. We drove 9% organic storage growth, two-thirds of which was driven by revenue management trends in our global RIM business and one-third from our data center business. Total service revenue was $622 million, up $92 million from last year. Organic service revenue growth accelerated to 10% year-on-year. I will note, this represents our best quarterly growth rate for organic service revenue in the last two years. Revenue was driven by strong performance in our ALM and global RIM businesses. Reported service revenue growth at 17.4% reflects the inclusion of our Regency Technologies acquisition. Adjusted EBITDA was $568 million, a new record, up 14% year-on-year, driven by strong growth in our Global RIM, ALM and data center businesses. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.5%, up 50 basis points year-on-year, which reflects improved margins across all of our businesses. AFFO was $332 million, up $31 million, which represents growth in excess of 10% for the third quarter of last year -- from the third quarter of last year. Reported AFFO on a per share basis was $1.13, up $0.11 from last year. AFFO per share included a $0.01 benefit due to our GAAP share count in the quarter. Normalizing for that, AFFO per share was up 10% to $1.12, which is comparable to the projection we provided on our last call of $1.10. The outperformance to our guidance was driven by higher adjusted EBITDA. As expected, the strength of the U.S. dollar continued to be a headwind, increasingly so toward the end of the quarter. On a constant currency basis, revenue was up 13% and AFFO was up 11%. Now turning to segment performance. I'll start with our global RIM business, which achieved revenue of $1.26 billion, an increase of $78 million year-on-year. Organic storage was up in excess of 7%, driven by revenue management and consistent volume. Organic service revenue was also up 7%, with contributions from digital and core services. A key highlight is the performance of our digital business. The team launched the digital experience platform that Bill mentioned, while also delivering their best bookings quarter yet. Consistent with our Matterhorn plan, the vast majority of the digital wins were the result of cross selling. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $569 million, an increase of $52 million year-on-year. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA margin was up 120 basis points sequentially and 140 basis points from last year. Margin expansion was driven by operating leverage and revenue management. Turning to our global data center business. The team delivered revenue of $153 million, an increase of $26 million year-on-year. From a total revenue perspective, we achieved 20% organic growth. We delivered storage rental revenue growth of 22% from the third quarter of last year. As expected, service revenue was down slightly this quarter due to the customer specific installation work we had last year. As a reminder, installation revenue tends to be at low to breakeven margins. Data center adjusted EBITDA was $67 million, representing strong growth of 26%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 43.6%, an increase of 190 basis points from the third quarter of last year and up 40 basis points sequentially. Margin expansion was driven by pricing, recent commencements and operating leverage. Turning to new and expansion leasing. We signed 9 megawatts in the quarter, bringing total bookings year-to-date to 106 megawatts, and we expect to finish the year with 130 megawatts of new leases signed in 2024. Consistent with the strength and expanding nature of our hyperscale customer relationships, together with the outlook for long-term secular growth in the data center industry, we are pleased to announce that we have acquired a development site in Richmond, Virginia. When fully built out, the campus will operate with greater than 200 megawatts of capacity. As this transaction closed in the fourth quarter, it is not included in our supplemental. With this new market, our total data center capacity rises to in excess of 1.1 gigawatts, an increase of over 20%. Turning to asset life cycle management. Total ALM revenue in the quarter was $102 million, an increase of $61 million or 145% year-on-year. On an organic basis, our ALM team delivered strong double-digit growth, which was driven by data center decommissioning and expansion in our enterprise business. Regency Technologies performed very well this quarter with revenue of $36 million. Leveraging Regency's capabilities, capturing synergies related to the deal and improved efficiencies in our data center decommissioning resulted in considerable improvement in ALM profitability. Our focus on cross selling is delivering great results. For example, over 95% of our ALM bookings this quarter were cross sell wins. Regarding the ALM acquisitions that Bill referenced, we closed APCD in August, and it contributed $3 million to revenue. We closed Wisetek in late September, so we had no income statement contribution in the quarter from that acquisition. Turning to capital allocation. We remain committed to our strategy, that is balanced between funding our growth initiatives, while delivering meaningful returns to our shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $415 million, with $373 million of growth and $41 million of recurring. Turning to the balance sheet. With strong EBITDA performance, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.0 times, which is again the lowest level we have achieved since prior to the company's REIT conversion in 2014. For me, a highlight in the quarter was the significant improvement in our cash cycle, with the third quarter having the best performance in that metric in over a decade. Our team drove days sales outstanding down by over five days from the third quarter of last year. Also, we improved days payable by two days. Turning to our dividend. Our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.715 per share to be paid in early January. And now turning to our projections. For the full year, we are on track to achieve the high end of our guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue of approximately $1.6 billion, adjusted EBITDA of approximately $595 million, AFFO of approximately $358 million and AFFO per share of approximately $1.21. In conclusion, our third quarter results represent another milestone on our growth plan. We operate in very large categories, with a total addressable market in excess of $150 billion annually and growing. Iron Mountain has long-standing relationships with nearly 250,000 clients, many measured in decades of duration. And in the vast majority of those relationships, we are only penetrated with a small fraction of our total product offering. We are driving value for our customers, and we are highly focused on cross selling and expanding market share across our businesses. I would like to thank all of my fellow Mountaineers for their efforts to serve our clients and grow our company. And with that, operator, would you please open the line for Q&A. And George, it's Barry. I would say from a pricing standpoint, we continue to see -- expect it to trend as I've been discussing throughout the year. It was up some on a year-year basis and trending. However, the spreads between new and second hand of the year have been a little bit variable based on the specific component. So with memory, for example, being a little wider than normal and some of those others being a little tighter. As I've said before, we're not really predicating our guidance on a really meaningful increase in component pricing. And just to give you a perspective on this, our total ALM business was $102 million of revenue, almost $103 million actually in the quarter. As I mentioned, Regency was $36 million, and then we had about $3 million from APCD, which means our organic revenue in the quarter on ALM was about $64 million, and that compares to last year at $42 million. So we are -- to Bill's point, the volume is driving a lot of increase. And with that volume, together with the synergies from our Regency deal, we're seeing the ALM profitability to be up a lot. So we're very pleased with the way our ALM business is trending, George. Hi, Jon. It's Barry. You are correct that in light of the strong growth we continue to see in leasing, we will be continuing to invest significantly in data center growth capital. And in fact, we'll probably be somewhere in the vicinity of a couple of hundred million dollars more growth capital than we were previously expecting earlier in the year in light of the signings. And as you probably saw in our supplemental, we are advancing pretty heavily in some of the construction of all the pre-leased assets. As I've said before, important note is nearly everything that we have under construction is already pre-leased on very, very favorable terms. So our total guidance for capital this year is probably approaching $1.8 billion and with about approaching $150 million of that being recurring. The vast, vast majority of the growth is for data center. And I think you should probably expect something of that order or so going forward in light of the signings that we've had and the amount of capacity we'll be bringing online under those pre-leased agreements. Thank you. Sure. Well, the only other color I suppose I would provide is, you would see in the supplemental that we did commence into revenue generating and finished construction, if you will, on quite a few megawatts. But the vast majority of that was right at the end of the quarter. So it really contributed almost very de minimis amount of revenue to the headline results. And so that's one of the reasons why we have a high degree of visibility to something in the neighborhood of probably $20 million plus or more of incremental data center revenue in the fourth quarter versus the third. That incidentally is up from our prior guidance, so reflecting the fact that our team is doing a great job with keeping construction on budget and on time. And as you would see in the supplemental, we've got quite a few commencements coming over the next couple, three, four quarters. So you should be anticipating ramping levels of data center revenue from us going forward. And I'll just point out that, as we said before, the returns we've been writing have been improving. Pricing, obviously, in data center has been getting better for quite some time now. And so that's one of the reasons why you're seeing the margins step up sequentially, and we expect that trend to continue. So we feel quite good about where we are. Next question? Sure. Hi, Nate. As you would see in the supplemental, we continue to expand our total physical volume in the quarter and we expect that trend to continue certainly in the fourth quarter and going into next year. The team is doing a great job capturing market share and growing our physical volume. Pricing, revenue management, we were clearly focused, as I mentioned, on driving value for our clients and with that value. And I think we're really on provider that can serve clients, especially our larger clients in the ways that we do. And we're offering new offerings that make the value that much higher, things like Smartstore, Image on Demand, our DXP platform among numerous other offerings that drive value for clients. So you would see that the total revenue in global RIM on the storage side was up a little over 7% organic in the quarter, and that was very much in line, in fact, a little bit ahead of what we were expecting as the team continues to do very well driving that value. Thank you. And I would say you mentioned about for next year. Our long-term outlook continues to be that our physical volume will be flattish to slightly up. I see no reason why, at this point, that would be any different next year. And similarly, I think as long as we're continuing to drive value for clients as we are, you should be anticipating our revenue management opportunities to be of the same order that we've been speaking about for some time, which is that mid to upper-single digit. Thank you. Hi, Kevin, so good morning. Really appreciate the question. Appreciate the kind words. I would say, we have been saying all year long that what our year guidance was, and we've just taken it to the high end. And frankly, if you work through the guide, you'd find that we're probably going to be a little bit above the high end for revenue and EBITDA based on our fourth quarter projection. And then AFFO and AFFO per share kind of works out to right at the high end of the guidance. Of course, you are right, FX has been a headwind to us all year, probably at least as much of a headwind in the fourth quarter as it was in the third quarter in light of the dollar strength. And I know that it may sound a little bit -- just getting into the weeds, but that may sound a little counter to what you expect when you look at, say, the pound and the euro. But don't forget, we have a fair amount of exposure in Latin America. We've got a great business there. And incidentally, our Latin America business is doing phenomenally well, really growing bookings in our digital business, taking off dramatically in LatAm. But with that, we are exposed to the Argentine peso, the Chilean currencies or the Brazilian real. And so all of those you would see have had a really tough go versus the dollar. So that's disproportionately impacting our revenue and our EBITDA. But look, we feel really good about where we are and our outlook is very favorable. And as we said before, we are running well ahead of our long-term target for a CAGR of 10% that we issued at Investor Day. We're probably running 200 basis points, 300 basis points or more above that for the first few years of that target, and we continue to expect to be at or above those levels and driving considerable profitability. And that is based on -- our growth portfolio that Bill spoke about, we expect that growth portfolio to continue to grow it in excess of 20% for a long period of time. That's ALM, digital and data center, coupled together with the strength of our global RIM business. Next question? I think, Eric, the top line target that we provided for the whole company was 10%, and we're obviously running, as I mentioned earlier, a couple of hundred -- 200 basis points, 300 basis points ahead of that. I think our growth portfolio continues to outperform and our global RIM business, also is considerably ahead of where our projections were at that time in the scenario that you're referring to. I'd just underscore, ALM is a really big category. And the TAM there is immense. We're already one of the, if not, the largest player. And I think both from an organic and inorganic standpoint, we can become the market leader in that space. And you saw us doing that both on the organic side as well as with a couple of recent complementary deal. So we feel quite good about ALM. It is very much on track with our strategy for cross selling and driving more value for our clients. Next question, please. Hi, Brendan. Good morning. We didn't really disclose financial terms on these couple of smaller deals, but I will tell you that, combined, they probably represent in the vicinity of $75 million, $80 million run rate revenue and they -- Wisetek is based in Ireland that has decent sized operations as Bill was mentioning both in Europe as well as U.S. and a little bit in Asia. APCD, as I mentioned, is based in Australia. And the thing about Australia is that's a large data center market, as I know you know, because you follow the data center industry so well. So that is an underpenetrated opportunity for us, both in terms of enterprise as well as decommissioning. And so we feel very good about these opportunities.

I think all of these create more scale, more capability and more reach for us to serve our global client base much more effectively. And as you mentioned, are we open to larger deals?

So you're thinking like $100 million revenue or less. And so, I don't think you should anticipate anything large in that space. And -- but frankly, we're doing quite well on the organic side, and we're very happy to welcome the team from Wisetek and APCD to our company. So thank you for the questions."

            "name": "William Meaney",
            "content": "Thank you, Gillian, and thank you all for taking time to join us today to discuss our third quarter results. We delivered another excellent quarter, with record results across all financial metrics of revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. This is a direct result of the portfolio based momentum we have built, which will continue to deliver sustained double-digit growth. During the quarter, we achieved our highest ever quarterly revenue of $1.6 billion, up 12% from the prior year. We also set a new adjusted EBITDA record of $568 million, up 14%. In addition, AFFO per share on a normalized basis was $1.12, up 10% compared to the prior year. Given our strong performance year-to-date, we are now on track to achieve the high end of our full year 2024 guidance range. I'll now turn to an update of our key achievements during the quarter, which are grounded in the following strategic priorities: driving continued revenue growth in our physical storage records management business; delivering differentiated digital solutions, which give truly transformative results to our customers in terms of revenue, cost and cybersecurity; providing asset life cycle management capabilities, which are both economic and environmentally sustainable; and supplying differentiated data center offerings through our global scale and customer trust. Now let me highlight some important wins from the quarter that showcase how we demonstrate the power of our platform. Let's begin with our Records and Information Management business. In Australia, a large government department was looking for a partner that could provide a number of services. We earned their trust and signed a seven year contract delivering storage, digital solutions and asset life cycle management services. Turning to our digital solutions business. This quarter, we launched our InSight Digital Experience, or DXP, a SaaS based platform. DXP allows customers to automate the generation of metadata as well as having the ability to access, manage, govern and monetize physical and digital information. We launched this enhanced platform on August 1, and we have already booked 24 recurring revenue deals. I'll speak to two existing customer wins where we cross sold our DXP offering. Let's start with the customer in Mexico. Due to new requirements in the country for all pension information to be digitized, a longstanding customer turned to Iron Mountain to swiftly gain compliance. We have secured a DXP contract with this large financial services company to sort, digitize and manage their pension records over the next 12 months, comprising more than 50 million images. Secondly, in the U.S., a large healthcare company that has an existing records management and ALM customer will leverage our DXP platform to manage a complex set of multi-format records. By digitizing and migrating this data into our DXP platform, our customer will be able to manage their records more effectively, including the elimination of ineligible claims. This is an example, how the power of our DXP platform drives value for our customers and our unique ability to support their physical and digital information management needs. Turning to our asset life cycle management business. We are pleased with the progress we are making to expand our capabilities and geographic footprint. In Australia, a telecommunications provider needed services for the secured destruction and disposal of e-waste and IT assets. Given our nationwide scale, this customer determined that we are the right partner by handling a high volume of IT hardware efficiently. As a result, Iron Mountain was awarded a recurring contract for these services. In the U.S., our expanded footprint and capabilities following our acquisition of Regency Technologies has resulted in a significant ALM contract with a global technology company. Under this agreement, we will be managing all IT asset disposition services for our customers' U.S. operations, in addition to the records management services that we already provide. The strength of our logistics capabilities was a major factor in winning this contract. Consistent with our strategy to significantly grow our presence in the large and fragmented enterprise asset life cycle management space, we are pleased to announce the acquisition of Wisetek, an end-to-end IT asset disposition company, which will provide us with an expanded footprint across Europe and the United States. We also completed the acquisition of APCD, a leading Australian IT asset disposition specialist. These acquisitions will enable us to continue to expand our reach across a number of categories. Turning to our data center business. I would like to share two examples that demonstrate the continued demand for capacity at our campuses across the world. In Virginia, our team won a second 2 megawatt deal with a global technology company, building on a similar deal with this customer at our data center in Pennsylvania earlier this year. In Arizona, we are supporting a global fintech provider to migrate from an internal data center in a 1.5 megawatt deal with scope for further expansion. Our compliance program was a deciding factor for this highly regulated customer. The leasing achieved in the first three quarters brings us to 106 megawatts compared to the increased guidance for the year of 130 megawatts. To conclude, I'll leave you with three key takeaways. Our strategy is built on the strength of our portfolio of growth businesses, including digital solutions, data center and asset life cycle management, each growing at a CAGR of 20% plus. This coupled with the mid to high-single digit growth of our records management business will continue to deliver consolidated growth in excess of 10% for years to come. This growth is sustained and resilient given it is based upon a portfolio of products and services that meet the current and future needs of our customer base of nearly 250,000 customers, including 95% of the Fortune 1000. And the cornerstone of this strategy is our company's DNA of placing our customers' needs and well-being at the heart of how we serve them. This is all thanks to our dedicated team of Mountaineers. With that, I'll turn it over to Barry to provide more details on our financial results and outlook. Good morning, George. Thanks for the question. Let me talk about the overall trends. And Barry, I'll ask to comment a little bit on the pricing trends. So as you, I think, alluded to, is that we see good growth or very strong growth coming out of the data center decommissioning (ph), especially where a lot of the hyperscalers are renewing their equipment to take advantage of the latest GPU. So we continue to see strength in that trend. But that's not to ignore the strength in the growth, the volumetric trends that we see also in the enterprise side. But you're right to assume that we see good growth in the hyperscale segment due to the refresh of some of their equipment to take advantage of AI. Yeah. Thanks, Shlomo for the question. So there's a few pieces in there. So let me start, first of all, about the signing this quarter, the 9 megawatts. And as you alluded to, and I think we said in the last call, there was some that kind of we expected in Q3 last time that landed in Q2. We still feel very good with the pipeline that we have to land at 130 megawatts or maybe a little bit better for the year because of lumpiness of some of these large hyperscale contracts that you mentioned. But we're really pleased with the -- these two contracts that we signed or the two that I mentioned on the call, for instance, because these are more co-lo (ph), which obviously attract very high margins. So we feel really good about the overall guidance for the year. I think in terms of the revenue growth and the pickup that you mentioned is the commencements are actually driving this. So we actually see an acceleration of revenue growth, both year-over-year and sequentially as we head into the fourth quarter, which is really going to set us up well as we get the momentum to continue to carry this strong double-digit or in center case, north of 20% CAGR in the growth of that business as we go into 2025. And that's reinforced by the fact that we announced it since the close of the quarter, but in Q4, we've already purchased more land to build out a campus in Richmond, Virginia that Barry mentioned in his remarks. So we feel really good about the setup as we go into 2025. The fourth quarter will be very strong. And I don't know, Barry, if you want to add anything. Thanks, Nate. Let me start with the Richmond land. Yes, that is power provided. And as we said, that will be north of 200 megawatts of critical IT load, so we're really pleased with that expansion. And I'll let Barry talk about the RIM volume and pricing. Thanks, Andrew. I appreciate the question. So first of all, it's 24, but who's counting, but just -- first of all, we don't do anything for free. So these are -- when I say highly profitable, these are the typical kind of double-digit service contracts that you're used to watching us. Think of these things, depending on the length of the contract, depending on how much productivity we build in during the length of the contract, but think of them somewhere between 20% and 40% gross margin contracts. The nice thing about these with the DXP platform, not only are we tracking those contracts, I mean, you've been watching the company for a long time, when we start off our digital business is that we were doing relatively little in the area of workflow, much more feeding their data links by the digitization of physical documents. This DXP platform, not only part of it is -- there is a digitization part. But more importantly, when I'm talking about the 20% to 40% margin, depending on the length of the contract, and how much productivity we can build during that course is lots of times, it's taking in data that's completely digital, it's foreign digitally. And we're putting that into our SaaS platform, creating metadata automatically and putting workflow around that. So I think I highlighted the savings bond example. Recently, that was the precursor to DXP, where we took 2 billion microfiche images of historical savings bonds where they couldn't find the owners. And 96% of them we were able to process with the precursor of DXP, which we called InSight and without a person in the loop and identify the owner. So it's that kind of power in this platform. And of course, we've taken it the next step further, and it's a fully SaaS-based platform. But we like the profitability of this business. We really like the growth of the business. And generally, I think you know me well enough. I don't do anything for free. Let me -- thanks, Eric. I appreciate the question. So I think, yes, we still very much have line of sight to the targets that we set out on Investor Day. Now obviously, that's a combination of organic growth. And as Barry pointed out, we had very, very strong organic growth this quarter. We continue \u2013 although, it was up over 50% this quarter, we continue to guide that we can maintain over 20% growth because there's obviously some fluctuation in the pricing of components over time, and we saw that 1.5 years or 2 years ago. But if you look at the volumetric trends that we see in that business, whether it be on enterprise, whether it be on hyperscale data centers or even enterprise data centers decommissioned is the amount of volume because people have a different need as they refresh their equipment than maybe they had 10 years ago, both environmentally and from a security standpoint. We see the volumetric trends. So that's a really strong double-digit growth business. And in addition, we \u2013 like, the acquisitions we highlighted that we did in Q3, we see that there's a number of these acquisitions that we'll continue to build. So we feel really good about the targets that we outlined on Investor Day. I don't know, Barry, if you want to add anything. Thanks, Brendan for the question. So let me -- I'll talk a little bit about the categories and geographies they bring. So Wisetek really helps us expand our portfolio, primarily, in Europe and North America. So they have good presence in both markets. In addition, they also bring strong customer relationships, both on the enterprise, but also we picked up a new hyperscale customer the acquisition of Wisetek, which was great. This is a customer that we have a relationship in some of our other businesses already. But having -- picking up the hyperscale relationship on the ALM side, in addition through the Wisetek acquisition was really great. I think also, obviously, the acquisition we did in Australia does build out our capabilities in Australia, which has always been a strong and important market for Iron Mountain, but it allows us to actually broaden our portfolio of services for our customers there. I don't know, Barry, if you want to talk a little bit more about..."

We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Barry Hytinen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we'll open up the lines for Q&A. Today's earnings materials contain forward-looking statements including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's earnings materials, the Safe Harbor Language on Slide 2, and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliations to these measures in our supplemental financial information. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.\nWilliam Meaney : Thank you, Gillian, and thank you all for taking the time to join us today for our discussion of our second quarter results. As you saw in this morning's announcement, this quarter delivered another record financial performance and exceeded our expectations. Reflecting on these results, I am incredibly proud of how our team consistently executes at a high level, putting our customers at the center of everything we do. With our proven growth strategy, we are entering the back half of the year with strong momentum. We continue to see firsthand the power of Project Matterhorn from our commercial teams, who are successfully leveraging our full suite of products and solutions to help position Iron Mountain as an ideal partner to our customers. This customer centricity continues to power our results forward for both customers and our shareholders. Building on our track record of value creation for our shareholders and our strong positive outlook, our Board of Directors has authorized an increase of our quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.715 in-line with our AFFO per share growth. I'll now turn to key developments during the quarter and how we executed on our growth strategy, which is aligned to our business segments. As a reminder, our strategic priorities are the following. Driving continued revenue growth in our physical storage records management business, providing digitally enabled solutions for our 240,000 customers, which allows them to get true competitive advantage out of their physical and digital information, delivering differentiated data center offerings and offering top-tier growth through our global scale and customer trust, and advancing our asset lifecycle management services which provide security, maximum efficiency, and an environmentally sound lifecycle management approach for our customers' IT assets. To give you some examples of how we have recently applied our services on behalf of our customers, let's begin with our records management business. The first win I wish to highlight shows how our scalable solutions can solve for complex regulatory requirements and address changing customer needs. A European-based pharmaceutical company came to us in need of a global record retention schedule, as the company was struggling to manage costs and meet regulatory requirements. As part of our expanding partnership, we are providing a fully managed suite of solutions, including policy center [upkeep] (ph), advisory services, and a dedicated help desk for queries in a scalable and flexible way that can seamlessly adapt over time as their needs evolve. Continuing with wins in our records management business, I am particularly excited to discuss a couple of digital wins. The first example to highlight is a major contract signed with a large financial institution. The foundation of this win was based upon multiple decades of a trusted relationship with the bank's understanding of our truly differentiated approach to digitally managing and automating workflow. As a result, they selected Iron Mountain to serve as its partner for a long-term transformation of its management of digital and physical documents. On the bank's behalf, Iron Mountain is transforming how it captures both digital and physical documents and their associated metadata across all lines of business, including non-banking internal documents like finance and HR. Our unique offering revolutionizes document processing services for both physical and digital documents. We have achieved this by employing our proprietary leading edge, AI powered intelligent document processing built into our InSight platform. Continuing with our digital business in Australia we have secured a large deal with one of the country's biggest banks to provide our Digital Mailroom solution, which brings together our operational scale and digital capabilities. Iron Mountain has been a trusted records management partner for over 20 years, and we built on that relationship to develop a comprehensive service offering that will see us manage their physical Mailroom sites across Australia and scan around 32 million images a year, as we process mortgage documents, checks, vouchers, and other banking documents. Our proven implementation methodology reassured the customer that we could execute a seamless transition of services and the innovative technology we are deploying will help them to realize significant efficiencies in the years ahead. Moving to our data center business, through the first half of the year, we leased 97 megawatts, which includes 66 megawatts this quarter. Due to our strong pipeline, we feel confident we will exceed our original projection and now expect to lease 130 megawatts for the year. The speed of leasing in the first half of the year is thanks to the momentum that our team has built in our leasing pipeline. We are an attractive partner to customers looking for infrastructure, which can support their very dense IT workloads and associated with their AI enabled services. Here are some examples of wins during the quarter from our US and UK markets. At our Western Pennsylvania location, we welcomed a new hyperscale customer with a seven-year contract. Since signing the contract, the customer is already in discussions about potential expansion to some of our other campuses. A good example of our continued and growing partnerships with some of the largest hyperscalers, our recent wins this quarter with a single customer in both the US and UK markets. This customer has placed a 10-year contract for us with us for almost 25 megawatts of capacity at our London data center campus and a 15-year contract for 36 megawatts at our data center campus in Phoenix, Arizona. Also at our Phoenix campus, we have won a 10-year co-location contract with one of Japan's largest banks. We will be providing 800 kilowatts of capacity to support the complete transformation of this customer's North American IT platform. Turning to our asset lifecycle management business, we continue to see established Iron Mountain customers seek new solutions from our ever-expanding portfolio. A perfect example of this is how we expanded a relationship with an insurance company that has been an Iron Mountain customer since the late 1950s. Having secured a small ALM project with them last year, our customers confidence in our capabilities and our delivery record has led them to make us their sole ALM provider. Finally, I'd like to share a last example of a customer that has added our ALM services to the Iron Mountain Solutions from which they already benefit. This global cloud-based software company has asked us to manage an ALM program to securely destroy, remarket or recycle data center assets at more than 30 locations in North America, EMEA, Latin America, and the Asian Pacific regions. Demonstrating we can provide a full service global ALM offering is no small task, but our skilled and dedicated teams successfully met the challenge. We are now a proud ALM partner for this customer, alongside the records management and digital solutions that we already provide. To conclude, we have thoughtfully and strategically curated a mountain range of best-in-class solutions and an effective operating model under Project Matterhorn. This quarter's successes are a brief testament to the value our strategy is already delivering and a window into the future we are building at Iron Mountain. As we continue to expand our footprint of storage and services and deliver tailored, innovative solutions for each of our customers, I could not be more grateful for the hard work of our Mountaineers. Our strategy and execution is showing the way in delivering consistently strong revenue growth in the resulting financial model that delivers top tier growth in both our AFFO and our dividend. We have an energized team of experienced, proven operators who are committed to excellence, and that gives us great confidence in our future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry.\nBarry Hytinen : Thanks, Bill, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our results. I'll begin by providing an overview of our second quarter results, and then go into more detail on each of our business segments before turning to our outlook for the third quarter, the full year. In the second quarter, our team achieved strong performance across all of our key financial metrics. We achieved record revenue of $1.534 billion, up 13% on a recorded basis driven by 11% storage growth and 17% service growth. We delivered 10% organic revenue growth. Revenue was ahead of the expectations we shared on our last call by more than $30 million. Total storage revenue was $920 million up $89 million year-on-year. Storage growth was driven by revenue management and continued strong commencements in our data center business. Total service revenue was $615 million up $87 million from last year, driven by strength in our asset lifecycle management and global RIM businesses. Adjusted EBITDA was $544 million a new record, up 14% year-on-year, driven by strong growth in global RIM, as well as data center and asset lifecycle management. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.5% up 50 basis points year-on-year, which reflects improved margins across our business. AFFO was $321 million or $1.08 on a per share basis, up $34 million and $0.10 respectively from the second quarter of last year. This represents growth of 12% for AFFO and 10% for AFFO per share. This is ahead of the guidance we provided for the second quarter, driven by higher adjusted EBITDA, as well as lower than expected cash taxes, which is included in our guidance for the third quarter. The strength of the US dollar continued to be a headwind in the quarter. On a constant currency basis, revenue was up 14% and AFFO was up 13%. Now turning to segment performance. I'll start with our global RIM business, which achieved revenue of $1.25 billion, an increase of $91 million year-on-year with strong organic revenue growth of 7.9%. Revenue management and positive volume trends drove organic storage rental growth of 7.7%. Our team delivered organic service revenue up 8.3%. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $549 million, an increase of $50 million year-on-year. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA margin was up 40 basis points sequentially and 90 basis points from last year driven by storage growth and continued productivity across our operations. Turning to Global Data Center, the team delivered revenue of $153 million, an increase of $35 million year-on-year. From a total revenue perspective, we achieved 24% organic growth. Organic Storage Rental revenue growth was particularly strong at 27% driven by commencements and improved pricing. GAAP mark-to-market in the second quarter was 12.3% and was benefited by a single relatively large renewal. We continue to expect mark-to-market to be up mid-to-high single digit in the second half. Data center adjusted EBITDA was $66 million representing 23% growth. Turning to new and expansion leasing, we signed 66 megawatts in the quarter, bringing total bookings for the first half to 97 megawatts. As Bill mentioned, with our strong leasing and favorable outlook, we are increasing our full-year projection to 130 megawatts. The data center market continues to develop rapidly, and with our strong and expanding hyperscale relationships, our pipeline continues to grow. I am pleased to report that we have increased our land bank by 57 megawatts. With those additions, our total data center capacity can now be built out to 918 megawatts over time with 347 megawatts held for development. Turning to Asset Lifecycle Management. Total ALM revenue in the quarter was $90 million, an increase of 111% year-on-year and 30% on an organic basis driven by both improved volume and pricing. ALM continues to be a key beneficiary of cross-selling with over 95% of our bookings this quarter happening as a result of that initiative. The team at Regency Technologies continues to deliver results ahead of our plan with revenue of $35 million in the quarter. We have seen our combination with Regency result in expanded client relationships and improved profitability. Turning to capital allocation, we remain focused on a disciplined approach to fund our growth initiatives and drive meaningful shareholder returns, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $399 million with $360 million of growth and $37 million of recurring. Turning to the balance sheet. With strong EBITDA performance, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.0 times, which is the lowest level we have achieved since prior to the company's REIT conversion in 2014. Turning to our dividend. On a trailing four-quarter basis, our payout ratio is now 60%. Consistent with our target payout range and reflecting our positive outlook, we have increased our dividend 10%. Now turning to our projections. For the full year, we now expect to deliver results towards the high end of our guidance range on all metrics. For the third quarter, we expect revenue of approximately $1.55 billion, adjusted EBITDA of approximately $560 million, AFFO of approximately $325 million, and AFFO per share of approximately $1.10. In conclusion, our team delivered record results in the first half. We continue to perform ahead of our long-term growth objectives, and our outlook is strong. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all of our Mountaineers for their continued efforts to deliver on behalf of our customers. And with that operator, would you please open the line for Q&A?\nOperator: Absolutely. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Tong: All right, thanks. Good morning. Your ALM business saw 30% organic revenue growth in the quarter. Can you discuss how much of the growth came from volumes versus pricing and what assumptions for component prices you're baking into your guidance.\nWilliam Meaney: Thanks, George, and good morning. Let me handle the first part, and then I'll let Barry talk a little bit more about the pricing trends that we're seeing. So first, we're really pleased with the growth, in the organic growth that you highlighted in our ALM business this quarter. And you think about that, about two-thirds of that is driven by just pure volume. And the other third is the price improvement that we've seen from the record lows that were 12 months, 18 months ago. So we're really pleased with the progress. But I'd say most of the growth is from volume.\nBarry Hytinen: And, George, from a standpoint of what we're seeing in our view for pricing going forward is, as you'd know pricing continues to be expected to trend higher. We've been somewhat conservative with respect to our outlook for pricing because we've seen some variation between the spreads between new gear and secondary gear, particularly so on memory. It's widened some, but frankly, it's narrowed those spreads on other gear like drives. So, you know, look it's a very positive outlook for our ALM business because the team continues to win a lot of business. The cross-selling activity we have is immense. And we are expecting, if you work through the guidance we just gave for the third quarter and implied for the fourth, you should be expecting our ALM business to be comping organically in the 40s in the back half, if not higher. So we're feeling really good and I guess I should just call out, since you asked about ALM, our Regency business is doing phenomenal. The team there continues to execute very, very well. We are seeing very strong productivity as a result of leveraging Regency\u2019s capabilities and their utilization is going up, thanks to historic Iron Mountain business that's being processed by regency. So thank you, George.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Kevin McVeigh, UBS. Please go ahead.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. Congratulations on the record results. Yes. I don't know if it is for Barry or -- can you reconcile kind of the two quarters of beat relative to the reaffirmed guidance and just the optimism that it seems like it is scaling on the ALM side. Just puts and takes around that.\nBarry Hytinen: Yes. Kevin. Good morning. We continue to feel very good, as we just noted about our guidance, and as you know, we beat in the first quarter, and we beat again here in the second quarter, actually a wider beat than the first. And our thought process is that things continue to trend very much in the right direction. That's why we pointed to the higher end of our guidance range for the year. I will note FX continues to be a headwind, so you will see the stronger dollar be an impact to our reported results in the third quarter probably of the order of the same magnitude as the second quarter, if not a little bit more. But what you are seeing is, improving trends as compared to our initial outlook this year across the business. Global RIM continues to perform really well in the organic storage rental revenue growth accelerated in the quarter, as we expected it to and as we forecasted last quarter, and we continue to expect that to be in the 7% to 8% range in the back half. And then in terms of data center, as we talked about before, that's a business that has a tremendous amount of visibility in the near-term. And as we talked about the outlook for the long term, there is very robust in light of the leasing activity we've had. And I just mentioned ALM with George. So I appreciate the question.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Nate Crossett of BNP. Please go ahead.\nNate Crossett: Hi, good morning. Just wondering what you are expecting in terms of overall RIM volumes for 3Q in the balance of the year? And then can you -- I guess, you already talked about your expectations for pricing growth. So should we assume that the organic revenue growth is 7% to 8% in the back half?\nBarry Hytinen: Hi, Nate, it's Barry. Consistent with our outlook for the last many quarters, we continue to expect our physical volume to be flattish to slightly up. And it continued that trend obviously, in the second quarter, and we have a favorable outlook for it again to be in that vicinity in the third and in the fourth quarter. So we expect our volumes to be continuing to rise. I'll just note we have never stored more physical volumes than we are storing today. And so that is, I think, a testament to the team's diligence, as it relates to serving our customers. And frankly, the value we are driving for customers, as they continue to trust us with their important assets. In terms of organic growth in RIM on the storage side, you\u2019ve got it right. So the volume would be a relatively small component of the growth and then the rest would be driven principally by revenue management. And I\u2019ll note that our services business in Global RIM continues to be benefited both on the traditional side, but also and going forward likely to be ramping some on the digital side, because the team in our Digital Solutions Group just delivered the best bookings quarter we\u2019ve ever had in digital. So that is a really nice performance by our commercial and digital teams. Thanks, Nate.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAlexander Hess: This is Alex Hess on for Andrew Steinerman. I hope you are all well today. A quick question on data center CapEx. And then maybe a quick follow-up. On data center CapEx, do the assumptions that you guys made at Investor Day -- your investor event in 2022 still hold. Obviously, we're seeing notable pickup in the guided CapEx numbers from the hyperscalers. And then maybe a structural question. Has the pool of hyperscalers, are those still say, the same firms for you guys as three years or four years ago? Or is there opportunity for some of these infrastructure software and AI start-ups to also be hyperscalers in your book as well? Thank you.\nWilliam Meaney: Good morning. I'll start with your second question and then Barry will follow up on the CapEx relative to our Investor Day. So I think what you see for us, hyperscalers are always kind of not just the largest cloud providers, but the largest SaaS providers as well. So people who need very, very large deployments in terms of megawatts of data center capacity. And usually, these are global firms. So I'm not saying that we won't see some of those firms -- some of the more newer firms that you are highlighting come into that fold, but I\u2019d say, that the barriers to entry for these really very large hyperscalers just given the cost of leasing and building data centers. It is a fairly consolidated in tight group. I'm not saying that there couldn't be people that break into it, but I think for the moment, it's a pretty stable group, slightly increasing as some of the SaaS players get bigger in their own right.\nBarry Hytinen: Alex, it is Barry. I\u2019d say, a couple of thoughts about your question on the CapEx use. We are continuing to see our data center business and actually the whole business run ahead of the expectations we shared at that Investor Day. As we talked about last quarter, for the first couple of years, we were well ahead. And if you look at what we are doing here this year, we are actually accelerating that level of beat. So we are generating more revenue, more EBITDA and more cash generation. And certainly, we continue to lease more and faster than we were indicating at the time of the Investor Day. So over time, I think it\u2019s possible that we may see a continued ramp in capital for data center. But I'll just note, we are constructing to leases with some of the best quality tenants you could imagine in the hyperscalers. And I mean a couple of statistics, we are 96% leased in our operating portfolio and in our under development construction portfolio which is about 10% bigger than what we are operating, maybe even 15% bigger than we're operating, we're 96% leased on that as well on a pre-lease basis. So I will just underscore that when we are putting capital to work to build out our data center platform, it is because we have already signed contracts with clients, and we\u2019re very pleased with the level of returns that we have been generating on those deals.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question from comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nEric Luebchow: Thanks. Appreciate it. Just a follow-up on the data center conversation. I mean just based on all the opportunity you've had, the outperformance on leasing year-to-date. Maybe you could just talk about funding sources going forward. And given the fact that your stock has been so strong this year, your equity cost of capital is significantly lower than it has been in years past. Does this issuing equity enter the conversation going forward, as you look at funding the data center business? Thank you.\nWilliam Meaney: Thanks, Eric. Let me start and then Barry may want to chime in as well. So first, we feel really good about, as you are highlighting, the growth and momentum that we are building in the data center business. And just in the colo, but more and more in the hyperscale and the majority is coming from hyperscale. But as Barry said, it is -- well over 90% like around 96% is all pre-leased and it is a fully funded plan as we highlighted in Investor Day. So we don't see any -- we feel really good in terms of the way that we are able to fund the growth. And so we are happy in terms of the trajectory that we have without going out and raising equity. I think we have a plan that works.\nBarry Hytinen: Eric, I\u2019d just add that if you look going forward, likely rates are probably coming down over time. So that makes it that much easier for us. And the business is so cash generative from the core. And as you see, the [covering] (ph) business continues to deliver outstanding results. So I think from a standpoint of your point about the equity has risen a bit, that is true. But I think that's more a function of where it was. And if you look at us on a multiple versus the growth we're putting up I think that bolsters the point Bill was just making as it relates to equity. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, thank you very much. I just wanted to touch on two items, if I may. One, just on ALM, are you seeing the hyperscalers starting to really open up the inventory of gear that they had and really starting to sell it? Or are you still starting -- seeing the hesitation in case prices rise more. What I'm trying to understand is, are they starting to actually dump the stuff that they've been holding on to? And then just second, just if you can comment, Barry, on the storage gross margin had increased by 20 basis points sequentially, but the moving parts are very interesting, where you had like all other storage costs up like $10 million, but you had a rent to actually go down $2 million sequentially. Maybe you could talk about what the movements over there, how did rent go down? And what are those other storage costs that are going up?\nWilliam Meaney: Good morning. Shlomo. So I will take the question on the ALM and then Barry can talk to you a little bit about the takes in terms of storage costs. So on the ALM side, is the hyperscale is the reticence that you might have seen last year that I think we commented from the hyperscalers was less to do with the pricing on the components. It was more the availability of new kit that they had to actually refresh their data centers. And I think you've seen all the reporting from some of the largest hyperscalers in the last couple of weeks that you are all ramping up their refresh of their data centers to bring in the most capable GPUs, so that they are AI ready, and they can build up some of their AI Services. So we do see an uptick, to your point in the volume that we're getting from the hyperscalers, but it's driven more because they are refreshing their data centers to be more AI enabled and they're able to get the latest GPUs from the supplier, so they are able to accelerate some of that. So we do see a building volume from the hyperscalers right now in terms of decommissioning, which leads to more ALM volume in our business.\nBarry Hytinen: Shlomo, it is Barry. A couple of thoughts about the storage rental gross margin. First of all, we were really pleased with that at 70% and that being because really, if you look at our global RIM business, it was up very nicely year-on-year. Of course part of that revenue management, part of that is the continued productivity that our operations teams are driving. And so the reason it was slightly down year-on-year is related to, as I talked about hour, as well as data center. As we've talked about sometimes before, data center is a lower gross margin, but it is, of course accretive to our EBITDA margin. And so as data center continues to ramp at a very fast rate, it has a little bit of a level of mix. But obviously, it is very incremental. And on a sequential basis, you would expect on that all other storage costs, there to be some power inflation as commencements begin to ramp and folks start to drop out, if you know that -- that's a direct pass-through. So it can actually also affect rate. So to have the storage gross margin up sequentially in light of that headwind is we thought very favorable about that. On the storage rent expense it was down some sequentially, and that's thanks to our team's continued productivity around warehouse efficiencies. We have -- as you would have seen over the last few quarters, reduced some of our warehouses and thereby gotten to a better expense position. And the only other thing I'll mention is taking it up a level. Our gross margin in the quarter for the whole company was almost just under 56%. Now that's slightly down from last year. But two things to think about. One, we are absorbing the mix issues, including the power that I mentioned in that number. And two, we've added Regency Technologies, which is, again, a mixed headwind on gross margin, but by the way Regency performed extraordinarily well on EBITDA in the quarter. And so we feel really good about where the gross margin is trending and it\u2019s been ahead of our expectations.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Brendan Lynch with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrendan Lynch: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. It came up a little bit already. But on the pricing front, your organic constant currency growth was 7.7% for storage rentals, up quarter-to-quarter, but down relative to the 2023 pace. I think you guys have one suggested mid-single digit pricing growth which is possible over the next couple of years. But you've been at high single digits for a few years now. Is it transition to mid-single digits occurring now? And how should we think about you guys pushing price as inflation wanes?\nBarry Hytinen: Brendan, we were very pleased with the 7.7%. And I think at that level, you can see the amount of EBITDA the business generates since it is a highly productive portion of our company. And as it relates to trending, we have indicated we feel like mid-to-upper single is the right kind of level over the longer term. And so I\u2019d say, it trending in this vicinity is -- would be very positive to the business model going forward.\nWilliam Meaney: Yes. And the only thing I would add is that it isn't so much inflation-based anymore. It's really about the value that we are adding to our customers. So if you look at our traditional records management business, is we've over the last few years have added a portfolio of services such as Smart Sort, Smart Reveal, and I highlighted on the call some of the governance and compliance consulting and systems that we are able to install around their hard records management. And so we are really driving more value for our customers and the customers see value in that. So I think you can continue to expect that our pricing will remain some 300 basis points to 400 basis points ahead of what you would think is normal inflation, but it is really driven by the value that our customers see from our services.\nBarry Hytinen: Brendan, the only other thing I'll add is that at the start of the year, we had suggested Global RIM might be in the vicinity of 6%, total growth for the year. And so year-to-date, we are running 7.5% on that business. So we continue to see outperformance in Global RIM. Some of that is driven off of revenue management, also incremental service uptake of the sort that Bill just mentioned.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from Jonathan Atkin with RBC. Please go ahead.\nJon Atkin: Thanks. A couple of questions. Can you talk a little bit about ALM and to what extent Regency is sort of fully occupied? Or do you have the opportunity within that set of assets to see more productivity. And then secondly, on data centers, if there is anything to call out in terms of lead times around construction and delivery and the conversion of book-to-bill. Thank you.\nWilliam Meaney: Good morning Jon. Let me start with the data center piece and then Barry can talk about Regency and more broadly, the ALM business and operating leverage. So on the data center side, is you are right to highlight the lead times for a lot of the build components, including the concrete panels or the actual physical construction of the shelf. The good news is that we've been able to manage that and keep the lead times similar to historical norms and what our customers are expecting because as we're building scale in our data center business, we're standardizing across a lot of those components in market, right? So across some of the like Europe versus the United States, you can't standardize as much. But within Europe, you can standardize a lot. Within the United States, you can standardize a lot. India, you can standardize a lot, et cetera. So we are doing that. And what that allows us to do is as we get scale is to be much more flexible in terms of having the right equipment for the right customer in the right location. So we feel pretty good in terms of our ability to manage the supply chain and keep our timing intact?\nBarry Hytinen: Jon, this is Barry. As it relates to Regency and the opportunity to continue to utilize and optimize further, it\u2019s definitely there. There is a lot of opportunity. We have considerable capacity to expand the business, both in terms of what is already in place, as well as the opportunity to expand the footprint at relatively low CapEx, I might add. So it's a very positive situation to be having Regency get further utilized which I expected to over time. And I\u2019ll say, we have a very highly capable team at Regency that there is no doubt, can manage a much larger business and drive a tremendous amount of value for our shareholders.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Thanks for squeeze me in for one more. This is a little bit more of a technical one also. It looks like the real estate depreciation went up sequentially by like $14 million. Was there a major site that team on Board during the quarter?\nBarry Hytinen: Shlomo, you should expect the depreciation, of course to continue to ramp with all of the CapEx we've been doing on data center as well as some of our incremental new warehouses that we put in as well as some of the digital innovation that we\u2019ve been driving internally for some time now. So that is the primary driver, and it is in those that order.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session and the Iron Mountain second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. We thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our results. I'll begin by providing an overview of our second quarter results, and then go into more detail on each of our business segments before turning to our outlook for the third quarter, the full year. In the second quarter, our team achieved strong performance across all of our key financial metrics. We achieved record revenue of $1.534 billion, up 13% on a recorded basis driven by 11% storage growth and 17% service growth. We delivered 10% organic revenue growth. Revenue was ahead of the expectations we shared on our last call by more than $30 million. Total storage revenue was $920 million up $89 million year-on-year. Storage growth was driven by revenue management and continued strong commencements in our data center business. Total service revenue was $615 million up $87 million from last year, driven by strength in our asset lifecycle management and global RIM businesses. Adjusted EBITDA was $544 million a new record, up 14% year-on-year, driven by strong growth in global RIM, as well as data center and asset lifecycle management. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.5% up 50 basis points year-on-year, which reflects improved margins across our business. AFFO was $321 million or $1.08 on a per share basis, up $34 million and $0.10 respectively from the second quarter of last year. This represents growth of 12% for AFFO and 10% for AFFO per share. This is ahead of the guidance we provided for the second quarter, driven by higher adjusted EBITDA, as well as lower than expected cash taxes, which is included in our guidance for the third quarter. The strength of the US dollar continued to be a headwind in the quarter. On a constant currency basis, revenue was up 14% and AFFO was up 13%. Now turning to segment performance. I'll start with our global RIM business, which achieved revenue of $1.25 billion, an increase of $91 million year-on-year with strong organic revenue growth of 7.9%. Revenue management and positive volume trends drove organic storage rental growth of 7.7%. Our team delivered organic service revenue up 8.3%. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $549 million, an increase of $50 million year-on-year. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA margin was up 40 basis points sequentially and 90 basis points from last year driven by storage growth and continued productivity across our operations. Turning to Global Data Center, the team delivered revenue of $153 million, an increase of $35 million year-on-year. From a total revenue perspective, we achieved 24% organic growth. Organic Storage Rental revenue growth was particularly strong at 27% driven by commencements and improved pricing. GAAP mark-to-market in the second quarter was 12.3% and was benefited by a single relatively large renewal. We continue to expect mark-to-market to be up mid-to-high single digit in the second half. Data center adjusted EBITDA was $66 million representing 23% growth. Turning to new and expansion leasing, we signed 66 megawatts in the quarter, bringing total bookings for the first half to 97 megawatts. As Bill mentioned, with our strong leasing and favorable outlook, we are increasing our full-year projection to 130 megawatts. The data center market continues to develop rapidly, and with our strong and expanding hyperscale relationships, our pipeline continues to grow. I am pleased to report that we have increased our land bank by 57 megawatts. With those additions, our total data center capacity can now be built out to 918 megawatts over time with 347 megawatts held for development. Turning to Asset Lifecycle Management. Total ALM revenue in the quarter was $90 million, an increase of 111% year-on-year and 30% on an organic basis driven by both improved volume and pricing. ALM continues to be a key beneficiary of cross-selling with over 95% of our bookings this quarter happening as a result of that initiative. The team at Regency Technologies continues to deliver results ahead of our plan with revenue of $35 million in the quarter. We have seen our combination with Regency result in expanded client relationships and improved profitability. Turning to capital allocation, we remain focused on a disciplined approach to fund our growth initiatives and drive meaningful shareholder returns, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $399 million with $360 million of growth and $37 million of recurring. Turning to the balance sheet. With strong EBITDA performance, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.0 times, which is the lowest level we have achieved since prior to the company's REIT conversion in 2014. Turning to our dividend. On a trailing four-quarter basis, our payout ratio is now 60%. Consistent with our target payout range and reflecting our positive outlook, we have increased our dividend 10%. Now turning to our projections. For the full year, we now expect to deliver results towards the high end of our guidance range on all metrics. For the third quarter, we expect revenue of approximately $1.55 billion, adjusted EBITDA of approximately $560 million, AFFO of approximately $325 million, and AFFO per share of approximately $1.10. In conclusion, our team delivered record results in the first half. We continue to perform ahead of our long-term growth objectives, and our outlook is strong. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all of our Mountaineers for their continued efforts to deliver on behalf of our customers. And with that operator, would you please open the line for Q&A? And, George, from a standpoint of what we're seeing in our view for pricing going forward is, as you'd know pricing continues to be expected to trend higher. We've been somewhat conservative with respect to our outlook for pricing because we've seen some variation between the spreads between new gear and secondary gear, particularly so on memory. It's widened some, but frankly, it's narrowed those spreads on other gear like drives. So, you know, look it's a very positive outlook for our ALM business because the team continues to win a lot of business. The cross-selling activity we have is immense. And we are expecting, if you work through the guidance we just gave for the third quarter and implied for the fourth, you should be expecting our ALM business to be comping organically in the 40s in the back half, if not higher. So we're feeling really good and I guess I should just call out, since you asked about ALM, our Regency business is doing phenomenal. The team there continues to execute very, very well. We are seeing very strong productivity as a result of leveraging Regency's capabilities and their utilization is going up, thanks to historic Iron Mountain business that's being processed by regency. So thank you, George. Yes. Kevin. Good morning. We continue to feel very good, as we just noted about our guidance, and as you know, we beat in the first quarter, and we beat again here in the second quarter, actually a wider beat than the first. And our thought process is that things continue to trend very much in the right direction. That's why we pointed to the higher end of our guidance range for the year. I will note FX continues to be a headwind, so you will see the stronger dollar be an impact to our reported results in the third quarter probably of the order of the same magnitude as the second quarter, if not a little bit more. But what you are seeing is, improving trends as compared to our initial outlook this year across the business. Global RIM continues to perform really well in the organic storage rental revenue growth accelerated in the quarter, as we expected it to and as we forecasted last quarter, and we continue to expect that to be in the 7% to 8% range in the back half. And then in terms of data center, as we talked about before, that's a business that has a tremendous amount of visibility in the near-term. And as we talked about the outlook for the long term, there is very robust in light of the leasing activity we've had. And I just mentioned ALM with George. So I appreciate the question. Hi, Nate, it's Barry. Consistent with our outlook for the last many quarters, we continue to expect our physical volume to be flattish to slightly up. And it continued that trend obviously, in the second quarter, and we have a favorable outlook for it again to be in that vicinity in the third and in the fourth quarter. So we expect our volumes to be continuing to rise. I'll just note we have never stored more physical volumes than we are storing today. And so that is, I think, a testament to the team's diligence, as it relates to serving our customers. And frankly, the value we are driving for customers, as they continue to trust us with their important assets. In terms of organic growth in RIM on the storage side, you've got it right. So the volume would be a relatively small component of the growth and then the rest would be driven principally by revenue management. And I'll note that our services business in Global RIM continues to be benefited both on the traditional side, but also and going forward likely to be ramping some on the digital side, because the team in our Digital Solutions Group just delivered the best bookings quarter we've ever had in digital. So that is a really nice performance by our commercial and digital teams. Thanks, Nate. Alex, it is Barry. I'd say, a couple of thoughts about your question on the CapEx use. We are continuing to see our data center business and actually the whole business run ahead of the expectations we shared at that Investor Day. As we talked about last quarter, for the first couple of years, we were well ahead. And if you look at what we are doing here this year, we are actually accelerating that level of beat. So we are generating more revenue, more EBITDA and more cash generation. And certainly, we continue to lease more and faster than we were indicating at the time of the Investor Day. So over time, I think it's possible that we may see a continued ramp in capital for data center. But I'll just note, we are constructing to leases with some of the best quality tenants you could imagine in the hyperscalers. And I mean a couple of statistics, we are 96% leased in our operating portfolio and in our under development construction portfolio which is about 10% bigger than what we are operating, maybe even 15% bigger than we're operating, we're 96% leased on that as well on a pre-lease basis. So I will just underscore that when we are putting capital to work to build out our data center platform, it is because we have already signed contracts with clients, and we're very pleased with the level of returns that we have been generating on those deals. Eric, I'd just add that if you look going forward, likely rates are probably coming down over time. So that makes it that much easier for us. And the business is so cash generative from the core. And as you see, the [covering] (ph) business continues to deliver outstanding results. So I think from a standpoint of your point about the equity has risen a bit, that is true. But I think that's more a function of where it was. And if you look at us on a multiple versus the growth we're putting up I think that bolsters the point Bill was just making as it relates to equity. Thank you. Shlomo, it is Barry. A couple of thoughts about the storage rental gross margin. First of all, we were really pleased with that at 70% and that being because really, if you look at our global RIM business, it was up very nicely year-on-year. Of course part of that revenue management, part of that is the continued productivity that our operations teams are driving. And so the reason it was slightly down year-on-year is related to, as I talked about hour, as well as data center. As we've talked about sometimes before, data center is a lower gross margin, but it is, of course accretive to our EBITDA margin. And so as data center continues to ramp at a very fast rate, it has a little bit of a level of mix. But obviously, it is very incremental. And on a sequential basis, you would expect on that all other storage costs, there to be some power inflation as commencements begin to ramp and folks start to drop out, if you know that -- that's a direct pass-through. So it can actually also affect rate. So to have the storage gross margin up sequentially in light of that headwind is we thought very favorable about that. On the storage rent expense it was down some sequentially, and that's thanks to our team's continued productivity around warehouse efficiencies. We have -- as you would have seen over the last few quarters, reduced some of our warehouses and thereby gotten to a better expense position. And the only other thing I'll mention is taking it up a level. Our gross margin in the quarter for the whole company was almost just under 56%. Now that's slightly down from last year. But two things to think about. One, we are absorbing the mix issues, including the power that I mentioned in that number. And two, we've added Regency Technologies, which is, again, a mixed headwind on gross margin, but by the way Regency performed extraordinarily well on EBITDA in the quarter. And so we feel really good about where the gross margin is trending and it's been ahead of our expectations. Brendan, we were very pleased with the 7.7%. And I think at that level, you can see the amount of EBITDA the business generates since it is a highly productive portion of our company. And as it relates to trending, we have indicated we feel like mid-to-upper single is the right kind of level over the longer term. And so I'd say, it trending in this vicinity is -- would be very positive to the business model going forward. Brendan, the only other thing I'll add is that at the start of the year, we had suggested Global RIM might be in the vicinity of 6%, total growth for the year. And so year-to-date, we are running 7.5% on that business. So we continue to see outperformance in Global RIM. Some of that is driven off of revenue management, also incremental service uptake of the sort that Bill just mentioned. Jon, this is Barry. As it relates to Regency and the opportunity to continue to utilize and optimize further, it's definitely there. There is a lot of opportunity. We have considerable capacity to expand the business, both in terms of what is already in place, as well as the opportunity to expand the footprint at relatively low CapEx, I might add. So it's a very positive situation to be having Regency get further utilized which I expected to over time. And I'll say, we have a very highly capable team at Regency that there is no doubt, can manage a much larger business and drive a tremendous amount of value for our shareholders. Shlomo, you should expect the depreciation, of course to continue to ramp with all of the CapEx we've been doing on data center as well as some of our incremental new warehouses that we put in as well as some of the digital innovation that we've been driving internally for some time now. So that is the primary driver, and it is in those that order."

            "name": "William Meaney",
            "content": "Thank you, Gillian, and thank you all for taking the time to join us today for our discussion of our second quarter results. As you saw in this morning's announcement, this quarter delivered another record financial performance and exceeded our expectations. Reflecting on these results, I am incredibly proud of how our team consistently executes at a high level, putting our customers at the center of everything we do. With our proven growth strategy, we are entering the back half of the year with strong momentum. We continue to see firsthand the power of Project Matterhorn from our commercial teams, who are successfully leveraging our full suite of products and solutions to help position Iron Mountain as an ideal partner to our customers. This customer centricity continues to power our results forward for both customers and our shareholders. Building on our track record of value creation for our shareholders and our strong positive outlook, our Board of Directors has authorized an increase of our quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.715 in-line with our AFFO per share growth. I'll now turn to key developments during the quarter and how we executed on our growth strategy, which is aligned to our business segments. As a reminder, our strategic priorities are the following. Driving continued revenue growth in our physical storage records management business, providing digitally enabled solutions for our 240,000 customers, which allows them to get true competitive advantage out of their physical and digital information, delivering differentiated data center offerings and offering top-tier growth through our global scale and customer trust, and advancing our asset lifecycle management services which provide security, maximum efficiency, and an environmentally sound lifecycle management approach for our customers' IT assets. To give you some examples of how we have recently applied our services on behalf of our customers, let's begin with our records management business. The first win I wish to highlight shows how our scalable solutions can solve for complex regulatory requirements and address changing customer needs. A European-based pharmaceutical company came to us in need of a global record retention schedule, as the company was struggling to manage costs and meet regulatory requirements. As part of our expanding partnership, we are providing a fully managed suite of solutions, including policy center [upkeep] (ph), advisory services, and a dedicated help desk for queries in a scalable and flexible way that can seamlessly adapt over time as their needs evolve. Continuing with wins in our records management business, I am particularly excited to discuss a couple of digital wins. The first example to highlight is a major contract signed with a large financial institution. The foundation of this win was based upon multiple decades of a trusted relationship with the bank's understanding of our truly differentiated approach to digitally managing and automating workflow. As a result, they selected Iron Mountain to serve as its partner for a long-term transformation of its management of digital and physical documents. On the bank's behalf, Iron Mountain is transforming how it captures both digital and physical documents and their associated metadata across all lines of business, including non-banking internal documents like finance and HR. Our unique offering revolutionizes document processing services for both physical and digital documents. We have achieved this by employing our proprietary leading edge, AI powered intelligent document processing built into our InSight platform. Continuing with our digital business in Australia we have secured a large deal with one of the country's biggest banks to provide our Digital Mailroom solution, which brings together our operational scale and digital capabilities. Iron Mountain has been a trusted records management partner for over 20 years, and we built on that relationship to develop a comprehensive service offering that will see us manage their physical Mailroom sites across Australia and scan around 32 million images a year, as we process mortgage documents, checks, vouchers, and other banking documents. Our proven implementation methodology reassured the customer that we could execute a seamless transition of services and the innovative technology we are deploying will help them to realize significant efficiencies in the years ahead. Moving to our data center business, through the first half of the year, we leased 97 megawatts, which includes 66 megawatts this quarter. Due to our strong pipeline, we feel confident we will exceed our original projection and now expect to lease 130 megawatts for the year. The speed of leasing in the first half of the year is thanks to the momentum that our team has built in our leasing pipeline. We are an attractive partner to customers looking for infrastructure, which can support their very dense IT workloads and associated with their AI enabled services. Here are some examples of wins during the quarter from our US and UK markets. At our Western Pennsylvania location, we welcomed a new hyperscale customer with a seven-year contract. Since signing the contract, the customer is already in discussions about potential expansion to some of our other campuses. A good example of our continued and growing partnerships with some of the largest hyperscalers, our recent wins this quarter with a single customer in both the US and UK markets. This customer has placed a 10-year contract for us with us for almost 25 megawatts of capacity at our London data center campus and a 15-year contract for 36 megawatts at our data center campus in Phoenix, Arizona. Also at our Phoenix campus, we have won a 10-year co-location contract with one of Japan's largest banks. We will be providing 800 kilowatts of capacity to support the complete transformation of this customer's North American IT platform. Turning to our asset lifecycle management business, we continue to see established Iron Mountain customers seek new solutions from our ever-expanding portfolio. A perfect example of this is how we expanded a relationship with an insurance company that has been an Iron Mountain customer since the late 1950s. Having secured a small ALM project with them last year, our customers confidence in our capabilities and our delivery record has led them to make us their sole ALM provider. Finally, I'd like to share a last example of a customer that has added our ALM services to the Iron Mountain Solutions from which they already benefit. This global cloud-based software company has asked us to manage an ALM program to securely destroy, remarket or recycle data center assets at more than 30 locations in North America, EMEA, Latin America, and the Asian Pacific regions. Demonstrating we can provide a full service global ALM offering is no small task, but our skilled and dedicated teams successfully met the challenge. We are now a proud ALM partner for this customer, alongside the records management and digital solutions that we already provide. To conclude, we have thoughtfully and strategically curated a mountain range of best-in-class solutions and an effective operating model under Project Matterhorn. This quarter's successes are a brief testament to the value our strategy is already delivering and a window into the future we are building at Iron Mountain. As we continue to expand our footprint of storage and services and deliver tailored, innovative solutions for each of our customers, I could not be more grateful for the hard work of our Mountaineers. Our strategy and execution is showing the way in delivering consistently strong revenue growth in the resulting financial model that delivers top tier growth in both our AFFO and our dividend. We have an energized team of experienced, proven operators who are committed to excellence, and that gives us great confidence in our future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry. Thanks, George, and good morning. Let me handle the first part, and then I'll let Barry talk a little bit more about the pricing trends that we're seeing. So first, we're really pleased with the growth, in the organic growth that you highlighted in our ALM business this quarter. And you think about that, about two-thirds of that is driven by just pure volume. And the other third is the price improvement that we've seen from the record lows that were 12 months, 18 months ago. So we're really pleased with the progress. But I'd say most of the growth is from volume. Good morning. I'll start with your second question and then Barry will follow up on the CapEx relative to our Investor Day. So I think what you see for us, hyperscalers are always kind of not just the largest cloud providers, but the largest SaaS providers as well. So people who need very, very large deployments in terms of megawatts of data center capacity. And usually, these are global firms. So I'm not saying that we won't see some of those firms -- some of the more newer firms that you are highlighting come into that fold, but I'd say, that the barriers to entry for these really very large hyperscalers just given the cost of leasing and building data centers. It is a fairly consolidated in tight group. I'm not saying that there couldn't be people that break into it, but I think for the moment, it's a pretty stable group, slightly increasing as some of the SaaS players get bigger in their own right. Thanks, Eric. Let me start and then Barry may want to chime in as well. So first, we feel really good about, as you are highlighting, the growth and momentum that we are building in the data center business. And just in the colo, but more and more in the hyperscale and the majority is coming from hyperscale. But as Barry said, it is -- well over 90% like around 96% is all pre-leased and it is a fully funded plan as we highlighted in Investor Day. So we don't see any -- we feel really good in terms of the way that we are able to fund the growth. And so we are happy in terms of the trajectory that we have without going out and raising equity. I think we have a plan that works. Good morning. Shlomo. So I will take the question on the ALM and then Barry can talk to you a little bit about the takes in terms of storage costs. So on the ALM side, is the hyperscale is the reticence that you might have seen last year that I think we commented from the hyperscalers was less to do with the pricing on the components. It was more the availability of new kit that they had to actually refresh their data centers. And I think you've seen all the reporting from some of the largest hyperscalers in the last couple of weeks that you are all ramping up their refresh of their data centers to bring in the most capable GPUs, so that they are AI ready, and they can build up some of their AI Services. So we do see an uptick, to your point in the volume that we're getting from the hyperscalers, but it's driven more because they are refreshing their data centers to be more AI enabled and they're able to get the latest GPUs from the supplier, so they are able to accelerate some of that. So we do see a building volume from the hyperscalers right now in terms of decommissioning, which leads to more ALM volume in our business. Yes. And the only thing I would add is that it isn't so much inflation-based anymore. It's really about the value that we are adding to our customers. So if you look at our traditional records management business, is we've over the last few years have added a portfolio of services such as Smart Sort, Smart Reveal, and I highlighted on the call some of the governance and compliance consulting and systems that we are able to install around their hard records management. And so we are really driving more value for our customers and the customers see value in that. So I think you can continue to expect that our pricing will remain some 300 basis points to 400 basis points ahead of what you would think is normal inflation, but it is really driven by the value that our customers see from our services. Good morning Jon. Let me start with the data center piece and then Barry can talk about Regency and more broadly, the ALM business and operating leverage. So on the data center side, is you are right to highlight the lead times for a lot of the build components, including the concrete panels or the actual physical construction of the shelf. The good news is that we've been able to manage that and keep the lead times similar to historical norms and what our customers are expecting because as we're building scale in our data center business, we're standardizing across a lot of those components in market, right? So across some of the like Europe versus the United States, you can't standardize as much. But within Europe, you can standardize a lot. Within the United States, you can standardize a lot. India, you can standardize a lot, et cetera. So we are doing that. And what that allows us to do is as we get scale is to be much more flexible in terms of having the right equipment for the right customer in the right location. So we feel pretty good in terms of our ability to manage the supply chain and keep our timing intact?"

[Operator Instructions] Please note today's event is being recorded.\n I would now like to turn the conference over to Gillian Tiltman, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nGillian Tiltman: Thanks, Rocco. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. On today's call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Barry Hytinen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we'll open up the lines for Q&A.\n Today's earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's earnings materials, the safe harbor language on Slide 2 and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliations to these measures in our supplemental financial information.\n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. \nWilliam Meaney: Thank you, Gillian, and thank you all for taking time to join us today. We are pleased to report that our team has delivered outstanding results for the first quarter of 2024, achieving another set of all-time highs for revenue and profitability. Our continued progress is evidence of the success of Project Matterhorn and our team's commitment to delivering best-in-class solutions.\n On a reported basis, in the first quarter, we achieved our highest ever quarterly revenue of $1.48 billion, representing 12% year-over-year growth and a new first quarter adjusted EBITDA record of $519 million, delivering 13% year-over-year growth. Project Matterhorn has successfully transformed Iron Mountain into a solutions-based business with a commercial organization that offers a broad range of products and services to meet the evolving needs of our customers.\n This integrated product portfolio drives strong growth across all business areas through our integrated solutions, combining storage with truly differentiated services. Now I'd like to take you through some pivotal wins this quarter. Let's begin with records and information management.\n The strength and longevity of the relationships we have built with our 240,000 customers is leading to further opportunities to offer more solutions from our portfolio to meet our customers' needs. An excellent example of this cross-selling is in the oil and energy sector where a U.S.-headquartered customer with a presence in 75 countries initially selected Iron Mountain to securely manage its data containing geological information.\n Thanks to our expanded range of solutions and a deep understanding of the customers' needs, we are now also providing a secure IT asset disposition solution.\n Another example of our strength and ability to cross-sell and provide more solutions for our customers is in the United Arab Emirates. For the past 2 years, we have been partnering with a prominent bank to provide records management services for a growing volume of documents. With this customer's need to comply with regulations from the UAE Central Bank, we secured an agreement to extend our solutions. These now include document capture and asset life cycle management or ALM services.\n We continue to see opportunities to support government and public sector organizations with their transformations, helping them to increase efficiency and demonstrate value for money for the sources they provide to their citizens. A recent example of this is in the U.K., where we have a long-term relationship with a government agency that trust us to store approximately 18 million records. This customer awarded Iron Mountain a contract to manage documents that must be retained whilst legal proceedings are ongoing.\n Our proven ability to manage records effectively to this customer and a number of other government organizations in the U.K. demonstrates we have the skills, capabilities and experience to successfully manage sensitive projects like this.\n Turning to our digital business, a global customer that provides automation solutions has asked us to digitize its physical records in Morocco. Our InSight platform, which as you will recall, fully integrates both artificial intelligence and machine learning will enable this customer to simplify their current use of multiple information systems and content formats.\n InSight will enable them to derive greater value from their information whilst improving their compliance and driving greater operational efficiencies. The customer's confidence in our solution is a testament to our team's clear understanding of our customers' needs as well as our proven track record of success as a digital transformation partner.\n Staying with digital solutions, an Australian government agency asked Iron Mountain to digitize approximately 250,000 land registry files dating back to the 1850s for government-owned real estate in the state of Victoria. Our solution will ensure that these vital historical records are preserved both physically and digitally, enabling efficient access for land managers, potential developers and government departments.\n Our infrastructure, reputation and expertise, including our ability to meet a requirement to manage the entire project within the state of Victoria were key differentiators that enabled us to secure this deal.\n Moving next to our data center business. We continue to be pleased by the strength and rapid growth of this business and how we can support more customers with the capacity we are creating at our facilities around the world. Today, I want to highlight 3 examples of leases we signed this quarter.\n First, we have signed a 24-megawatt 12-year contract with a global technology company for data center space at our Manassas, Virginia campus. This is an existing North American records customer that required space in Virginia to support their high-performance computing needs and to expand their footprint. Also this quarter, we leased 4 megawatts with an existing global cloud storage customer. The customer relate to us that our excellent customer service was a key determinant in their decision to expand their footprint with us.\n Additionally, in our data center business, we are pleased to welcome a global IT consulting firm as a new customer. They chose us in order to be in close proximity to their clients as well as to meet their demanding connectivity requirements.\n Turning to asset life cycle management. We are pleased to share that this quarter, we closed the acquisition of Regency Technologies. The Regency leadership team have already made strong contributions to our ALM efforts, both commercially and operationally and have integrated well into our company. Moreover, Regency adds 8 complementary locations to our U.S. network.\n Moving to ALM more broadly. We are pleased with strong organic growth in the business, driven by a combination of increased volume and component price recovery leading to a strong quarter. As we continue to build our ALM capabilities, I wish to share several examples of how ALM enables us to offer more solutions to new and existing customers.\n A well-known food service brand has signed an agreement with Iron Mountain in the Netherlands to recycle their decommissioned IT assets. Data security was paramount in their decision to partner with Iron Mountain as well as our ability to be at any of their in-country locations within 48 hours. Also in this quarter, an existing Iron Mountain global financial institution customer signed a program deal to manage their secure ITAD, recycling and remarketing requirements, including their remote workplace inventory for over 400 sites nationwide.\n The customer wanted a single vendor approach to streamline their asset life cycle management. We worked with them on a unique solution that created process and workflow enhancements, integrated with their existing asset management systems and lowered their overall cost through the remarketing initiatives. The program supports all of their corporate locations with both on and off-site ALM services.\n Finally, a multinational conglomerate company has signed a deal with us to manage its ALM needs for data center decommissioning as well as their end user devices. Due to the customers' significant growth through acquisition, they had accumulated a significant amount of legacy data center and end-user device equipment that needed to be securely decommissioned. We were pleased to be able to provide a holistic global solution backed by our secure chain of custody in order to meet their needs.\n To conclude, I am very proud of the strong results our Mountaineers continue to deliver. Our consistently strong performance, including our ability to achieve our highest quarterly revenue to date is evidence of the increasing heights we are achieving as part of our Matterhorn climb.\n At the core of this continued strong performance is our customers. All of us at Iron Mountain are humbled by the trust which more than 240,000 organizations around the world including 95% of the Fortune 1000 have in us in our increased portfolio of services. We look forward to continuing our growth journey as we deliver our best-in-class and integrated solutions to our clients and create value for our shareholders.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry. \nBarry Hytinen: Thanks, Bill, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our results. In the first quarter, our team continued our track record of strong performance, exceeding the expectations we've provided on our last call.\n We achieved record quarterly revenue of $1.48 billion, up 12% on a reported basis, driven by 9% storage growth and 17% service growth. On an organic basis, revenue grew 8%. Revenue was nearly $30 million ahead of the expectations we shared on our last call, driven by stronger performance in both our Global RIM and our asset life cycle management businesses.\n Total storage revenue of $885 million, up $75 million year-on-year was driven by solid performance from both Global RIM and data center. Total service revenue of $592 million was up $88 million from last year, reflecting strength in Global RIM and digital as well as strong contribution from our recently closed acquisition of Regency Technologies.\n For me, 2 key highlights in the quarter are: first, data center storage revenue exceeded 30% growth year-on-year. And second, our organic service revenue growth accelerated to 10% year-on-year, primarily driven by improved performance in our asset life cycle management business. Adjusted EBITDA was $519 million, an increase of $58 million from last year. This constitutes growth of 13%, both on a reported and constant currency basis year-on-year, driven by strong contributions across all business units.\n Adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.1%, consistent year-on-year driven by revenue management and cost productivity, offset by mix. AFFO was $324 million or $1.10 on a per share basis, up $29 million and $0.09, respectively, from the first quarter of last year. This was ahead of the expectations we shared on our last call as a result of the upside in adjusted EBITDA as well as phasing of both recurring capital investments and cash taxes, which is incorporated into our guidance for the second quarter.\n Now turning to segment performance. In the first quarter, our Global RIM business delivered revenue of $1.21 billion, an increase of $84 million from last year. On a reported and organic basis, revenue grew 7%. Storage rental revenue growth of 6% reflects our focus on revenue management and consistent volume trends. We delivered service revenue growth of 10%, driven by traditional services and digital solutions.\n Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $526 million, an increase of $48 million year-on-year. Turning to our global data center business. We achieved revenue of $144 million, an increase of $32 million and 28% year-on-year. Data center adjusted EBITDA was $62 million or 22% growth from the first quarter of 2023.\n Turning to new and expansion leasing. We had a successful quarter with the team signing 30 megawatts with strong cross-selling activity. Our data center pipeline is robust across the markets we serve. In Phoenix, where we are fully leased in our first 2 sites, we have now commenced construction on our third site and have a considerable pipeline of opportunities to fill it.\n In support of our data center strategy and consistent with our sustainability commitments, we were pleased to execute our first green loan in April. This $300 million financing was well received and considerably oversubscribed. Proceeds will be used to support the construction of energy-efficient data centers in Northern Virginia.\n Turning to asset life cycle management. In the first quarter, we delivered improved performance for both revenue and EBITDA. Total ALM revenue in the quarter was $84 million, an increase of 103% year-on-year. Regency Technologies performed ahead of our expectations in the quarter with revenue of $32 million.\n While we are only 1 quarter into the integration, we are very pleased with the acquisition and are already seeing more benefit than planned in terms of cross-selling, increased capabilities and improved operational efficiencies. On an organic basis, ALM revenue increased 25% year-on-year, driven by both improved component pricing and increased volume from our strong cross-selling activity.\n Turning to capital. In the first quarter, we invested $366 million, of which $337 million was growth and $29 million was recurring. Our full year capital expenditure target remains $1.35 billion of growth and $150 million of recurring. Turning to the balance sheet. With strong EBITDA performance, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.1x.\n As a reminder, this remains at the lowest level in the past decade. We expect to operate within our target leverage range, which is 4.5 to 5.5x. Our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.65 per share to be paid in early July. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, our payout ratio is now 61% at the lower end of our long-term target range of low to mid-60s percent.\n And now turning to our forecast. With our positive outlook, we are pleased to reiterate our full year guidance despite the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar. Our forecast today includes current FX rates, which results in an incremental headwind of approximately $25 million to revenue and approximately $10 million to adjusted EBITDA through the remainder of the year as compared to our initial guidance.\n For the second quarter, we expect revenue of approximately $1.5 billion, adjusted EBITDA of approximately $535 million, AFFO of approximately $310 million and AFFO per share of approximately $1.05. In summary, we are pleased to have delivered strong first quarter results, and we expect continued growth in 2024 as a result of our focus on Project Matterhorn objectives.\n I would like to take this opportunity to once again thank our entire team for their continued dedication and commitment to Iron Mountain and our clients. And with that, operator, would you please open the line for Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. \nKeen Fai Tong: Within the storage business, organic revenue growth step to 7.5% in the quarter compared to about 10.5% in 4Q. Presumably, most of that was driven by changes in price realization since volumes are generally stable in storage. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing with your revenue management strategy and your latest traction with price realization in the quarter and expectations for the remainder of the year? \nWilliam Meaney: Thanks, George. It's Bill, and I appreciate you joining the call. The -- so let me start with kind of the macro view. So we're really very pleased with our storage, both in terms of the records management as well as in the data center side because you can see we're continuing to grow. We've never stored on the traditional side or the records management side, we've never stored more documents than we do today.\n So we're really pleased with the continued strength of the volume and the growth and the volume on the data center side. In terms of pricing, you can appreciate that we -- as we go through the year, that ramp. So you should think about that as being kind of the low point. But I don't know, Barry, you might want to add a little bit more color to it? \nBarry Hytinen: George, thanks for that question. Bill's got it right there on the revenue management within Global Rim. The timing of revenue management actions year-on-year is such that there was a bit of a shift in the first quarter. Last year, we had more of the revenue management actions in place right at the beginning of the year. And this year, we're back to our more normal cadence of kind of the Mark's time frame, generally speaking, in terms of getting them all into the market and realized.\n As it relates to how it performed, though in Global RIM for storage rental revenue growth is actually, to be clear, ahead of our expectations on the lines you're asking about. And in total, we delivered 7.5% total revenue growth in Global RIM. You'll recall last quarter, we mentioned that our guide for the whole year, assuming Global RIM at about 6%. So we're starting very well. There was upside in Global RIM principally driven off of services, but a little bit ahead, as I mentioned, on storage rental and of course, data centers off to a really strong start.\n So we feel very well positioned with respect to where we started the year, George, on both revenue management, total storage revenue as well as the full enterprise results. \nOperator: And our next question today comes from Nate Crossett with BMP. \nNathan Daniel Crossett: Maybe just a follow-up to that. What is your expectation for RIM volumes for 2Q and the balance of the year? And then data center leasing guidance, is it still 100-megawatt? And maybe you could just talk about the pipeline for data center. \nWilliam Meaney: Okay. Thanks, Nate. I'll give you the -- in terms of volume, we continue -- it's a rock-solid business in terms of RIM volume, and we continue to see that to flat, slightly up. So we don't see any change, and you can see that in our supplemental, we don't see any change in that trend, and we continue to feel really good about that.\n And in terms of the pipeline on data center, it's extremely strong. You see we're off to a good start. We guided 100 megawatts for the full year. We're 30 megawatts in the first quarter, and we have a very strong pipeline as Barry alluded to in terms of Arizona, for instance, in terms of building out the third site in Phoenix.\n But across the globe, we have a very, very strong pipeline. So we're expecting another very strong year, benefiting from the strong macro environment around data centers, especially with the growth around AI applications. \nBarry Hytinen: And Nate, the only -- this is Barry. The only thing I would add is -- building on to Bill's point there at the beginning on volume. We are forecasting for volume to be up second quarter versus the first quarter. And consistent to slightly up for the full year as we've been saying for some time we're well on track with that forecast. And just as a reminder, we have never stored more physical volume than we are storing today. \nOperator: And our next question today comes from Brendan Lynch with Barclays. \nBrendan Lynch: Maybe we could start just by disaggregating the ALM components between increased volume and improvement pricing? \nBarry Hytinen: Brendan, it's Barry. Thanks for that question. If we look at total ALM, we had $84 million of revenue. Now Regency, which, as you know, we just recently acquired was just over $32 million of revenue, as I mentioned on the prepared remarks. So that -- and by the way, that was very good performance. So that's on a run rate of nearly, let's call it, 130, you'll recall last quarter, I mentioned that embedded in the midpoint of our guidance, it was for Regency to be about 115. And so we are well on track with respect to that line.\n In terms of enterprise and hyperscale rest of our ALM business is performing quite well. As I mentioned, on an organic basis, ALM was up 25%, which was stronger than we expected. And I should note that ALM in total was about $10 million ahead of the expectations we have baked into our first quarter guidance. So it was a meaningful portion of the upside for the total.\n In enterprise and hyperscale, getting directly to your question now, volume and price were both up and we saw component pricing rising through the quarter with more of the increase late in the quarter. So as we sit here today in April, component prices have continued to rise as compared to where they were in the first quarter.\n And in our outlook, we continue to be, I think, prudent with our expectations that, that is likely to continue to rise, although we haven't baked in the kind of some of the levels of increase that you've seen from some of the industry analysts, which are very robust increases as we move through the remainder of the year.\n Volume is being driven by our strong cross-selling activity and increased penetration with hyperscale clients as it relates to decommissioning. In both cases, we see that continuing to trend up over time. So we're feeling really good about the way ALM is starting to track with it. \nOperator: And our next question today comes from Jon Atkin with RBC. \nJonathan Atkin: So a question on data centers and a question on, I guess, ALM. So on data centers for some of your newer expansions where you might end up doing build-to-suits or single tenant. What are the unlevered yields now that you are kind of underwriting to what would be kind of a minimum level that you think the market will bear? And then for ALM, I just wondered which regions do you think you could see outsized growth in? \nWilliam Meaney: Okay. So maybe I'll start, John, and then Barry can give you some more color on ALM. On the data center side, I think we covered pretty much what we said in the last quarter, we see those trends continuing. So think of it as a couple of hundred basis points above the historical cash-on-cash return.\n So you're kind of looking at the 9 to 10 on hyperscale and then your -- I guess your question was more around hyperscale. So if you think about in terms of cost of capital, then we've -- basically, it's slightly ahead of what we've seen in the cost of capital with the run-up in interest rates. So the spreads are still positive in terms of the cost of finance, in terms of what we've gotten for cash-on-cash returns on the new leasing that we're doing.\n I mean that's due to the macro environment, as you know very well, in terms of -- it's a very, very strong market for data center, and we see that in our results. \nBarry Hytinen: Jon, it's Barry. On the ALM question as it relates to where we might see continued outsized performance, I don't want to come across promotional, but it's basically all regions because we are seeing ALM component pricing rise on a global basis, and we're seeing continued volume growth around the world, particularly in the U.S., thanks to our continued cross-selling to our some of our largest Fortune 1000 type clients as well as partnering together with the great team at Regency Technologies, we're seeing strong growth there.\n And I think that will continue for some time. As you know, the ALM market is very large, it's highly fragmented, and we think we have a huge opportunity in that space. And I just want to underscore that we're really, really pleased with the way the Regency combination is already unfolding even in this early stage of the integration. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. \nAlexander EM Hess: This is Alex Hess on for Andrew Steinerman. Maybe 2 quick questions if you allow. On the ALM side, it appears that sort of -- if my math is right, that quarter-on-quarter, so 4Q '23 to 1Q '24 sort of the organic growth was about flat.\n Is that right? Maybe 25 million -- 25% growth times a year ago growth rate, a year ago revenue number for ALM? And then if I think about -- and maybe I'll let you answer that and then hopefully, you don't mind if I ask a maybe more longer-term-oriented question. \nBarry Hytinen: Go ahead with the longer term, and so we'll have them both. \nAlexander EM Hess: All right. Sounds good. So on the more longer-term-oriented question. I just wanted to know like how do you think about your ability to sort of deliver on time, on budget within your data center business and maybe how that's benchmarked against your peer group? \nWilliam Meaney: Okay. Well, I'll deal with the longer term, and then I'll let Barry talk to you about the sequential quarter-over-quarter -- quarter-to-quarter on the ALM side. So on the -- I mean, the data center business, I think you can see that we're continuing to drive strong deployments across all of our campuses.\n So we don't see any change in terms of our ability to both plan and execute that, that's -- and you can see that in our leasing activity because as you can imagine, especially with the hyperscale clients and most of our leasing over the last 12 months has been -- the vast majority has been with hyperscale. You can imagine that's a key component for them to decide who they're going to go to, is our ability to actually execute on time, on budget, which is managing also the supply chain.\n So if anything, we see -- even though the demand is really, really strong right now in data center, we see that the planning has gotten a little bit simpler as supply chain is more normalized, albeit though this very, very strong demand. So we're blessed with a very good construction team. And our customers' trust is in a big part, exactly what you're talking about? \nBarry Hytinen: And Alex, it's Barry. Thanks for that question. You're doing the math right. It was up slightly on a dollar basis Q-to-Q. And I'll just note that as we said last quarter, on the decommissioning side, we had some clients last quarter that wanted to move some of their volume that they had been sitting on for some time. So there was a little bit of timing there.\n And frankly, I think we also saw in light of the way pricing was moving both from the end of the fourth quarter through the first quarter that some of our hyperscale clients were actually deferring some of the remarketing until later in the quarter in light of the fact that they wanted to like we did as well capture the better pricing that we've been seeing. As I mentioned earlier, the pricing really did ramp later in the quarter and continues.\n So the trends in that business are quite good. And what that results in is we had a little bit of mix in legacy IT renew business. I will note, however, that the enterprise business was up nicely on a sequential basis. And of course, in light of the cross-selling activity and the bookings that we've been talking about in that business and knowing that it's not the kind of remarketing. It's just a very straight service oriented.\n I am expecting the enterprise business to continue to grow quarter-to-quarter and, frankly, the hyperscale as well. So thanks for that, Alex. \nOperator: And our next question today comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. \nEric Luebchow: Just to follow back on the data center business. Obviously, you have a high-class problem with most of your footprint pretty leased up. So how should we think about future data center CapEx given the strong leasing in the quarter? And how are you thinking about either additional markets or areas where you might need to add land capacity so that you have a further runway to grow the business beyond this year? \nWilliam Meaney: Thanks, Eric, for the question. Yes. So I think let me kind of break out your question in 2 parts. From a capital standpoint, we're very much within our multiyear plan that we laid out at the Investor Day. So in terms of our ability to fund it, as I said, earlier is that we have a fully funded plan and that we don't see any issues between the strength that we have in our traditional records management business that generates as you know, tons of cash that we then -- after paying the dividend, we actually flow into data center and growth areas.\n And then, of course, the strong growth we're getting in EBITDA gives us plenty of debt capacity to continue to fund that growth. So in terms of the funding side of it, as you say, it's a high-class problem. But you can imagine even when we were putting the plans together and we do our budgets is we look at upside and downside in terms of demand. So we're pretty comfortable that we can continue to fund the growth that we're seeing.\n In terms of the footprint, you're right to point out that we're going to be full and for instance, in our Manassas campus fairly soon. And we've talked about that we're already starting construction on our third campus or our third data center in Phoenix. And we're building out the Madrid campus. We're adding to the Amsterdam campus London 3. We started off with 1 data center. Now we're in 3. We have 2 data centers in Frankfurt.\n So you're right to point that out. But I think you can imagine that we, right now, we feel very confident that we have in our pipeline to acquire more land that's in excess of the 100 megawatts for instance, that we guided this year. So we feel really good about the land bank strategy that we have in terms of what we have in the acquisition pipeline for land over the next -- for the rest of the year that will be ahead of our leasing activity. \nBarry Hytinen: Yes, Eric, I would just add on and thank you for the compliment, by the way, on how the data center business is continuing to progress. The team is doing a phenomenal job. But I would just add on that we have multiple land parcels that we are in active negotiations with. We were looking at multiple sites.\n And importantly, that is embedded in our capital spending that we've been planning, as Bill alluded to, to continue to add to the land bank kind of continuously year in and year out. So that's embedded in the capital. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Jon Atkin with RBC. \nJonathan Atkin: Just a follow-up on, I guess, 2 follow-ups for your time. So you mentioned a lot of sovereign requirements, and I'm just interested in how competitive you find that space in terms of the RFP activity. And again, similar to my other question with earlier, is there particular region where you see more of those sorts of things, perhaps presenting opportunities? And then beyond the question would be the... \nBarry Hytinen: Jon, just before you go into the next question, we had a little interference with the signal. Can you repeat the first part of the question or maybe just give us the first question again? \nJonathan Atkin: Yes. How competitive are you finding the sovereign requirements? I don't know if these are formal RFPs in each case, but if you can talk a little bit about the competitive environment and then future opportunities, are there particular regions where you see more growth ahead in kind of the public sector?\n And then the second question was more around ITAD and you mentioned the integration of Regency. How complex are those integrations? And is it too soon to think about doing more of those types of tuck-ins for ALM? \nWilliam Meaney: Okay. Thanks, Jon. I'll take the question in terms of government contracting. And Barry, as you know, runs our M&A shopping. So I'll let him talk about both the integration with Regency as well as the pipeline in terms of further roll-ups.\n I think in terms of the sovereign contracting or government side of the business, is that we work for -- we work with a number. As you noticed that I highlighted a couple this time with United Kingdom, we do quite a bit in the United States, we also do quite a bit in other parts of Germany, including France and in -- yes, in other parts of France and Germany.\n And you're right, the relationships -- first of all, it's like anything else, it's a relationship building to make sure that you get into the queue. And you're right to point out that many times, these things lapse 12 months. In other words, they start talking to you before they get into the budgets and the budgets for the following year and you go through a tender process.\n But we feel pretty good about -- I mean, we've got teams that are very experienced at that. I think it's actually an opportunity for us because you can imagine we pick our places that we decide to play because you do have to have a 24-month horizon when you're going after that kind of business. So we typically go to the -- both the parts of government and the governments or states where we think that there's enough of a volume to do.\n So I think there's more for us to do and we're continuing to add to our teams in that area. And of course, you have to put very strong compliance around it, right? So -- but it is a strong part of our business, and it continues to grow. And it's a strong part -- and of all of our businesses. It's not just on the records management or the digital side, it includes data center. \nBarry Hytinen: Jon, it's Barry. Thanks for that question on the integration and tuck-ins. First thing I'd say is the integration is going very well. No integration, I would ever say, is easy because, of course, combinations of companies are -- it is complex. However, I think our team is doing a very, very good job, and I alluded to in the script, that we are ahead of plan, and we are seeing more benefits in terms of operational efficiencies, driving better margins, improved capabilities.\n And that's credit to the team we picked up at Regency Technologies because they have a best-in-class capability as it relates to processing and recycling. And Bill and I were recently in our largest facility in Ohio with the team of Regency Technologies. We saw a lot of great processing going on, a really dedicated team.\n I was in our Atlanta Regency facility last week, and saw the integration underway and we continue to see a lot of incremental capacity to utilize as we build out our ALM customer base. And as it relates to additional tuck-ins, I would say now that we've built the platform of both hyperscale, decommissioning as well as combining with Regency, tuck-ins are definitely something we are continuing to look at.\n It is to use your phrase, it is not too early to be considering them. We have a list. But of course, everything is fact and circumstances driven. We like to make sure we're getting things at a very appropriate multiple and that we can see clear growth aligned with our business and that it will be incremental to our franchise. And -- but I think that there are opportunities booked in the U.S. and throughout the world actually as we build out our ALM capability to be a global partner to our large client base. \nOperator: This concludes today's question-and-answer session and the Iron Mountain First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call.

            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our results. In the first quarter, our team continued our track record of strong performance, exceeding the expectations we've provided on our last call.\n We achieved record quarterly revenue of $1.48 billion, up 12% on a reported basis, driven by 9% storage growth and 17% service growth. On an organic basis, revenue grew 8%.

This was ahead of the expectations we shared on our last call as a result of the upside in adjusted EBITDA as well as phasing of both recurring capital investments and cash taxes, which is incorporated into our guidance for the second quarter.\n Now turning to segment performance. In the first quarter, our Global RIM business delivered revenue of $1.21 billion, an increase of $84 million from last year. On a reported and organic basis, revenue grew 7%. Storage rental revenue growth of 6% reflects our focus on revenue management and consistent volume trends. We delivered service revenue growth of 10%, driven by traditional services and digital solutions.\n Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $526 million, an increase of $48 million year-on-year. Turning to our global data center business. We achieved revenue of $144 million, an increase of $32 million and 28% year-on-year. Data center adjusted EBITDA was $62 million or 22% growth from the first quarter of 2023.\n Turning to new and expansion leasing. We had a successful quarter with the team signing 30 megawatts with strong cross-selling activity. Our data center pipeline is robust across the markets we serve. In Phoenix, where we are fully leased in our first 2 sites, we have now commenced construction on our third site and have a considerable pipeline of opportunities to fill it.\n In support of our data center strategy and consistent with our sustainability commitments, we were pleased to execute our first green loan in April.

With strong EBITDA performance, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.1x.\n As a reminder, this remains at the lowest level in the past decade. We expect to operate within our target leverage range, which is 4.5 to 5.5x. Our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.65 per share to be paid in early July. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, our payout ratio is now 61% at the lower end of our long-term target range of low to mid-60s percent.\n And now turning to our forecast. With our positive outlook, we are pleased to reiterate our full year guidance despite the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar. Our forecast today includes current FX rates, which results in an incremental headwind of approximately $25 million to revenue and approximately $10 million to adjusted EBITDA through the remainder of the year as compared to our initial guidance.\n For the second quarter, we expect revenue of approximately $1.5 billion, adjusted EBITDA of approximately $535 million, AFFO of approximately $310 million and AFFO per share of approximately $1.05. In summary, we are pleased to have delivered strong first quarter results, and we expect continued growth in 2024 as a result of our focus on Project Matterhorn objectives.\n I would like to take this opportunity to once again thank our entire team for their continued dedication and commitment to Iron Mountain and our clients. And with that, operator, would you please open the line for Q&A. George, thanks for that question. Bill's got it right there on the revenue management within Global Rim. The timing of revenue management actions year-on-year is such that there was a bit of a shift in the first quarter. Last year, we had more of the revenue management actions in place right at the beginning of the year. And this year, we're back to our more normal cadence of kind of the Mark's time frame, generally speaking, in terms of getting them all into the market and realized.\n As it relates to how it performed, though in Global RIM for storage rental revenue growth is actually, to be clear, ahead of our expectations on the lines you're asking about. And in total, we delivered 7.5% total revenue growth in Global RIM. You'll recall last quarter, we mentioned that our guide for the whole year, assuming Global RIM at about 6%. So we're starting very well. There was upside in Global RIM principally driven off of services, but a little bit ahead, as I mentioned, on storage rental and of course, data centers off to a really strong start.\n So we feel very well positioned with respect to where we started the year, George, on both revenue management, total storage revenue as well as the full enterprise results. And Nate, the only -- this is Barry. The only thing I would add is -- building on to Bill's point there at the beginning on volume. We are forecasting for volume to be up second quarter versus the first quarter. And consistent to slightly up for the full year as we've been saying for some time we're well on track with that forecast. And just as a reminder, we have never stored more physical volume than we are storing today. Brendan, it's Barry. Thanks for that question. If we look at total ALM, we had $84 million of revenue. Now Regency, which, as you know, we just recently acquired was just over $32 million of revenue, as I mentioned on the prepared remarks. So that -- and by the way, that was very good performance. So that's on a run rate of nearly, let's call it, 130, you'll recall last quarter, I mentioned that embedded in the midpoint of our guidance, it was for Regency to be about 115. And so we are well on track with respect to that line.\n In terms of enterprise and hyperscale rest of our ALM business is performing quite well. As I mentioned, on an organic basis, ALM was up 25%, which was stronger than we expected. And I should note that ALM in total was about $10 million ahead of the expectations we have baked into our first quarter guidance. So it was a meaningful portion of the upside for the total.\n In enterprise and hyperscale, getting directly to your question now, volume and price were both up and we saw component pricing rising through the quarter with more of the increase late in the quarter. So as we sit here today in April, component prices have continued to rise as compared to where they were in the first quarter.\n And in our outlook, we continue to be, I think, prudent with our expectations that, that is likely to continue to rise, although we haven't baked in the kind of some of the levels of increase that you've seen from some of the industry analysts, which are very robust increases as we move through the remainder of the year.\n Volume is being driven by our strong cross-selling activity and increased penetration with hyperscale clients as it relates to decommissioning. In both cases, we see that continuing to trend up over time. So we're feeling really good about the way ALM is starting to track with it. Jon, it's Barry. On the ALM question as it relates to where we might see continued outsized performance, I don't want to come across promotional, but it's basically all regions because we are seeing ALM component pricing rise on a global basis, and we're seeing continued volume growth around the world, particularly in the U.S., thanks to our continued cross-selling to our some of our largest Fortune 1000 type clients as well as partnering together with the great team at Regency Technologies, we're seeing strong growth there.\n And I think that will continue for some time. As you know, the ALM market is very large, it's highly fragmented, and we think we have a huge opportunity in that space. And I just want to underscore that we're really, really pleased with the way the Regency combination is already unfolding even in this early stage of the integration. Go ahead with the longer term, and so we'll have them both. And Alex, it's Barry. Thanks for that question. You're doing the math right. It was up slightly on a dollar basis Q-to-Q. And I'll just note that as we said last quarter, on the decommissioning side, we had some clients last quarter that wanted to move some of their volume that they had been sitting on for some time. So there was a little bit of timing there.\n And frankly, I think we also saw in light of the way pricing was moving both from the end of the fourth quarter through the first quarter that some of our hyperscale clients were actually deferring some of the remarketing until later in the quarter in light of the fact that they wanted to like we did as well capture the better pricing that we've been seeing. As I mentioned earlier, the pricing really did ramp later in the quarter and continues.\n So the trends in that business are quite good. And what that results in is we had a little bit of mix in legacy IT renew business. I will note, however, that the enterprise business was up nicely on a sequential basis. And of course, in light of the cross-selling activity and the bookings that we've been talking about in that business and knowing that it's not the kind of remarketing. It's just a very straight service oriented.\n I am expecting the enterprise business to continue to grow quarter-to-quarter and, frankly, the hyperscale as well. So thanks for that, Alex. Yes, Eric, I would just add on and thank you for the compliment, by the way, on how the data center business is continuing to progress. The team is doing a phenomenal job. But I would just add on that we have multiple land parcels that we are in active negotiations with. We were looking at multiple sites.\n And importantly, that is embedded in our capital spending that we've been planning, as Bill alluded to, to continue to add to the land bank kind of continuously year in and year out. So that's embedded in the capital. Jon, just before you go into the next question, we had a little interference with the signal. Can you repeat the first part of the question or maybe just give us the first question again? Jon, it's Barry. Thanks for that question on the integration and tuck-ins. First thing I'd say is the integration is going very well. No integration, I would ever say, is easy because, of course, combinations of companies are -- it is complex. However, I think our team is doing a very, very good job, and I alluded to in the script, that we are ahead of plan, and we are seeing more benefits in terms of operational efficiencies, driving better margins, improved capabilities.\n And that's credit to the team we picked up at Regency Technologies because they have a best-in-class capability as it relates to processing and recycling. And Bill and I were recently in our largest facility in Ohio with the team of Regency Technologies. We saw a lot of great processing going on, a really dedicated team.\n I was in our Atlanta Regency facility last week, and saw the integration underway and we continue to see a lot of incremental capacity to utilize as we build out our ALM customer base. And as it relates to additional tuck-ins, I would say now that we've built the platform of both hyperscale, decommissioning as well as combining with Regency, tuck-ins are definitely something we are continuing to look at.\n It is to use your phrase, it is not too early to be considering them. We have a list. But of course, everything is fact and circumstances driven. We like to make sure we're getting things at a very appropriate multiple and that we can see clear growth aligned with our business and that it will be incremental to our franchise. And -- but I think that there are opportunities booked in the U.S. and throughout the world actually as we build out our ALM capability to be a global partner to our large client base."

            "name": "William Meaney",
            "content": "Thank you, Gillian, and thank you all for taking time to join us today. We are pleased to report that our team has delivered outstanding results for the first quarter of 2024, achieving another set of all-time highs for revenue and profitability. Our continued progress is evidence of the success of Project Matterhorn and our team's commitment to delivering best-in-class solutions.\n On a reported basis, in the first quarter, we achieved our highest ever quarterly revenue of $1.48 billion, representing 12% year-over-year growth and a new first quarter adjusted EBITDA record of $519 million, delivering 13% year-over-year growth. Project Matterhorn has successfully transformed Iron Mountain into a solutions-based business with a commercial organization that offers a broad range of products and services to meet the evolving needs of our customers.\n This integrated product portfolio drives strong growth across all business areas through our integrated solutions, combining storage with truly differentiated services. Now I'd like to take you through some pivotal wins this quarter. Let's begin with records and information management.\n The strength and longevity of the relationships we have built with our 240,000 customers is leading to further opportunities to offer more solutions from our portfolio to meet our customers' needs. An excellent example of this cross-selling is in the oil and energy sector where a U.S.-headquartered customer with a presence in 75 countries initially selected Iron Mountain to securely manage its data containing geological information.\n Thanks to our expanded range of solutions and a deep understanding of the customers' needs, we are now also providing a secure IT asset disposition solution.\n Another example of our strength and ability to cross-sell and provide more solutions for our customers is in the United Arab Emirates. For the past 2 years, we have been partnering with a prominent bank to provide records management services for a growing volume of documents. With this customer's need to comply with regulations from the UAE Central Bank, we secured an agreement to extend our solutions. These now include document capture and asset life cycle management or ALM services.\n We continue to see opportunities to support government and public sector organizations with their transformations, helping them to increase efficiency and demonstrate value for money for the sources they provide to their citizens. A recent example of this is in the U.K., where we have a long-term relationship with a government agency that trust us to store approximately 18 million records. This customer awarded Iron Mountain a contract to manage documents that must be retained whilst legal proceedings are ongoing.\n Our proven ability to manage records effectively to this customer and a number of other government organizations in the U.K. demonstrates we have the skills, capabilities and experience to successfully manage sensitive projects like this.\n Turning to our digital business, a global customer that provides automation solutions has asked us to digitize its physical records in Morocco. Our InSight platform, which as you will recall, fully integrates both artificial intelligence and machine learning will enable this customer to simplify their current use of multiple information systems and content formats.\n InSight will enable them to derive greater value from their information whilst improving their compliance and driving greater operational efficiencies. The customer's confidence in our solution is a testament to our team's clear understanding of our customers' needs as well as our proven track record of success as a digital transformation partner.\n Staying with digital solutions, an Australian government agency asked Iron Mountain to digitize approximately 250,000 land registry files dating back to the 1850s for government-owned real estate in the state of Victoria. Our solution will ensure that these vital historical records are preserved both physically and digitally, enabling efficient access for land managers, potential developers and government departments.\n Our infrastructure, reputation and expertise, including our ability to meet a requirement to manage the entire project within the state of Victoria were key differentiators that enabled us to secure this deal.\n Moving next to our data center business. We continue to be pleased by the strength and rapid growth of this business and how we can support more customers with the capacity we are creating at our facilities around the world. Today, I want to highlight 3 examples of leases we signed this quarter.\n First, we have signed a 24-megawatt 12-year contract with a global technology company for data center space at our Manassas, Virginia campus. This is an existing North American records customer that required space in Virginia to support their high-performance computing needs and to expand their footprint. Also this quarter, we leased 4 megawatts with an existing global cloud storage customer. The customer relate to us that our excellent customer service was a key determinant in their decision to expand their footprint with us.\n Additionally, in our data center business, we are pleased to welcome a global IT consulting firm as a new customer. They chose us in order to be in close proximity to their clients as well as to meet their demanding connectivity requirements.\n Turning to asset life cycle management. We are pleased to share that this quarter, we closed the acquisition of Regency Technologies. The Regency leadership team have already made strong contributions to our ALM efforts, both commercially and operationally and have integrated well into our company. Moreover, Regency adds 8 complementary locations to our U.S. network.\n Moving to ALM more broadly. We are pleased with strong organic growth in the business, driven by a combination of increased volume and component price recovery leading to a strong quarter. As we continue to build our ALM capabilities, I wish to share several examples of how ALM enables us to offer more solutions to new and existing customers.\n A well-known food service brand has signed an agreement with Iron Mountain in the Netherlands to recycle their decommissioned IT assets. Data security was paramount in their decision to partner with Iron Mountain as well as our ability to be at any of their in-country locations within 48 hours. Also in this quarter, an existing Iron Mountain global financial institution customer signed a program deal to manage their secure ITAD, recycling and remarketing requirements, including their remote workplace inventory for over 400 sites nationwide.\n The customer wanted a single vendor approach to streamline their asset life cycle management. We worked with them on a unique solution that created process and workflow enhancements, integrated with their existing asset management systems and lowered their overall cost through the remarketing initiatives. The program supports all of their corporate locations with both on and off-site ALM services.\n Finally, a multinational conglomerate company has signed a deal with us to manage its ALM needs for data center decommissioning as well as their end user devices. Due to the customers' significant growth through acquisition, they had accumulated a significant amount of legacy data center and end-user device equipment that needed to be securely decommissioned. We were pleased to be able to provide a holistic global solution backed by our secure chain of custody in order to meet their needs.\n To conclude, I am very proud of the strong results our Mountaineers continue to deliver. Our consistently strong performance, including our ability to achieve our highest quarterly revenue to date is evidence of the increasing heights we are achieving as part of our Matterhorn climb.\n At the core of this continued strong performance is our customers. All of us at Iron Mountain are humbled by the trust which more than 240,000 organizations around the world including 95% of the Fortune 1000 have in us in our increased portfolio of services. We look forward to continuing our growth journey as we deliver our best-in-class and integrated solutions to our clients and create value for our shareholders.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry. Thanks, George. It's Bill, and I appreciate you joining the call. The -- so let me start with kind of the macro view. So we're really very pleased with our storage, both in terms of the records management as well as in the data center side because you can see we're continuing to grow. We've never stored on the traditional side or the records management side, we've never stored more documents than we do today.\n So we're really pleased with the continued strength of the volume and the growth and the volume on the data center side. In terms of pricing, you can appreciate that we -- as we go through the year, that ramp. So you should think about that as being kind of the low point. But I don't know, Barry, you might want to add a little bit more color to it? Okay. Thanks, Nate. I'll give you the -- in terms of volume, we continue -- it's a rock-solid business in terms of RIM volume, and we continue to see that to flat, slightly up. So we don't see any change, and you can see that in our supplemental, we don't see any change in that trend, and we continue to feel really good about that.\n And in terms of the pipeline on data center, it's extremely strong. You see we're off to a good start. We guided 100 megawatts for the full year. We're 30 megawatts in the first quarter, and we have a very strong pipeline as Barry alluded to in terms of Arizona, for instance, in terms of building out the third site in Phoenix.\n But across the globe, we have a very, very strong pipeline. So we're expecting another very strong year, benefiting from the strong macro environment around data centers, especially with the growth around AI applications. Okay. So maybe I'll start, John, and then Barry can give you some more color on ALM. On the data center side, I think we covered pretty much what we said in the last quarter, we see those trends continuing. So think of it as a couple of hundred basis points above the historical cash-on-cash return.\n So you're kind of looking at the 9 to 10 on hyperscale and then your -- I guess your question was more around hyperscale. So if you think about in terms of cost of capital, then we've -- basically, it's slightly ahead of what we've seen in the cost of capital with the run-up in interest rates. So the spreads are still positive in terms of the cost of finance, in terms of what we've gotten for cash-on-cash returns on the new leasing that we're doing.\n I mean that's due to the macro environment, as you know very well, in terms of -- it's a very, very strong market for data center, and we see that in our results. Okay. Well, I'll deal with the longer term, and then I'll let Barry talk to you about the sequential quarter-over-quarter -- quarter-to-quarter on the ALM side. So on the -- I mean, the data center business, I think you can see that we're continuing to drive strong deployments across all of our campuses.\n So we don't see any change in terms of our ability to both plan and execute that, that's -- and you can see that in our leasing activity because as you can imagine, especially with the hyperscale clients and most of our leasing over the last 12 months has been -- the vast majority has been with hyperscale. You can imagine that's a key component for them to decide who they're going to go to, is our ability to actually execute on time, on budget, which is managing also the supply chain.\n So if anything, we see -- even though the demand is really, really strong right now in data center, we see that the planning has gotten a little bit simpler as supply chain is more normalized, albeit though this very, very strong demand. So we're blessed with a very good construction team. And our customers' trust is in a big part, exactly what you're talking about? Thanks, Eric, for the question. Yes. So I think let me kind of break out your question in 2 parts. From a capital standpoint, we're very much within our multiyear plan that we laid out at the Investor Day. So in terms of our ability to fund it, as I said, earlier is that we have a fully funded plan and that we don't see any issues between the strength that we have in our traditional records management business that generates as you know, tons of cash that we then -- after paying the dividend, we actually flow into data center and growth areas.\n And then, of course, the strong growth we're getting in EBITDA gives us plenty of debt capacity to continue to fund that growth. So in terms of the funding side of it, as you say, it's a high-class problem. But you can imagine even when we were putting the plans together and we do our budgets is we look at upside and downside in terms of demand. So we're pretty comfortable that we can continue to fund the growth that we're seeing.\n In terms of the footprint, you're right to point out that we're going to be full and for instance, in our Manassas campus fairly soon. And we've talked about that we're already starting construction on our third campus or our third data center in Phoenix. And we're building out the Madrid campus. We're adding to the Amsterdam campus London 3. We started off with 1 data center. Now we're in 3. We have 2 data centers in Frankfurt.\n So you're right to point that out. But I think you can imagine that we, right now, we feel very confident that we have in our pipeline to acquire more land that's in excess of the 100 megawatts for instance, that we guided this year. So we feel really good about the land bank strategy that we have in terms of what we have in the acquisition pipeline for land over the next -- for the rest of the year that will be ahead of our leasing activity. Okay. Thanks, Jon. I'll take the question in terms of government contracting. And Barry, as you know, runs our M&A shopping. So I'll let him talk about both the integration with Regency as well as the pipeline in terms of further roll-ups.\n I think in terms of the sovereign contracting or government side of the business, is that we work for -- we work with a number. As you noticed that I highlighted a couple this time with United Kingdom, we do quite a bit in the United States, we also do quite a bit in other parts of Germany, including France and in -- yes, in other parts of France and Germany.\n And you're right, the relationships -- first of all, it's like anything else, it's a relationship building to make sure that you get into the queue. And you're right to point out that many times, these things lapse 12 months. In other words, they start talking to you before they get into the budgets and the budgets for the following year and you go through a tender process.\n But we feel pretty good about -- I mean, we've got teams that are very experienced at that. I think it's actually an opportunity for us because you can imagine we pick our places that we decide to play because you do have to have a 24-month horizon when you're going after that kind of business. So we typically go to the -- both the parts of government and the governments or states where we think that there's enough of a volume to do.\n So I think there's more for us to do and we're continuing to add to our teams in that area. And of course, you have to put very strong compliance around it, right? So -- but it is a strong part of our business, and it continues to grow. And it's a strong part -- and of all of our businesses. It's not just on the records management or the digital side, it includes data center."
