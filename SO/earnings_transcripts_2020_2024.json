At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Southern Company Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded Thursday, February 18, 2021. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Investor Relations Director. Please, go ahead, sir.\nScott Gammill: Thank you, Pema. Good afternoon, and welcome to Southern Company's year-end 2020 earnings call. Joining me today are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Drew Evans, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you, we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measures are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.\nTom Fanning: Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted earnings per share for 2020 that exceeded our guidance range. In addition, we have a solid outlook for 2021, and importantly, we are raising our projected long-term earnings per share growth rate. But before we turn to more on our year-end business update, I'd like to share some thoughts on 2020. In 2020, we essentially saw four pandemics: health, economic, social and political. Southern Company demonstrated excellence and resilience on every front, including prioritizing the health and safety of our workforce and communities, overcoming decreased electric demand while delivering both, strong financial and superior operating results, and continuing to address racial injustice and working with policymakers to advance a cleaner energy future. First, the health pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic was, of course, the first and primary challenge that we faced last year and one that continues to impact our communities today. From developing a pandemic response reentry playbook, that was ultimately leveraged by many peer companies, to setting up a medical village at the Vogtle construction site and making heroic progress towards completion of those units, we placed the health and safety of our employees as a top priority. So by taking care of our workforce, we were able to continue taking care of our customers. The economic pandemic. Beginning in March and April of last year, the world has experienced significant economic duress. Southern Company originally projected a $250 million to $400 million loss in revenue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Through thoughtful, disciplined O&M reductions, we were able to mitigate the estimated now $300 million revenue loss that we have experienced, while still providing reliability and industry-leading customer satisfaction to our customers. As well, our long-term efforts with the states that we serve on economic development efforts continue, helping capital investment and job growth in the communities we're privileged to serve. The social pandemic. I am also proud of our ongoing commitment to foster racial justice. For years, this has been an effort of Southern's to focus on building a healthy culture. Even before the unrest last summer, we initiated an effort to donate $50 million to historically black colleges and universities. Last summer, I told you that meaningful discussions were underway across our company related to our actions and response. And while these conversations will continue, an initial outcome is that we have refocused our efforts towards a more holistic goal of diversity, equity and inclusion, ensuring that all groups are welcomed, well-represented, engaged and fairly treated throughout the organization. As an example of this commitment, the Southern Company Foundation recently announced a partnership with Apple, where each are investing $25 million to launch the Propel Center, a new digital learning hub, business incubator and global innovation headquarters located in Atlanta for students throughout the nation of historically black colleges and universities. And finally, the political pandemic. I also want to address the political discord that our nation has experienced over the past several months. At Southern, we have consistently prioritized working with policymakers regardless of political party, and we have been working constructively with the Biden administration for months. In fact, we have already engaged in matters related to energy policy, especially the transition to a net zero carbon future, as well as on matters related to national security. You'll see in the appendix a letter I sent to President elect Biden pledging our support. As we continue to engage with the new administration as well as legislators and regulators at both federal and state levels, our positions will continue to focus on energy policies that can enable a smart transition and be informed by our key objectives of providing clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to our customers. So let's now turn to an update on plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. We remain focused on meeting the November 2021 and November 2022 regulatory approved in-service dates for Units 3 and 4, respectively. With the start of hot functional testing expected in only a few weeks, we now expect a November completion for Unit 3. For Unit 4, we continue to utilize an aggressive site work plan as a tool to provide margin to the regulatory approved November 2022 in-service date. Unit 4's current site work plan targets a third quarter 2022 in-service date. From a cost perspective, Georgia Power's share of the total project capital cost forecast increased by $176 million, largely reflecting estimated COVID-19 impacts and other costs, along with a replenishment of contingency to fund future expected risks that will include lower productivity rates and increased support costs. As a result, Georgia Power recorded an after-tax charge of $131 million during the fourth quarter. 2020 marked another year of significant progress at the site. Throughout the year, as some other major projects around the country were shutting down or delayed due to COVID-19, Georgia Power and the Vogtle site team worked tirelessly to implement measures to keep the project progressing while prioritizing the safety of our workforce and the surrounding community. Similar to what was experienced across much of the United States during the last two months of the year and earlier this year, we saw a surge in COVID-19 cases at the Vogtle site, which, as you can see on Slide 6, peaked around the beginning of January. Since the onset of the pandemic and most acutely during the fourth quarter of 2020, the impact from COVID-19 have included high absenteeism and disruptions to planned or ongoing work as we isolated personnel. We estimate the pandemic has extended the schedule for both units by approximately three to four months, consuming much of the remaining margin to the November 2021 in-service date for Unit 3 and several months of margin for Unit 4. Unit 3 direct construction is now approximately 98% complete, and hot functional testing is expected to start in the coming weeks. On our last call, we identified three key risk factors to our timeline: electrical productivity, subcontractor performance and what we call paper closure. Recall, paper closure relates to the turnover of systems to the testing group to help ensure that the as-built condition of the plant meets design specifications. Over the past few months, COVID-19 has hurt site productivity, negatively impacted electrical production and impaired our ability to close paper issues that facilitate timely system turnovers and ultimately, ITAAC submittals. The combination of these factors has delayed system turnovers and impacted our timeline for the start of hot functional testing. Based on our recent production trends, we now expect to start hot functional testing during the second half of March and start loading fuel during July. Starting hot functional testing, and fuel load on this time line would support a November 2021 in-service date with up to one month of flexibility remaining in the schedule. Now certainly, risks remain to this schedule. These risks may be thought of in four segments: first, the completion of system turnovers leading up to hot functional testing; second, the successful completion of hot functional testing; third, the completion of system turnovers leading to fuel load; and fourth, an orderly transition from fuel load to an efficient startup of the unit. Successful completion of hot functional testing this spring would significantly decrease the remaining operational risk to Unit 3 completion, although certainly, challenges and risks will remain in focus as we focus to fuel load. ITAAC submittal and review is expected to continue to accelerate and will remain an area of focus. To date, 180 ITAAC have been submitted to the NRC. We expect approximately 20 additional ITAAC to be submitted by the start of hot functional testing and the remaining 200 to be submitted during hot functional testing and as we approach fuel load. Direct construction for Unit 4 is now over 75% complete. Last month, we started integrated flush, and we expect initial energization to occur during March. To support the November benchmark, we will need to average construction completion of approximately 1.5% per month, which is in line with the average rate achieved during the period from last November through January. As we progress in 2021, construction production is expected to increase in support of our upcoming testing milestones. And importantly, as Unit 3 nears hot functional testing, we expect to shift additional resources to Unit 4 to increase our current pace of construction completion. Now turning to cost. During the fourth quarter, Georgia Power allocated its remaining contingency, plus an additional $5 million and subsequently added new contingency of approximately $171 million to support completion of the project. We estimate the pandemic has extended the schedule for both units by approximately three to four months at an estimated cost to Georgia Power of between $150 million and $190 million. This cost is embedded in our updated total project cost estimate. While COVID-19-related impacts were significant drivers of the change of our capital cost forecast, future risks, including construction productivity, were contributing factors. Earlier this week, the Georgia Public Service Commission unanimously approved VCM 23, which included project capital costs through June 30, 2020. As a part of the order, Georgia Power was directed to work with the PSC staff to develop a mutually agreeable recommendation to the commission by the end of March regarding the process, timing and substance of filings related to the transition of Unit 3 costs into base rates. Additionally, Georgia Power files VCM 24 today. The months ahead represent a critical and exciting time for Vogtle. The project team has worked tirelessly amid conditions none of us could have imagined just a year ago. Our employees, contractors, co-owners and community partners should be commended for their perseverance and dedication to the completion of this important project. Drew, I'll turn it over to you now for an update of the financials and our outlook.\nDrew Evans: Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. I hope you are all safe and healthy. As Tom mentioned, we had a very strong year in 2020 despite the many challenges we faced. For the full year, our adjusted earnings per share was $3.25, $0.14 higher than last year and $0.03 above the top of our guidance range. 2020 was certainly defined by milder weather and sales impacts due to COVID-19, and we were able to substantially overcome both, as evidenced in our solid results. Looking at the details. Retail electric sales on a weather-normalized basis were down by $0.14 year-over-year, including impacts related to COVID-19, offset by customer growth. Milder temperatures throughout 2020 resulted in an additional $0.21 negative earnings per share variance, as compared to the prior year. We substantially mitigated both weather and COVID-19 impacts through thoughtful, disciplined O&M reductions as well as continued investment at our state-regulated utilities. On a combined basis, these factors allowed us to exceed our adjusted EPS guidance for the year. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results as compared to 2019 is included in today's release and earnings package. COVID-19 impacts reduced our projected weather normal kilowatt hour sales by 3% for the year. The slight uplift from the residential sector persisted throughout 2020 with more people working from home. In the fourth quarter, we continued to see improvement in kilowatt hour sales for both the commercial and industrial customer classes. However, we do not believe we have seen a full recovery in these sectors yet. Factoring in impacts across all customer classes, our non-fuel revenues declined by approximately $300 million, which was at the lower end of our original estimates as the pandemic began. As Tom mentioned, an important part of our COVID-19 response was, and continues to be, supporting our customers. We have worked closely with customers across our regulated utilities, offering special payment plans for those with past due account balances and have delayed disconnects. You can see the impact of our COVID-19-related protocols for disconnects in our customer counts for the year. Last year, our state-regulated utilities added just over 53,000 new residential electric customers and nearly 30, 000 residential natural gas customers. Our electric customer growth was approximately 30% higher than our expectations. Overall, we estimate that about 80% of the residential electric customer growth in 2020 was due to continued and accelerating in migration to the region, particularly in Georgia. The remainder is likely related to the steps we have taken to keep customers connected during the pandemic, particularly through the use of extended payment plans. During this time, customer arrears have tended better than we anticipated across our operating companies. We also have constructive mechanisms approved by the commissions in many of our states, allowing us to address incremental COVID-19-related costs, including bad debt expense. Those will be considered in future regulatory proceedings. In a trend that differentiates our service territory, the pandemic has strengthened population and job growth in the Southeast, particularly in Georgia, which is one of the fastest-growing states in the United States. Robust economic development in the Southeast region is also a positive indicator that our key states are weathering the pandemic relatively well. In 2020, we saw new investment of nearly $6 billion and nearly 25,000 jobs created across Georgia and Alabama. In fact, Georgia was the number two state in the country for job creation in December. And just last week, Microsoft confirmed Atlanta as a major East Coast hub, which is expected to bring significant job growth and investment. Our state-regulated operating companies play an integral role in leading economic development efforts in each of their states. Turning now to our expectation for 2021. Our guidance range for the year is $3.25 to $3.35 per share. In the first quarter of 2021, we expect – we estimate that we will earn $0.84 per share. Included in our full year guidance is an assumption that we will see modest impacts – continue to see modest impacts on retail sales from COVID-19, which we expect to continue to mitigate through thoughtful cost control. Additionally, we expect total retail sales growth normalized for any short-term COVID-19 impact to be flat to 1%. For this foreseeable future, this expected growth rate is driven by a combination of customer growth and ongoing improvements in energy efficiency. Moving now to our outlook for long-term growth. We see our long-term EPS growth rate in the 5% to 7% range, consistent with adjusted earnings in the range of $4 to $4.30 per share by 2024. With 90% of total projected earnings over the five-year plan horizon coming from our state-regulated utilities, our expected EPS trajectory has a solid foundation. Likewise, our history of constructive regulation, stable credit metrics and ongoing focus on cost control serve to underscore the achievability of our plan. Looking more closely at our long-term capital investment plan, we continue to allocate 95% of our capital investment to our state-regulated utilities. Our capital investment plan of $40 billion for 2021 through 2025 includes annual projected rate base growth at our state-regulated utilities of greater than 5% with a continued emphasis on transmission, transportation and distribution, modernization and resilience. For Southern Power, the cumulative five-year investment plan is comprised entirely of previously approved renewables projects and maintenance capital for the existing generation fleet, which is over 90% contracted for the next 10 years. Any incremental growth opportunities at Southern Power are expected to enhance the long-term financial plan and be largely self-funded and credit-neutral. Importantly, this CapEx projection for the whole company does not include amounts for accelerated fleet transition and any associated transmission growth, nor does it account for new generation projects at Southern Power. We will be evaluating a number of paths over the next few years as it relates to the fleet transition, but we do not establish placeholders in our plan with virtually all projects being known in the process of, or having already been engineered, or have already begun. Taking a look at the balance sheet, we currently forecast no equity needs over our five-year plan horizon, even when considering the potential increase in capital investment I just described. We believe we are well-positioned to further strengthen our balance sheet and to improve our credit metrics materially during this time. I'll highlight that, in January, we became the first large-cap utility in the U.S. to publish a sustainable financing framework and the days that followed Southern Power issued a five-year green bond under that framework that resulted in a record low coupon rate. This framework highlights Southern's ongoing commitment to a wide range of sustainability and social issues and should allow us to leverage our work in these areas to help optimize our balance sheet and benefit our customers. We will also continue our focus on societal priorities in the upcoming years. Before I turn it back to Tom, I'd like to echo his opening remarks. The resilience of our business has demonstrated amid the pandemic is a testament to the hard work our employees put forth every -- each and every day. The ability of our employees to continually provide outstanding service to our customers, combined with the support of our communities and the constructive relationships we maintain with regulators and public officials, underpin our ability to also deliver such solid performance. I would like to particularly thank the people who work for, and on behalf of, the customer -- our customers to meet our priorities even in light of a global pandemic. We are all grateful. Thank you. Tom, I'll turn it back over to you.\nTom Fanning: Thanks, Drew. I'd like to circle back to your comments on fleet transition. Southern has two primary goals related to our greenhouse gas emissions. The first is to achieve zero -- net zero emissions by 2050. We will work constructively with the Biden administration to accelerate this time frame, as national policy evolves. The second one is to put in place an interim milestone to achieve a 50% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030. Regarding the intermediate goal, we achieved our 2030 goal in 2020, with preliminary greenhouse gas emissions now down 52%. Now, certainly, 2020 was an unusual year, and we may see emissions reductions move around 50% for the next two years, but we believe we'll be sustainably above our 50% reduction level by 2023. While ESG issues have received increasing attention by investors over the past few years, at Southern Company, these issues have consistently received the heightened attention they deserve, and it's being recognized. We were once again ranked as one of the world's most admired companies by Fortune Magazine. The DiversityInc rated us as a top company for ESG. And for the fifth consecutive year, we've received a perfect Corporate Equality Index score by the Human Rights Campaign. In addition, we're very proud of the A- rating we recently received from the Carbon Disclosure Project for our environmental transparency and leadership. We recognize the value our investors and stakeholders place on transparency, and we are committed to continued enhancements. And before closing, I want to just take a moment to recognize our leadership transition announcement that we made at the end of last year. My trusted friend and one of my closest confidantes, Mark Lantrip, plans to retire in April after dedicating 40 years to Southern Company. Mark has helped position Southern Company as a leader that is building and shaping the future of energy. We are grateful for the many contributions Mark has made to our business, and we'll miss him dearly and wish him all the best. Mark is passing the baton to Chris Kaminski, who has been a valued member of the Southern Company leadership team for many years, holding key positions at both Georgia Power and Southern Power. In closing, over the past decade that I have been privileged to serve as CEO of Southern Company, I can think of no other year that I've been prouder of the way we've conducted ourselves and managed our business. Our engagement with and empathy for our employees, customers and communities in 2020 demonstrates our enduring commitment to be a citizen wherever we serve. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. We’ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nTom Fanning: Julien, how are you?\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey. Good morning. Hey, buddy. Hey, thanks for the time. Congrats, guys. So maybe just to kick things off on a light basis. $5 to $7, how are you thinking about the base here? You guys gave the $4 to $4.30 number, but can you talk about what's the baseline year for that? And then if I can throw it in there at the same time, that five to seven, how are you thinking about upside CapEx, perhaps some of the spending opportunities that exist in a, shall we say, post-Vogtle world, as you think about this transition? How does that fit against the numbers you guys gave today?\nTom Fanning: Yes, man. You bet. We did it a little bit differently this year. The way you should think about the base here is kind of a 2024 number. That is $4 to $4.30 and then kind of reverse engineer back from that at the kind of top end of that range at a growth rate of 7% and the bottom end of that range at kind of 5%. That's how we come up with 5% to 7%. Certainly, as we move from 2021 to 2022, there's a step change, but I think you can see the math from there. With respect to that range, it's fascinating. As Drew pointed out, and I've said this before on other calls, the way we do CapEx forecasting, in my opinion, is really conservative. What we put out there, I know some companies – I shouldn't say this, but perhaps some companies use CapEx forecast to plug to a growth rate. We do almost the opposite. We only put in our CapEx forecast what we know or what we firmly expect, and we do not put in placeholders. So what is absent in that CapEx forecast is capital allocated to future projects at Southern Power. You know that we allocate, on current practice, about $0.5 billion a year to that business unit but none of that is showing up in the CapEx forecast. Certainly, as you look at fleet transitions that I think, from a policy standpoint, are being pushed in Washington, you will see growth in renewables. And it wouldn't surprise me that there will be plenty of opportunities to do more solar and wind in the future. Right now, we think those markets are very tough. So we elect not to put anything in the forecast. Secondly, we don't include any fleet transition. I think it's been very clear and I've been in the press here recently, talking about the transition of the fleet and working with the Biden team to think about how to move net zero 2050 to something sooner. I know President Biden, now would like to put out a marker of net zero by 2035 for this industry. We certainly – I think we can certainly achieve that. There are certain policy choices that will have to be made along the way, but we are engaged constructively in that conversation. If you go to something like that, I think you will accelerate fleet transition. Again, nothing in this CapEx forecast is reflected, associated with any of retiring coal plants sooner and building more renewables or more gas assets in this time frame. Drew, what else would you add?\nDrew Evans: I think the only thing I'd supplement maybe, Julien, is that if you kind of look at our historical performance, go back as far as 2018, we've been clearly growing rate base and growing earnings in sort of the 4% to – 5% to 7% range historically. We've had some changes in that pathway a little bit because we've taken penalty for Vogtle construction. We'll see a little bit of that change as we move Vogtle into service. And so you get a bit of a [lag] [ph] in the way our growth rate might be delineated on a linear basis. But what we're really trying to express is a longer-term potential for the business as we invest capital into it. Then I think the other important point that Tom made is that we have quite a bit of generation modernization to do that we have not yet quantified, because I think there are a number of ways that that could play out. If you think about broadly what that looks like, we've got about 10 gigawatts of coal fired facilities in aggregate. We'll have to find some method of meeting the reliability requirements of our customer base without relying on coal as a primary source of megawatt hour production. And so I think we'll -- over the next couple of years, we'll take stock of emerging technology, different things that work within our system to meet the goals that we have, and we'll kind of lay those out for you as they reveal themselves to us.\nTom Fanning: Hey, one other point, Drew, is -- and I didn't mention this one, I'll bet you there's at least another $1 billion of transmission. So when we talk about transitioning the fleet, it isn't just choices in generation, which we think we'll have. We do believe that there will be additional transmission associated with this transition that will occur. I see that easy to achieve over this five-year period. One last thing, and I'm not often doing this, but complementing the analyst community, you guys have done the math. If you back out this penalty period, we have been earning about 6% EPS growth once you exit that period. And so that actually creates a nice line going into the future. Julien, anything I didn't cover you wanted?\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Listen, so let me clarify that, if I can, when does some of this CapEx start hitting, right? Whether the transition on generation, when you guys have this 4% rate base trajectory through 25?\nTom Fanning: Yeah, I mean…\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: It seems like that already translates to the 5% to 7%. When you actually get this CapEx uplift, it sounds like that drives you higher within that 5% to 7% range, as I'm hearing you, right, as you get some…\nTom Fanning: Yeah. So you know, and you all know that we never try to get ahead of our regulatory processes, and each of our states follow their own version of an integrated resource plan. And so as we file those plans and file, whether it's RSE in Alabama or the three-year rate case at Georgia or PEP in Mississippi, that we'll make those plans known and approved by the commissions as appropriate. The other thing you should know is that heading into this call, I guess, we showed 4% for electric, it was 5% probably a week ago, it's rounding, okay? So it's in the middle of 4% to 5%. The gas business is growing at like 10%. And so the overall support the growth trajectory, that is supportive of 5% to 7%. And you're right. When you think about starting with $4 to $4.30, there is upside to a mid-range forecast there based on how we deploy capital over time. But I think even with the base forecast that we're showing you today, we're within that range, and we're comfortable at 5% to 7% within that range in 24.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yeah. Absolutely, great. Thank you to clarifying that all. Best of luck guys. Talk soon.\nTom Fanning: Thank you so much. Appreciate you calling in.\nOperator: Thank you. And up next, we have a question from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead sir.\nTom Fanning: Hey, Steve. How are you?\nSteve Fleishman: Thank you. Hi, Tom. Good afternoon. So just a question, if you end up determining that you cannot meet the November deadline for Vogtle for some reason, could you remind us like do you have to -- what do you have to do with anything then? Do you have to make a filing, or is it just – you just – just update the schedule?\nTom Fanning: That's right. We'll just update the schedule. And certainly, I think we're pretty good about letting people know when things change. We did the press release with the expressed intention of moving off of what we had thought, I guess, back in October, may have been July HFT. As this third wave of COVID hit, it really did just knock us for a loop in terms of productivity and pushed us now. And actually, the numbers continue to move just a wee bit, but it puts us from February now into March. No, it really just has a function of cost, Steve, and it really depends on when you incur the costs, okay? So if it is a delay that causes us to get into hot functional tests, the amount of both units in Georgia Power dollars is about $40 million. If it's items – I mean, Unit 3 only, it's about $25 million. If, however, we shift, and it is a delay kind of from fuel load to in-service, in other words, it's some punch list that causes us to have a delay in the in-service declaration of a unit, it goes way down. For both units, it's $25 million a month. For Unit 3, it's only $10 million a month. So depending on when the delay occurs, there would just be an additional cost that we're factoring in. And I will say that with this now new estimate on estimated cost to complete, this $176 million we've added this time, it includes a November in-service for both units. It includes a CPI number that is like 1.8. It includes a construction per month that is consistent for Unit 4 with our experience from November to January. Now my hope is that we can improve on those numbers but we wanted to put out what we thought was a thoughtful and kind of reasonably conservative estimate so we wouldn't have to come back to this number again. No assurances that won't happen, but that's where we are.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay.\nTom Fanning: Steve I think…\nSteve Fleishman: So I know there’s November…\nTom Fanning: I think the only thing mechanically that occurs is that we continue to function under a penalty ROE until we bring the unit into service, and so that would be the material thing to model.\nDrew Evans: That's right. You start losing that penalty rate once you declare in service.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. So because I know for a long time, we've had November as this like regulatory approved deadline. If there's a new deadline or whatever, you don't need to kind of go back and seek a new deadline or anything like that. You just finish it and go through the VCM process?\nTom Fanning: Yes, sir. There's nothing special. The VCM process we've been filing has been really effective at kind of handling those issues. And as you guys know, you follow those VCM filings very clearly. That's kind of the way we would handle it.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And then 1 other just quick Vogtle question. I think there's a new – or there's going to be a new chair of the NRC. Does that matter at all for you in terms of your timing process? I doubt that they're too much in the weeds of everything. But...\nTom Fanning: Oh, no, I would argue. Hey, look, Steve Kuczynski and I visit with each of the NRC commissioners regularly. And we're very happy with Chris Hanson. We were very happy with Kristine Svinicki. My sense is Chris Hanson will, I think, run an NRC consistent with the principles of Svinicki. Hanson has experience in a variety of fronts in Congress with Dr. Ernie Moniz, who's on our Board. We know him well, and we think he will be terrific. The NRC yeah -- the NRC is a very tough regulator, but we think they're very fair, and they've been very constructive in their treatment of Vogtle 3 and 4.\nSteve Fleishman: Great. Thanks so much.\nTom Fanning: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead sir.\nTom Fanning: Hey, Michael, glad to have you with us.\nMichael Weinstein: Yeah. Glad to be here. So the -- just to follow-up on Julien's question, so the 4% rate base growth profile for electric, and if I look at that overall, I'm just thinking that once you get to the 2024 range and the penalties are out, right, the -- moving into penalties is the main driver of 5% to 7%, I'm guessing through 2024…\nTom Fanning: Yeah. That…\nMichael Weinstein: Yeah.\nTom Fanning: Yeah. Michael, excuse me those penalties will expire as we move to in service for the units. They expire by degree. So in effect, once we declare Unit 3 in-service and then Unit 4 in-service, we actually have a step change in growth that we're really not saying a whole lot about. The 5% to 7% is what we think we can sustain and have sustained over recent history without this step change in the Vogtle uplift moving in the rate base.\nMichael Weinstein: Okay. I mean, because I was thinking that the 5% to 7% is simply sustained by increasing the CapEx profile and increasing the rate base growth profile once…\nTom Fanning: It is a sustainable growth rate beyond the uplift from Vogtle.\nMichael Weinstein: It sounds like it actually any -- yeah. I'm thinking any increase in renewable CapEx or recognization CapEx actually improves on that 5% to 7% versus…\nTom Fanning: Yes, It would, absolutely.\nDrew Evans: Mike, we’re pretty focus the durability of spend, I think, is the way we think about it, and so trying to extend the 5% to 7% range as long as we can. The -- if you sort of draw the line between what we've laid out today is our earnings expectation for 2021 and then take a look at our projection for 2024, you can see that sort of falls without -- outside of the range that we've intimated at 5% to 7%. We think of that really as being more of a longer term growth -- sustainable growth rate in absence of single large project risk.\nTom Fanning: Yeah. And then the way you should think about it is almost a reverse engineer. Start with what we're thinking about is a reasonable range with this CapEx forecast for 2024 and then reverse engineer backwards using 5% to 7% growth rate. We think that's the right way to think about this.\nMichael Weinstein: And it looks like most of the increase or almost one-third of the increase in CapEx in this new plan is at Southern Power. That's this year. And is that just a function of you just not wanting to put placeholders in there? So each year, you'll simply have a major increase around the same amount for?\nTom Fanning: No. And I'd say in particular to Southern Power, it was more that we had earmarked capital in 2020 that was committed but not yet in place. We'll actually deploy that capital in 2021, which increases the expenditure. But if you look at it over a longer period of time, a three-year, five-year average, very close to the $500 million that you're marking that business.\nTom Fanning: Yes. So I mean, let me just say it another way. Were we to spend the dollars that we allocate in our minds to Southern Power, that's an additional $2.5 billion to the CapEx forecast that doesn't show up in the forecast.\nMichael Weinstein: Yes. That's right. I hear where you're heading.\nTom Fanning: Yes. And like I said before, there's probably an additional $1 billion. I mean, who knows on transmission. And then whatever happens on fleet transition, there's something else there. Yes. I think what we've given you is kind of a bare bones approach, which we think is appropriate. And then that supports the 5% to 7%.\nDrew Evans: And what we've represented for Southern Power in particular at $1.3 billion are committed projects that we will execute on within this calendar year or represents maintenance of those facilities over time.\nMichael Weinstein: Now I mean, you mentioned that the increase or the extension of tax credits and the promotion of renewable power by the Biden administration going forward could present more opportunities for Southern Power. In the past, you've been a little more, I guess, more cautious on it, saying that returns have been tight. You've been pulling back on spending at Southern Power. Are we – are you reversing that stance now? Are you thinking of it may be more opportunity, not less going forward?\nTom Fanning: No. In fact, I thought I'd put those words in there. The returns have been – the terms and conditions have been tougher. The duration of the contract has been shorter. And so all I'm saying is, and that's really the reason why we don't include capital commitment to Southern Power in our forecast, we think it's a very tough market. Now I was only postulating that with an administration that is really bullish on pushing more renewables, that the markets may get a little looser. But they're certainly not now.\nMichael Weinstein: Got you. Okay. Thank you.\nTom Fanning: Yes, sir. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.\nTom Fanning: Hello, Angie. How are you?\nAngie Storozynski: Great. How are you guys. So I have a question, one, obviously, about Vogtle. So we're all waiting to have functional testing to start. We have some concerns if it's going to uncover any sort of catastrophic flaw of the project. I mean is there anything you guys have learned about Unit 3 that would make you feel more comfortable with how hot functional testing is going to go?\nTom Fanning: Yes. Angie, knock on wood, and don't show overconfidence or what have you. The Chinese plants that went through hot functional test went through it pretty well without any incident. We have every reason to believe that will be our experience as well. I just can't predict the future. That's all. There’s nothing that I know of that will cause me concern right now. And hey – and Angie, the other thing is we've done all these partial system tests along the way. And I think we've even surprised ourselves how well those have gone.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. And something completely unrelated. Given what's been happening in Texas, and I understand it's a completely different design of market, but we're about to have this debate about what types of plants are needed on the system in order to maintain a reliable electric service. And again, lots of differences between your service territory and ERCOT. But in light of what has happened, is it changing your perspective of what types of power plants your utilities should have? You talked about some generation replacement. How does, again, the last week play into this planning?\nTom Fanning: Yeah. Let me offer up a few comments. I was on CNBC this morning, and it was a great topic of interest and discussion about what about Texas. And it really gets into this idea of organized markets versus integrated regulated markets. You know I've been a fan of integrated regulated markets. Through our integrated resource plans, we can effectively begin with optimal capacity portfolios and iterate around transmission that supports those optimal portfolios. We can also build in resilience requirements and socialize those costs over a large customer base. And we've been able to do that for a decade, and it has worked exceedingly well. A real criticism of the so-called organized markets is that they are set up -- and I think the people inside those markets operate quite rationally, but they either operate within punitive constraints or profit incentives that are broadly -- and every market is different, as you know, but they're broadly designed around maximizing short run marginal properties. So minimizing short run marginal cost, that's no way to build a portfolio. And I would argue that the outcome of those designs is, as you start to include other value attributes like transmission, like -- I'm sorry, not transition, like a backup generation, like resiliency, like other things, you get to really complex approaches in a market. I think PJM has been wrestling with how to value all those things. I guess, the second thing is that you really don't get a sense of valuing long-term base-load capacity as it should be. And I think we've seen that in the markets where, for heaven's sakes, very valuable nuclear generation is getting priced out of the market. And those valuable assets, especially as we consider a carbon reduced future are getting priced out of the market and getting turned down. I think there’s better approaches here. And so it was interesting. Not only did I have this conversation on CNBC this morning, and I guess I'll just be a little obtrusive about this, but I was called by the Biden administration. From a national security standpoint, what can we do as an industry to avoid these things? Unfortunately, given the market structure of ERCOT, there's probably not a lot we can do in the near term. But I think long-term, this notion of resilience versus reliability, reliability is how we handle the vagaries of weather and economic load and machine reliability under known conditions. Resilience is the idea of keeping your system up under unknown and unexpected conditions. Whether they be operational, weather-driven or cyber related, these are things we must do as an industry. And I think Southern is in a good position to help lead that dialogue.\nAngie Storozynski: Awesome. Thank you.\nTom Fanning: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nTom Fanning: Hello Andrew. Thanks for joining us.\nAndrew Weisel: Hi. Good afternoon. Question -- you talked quite a bit about the updating the decarbonization strategy. I guess my question more specifically to Georgia is given the political changes, it's now a pretty solid blue state that Saturday Night Live made a funny sketch about. Does that change your thinking at all about how the pace and the method at which you plan to reduce your carbon footprint in Georgia coming into the IRP?\nTom Fanning: We don't try to evaluate long-term strategies based on the current politics of any state or elected official or what have you. We have, I think, a very solid long-term plan. Now, I think the broader kind of issue that we'll be dealing with is how fast do we want to get to net zero and how will we do that. How will we evaluate the relative merits of just trading out one form of generation for another. How will we help fund and push some long research and development, energy innovation as solutions that will make this transition, hopefully, easier and more efficient in the years ahead? CNBC also did a segment just before mine with Bill Gates. He and I are on the American Energy Innovation Council, and we're working on several ideas. Whether they are storage-based, hydrogen-based fourth generation, nuclear-based or even energy efficiency-based, letting energy innovation work for us and maybe joining into a reimagined partnership with government to make that happen is, I think, a very wise energy policy to follow. And like I say, we're already engaged with the Biden administration on some of those concepts, and I look forward to their ideas as they advance.\nAndrew Weisel: Okay. I guess, maybe a different way to ask a similar question is you're very – you're ahead of schedule as far as your interim carbon emission reduction goal for 2030. Do you see opportunity to accelerate the net zero target from 2050 currently?\nTom Fanning: Sure. I think it really is a matter, though, of working with our local jurisdictions in each of the states. To do that in a wise manner. So we'll be doing that.\nAndrew Weisel: Okay, great. And one unrelated question. On dividends, the growth has obviously been fairly modest at $0.08 or about 3% per year. I recognize the high current payout ratio, but you talked about the Vogtle penalties going away in 12 and 24 months and then the 5% to 7% earnings growth thereafter. What's your current thinking on the outlook for dividend growth once we're past the Vogtle construction?\nTom Fanning: So of course, that's a decision of the Board, and we'll make obviously recommendations to the Board. But you guys can do the math as well as we do. And I'm looking at my friend, Drew Evans, right now and kind of laughing. I have a certain half-life with my career here. Certainly, as we grow into this long-term earnings guidance that we've put before you, one of the choices that I think the people that follow me will be able to make very easily will be whether to take the dividend payout ratio down perhaps below 70% or whether to increase the rate of growth of dividends per share. That is certainly a strategic option on the table. But we'll carry that with the Board at the right time.\nDrew Evans: Yes. No, I'd just say, Andrew, we've been incredibly protective of our creditworthiness. We're very focused on ratings and conversations with the rating agencies related to Vogtle construction in particular. And we think it's most prudent to hold dividend growth at a modest level until we come out from under the large-scale construction that we're performing down in Augusta. Once we get through Vogtle and headline risk is behind us and our credit metrics start to strengthen in the categories we think are more at home with how we've operated in the past, we'll start to take a look at what dividend policy would be. And we'll also really start to hone in on what our target credit rating might be. Southern has operated at a -- as a premium to its peer group relatively in PE in periods where we didn't post headline risk. And in periods where our credit was a little bit stronger than where we stand today, and so all these things are going to be considerations as we go forward.\nTom Fanning: And consistent with what Drew just said, we typically say it on every call, we didn't say it yet, one of the other outcomes of this reset and moving to these higher rates, not just earnings per share growth improvement, cash flow improvement is pretty significant, over $800 million in increased cash flow per year.\nDrew Evans: That’s right.\nAndrew Weisel: Terrific. Thank you very much.\nTom Fanning: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead sir.\nTom Fanning: Hi, Jeremy. How are you?\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good. Thanks for having me. Good afternoon.\nTom Fanning: Good afternoon.\nJeremy Tonet: Just want to reach out to the 2024 guidance as you laid out there. And thinking about Georgia, the Georgia Power ROE and recovery of Vogtle overspend. If you could paint any kind of broad strokes on what assumptions might be baked in on those two items into your guidance there?\nTom Fanning: We're always, I think, reasonably cautious and relatively conservative on our guidance. The only thing I would just say is that for the system, it is a reasonable estimate of what we expect to earn across the system. We're not pushing numbers in order to hit those ranges.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just one on 2021 itself guidance there implies, kind of, a smaller step up year-over-year. Are there any meaningful drivers to this outside of Vogtle ROE penalty?\nDrew Evans: No. I would say that the Vogtle ROE penalty is the single largest driver that depresses earnings in 2021, almost $0.24 a share related to our constructions there, very consistent with an agreement that was reached with the commission a couple of years ago.\nJeremy Tonet: Very helpful. That’s it for me. Thanks.\nTom Fanning: You bet.\nDrew Evans: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And we now have a question from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nTom Fanning: Hi, Michael. How are you?\nMichael Lapides: I’m well. Thank you for taking my question. There's been some interesting dynamics at the FERC with some of the utilities having made filings regarding having the FERC review potentially a grid operator like structure in the Southeast. Can you just give your views on where you think that's going? What do you think the point is? What do you think the consensus is? You talked a little bit about the difference between regulated markets and the merchant power markets. And it just made me think of having seen a little bit of those filings and trying to understand where the long-term goal is.\nTom Fanning: The long-term goal is for us to not break what's working. And so when you look at these markets down here, we've been able to provide for clean, safe, reliable power for decades for our customers' benefit. And the data just overwhelmingly supports that. When you look at the so-called organized markets, I think there's a certain amount of chaos in those markets where I think, originally, people with great goodwill thought they would reap great benefits. I don't think the risk return that we see in those markets benefits customers at all. You know recently, we've submitted, we think, even an improvement to our own wholesale markets. That is the same effort, which, frankly, is a model that allows us to benefit renewables, particularly solar in a more efficient way, and it broadens the market to bring in people like Duke and TVA and others. And so we've broadened the market. I think we've made it more attractive to renewables because we believe that renewables are going to be really important as we transition the fleet. We'll continue to seek ways to improve our markets over time, but they're working well. I can't believe anybody would find the wisdom to throw that out right now.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, Tom. Much appreciate it.\nTom Fanning: Yes, sir. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have a question from the line Paul Fremont with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.\nTom Fanning: Hello, Paul. Great to hear from you.\nPaul Fremont: Great talking with you. My first question is a pretty technical question. For Southern Power, are the targeted investments inclusive of tax equity, or are the – or does that represent your share of what you are planning on spending?\nDrew Evans: I would say that today, this represents our share. But as we evaluate all of these projects and as they go into commercial operation, we've looked at a number of alternatives or ways to optimize the returns that we receive there. This 1.3 actually represents all capital being deployed at Southern Power.\nTom Fanning: And I think the big chunk of that is a wind deal. There is a little bit of a storage deal. The wind deal, we kind of like. It's got the 10-year profile. Where we did a lot of the tax equity, I guess, was on the solar. We had the big pop in one year, and we didn't particularly like the impact of all that in our financials.\nDrew Evans: So Southern Power is an animal [ph]. I would say that rather than us trying to define an amount of capital that we're interested in deploying there, projects tend to draw capital from the parent when they can meet certain criteria. Many of the things that we found over the last couple of years have been largely in the solar – I'm sorry, in the wind arena because we're able to find better contract terms, better contract counterparties, and construction risk is generally handled by others. And we've been pretty fortunate, I think, the last couple of years this particular plan includes a couple of identified wind transactions. And as Tom said, two battery transactions in the California marketplace where we're building attendant to our own solar, and that will give us a tremendous amount of experience in attaching storage to solar that we'll look at deploy across the balance of fleet and in other locations.\nPaul Fremont: Great. And then my second question, if I go back to staff testimony, I think what they were suggesting back in the fall was that you guys were hoping to get all of your ITAAC – remaining ITAAC approvals done by March, which would have been like over 240. But now when we get to mid-March, which is the start date of your hot functional testing, they'll still be about 200 that you need to get in hand based on the numbers that you provided today.\nTom Fanning: That's right.\nPaul Fremont: What gets you to, sort of, accelerate the level of ITAAC approvals to such a high extent to allow you to load the fuel in July?\nTom Fanning: You bet. And thank you for -- Paul, for shining light on that important issue. We believe that the ultimate filing of ITAACs, we've accomplished a lot with the NRC, frankly, over the life of this project, and we've shrunk down, what was it, about 875 or something down to about 4.25 or somewhere. And we've adopted the practice of the UIN. That is we filed the form and substance of an ITAAC and have that approved. So really, all we have to do now is essentially fill in the blanks as to the result of a test. As a result, by working with the NRC in this constructive way, I think once we get the systems in place to submit the results in the ITAAC, I think the ITAAC process is going to go really well. Like I say, the NRC has been great in this regard. And recall, we got NRC personnel all over the plant, working with us to make sure all this happen. Paul, the issue was not ITAACs. The issue is getting the systems done, getting the turnover appropriate with the testing appropriate and, the paper, as we pointed out before, appropriate, so that we can file in -- put in the values in these ITAACs and submit them. So I said this, I think, on the last call, and I made a big deal about it, when I say paper, it almost feels too glib. This idea of having engineers present, this would be back to our own, the NRC, that will evaluate the as built condition of the plant and harmonizing that to the design basis of the plant and making sure it exactly meets our standards, is really taking a lot of time, and it is a complex exercise. The most important thing we can do is assure that we have quality. That will permit the ITAAC process to go well. Frankly, it will permit the testing processes that we will do now HFT to go well. So the filing of ITAAC is simply associated with system turnover of these important processes within the plant.\nOperator: Mr. Fremont, do you have any further questions?\nPaul Fremont: No, thank you.\nTom Fanning: Thanks, Paul.\nOperator: Thank you sir. And now we have a question from the line of Andrew Levi with HITE Hedge. Please go ahead sir.\nTom Fanning: Andrew, how you're doing?\nAndrew Levi: I’m all right. I think most of my questions were answered. I was taken as listening this call, you'll probably get Vogtle before you're seeing offshore wind gets done. What do you think? I think -- bidding on that. It's funny how things happen. So seriously, though, I think I understand everything that you're saying as far as the potential renewable spend and the transmission and possibly distribution around that. Just on -- as far as the time line, so I guess at some point this year, hopefully soother rather than later, we hear from the Biden administration on what their plan is as far as their energy plan. And then probably, I guess, November, hopefully, knock on wood, Vogtle 3 goes into operation. At that point, I guess, is that when you'll kind of have a better idea of how much incremental CapEx is going to be? And I guess, kind of just kind of doing back-of-the-envelope and some conversations I had with you guys, I'm thinking it probably could add 200 basis points to the electric utility rate base growth longer term from the 4% to the 6%. Again, I don't want to put numbers out there that you're not comfortable talking about, but that's kind of like a time line and thinking that I have as far as finding out and will remain that – going with all this.\nTom Fanning: Well, I'll tell you my friend, here's let me give you a couple of ways to think about it. Number one, the key is going to be these IRPs that – where we do this integrated resource planning, no kidding. And so as we submit those and have those approved ultimately with each of our states, we have a very good idea as to how the CapEx forecast will change, whether fleet transition occurs, to what degree, what about transmission, the whole pit, that will be very illuminating. In advance of those important regulatory processes, we already have an ELG kind of requirement put out for our coal unit. And so some of those units are already on the thin economic margin as you add new requirements to them. I think that may cause us to accelerate that conversation with our commissions. But rest assured, you guys -- you know us exceedingly well. I think you and I were laughing with each other not long ago. I think you and I go back maybe 30 years in talking about our dogma in dealing with state regulation. We will not get in front of the regulators and the regulatory processes with you or anyone else. We're going to let those things play out, and then we'll reflect that in our plan but as it shows up.\nDrew Evans: Yes. And Andy, I would just add that this is a complex topic, and I'll just start by saying ELG limitation guidelines, I'd like to use an acronym on the call, which will regulate sort of mercury and slim and a couple of other things that come out of our facilities, we'll have to make some choices about how we – whether or not we control those facilities, put them into limited use or ultimately retire those facilities. The one thing that is certain is that if you look at the technology that's available to us today, it's not a simple substitution of what we currently generate with to what the future might look like. There are certain changes in material science that need to occur. There are certain complexities related to clean, safe and reliable power that have to be met. There are transmission considerations that have to be taken into account. And – but if you wanted to put a big, broad bow to wrap around it, if we have to do 10 gigawatts, and let's say that 7 of that is replacement or that 3 needs to be held in reserve for some period of time, you could think about numerically what the replacement of something like that amount of generation would require and make the assumption that we probably have to do 15% or 20% of that total CapEx in addition in transmission distribution. So there are ways to kind of come around – come to what's the size of this, ultimately, I think, for the company.\nTom Fanning: And so let me give you a head start like what do you want to say. I would argue you have kind of this. I'm giving you caveman math now. So looking at that forecast, I'll bet you, I kind of gave a few numbers already. If you were to fill out our $0.5 billion per year, there's $2.5 billion, add another $1 billion for transmission. And then on top of that, put in some estimate, probably backend loaded on generation replacement. And it's easy to see that I think you could get to don't hold me to this, and we're not forecasting it flat. But added to the CapEx forecast, $5 billion to $8 billion over this time frame. I don't think that's unreasonable. And you can do the math on what that does to your growth rates. That's easy.\nAndrew Levi: Okay, okay. Yeah I can add, subtract, multiply and divide.\nTom Fanning: No, you're a genius. I love this.\nAndrew Levi: Thank you. Thank you very much guys.\nTom Fanning: Oh, you're the best. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And now we have a question from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed sir.\nTom Fanning: Hi, Paul thanks for being with us.\nPaul Patterson: Hi. Good to be here. So just on the COVID impact on Vogtle, it looks like you guys have taken into account not just your current experience but what you expect in the future. And I see what you guys give us good data on how infection rates have been trending. I'm just wondering, what is your expectation going forward about the impact of COVID on construction of Vogtle? And I apologize if I missed this, but are your people getting vaccinated? Are there essential workers that -- it varies from state to state it seems. So I was just wondering -- I was just wondering sort of what -- if you can just elaborate?\nTom Fanning: Yeah. Sure, you bet. So I help lead the ESCC, Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council, for this industry. It started with cyber and went to physical national security matters. It has grown into storm response and now COVID. We have had lots of good dialogue with HHS and a variety of other people about the right classification for utility workers. And you got to be proud of this industry through this crazy hurricane season we had last year, we were able to adopt cutting-edge COVID protocols and get the lights back on, the wires up and the plants running again. So we've done a good job. I would argue that these guys, particularly the people that work hard to keep the lights on, and our hearts go out to them and thank them for their hard work this year. They should be treated as critical resources for this nation and, therefore, get a very high priority to receive vaccination. It is, though, at the end of the day, despite what the CDC will recommend, it is the option of each state to deploy those vaccines. Now we've got great relations in each state, particularly in Georgia, where Vogtle is, there's been a lot of discussion. And I have to make sure that the folks that can get the vaccines are -- it's available to the folks at the site. I'm going to guess that they may be able to get vaccines maybe within a month or so, but that's highly uncertain and depends upon the ultimate deployment within the state.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. Okay. And then just on COVID-19. I'm just as you know, there have been some papers and stuff out there indicating that perhaps the long-term economic impact could be pretty substantial. When you talk about your plans and just talk about utilities in general, one doesn't really tend to think that that -- your growth or whatever would be impacted by that or that whether there have to be some big deviation if, in fact, the economy does change as a result of COVID-19, or what have you. Is that pretty much -- is that just roughly speaking, sort of, the way to think about this?\nTom Fanning: Paul, let's Drew and I tank this one. Let me go first and I'll shut up and let you go. But here's what I see. From my past – to the Fed, I'd love to break the industrial segment, particularly as a great leading indicator into 10 big segments for Southern. And then not only do I look at period-versus-period results. Virtually all of it is still negative compared to a year ago, obviously, pre COVID. But the momentum statistics are really illuminating now, and they have turned positive. So of the 10 segments that make up something like 80% of our industrial sales, eight of them from a momentum standpoint are turning positive. So that tells me, and with a quote that has been put out there by me in the past, America is learning to live with COVID. A, I think COVID incidences are starting to decline. Maybe that's the normal sign wave we see from any surge, which we just went through. And maybe it's the longer-term effect of getting more people vaccinated. Didn't the Biden administration say recently, they want everybody vaccinated by July or sometime this summer? So surely, that will have an impact. But the economic data I see would show a recovery, I don't know, down 3% last year, maybe up 2% to 3% this year, with industrial starting to respond in a favorable manner.\nDrew Evans: Yes. I always worry about the long-term implications of something like this because the pressure that we put on folks on the margin or the COVID puts on folks on the margin will reveal itself. We've been served 60 days away from COVID ending for now 10 months. And so it'll be interesting to see where we come out. Our expectation around how it would impact our particular customers actually was quite different than what we expected on the onset. So we expected that retail customer usage would increase as people stayed home. We actually expected industrial production would maintain itself – would decline a little bit but not quite as drastically as it has and that commercial customers would be impacted most acutely, and it was very – it was a very different outcome. Commercial customers found a way to do business in a different way, not all, but most. And industrial went through a period where there was sort of a reduction in output as because inventories were at a reasonable level and they could sort of pare down that inventory as they saw the economy progress. We've now seen sort of a tightening in supply in a number of the industrial segments, and production has started to pick up. And there have always been two or three standout weak segments in any particular two or three month period. But as Tom said today, the momentum is generally positive, and we're encouraged by the fact that people have adapted their businesses to earn profits in a way that they maybe hadn't anticipated two years ago. But yes. I or – a year ago, I always worry that the longer anything goes, the more pressure you're going to put on somebody on the margin for sure.\nTom Fanning: In quick punchy stats, non-pharma employment fell nationally 6.2%. In the southeast, it was only 1.7%. Last year, in our territory, we had record job creation, best we've ever done. We're seeing an increase. I want to say the increase in jobs projected in our economic development group that we're showing that's kind of our headlights, up 17%. And then you see events like Microsoft coming in developing Atlanta as their third hub. There are other hubs being, of course, Seattle and San Francisco or Silicon Valley. Look, I'm not going to paint a super rosy picture, but I will say the southeast is really resilient. What's down right now? Chemicals are down mostly. We see that is driven by a large outage in particularly one plant in Alabama.\nDrew Evans: And some global demand for chemical, which might change the marginal economics of a single facility for sure.\nTom Fanning: And what kind of looks bright, it looks like pipeline, especially as we start seeing gas continue to displace coal, the pipes are doing pretty well.\nPaul Patterson: Okay, great. I really appreciate it. Thank you.\nTom Fanning: You bet. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks?\nTom Fanning: Well, thank you. These are exciting times, and I know the folks around our system that made the system perform as well as they did in 2020, just a great debt of gratitude. And I want to commend specifically our recovered workers, particularly IBEW and the folks from the broad building trades all around the system, particularly at Plant Vogtle 3 and 4, the leadership of the IBEW, the leadership of the building trades, they are terrific business partners for us, and we could not have achieved this level of success without their great leadership and the great work of the folks that are members there. I really like the cards we have. I like the fact that we have a lot of optionality no matter what the future holds. And I think we've run this business over the past decade to leave it stronger than ever. We'll get through Vogtle 3 and look forward to the progress there. We'll get through Vogtle 4 next year, and we're off and running. Thanks, everybody, for your attention today, and we'll talk to you soon. That's all.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes The Southern Company fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. You may now disconnect. Thank you all once again. Have a great day.",

            "name": "Drew Evans",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. I hope you are all safe and healthy. As Tom mentioned, we had a very strong year in 2020 despite the many challenges we faced. For the full year, our adjusted earnings per share was $3.25, $0.14 higher than last year and $0.03 above the top of our guidance range. 2020 was certainly defined by milder weather and sales impacts due to COVID-19, and we were able to substantially overcome both, as evidenced in our solid results. Looking at the details. Retail electric sales on a weather-normalized basis were down by $0.14 year-over-year, including impacts related to COVID-19, offset by customer growth. Milder temperatures throughout 2020 resulted in an additional $0.21 negative earnings per share variance, as compared to the prior year. We substantially mitigated both weather and COVID-19 impacts through thoughtful, disciplined O&M reductions as well as continued investment at our state-regulated utilities. On a combined basis, these factors allowed us to exceed our adjusted EPS guidance for the year. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results as compared to 2019 is included in today's release and earnings package. COVID-19 impacts reduced our projected weather normal kilowatt hour sales by 3% for the year. The slight uplift from the residential sector persisted throughout 2020 with more people working from home. In the fourth quarter, we continued to see improvement in kilowatt hour sales for both the commercial and industrial customer classes. However, we do not believe we have seen a full recovery in these sectors yet. Factoring in impacts across all customer classes, our non-fuel revenues declined by approximately $300 million, which was at the lower end of our original estimates as the pandemic began. As Tom mentioned, an important part of our COVID-19 response was, and continues to be, supporting our customers. We have worked closely with customers across our regulated utilities, offering special payment plans for those with past due account balances and have delayed disconnects. You can see the impact of our COVID-19-related protocols for disconnects in our customer counts for the year. Last year, our state-regulated utilities added just over 53,000 new residential electric customers and nearly 30, 000 residential natural gas customers. Our electric customer growth was approximately 30% higher than our expectations. Overall, we estimate that about 80% of the residential electric customer growth in 2020 was due to continued and accelerating in migration to the region, particularly in Georgia. The remainder is likely related to the steps we have taken to keep customers connected during the pandemic, particularly through the use of extended payment plans. During this time, customer arrears have tended better than we anticipated across our operating companies. We also have constructive mechanisms approved by the commissions in many of our states, allowing us to address incremental COVID-19-related costs, including bad debt expense. Those will be considered in future regulatory proceedings. In a trend that differentiates our service territory, the pandemic has strengthened population and job growth in the Southeast, particularly in Georgia, which is one of the fastest-growing states in the United States. Robust economic development in the Southeast region is also a positive indicator that our key states are weathering the pandemic relatively well. In 2020, we saw new investment of nearly $6 billion and nearly 25,000 jobs created across Georgia and Alabama. In fact, Georgia was the number two state in the country for job creation in December. And just last week, Microsoft confirmed Atlanta as a major East Coast hub, which is expected to bring significant job growth and investment. Our state-regulated operating companies play an integral role in leading economic development efforts in each of their states. Turning now to our expectation for 2021. Our guidance range for the year is $3.25 to $3.35 per share. In the first quarter of 2021, we expect – we estimate that we will earn $0.84 per share. Included in our full year guidance is an assumption that we will see modest impacts – continue to see modest impacts on retail sales from COVID-19, which we expect to continue to mitigate through thoughtful cost control. Additionally, we expect total retail sales growth normalized for any short-term COVID-19 impact to be flat to 1%. For this foreseeable future, this expected growth rate is driven by a combination of customer growth and ongoing improvements in energy efficiency. Moving now to our outlook for long-term growth. We see our long-term EPS growth rate in the 5% to 7% range, consistent with adjusted earnings in the range of $4 to $4.30 per share by 2024. With 90% of total projected earnings over the five-year plan horizon coming from our state-regulated utilities, our expected EPS trajectory has a solid foundation. Likewise, our history of constructive regulation, stable credit metrics and ongoing focus on cost control serve to underscore the achievability of our plan. Looking more closely at our long-term capital investment plan, we continue to allocate 95% of our capital investment to our state-regulated utilities. Our capital investment plan of $40 billion for 2021 through 2025 includes annual projected rate base growth at our state-regulated utilities of greater than 5% with a continued emphasis on transmission, transportation and distribution, modernization and resilience. For Southern Power, the cumulative five-year investment plan is comprised entirely of previously approved renewables projects and maintenance capital for the existing generation fleet, which is over 90% contracted for the next 10 years. Any incremental growth opportunities at Southern Power are expected to enhance the long-term financial plan and be largely self-funded and credit-neutral. Importantly, this CapEx projection for the whole company does not include amounts for accelerated fleet transition and any associated transmission growth, nor does it account for new generation projects at Southern Power. We will be evaluating a number of paths over the next few years as it relates to the fleet transition, but we do not establish placeholders in our plan with virtually all projects being known in the process of, or having already been engineered, or have already begun. Taking a look at the balance sheet, we currently forecast no equity needs over our five-year plan horizon, even when considering the potential increase in capital investment I just described. We believe we are well-positioned to further strengthen our balance sheet and to improve our credit metrics materially during this time. I'll highlight that, in January, we became the first large-cap utility in the U.S. to publish a sustainable financing framework and the days that followed Southern Power issued a five-year green bond under that framework that resulted in a record low coupon rate. This framework highlights Southern's ongoing commitment to a wide range of sustainability and social issues and should allow us to leverage our work in these areas to help optimize our balance sheet and benefit our customers. We will also continue our focus on societal priorities in the upcoming years. Before I turn it back to Tom, I'd like to echo his opening remarks. The resilience of our business has demonstrated amid the pandemic is a testament to the hard work our employees put forth every -- each and every day. The ability of our employees to continually provide outstanding service to our customers, combined with the support of our communities and the constructive relationships we maintain with regulators and public officials, underpin our ability to also deliver such solid performance. I would like to particularly thank the people who work for, and on behalf of, the customer -- our customers to meet our priorities even in light of a global pandemic. We are all grateful. Thank you. Tom, I'll turn it back over to you. I think the only thing I'd supplement maybe, Julien, is that if you kind of look at our historical performance, go back as far as 2018, we've been clearly growing rate base and growing earnings in sort of the 4% to – 5% to 7% range historically. We've had some changes in that pathway a little bit because we've taken penalty for Vogtle construction. We'll see a little bit of that change as we move Vogtle into service. And so you get a bit of a [lag] [ph] in the way our growth rate might be delineated on a linear basis. But what we're really trying to express is a longer-term potential for the business as we invest capital into it. Then I think the other important point that Tom made is that we have quite a bit of generation modernization to do that we have not yet quantified, because I think there are a number of ways that that could play out. If you think about broadly what that looks like, we've got about 10 gigawatts of coal fired facilities in aggregate. We'll have to find some method of meeting the reliability requirements of our customer base without relying on coal as a primary source of megawatt hour production. And so I think we'll -- over the next couple of years, we'll take stock of emerging technology, different things that work within our system to meet the goals that we have, and we'll kind of lay those out for you as they reveal themselves to us. That's right. You start losing that penalty rate once you declare in service. Mike, we're pretty focus the durability of spend, I think, is the way we think about it, and so trying to extend the 5% to 7% range as long as we can. The -- if you sort of draw the line between what we've laid out today is our earnings expectation for 2021 and then take a look at our projection for 2024, you can see that sort of falls without -- outside of the range that we've intimated at 5% to 7%. We think of that really as being more of a longer term growth -- sustainable growth rate in absence of single large project risk. And what we've represented for Southern Power in particular at $1.3 billion are committed projects that we will execute on within this calendar year or represents maintenance of those facilities over time. Yes. No, I'd just say, Andrew, we've been incredibly protective of our creditworthiness. We're very focused on ratings and conversations with the rating agencies related to Vogtle construction in particular. And we think it's most prudent to hold dividend growth at a modest level until we come out from under the large-scale construction that we're performing down in Augusta. Once we get through Vogtle and headline risk is behind us and our credit metrics start to strengthen in the categories we think are more at home with how we've operated in the past, we'll start to take a look at what dividend policy would be. And we'll also really start to hone in on what our target credit rating might be. Southern has operated at a -- as a premium to its peer group relatively in PE in periods where we didn't post headline risk. And in periods where our credit was a little bit stronger than where we stand today, and so all these things are going to be considerations as we go forward. That's right. No. I would say that the Vogtle ROE penalty is the single largest driver that depresses earnings in 2021, almost $0.24 a share related to our constructions there, very consistent with an agreement that was reached with the commission a couple of years ago. Thank you. I would say that today, this represents our share. But as we evaluate all of these projects and as they go into commercial operation, we've looked at a number of alternatives or ways to optimize the returns that we receive there. This 1.3 actually represents all capital being deployed at Southern Power. So Southern Power is an animal [ph]. I would say that rather than us trying to define an amount of capital that we're interested in deploying there, projects tend to draw capital from the parent when they can meet certain criteria. Many of the things that we found over the last couple of years have been largely in the solar – I'm sorry, in the wind arena because we're able to find better contract terms, better contract counterparties, and construction risk is generally handled by others. And we've been pretty fortunate, I think, the last couple of years this particular plan includes a couple of identified wind transactions. And as Tom said, two battery transactions in the California marketplace where we're building attendant to our own solar, and that will give us a tremendous amount of experience in attaching storage to solar that we'll look at deploy across the balance of fleet and in other locations. Yes. And Andy, I would just add that this is a complex topic, and I'll just start by saying ELG limitation guidelines, I'd like to use an acronym on the call, which will regulate sort of mercury and slim and a couple of other things that come out of our facilities, we'll have to make some choices about how we – whether or not we control those facilities, put them into limited use or ultimately retire those facilities. The one thing that is certain is that if you look at the technology that's available to us today, it's not a simple substitution of what we currently generate with to what the future might look like. There are certain changes in material science that need to occur. There are certain complexities related to clean, safe and reliable power that have to be met. There are transmission considerations that have to be taken into account. And – but if you wanted to put a big, broad bow to wrap around it, if we have to do 10 gigawatts, and let's say that 7 of that is replacement or that 3 needs to be held in reserve for some period of time, you could think about numerically what the replacement of something like that amount of generation would require and make the assumption that we probably have to do 15% or 20% of that total CapEx in addition in transmission distribution. So there are ways to kind of come around – come to what's the size of this, ultimately, I think, for the company. Yes. I always worry about the long-term implications of something like this because the pressure that we put on folks on the margin or the COVID puts on folks on the margin will reveal itself. We've been served 60 days away from COVID ending for now 10 months. And so it'll be interesting to see where we come out. Our expectation around how it would impact our particular customers actually was quite different than what we expected on the onset. So we expected that retail customer usage would increase as people stayed home. We actually expected industrial production would maintain itself – would decline a little bit but not quite as drastically as it has and that commercial customers would be impacted most acutely, and it was very – it was a very different outcome. Commercial customers found a way to do business in a different way, not all, but most. And industrial went through a period where there was sort of a reduction in output as because inventories were at a reasonable level and they could sort of pare down that inventory as they saw the economy progress. We've now seen sort of a tightening in supply in a number of the industrial segments, and production has started to pick up. And there have always been two or three standout weak segments in any particular two or three month period. But as Tom said today, the momentum is generally positive, and we're encouraged by the fact that people have adapted their businesses to earn profits in a way that they maybe hadn't anticipated two years ago. But yes. I or – a year ago, I always worry that the longer anything goes, the more pressure you're going to put on somebody on the margin for sure. And some global demand for chemical, which might change the marginal economics of a single facility for sure."

            "name": "Tom Fanning",
            "content": "Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted earnings per share for 2020 that exceeded our guidance range. In addition, we have a solid outlook for 2021, and importantly, we are raising our projected long-term earnings per share growth rate. But before we turn to more on our year-end business update, I'd like to share some thoughts on 2020. In 2020, we essentially saw four pandemics: health, economic, social and political. Southern Company demonstrated excellence and resilience on every front, including prioritizing the health and safety of our workforce and communities, overcoming decreased electric demand while delivering both, strong financial and superior operating results, and continuing to address racial injustice and working with policymakers to advance a cleaner energy future. First, the health pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic was, of course, the first and primary challenge that we faced last year and one that continues to impact our communities today. From developing a pandemic response reentry playbook, that was ultimately leveraged by many peer companies, to setting up a medical village at the Vogtle construction site and making heroic progress towards completion of those units, we placed the health and safety of our employees as a top priority. So by taking care of our workforce, we were able to continue taking care of our customers. The economic pandemic. Beginning in March and April of last year, the world has experienced significant economic duress. Southern Company originally projected a $250 million to $400 million loss in revenue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Through thoughtful, disciplined O&M reductions, we were able to mitigate the estimated now $300 million revenue loss that we have experienced, while still providing reliability and industry-leading customer satisfaction to our customers. As well, our long-term efforts with the states that we serve on economic development efforts continue, helping capital investment and job growth in the communities we're privileged to serve. The social pandemic. I am also proud of our ongoing commitment to foster racial justice. For years, this has been an effort of Southern's to focus on building a healthy culture. Even before the unrest last summer, we initiated an effort to donate $50 million to historically black colleges and universities. Last summer, I told you that meaningful discussions were underway across our company related to our actions and response. And while these conversations will continue, an initial outcome is that we have refocused our efforts towards a more holistic goal of diversity, equity and inclusion, ensuring that all groups are welcomed, well-represented, engaged and fairly treated throughout the organization. As an example of this commitment, the Southern Company Foundation recently announced a partnership with Apple, where each are investing $25 million to launch the Propel Center, a new digital learning hub, business incubator and global innovation headquarters located in Atlanta for students throughout the nation of historically black colleges and universities. And finally, the political pandemic. I also want to address the political discord that our nation has experienced over the past several months. At Southern, we have consistently prioritized working with policymakers regardless of political party, and we have been working constructively with the Biden administration for months. In fact, we have already engaged in matters related to energy policy, especially the transition to a net zero carbon future, as well as on matters related to national security. You'll see in the appendix a letter I sent to President elect Biden pledging our support. As we continue to engage with the new administration as well as legislators and regulators at both federal and state levels, our positions will continue to focus on energy policies that can enable a smart transition and be informed by our key objectives of providing clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to our customers. So let's now turn to an update on plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. We remain focused on meeting the November 2021 and November 2022 regulatory approved in-service dates for Units 3 and 4, respectively. With the start of hot functional testing expected in only a few weeks, we now expect a November completion for Unit 3. For Unit 4, we continue to utilize an aggressive site work plan as a tool to provide margin to the regulatory approved November 2022 in-service date. Unit 4's current site work plan targets a third quarter 2022 in-service date. From a cost perspective, Georgia Power's share of the total project capital cost forecast increased by $176 million, largely reflecting estimated COVID-19 impacts and other costs, along with a replenishment of contingency to fund future expected risks that will include lower productivity rates and increased support costs. As a result, Georgia Power recorded an after-tax charge of $131 million during the fourth quarter. 2020 marked another year of significant progress at the site. Throughout the year, as some other major projects around the country were shutting down or delayed due to COVID-19, Georgia Power and the Vogtle site team worked tirelessly to implement measures to keep the project progressing while prioritizing the safety of our workforce and the surrounding community. Similar to what was experienced across much of the United States during the last two months of the year and earlier this year, we saw a surge in COVID-19 cases at the Vogtle site, which, as you can see on Slide 6, peaked around the beginning of January. Since the onset of the pandemic and most acutely during the fourth quarter of 2020, the impact from COVID-19 have included high absenteeism and disruptions to planned or ongoing work as we isolated personnel. We estimate the pandemic has extended the schedule for both units by approximately three to four months, consuming much of the remaining margin to the November 2021 in-service date for Unit 3 and several months of margin for Unit 4. Unit 3 direct construction is now approximately 98% complete, and hot functional testing is expected to start in the coming weeks. On our last call, we identified three key risk factors to our timeline: electrical productivity, subcontractor performance and what we call paper closure. Recall, paper closure relates to the turnover of systems to the testing group to help ensure that the as-built condition of the plant meets design specifications. Over the past few months, COVID-19 has hurt site productivity, negatively impacted electrical production and impaired our ability to close paper issues that facilitate timely system turnovers and ultimately, ITAAC submittals. The combination of these factors has delayed system turnovers and impacted our timeline for the start of hot functional testing. Based on our recent production trends, we now expect to start hot functional testing during the second half of March and start loading fuel during July. Starting hot functional testing, and fuel load on this time line would support a November 2021 in-service date with up to one month of flexibility remaining in the schedule. Now certainly, risks remain to this schedule. These risks may be thought of in four segments: first, the completion of system turnovers leading up to hot functional testing; second, the successful completion of hot functional testing; third, the completion of system turnovers leading to fuel load; and fourth, an orderly transition from fuel load to an efficient startup of the unit. Successful completion of hot functional testing this spring would significantly decrease the remaining operational risk to Unit 3 completion, although certainly, challenges and risks will remain in focus as we focus to fuel load. ITAAC submittal and review is expected to continue to accelerate and will remain an area of focus. To date, 180 ITAAC have been submitted to the NRC. We expect approximately 20 additional ITAAC to be submitted by the start of hot functional testing and the remaining 200 to be submitted during hot functional testing and as we approach fuel load. Direct construction for Unit 4 is now over 75% complete. Last month, we started integrated flush, and we expect initial energization to occur during March. To support the November benchmark, we will need to average construction completion of approximately 1.5% per month, which is in line with the average rate achieved during the period from last November through January. As we progress in 2021, construction production is expected to increase in support of our upcoming testing milestones. And importantly, as Unit 3 nears hot functional testing, we expect to shift additional resources to Unit 4 to increase our current pace of construction completion. Now turning to cost. During the fourth quarter, Georgia Power allocated its remaining contingency, plus an additional $5 million and subsequently added new contingency of approximately $171 million to support completion of the project. We estimate the pandemic has extended the schedule for both units by approximately three to four months at an estimated cost to Georgia Power of between $150 million and $190 million. This cost is embedded in our updated total project cost estimate. While COVID-19-related impacts were significant drivers of the change of our capital cost forecast, future risks, including construction productivity, were contributing factors. Earlier this week, the Georgia Public Service Commission unanimously approved VCM 23, which included project capital costs through June 30, 2020. As a part of the order, Georgia Power was directed to work with the PSC staff to develop a mutually agreeable recommendation to the commission by the end of March regarding the process, timing and substance of filings related to the transition of Unit 3 costs into base rates. Additionally, Georgia Power files VCM 24 today. The months ahead represent a critical and exciting time for Vogtle. The project team has worked tirelessly amid conditions none of us could have imagined just a year ago. Our employees, contractors, co-owners and community partners should be commended for their perseverance and dedication to the completion of this important project. Drew, I'll turn it over to you now for an update of the financials and our outlook. Thanks, Drew. I'd like to circle back to your comments on fleet transition. Southern has two primary goals related to our greenhouse gas emissions. The first is to achieve zero -- net zero emissions by 2050. We will work constructively with the Biden administration to accelerate this time frame, as national policy evolves. The second one is to put in place an interim milestone to achieve a 50% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030. Regarding the intermediate goal, we achieved our 2030 goal in 2020, with preliminary greenhouse gas emissions now down 52%. Now, certainly, 2020 was an unusual year, and we may see emissions reductions move around 50% for the next two years, but we believe we'll be sustainably above our 50% reduction level by 2023. While ESG issues have received increasing attention by investors over the past few years, at Southern Company, these issues have consistently received the heightened attention they deserve, and it's being recognized. We were once again ranked as one of the world's most admired companies by Fortune Magazine. The DiversityInc rated us as a top company for ESG. And for the fifth consecutive year, we've received a perfect Corporate Equality Index score by the Human Rights Campaign. In addition, we're very proud of the A- rating we recently received from the Carbon Disclosure Project for our environmental transparency and leadership. We recognize the value our investors and stakeholders place on transparency, and we are committed to continued enhancements. And before closing, I want to just take a moment to recognize our leadership transition announcement that we made at the end of last year. My trusted friend and one of my closest confidantes, Mark Lantrip, plans to retire in April after dedicating 40 years to Southern Company. Mark has helped position Southern Company as a leader that is building and shaping the future of energy. We are grateful for the many contributions Mark has made to our business, and we'll miss him dearly and wish him all the best. Mark is passing the baton to Chris Kaminski, who has been a valued member of the Southern Company leadership team for many years, holding key positions at both Georgia Power and Southern Power. In closing, over the past decade that I have been privileged to serve as CEO of Southern Company, I can think of no other year that I've been prouder of the way we've conducted ourselves and managed our business. Our engagement with and empathy for our employees, customers and communities in 2020 demonstrates our enduring commitment to be a citizen wherever we serve. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Julien, how are you? Yes, man. You bet. We did it a little bit differently this year. The way you should think about the base here is kind of a 2024 number. That is $4 to $4.30 and then kind of reverse engineer back from that at the kind of top end of that range at a growth rate of 7% and the bottom end of that range at kind of 5%. That's how we come up with 5% to 7%. Certainly, as we move from 2021 to 2022, there's a step change, but I think you can see the math from there. With respect to that range, it's fascinating. As Drew pointed out, and I've said this before on other calls, the way we do CapEx forecasting, in my opinion, is really conservative. What we put out there, I know some companies – I shouldn't say this, but perhaps some companies use CapEx forecast to plug to a growth rate. We do almost the opposite. We only put in our CapEx forecast what we know or what we firmly expect, and we do not put in placeholders. So what is absent in that CapEx forecast is capital allocated to future projects at Southern Power. You know that we allocate, on current practice, about $0.5 billion a year to that business unit but none of that is showing up in the CapEx forecast. Certainly, as you look at fleet transitions that I think, from a policy standpoint, are being pushed in Washington, you will see growth in renewables. And it wouldn't surprise me that there will be plenty of opportunities to do more solar and wind in the future. Right now, we think those markets are very tough. So we elect not to put anything in the forecast. Secondly, we don't include any fleet transition. I think it's been very clear and I've been in the press here recently, talking about the transition of the fleet and working with the Biden team to think about how to move net zero 2050 to something sooner. I know President Biden, now would like to put out a marker of net zero by 2035 for this industry. We certainly – I think we can certainly achieve that. There are certain policy choices that will have to be made along the way, but we are engaged constructively in that conversation. If you go to something like that, I think you will accelerate fleet transition. Again, nothing in this CapEx forecast is reflected, associated with any of retiring coal plants sooner and building more renewables or more gas assets in this time frame. Drew, what else would you add? Hey, one other point, Drew, is -- and I didn't mention this one, I'll bet you there's at least another $1 billion of transmission. So when we talk about transitioning the fleet, it isn't just choices in generation, which we think we'll have. We do believe that there will be additional transmission associated with this transition that will occur. I see that easy to achieve over this five-year period. One last thing, and I'm not often doing this, but complementing the analyst community, you guys have done the math. If you back out this penalty period, we have been earning about 6% EPS growth once you exit that period. And so that actually creates a nice line going into the future. Julien, anything I didn't cover you wanted? Yeah, I mean... Yeah. So you know, and you all know that we never try to get ahead of our regulatory processes, and each of our states follow their own version of an integrated resource plan. And so as we file those plans and file, whether it's RSE in Alabama or the three-year rate case at Georgia or PEP in Mississippi, that we'll make those plans known and approved by the commissions as appropriate. The other thing you should know is that heading into this call, I guess, we showed 4% for electric, it was 5% probably a week ago, it's rounding, okay? So it's in the middle of 4% to 5%. The gas business is growing at like 10%. And so the overall support the growth trajectory, that is supportive of 5% to 7%. And you're right. When you think about starting with $4 to $4.30, there is upside to a mid-range forecast there based on how we deploy capital over time. But I think even with the base forecast that we're showing you today, we're within that range, and we're comfortable at 5% to 7% within that range in 24. Thank you so much. Appreciate you calling in. Hey, Steve. How are you? That's right. We'll just update the schedule. And certainly, I think we're pretty good about letting people know when things change. We did the press release with the expressed intention of moving off of what we had thought, I guess, back in October, may have been July HFT. As this third wave of COVID hit, it really did just knock us for a loop in terms of productivity and pushed us now. And actually, the numbers continue to move just a wee bit, but it puts us from February now into March. No, it really just has a function of cost, Steve, and it really depends on when you incur the costs, okay? So if it is a delay that causes us to get into hot functional tests, the amount of both units in Georgia Power dollars is about $40 million. If it's items – I mean, Unit 3 only, it's about $25 million. If, however, we shift, and it is a delay kind of from fuel load to in-service, in other words, it's some punch list that causes us to have a delay in the in-service declaration of a unit, it goes way down. For both units, it's $25 million a month. For Unit 3, it's only $10 million a month. So depending on when the delay occurs, there would just be an additional cost that we're factoring in. And I will say that with this now new estimate on estimated cost to complete, this $176 million we've added this time, it includes a November in-service for both units. It includes a CPI number that is like 1.8. It includes a construction per month that is consistent for Unit 4 with our experience from November to January. Now my hope is that we can improve on those numbers but we wanted to put out what we thought was a thoughtful and kind of reasonably conservative estimate so we wouldn't have to come back to this number again. No assurances that won't happen, but that's where we are. Steve I think... I think the only thing mechanically that occurs is that we continue to function under a penalty ROE until we bring the unit into service, and so that would be the material thing to model. Yes, sir. There's nothing special. The VCM process we've been filing has been really effective at kind of handling those issues. And as you guys know, you follow those VCM filings very clearly. That's kind of the way we would handle it. Oh, no, I would argue. Hey, look, Steve Kuczynski and I visit with each of the NRC commissioners regularly. And we're very happy with Chris Hanson. We were very happy with Kristine Svinicki. My sense is Chris Hanson will, I think, run an NRC consistent with the principles of Svinicki. Hanson has experience in a variety of fronts in Congress with Dr. Ernie Moniz, who's on our Board. We know him well, and we think he will be terrific. The NRC yeah -- the NRC is a very tough regulator, but we think they're very fair, and they've been very constructive in their treatment of Vogtle 3 and 4. Thanks, Steve. Hey, Michael, glad to have you with us. Yeah. That... Yeah. Michael, excuse me those penalties will expire as we move to in service for the units. They expire by degree. So in effect, once we declare Unit 3 in-service and then Unit 4 in-service, we actually have a step change in growth that we're really not saying a whole lot about. The 5% to 7% is what we think we can sustain and have sustained over recent history without this step change in the Vogtle uplift moving in the rate base. It is a sustainable growth rate beyond the uplift from Vogtle. Yes, It would, absolutely. Yeah. And then the way you should think about it is almost a reverse engineer. Start with what we're thinking about is a reasonable range with this CapEx forecast for 2024 and then reverse engineer backwards using 5% to 7% growth rate. We think that's the right way to think about this. No. And I'd say in particular to Southern Power, it was more that we had earmarked capital in 2020 that was committed but not yet in place. We'll actually deploy that capital in 2021, which increases the expenditure. But if you look at it over a longer period of time, a three-year, five-year average, very close to the $500 million that you're marking that business. Yes. So I mean, let me just say it another way. Were we to spend the dollars that we allocate in our minds to Southern Power, that's an additional $2.5 billion to the CapEx forecast that doesn't show up in the forecast. Yes. And like I said before, there's probably an additional $1 billion. I mean, who knows on transmission. And then whatever happens on fleet transition, there's something else there. Yes. I think what we've given you is kind of a bare bones approach, which we think is appropriate. And then that supports the 5% to 7%. No. In fact, I thought I'd put those words in there. The returns have been – the terms and conditions have been tougher. The duration of the contract has been shorter. And so all I'm saying is, and that's really the reason why we don't include capital commitment to Southern Power in our forecast, we think it's a very tough market. Now I was only postulating that with an administration that is really bullish on pushing more renewables, that the markets may get a little looser. But they're certainly not now. Yes, sir. Thank you. Hello, Angie. How are you? Yes. Angie, knock on wood, and don't show overconfidence or what have you. The Chinese plants that went through hot functional test went through it pretty well without any incident. We have every reason to believe that will be our experience as well. I just can't predict the future. That's all. There's nothing that I know of that will cause me concern right now. And hey – and Angie, the other thing is we've done all these partial system tests along the way. And I think we've even surprised ourselves how well those have gone. Yeah. Let me offer up a few comments. I was on CNBC this morning, and it was a great topic of interest and discussion about what about Texas. And it really gets into this idea of organized markets versus integrated regulated markets. You know I've been a fan of integrated regulated markets. Through our integrated resource plans, we can effectively begin with optimal capacity portfolios and iterate around transmission that supports those optimal portfolios. We can also build in resilience requirements and socialize those costs over a large customer base. And we've been able to do that for a decade, and it has worked exceedingly well. A real criticism of the so-called organized markets is that they are set up -- and I think the people inside those markets operate quite rationally, but they either operate within punitive constraints or profit incentives that are broadly -- and every market is different, as you know, but they're broadly designed around maximizing short run marginal properties. So minimizing short run marginal cost, that's no way to build a portfolio. And I would argue that the outcome of those designs is, as you start to include other value attributes like transmission, like -- I'm sorry, not transition, like a backup generation, like resiliency, like other things, you get to really complex approaches in a market. I think PJM has been wrestling with how to value all those things. I guess, the second thing is that you really don't get a sense of valuing long-term base-load capacity as it should be. And I think we've seen that in the markets where, for heaven's sakes, very valuable nuclear generation is getting priced out of the market. And those valuable assets, especially as we consider a carbon reduced future are getting priced out of the market and getting turned down. I think there's better approaches here. And so it was interesting. Not only did I have this conversation on CNBC this morning, and I guess I'll just be a little obtrusive about this, but I was called by the Biden administration. From a national security standpoint, what can we do as an industry to avoid these things? Unfortunately, given the market structure of ERCOT, there's probably not a lot we can do in the near term. But I think long-term, this notion of resilience versus reliability, reliability is how we handle the vagaries of weather and economic load and machine reliability under known conditions. Resilience is the idea of keeping your system up under unknown and unexpected conditions. Whether they be operational, weather-driven or cyber related, these are things we must do as an industry. And I think Southern is in a good position to help lead that dialogue. You bet. Hello Andrew. Thanks for joining us. We don't try to evaluate long-term strategies based on the current politics of any state or elected official or what have you. We have, I think, a very solid long-term plan. Now, I think the broader kind of issue that we'll be dealing with is how fast do we want to get to net zero and how will we do that. How will we evaluate the relative merits of just trading out one form of generation for another. How will we help fund and push some long research and development, energy innovation as solutions that will make this transition, hopefully, easier and more efficient in the years ahead? CNBC also did a segment just before mine with Bill Gates. He and I are on the American Energy Innovation Council, and we're working on several ideas. Whether they are storage-based, hydrogen-based fourth generation, nuclear-based or even energy efficiency-based, letting energy innovation work for us and maybe joining into a reimagined partnership with government to make that happen is, I think, a very wise energy policy to follow. And like I say, we're already engaged with the Biden administration on some of those concepts, and I look forward to their ideas as they advance. Sure. I think it really is a matter, though, of working with our local jurisdictions in each of the states. To do that in a wise manner. So we'll be doing that. So of course, that's a decision of the Board, and we'll make obviously recommendations to the Board. But you guys can do the math as well as we do. And I'm looking at my friend, Drew Evans, right now and kind of laughing. I have a certain half-life with my career here. Certainly, as we grow into this long-term earnings guidance that we've put before you, one of the choices that I think the people that follow me will be able to make very easily will be whether to take the dividend payout ratio down perhaps below 70% or whether to increase the rate of growth of dividends per share. That is certainly a strategic option on the table. But we'll carry that with the Board at the right time. And consistent with what Drew just said, we typically say it on every call, we didn't say it yet, one of the other outcomes of this reset and moving to these higher rates, not just earnings per share growth improvement, cash flow improvement is pretty significant, over $800 million in increased cash flow per year. Thank you. Hi, Jeremy. How are you? Good afternoon. We're always, I think, reasonably cautious and relatively conservative on our guidance. The only thing I would just say is that for the system, it is a reasonable estimate of what we expect to earn across the system. We're not pushing numbers in order to hit those ranges. You bet. Hi, Michael. How are you? The long-term goal is for us to not break what's working. And so when you look at these markets down here, we've been able to provide for clean, safe, reliable power for decades for our customers' benefit. And the data just overwhelmingly supports that. When you look at the so-called organized markets, I think there's a certain amount of chaos in those markets where I think, originally, people with great goodwill thought they would reap great benefits. I don't think the risk return that we see in those markets benefits customers at all. You know recently, we've submitted, we think, even an improvement to our own wholesale markets. That is the same effort, which, frankly, is a model that allows us to benefit renewables, particularly solar in a more efficient way, and it broadens the market to bring in people like Duke and TVA and others. And so we've broadened the market. I think we've made it more attractive to renewables because we believe that renewables are going to be really important as we transition the fleet. We'll continue to seek ways to improve our markets over time, but they're working well. I can't believe anybody would find the wisdom to throw that out right now. Yes, sir. Thank you. Hello, Paul. Great to hear from you. And I think the big chunk of that is a wind deal. There is a little bit of a storage deal. The wind deal, we kind of like. It's got the 10-year profile. Where we did a lot of the tax equity, I guess, was on the solar. We had the big pop in one year, and we didn't particularly like the impact of all that in our financials. That's right. You bet. And thank you for -- Paul, for shining light on that important issue. We believe that the ultimate filing of ITAACs, we've accomplished a lot with the NRC, frankly, over the life of this project, and we've shrunk down, what was it, about 875 or something down to about 4.25 or somewhere. And we've adopted the practice of the UIN. That is we filed the form and substance of an ITAAC and have that approved. So really, all we have to do now is essentially fill in the blanks as to the result of a test. As a result, by working with the NRC in this constructive way, I think once we get the systems in place to submit the results in the ITAAC, I think the ITAAC process is going to go really well. Like I say, the NRC has been great in this regard. And recall, we got NRC personnel all over the plant, working with us to make sure all this happen. Paul, the issue was not ITAACs. The issue is getting the systems done, getting the turnover appropriate with the testing appropriate and, the paper, as we pointed out before, appropriate, so that we can file in -- put in the values in these ITAACs and submit them. So I said this, I think, on the last call, and I made a big deal about it, when I say paper, it almost feels too glib. This idea of having engineers present, this would be back to our own, the NRC, that will evaluate the as built condition of the plant and harmonizing that to the design basis of the plant and making sure it exactly meets our standards, is really taking a lot of time, and it is a complex exercise. The most important thing we can do is assure that we have quality. That will permit the ITAAC process to go well. Frankly, it will permit the testing processes that we will do now HFT to go well. So the filing of ITAAC is simply associated with system turnover of these important processes within the plant. Thanks, Paul. Andrew, how you're doing? Well, I'll tell you my friend, here's let me give you a couple of ways to think about it. Number one, the key is going to be these IRPs that – where we do this integrated resource planning, no kidding. And so as we submit those and have those approved ultimately with each of our states, we have a very good idea as to how the CapEx forecast will change, whether fleet transition occurs, to what degree, what about transmission, the whole pit, that will be very illuminating. In advance of those important regulatory processes, we already have an ELG kind of requirement put out for our coal unit. And so some of those units are already on the thin economic margin as you add new requirements to them. I think that may cause us to accelerate that conversation with our commissions. But rest assured, you guys -- you know us exceedingly well. I think you and I were laughing with each other not long ago. I think you and I go back maybe 30 years in talking about our dogma in dealing with state regulation. We will not get in front of the regulators and the regulatory processes with you or anyone else. We're going to let those things play out, and then we'll reflect that in our plan but as it shows up. And so let me give you a head start like what do you want to say. I would argue you have kind of this. I'm giving you caveman math now. So looking at that forecast, I'll bet you, I kind of gave a few numbers already. If you were to fill out our $0.5 billion per year, there's $2.5 billion, add another $1 billion for transmission. And then on top of that, put in some estimate, probably backend loaded on generation replacement. And it's easy to see that I think you could get to don't hold me to this, and we're not forecasting it flat. But added to the CapEx forecast, $5 billion to $8 billion over this time frame. I don't think that's unreasonable. And you can do the math on what that does to your growth rates. That's easy. No, you're a genius. I love this. Oh, you're the best. Thank you. Hi, Paul thanks for being with us. Yeah. Sure, you bet. So I help lead the ESCC, Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council, for this industry. It started with cyber and went to physical national security matters. It has grown into storm response and now COVID. We have had lots of good dialogue with HHS and a variety of other people about the right classification for utility workers. And you got to be proud of this industry through this crazy hurricane season we had last year, we were able to adopt cutting-edge COVID protocols and get the lights back on, the wires up and the plants running again. So we've done a good job. I would argue that these guys, particularly the people that work hard to keep the lights on, and our hearts go out to them and thank them for their hard work this year. They should be treated as critical resources for this nation and, therefore, get a very high priority to receive vaccination. It is, though, at the end of the day, despite what the CDC will recommend, it is the option of each state to deploy those vaccines. Now we've got great relations in each state, particularly in Georgia, where Vogtle is, there's been a lot of discussion. And I have to make sure that the folks that can get the vaccines are -- it's available to the folks at the site. I'm going to guess that they may be able to get vaccines maybe within a month or so, but that's highly uncertain and depends upon the ultimate deployment within the state. Paul, let's Drew and I tank this one. Let me go first and I'll shut up and let you go. But here's what I see. From my past – to the Fed, I'd love to break the industrial segment, particularly as a great leading indicator into 10 big segments for Southern. And then not only do I look at period-versus-period results. Virtually all of it is still negative compared to a year ago, obviously, pre COVID. But the momentum statistics are really illuminating now, and they have turned positive. So of the 10 segments that make up something like 80% of our industrial sales, eight of them from a momentum standpoint are turning positive. So that tells me, and with a quote that has been put out there by me in the past, America is learning to live with COVID. A, I think COVID incidences are starting to decline. Maybe that's the normal sign wave we see from any surge, which we just went through. And maybe it's the longer-term effect of getting more people vaccinated. Didn't the Biden administration say recently, they want everybody vaccinated by July or sometime this summer? So surely, that will have an impact. But the economic data I see would show a recovery, I don't know, down 3% last year, maybe up 2% to 3% this year, with industrial starting to respond in a favorable manner. In quick punchy stats, non-pharma employment fell nationally 6.2%. In the southeast, it was only 1.7%. Last year, in our territory, we had record job creation, best we've ever done. We're seeing an increase. I want to say the increase in jobs projected in our economic development group that we're showing that's kind of our headlights, up 17%. And then you see events like Microsoft coming in developing Atlanta as their third hub. There are other hubs being, of course, Seattle and San Francisco or Silicon Valley. Look, I'm not going to paint a super rosy picture, but I will say the southeast is really resilient. What's down right now? Chemicals are down mostly. We see that is driven by a large outage in particularly one plant in Alabama. And what kind of looks bright, it looks like pipeline, especially as we start seeing gas continue to displace coal, the pipes are doing pretty well. You bet. Thank you. Well, thank you. These are exciting times, and I know the folks around our system that made the system perform as well as they did in 2020, just a great debt of gratitude. And I want to commend specifically our recovered workers, particularly IBEW and the folks from the broad building trades all around the system, particularly at Plant Vogtle 3 and 4, the leadership of the IBEW, the leadership of the building trades, they are terrific business partners for us, and we could not have achieved this level of success without their great leadership and the great work of the folks that are members there. I really like the cards we have. I like the fact that we have a lot of optionality no matter what the future holds. And I think we've run this business over the past decade to leave it stronger than ever. We'll get through Vogtle 3 and look forward to the progress there. We'll get through Vogtle 4 next year, and we're off and running. Thanks, everybody, for your attention today, and we'll talk to you soon. That's all."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Southern Company Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. All lines have been muted to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, October 29, 2020. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Investor Relations Director. Please go ahead, sir.\nScott Gammill: Thank you, Pema. Good afternoon and welcome to Southern Company’s third quarter 2020 earnings call. Joining me today are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Drew Evans, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you, we’ll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Qs, and subsequent filings. In addition, we will provide non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I’ll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.\nTom Fanning: Thanks, Scott. Good afternoon. And thank you all for joining us. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted results for the third quarter, ahead of the estimate provided on our last conference call. COVID-19 related demand impacts have moderated from the levels we experienced earlier this year. And given results through September, we expect adjusted full year earnings per share to be at the top end of our guidance range. Throughout 2020, our customers and communities have been faced with historic challenges, and our businesses have continued to demonstrate resilience in serving and supporting them. Well COVID-19 has resulted in many employees working from home, nearly half of our employees staff essential facilities and perform essential functions, which means they have been in the field, and in the case of our gas employees and homes and in businesses working daily to ensure the delivery of clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to our customers. Safety and health protocols have never been more important to protect both our employees and our customers. Despite extraordinary circumstances in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and an exceedingly busy storm season, our business model has demonstrated substantial resilience, as we've delivered outstanding service to customers, provided excellent operational reliability and achieved strong year today financial performance. As we reach completion of Vogel Unit 3 and continue significant progress on Unit 4, we will set the foundation for an expected increase of our long-term earnings per share growth rate and improvement of our cash flow and a dramatically improving dividend payout ratio. Let's turn now to an update on plant Vogel Units 3 and 4. We continue to focus on meeting the November 2021 and November 2022 regulatory approved in service dates, and recently updated our work plan for the timing of Unit 3s remaining major milestones. Based on our current work plan, we now expect that the in-service date for Unit 3 to be during the third quarter of 2021 ahead of its November 2021 regulatory approved and service date. Now we continue to utilize an aggressive site work plan for Unit 4 as a tool to provide margin to its regulatory approved in-service date of November 2022 with a current targeted and service date of June 2022. From a cost perspective, Georgia Power share of the total project capital cost forecast is unchanged at $8.5 billion. With Unit 3 direct construction approximately 94% complete, our expectations around the scheduled ranges for reaching major milestones continues to narrow. For about three years, and as we have discussed on prior earnings calls, we have used an aggressive on-site work plan to drive productivity and as a tool to provide the margin to the November regulatory approved in-service date for Unit 3. Now, this strategy has served us well in motivating the workforce, advancing construction progress, providing early testing of systems and components and facilitating earlier identification and mitigation of risks. Indeed, this tool has created margin to the November regulatory approved in-service date. Considering the current pace of construction and milestones reached to date, as well as assumptions for future productivity, we are shifting away from the use of an aggressive site work plan for Unit 3; two, a work plan that reflects our current expectation. Under this updated work plan, we anticipate our next major milestone, hot functional testing to start in January 2021, followed by fuel load in April of 2021. That work plan projects in-service as early as the third quarter of 2021, which provides approximately two to three months of margin to the November regulatory approved in service date. It is important to remember that for Unit 3, we expect hot functional testing could start as late as the end of March of 2021, and fuel load could occur as late as mid-year of 2021, and still support the November regulatory approved in service date. In mid-October, we successfully completed cold hydro testing for Unit 3, which was a major milestone for the project. Since our last call, we also completed civil construction on Unit 3 shield building, started to successfully operate the Unit 3 reactor coolant pumps for the first time and place the Unit 3 turban on its turning gear. As the site prepares for its next major milestone, hot functional testing, critical areas of focus remain the timing of system turnovers and electrical and subcontractor performance. While the site is experienced and managed through two waves of COVID-19, we expect the pandemic will present continued challenges as we work towards completion. Now as we approach hot functional testing, system turnover and testing activities for Unit 3 continue to increase. And in the coming months, we expect ITAAC to middle and review to accelerate. Southern Nuclear and the NRC staff have been working together for years on a plan that provides Southern Nuclear the ability to submit the necessary documentation and allow the NRC ample time to conduct a review of that documentation prior to the Unit 3 fuel load. All of the UI ends or the uncompleted ITAAC notifications have been submitted and accepted by the NRC for both Unit 3 and 4. And nearly 40% of the 399 high ITAAC closure notifications, we call these ICNs, have been verified as complete by the NRC for Unit 3. At this point, ITAAC progress is consistent with our expectations and milestone achievements. Leading up to hot functional testing, we plan to submit over 100 ITAAC for review and verification to the NRC, followed by approximately 100 more during hot functional testing and approximately 50 more as we approach to fuel load. We expect that all Unit 3 ITAAC and ICNs will be submitted and reviewed in a timely fashion to support Unit 3 fuel load. The Vogtle 3 and 4 operations team continues in preparation for the initial fuel receipt later this year, and an increase in pre-operational testing. The team successfully completed the pre-startup safety review by the World Association of Nuclear Operators highlighting the Safety Strong Safety Culture we have developed to position the project for successful startup and operation. We also completed the NRC evaluated emergency preparedness exercise, and received 62 reactor and senior reactor operator licenses, the first operator licenses for Units 3 and 4. This number represents full staffing for both units. These accomplishments set the stage for the site to achieve approval for Unit 3 fuel load. Now let's turn to cost. Based on our most recent assessment, there is no change in the total project capital cost forecast. In the third quarter of 2020, Georgia Power allocated approximately $5 million of the construction contingency to the base capital forecast, reflecting cost risks associated with construction productivity and field support. Now recall, the estimated cost of the time between the site work plans and the regulatory approved November in service dates or a schedule cost margin is embedded in Georgia Power's base capital forecast. Following the update to Unit 3 and Unit 4 site work plans, approximately $90 million of this scheduled cost margin was utilized. The remaining scheduled cost margin and cost contingency combined represent approximately 18% of the remaining estimated cost to complete. As we have said, we expect to utilize all contingency funds as we progress towards completion of the project. Through the remainder of this year and into the first quarter of 2021, the Vogtle team will continue to focus on the final phases of Unit 3 construction, system turnover and testing activities, ITAAC submittals and our transmission -- our transit transition into plant operations ahead of Unit 3s regulatory approved in-service date. At the same time, a ramp up in construction production is underway for Unit 4 related to its major milestones in 2021. While there is still uncertainty, our current expectation is that when we reach completion for Unit 3, ahead of the November 2021 regulatory approved in-service date. Drew, I’ll turn it over to you now for an update on the financials and our outlook.\nDrew Evans: Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. I hope you all are well. As Tom mentioned, we had a very strong quarter. Third quarter adjusted APS was $1.02 per share. While $0.12 lower than last year, it is $0.07 above our estimate for the quarter. One of the drivers of this variance was significantly warmer than normal weather in the third quarter of 2019. The weather impact relative to normal for the third quarter of 2020 was a positive $0.04, last year was a positive $0.14, hence the variance. In addition, we had a modest decline in third quarter of 2020 sales due to COVID-19 resulting in a $0.09 negative impact, which we mitigated through diligent cost control and constructive state regulatory actions at our utilities. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results is included in today's release and the earnings package. Year-over-year through September, the dynamics are very similar. For the first nine months of the year, adjusted EPS was $2.78 per share, which is $0.06 lower than last year. This year's milder temperatures through September resulted in a $0.21 variance in EPS when compared to 2019. COVID-19 impacts year-to-date have reduced income by $0.20, and weather impacts compared to normal added an additional $0.08. Despite these headwinds, we have substantially mitigated both weather and COVID-19 impacts throughout 2020, allowing us to exceed our estimates on an adjusted basis in each of the first three quarters. With the solid results through September, we expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be at the top end of our guidance range of $3.10 to $3.22 per share. We continue to assess the financial impacts of COVID-19 on our business. For the third quarter, the weather normal impact of COVID-19 reduced sales by 3% in the aggregate and slightly better than our baseline expectation. As you would expect, we are still seeing a slight uplift from the residential sector, due to people working from home. The trend for both commercial and industrial customer classes is markedly better relative to the troughs last spring. However, the timeline to full recovery for both sectors remains uncertain. Factoring in impacts across all customer classes year-to-date, our non-fuel revenues came in slightly above our forecast. Our retail sales projection for the full year is unchanged, with the expected overall decline in the range of 2% to 5% on a weather normal basis. Based on results to date, we expect total COVID-19 impacts to be approximately $300 million for the full year. In addition to sales, we are continuing to monitor customer arrears and the potential for an increase in bad debt expense. We have worked closely with customers across our regulated utilities, offering special payment plans for those with past-due account balances. Customer arrears have actually trended better than anticipated across our operating companies and our liquidity position remains robust. Constructive mechanisms have also been put in place by the commissions in many of our states, allowing us to address COVID-19 related cost and bad debt expense in future regulatory proceedings. Additionally, through the first three quarters of 2020, we are on target to meet our annual capital deployment plans. Turning to a brief capital markets update, during the third quarter Southern Company and several subsidiaries raised an aggregate of $3.4 billion, locking in record low coupon rates, increasing our liquidity positions and allowing us to redeem $1 billion of higher rate notes at the parent. Importantly, recall, we still forecast no equity need until at least 2024. From a ratings perspective, during the third quarter, Moody's upgraded Mississippi Power’s senior unsecured long term debt rating to be Baa1. Fitch also upgraded Mississippi Power’s senior unsecured rating to A-minus. Lastly, Fitch moved its outlook to stable for all issuers except Georgia Power. These positive changes demonstrate the continued commitment of Southern Company and our operating companies to financial integrity and strong credit ratings, both of which provides significant benefits to customers and investors. Before I turn it back to Tom, I'd like to highlight our energy mix trends so far for this year. Through September, nearly one-third of our energy supply was from zero carbon resources and coal represented just 16%. We continue to project that for the full year generation from coal could be below 20% for the first time in modern history. Last month, we published a supplemental carbon report for called Implementation and Action Toward Net Zero, in which we outlined our approach to achieving our goal of net zero by 2050. We've made significant progress toward this goal and currently project that we will achieve our 2030 interim goal of a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions as early as 2025. At a high level, we expect our path to net zero to be comprised of several key elements, including continued coal transition, utilization of natural gas to enable this transition, further growth in our portfolio of zero carbon resources, negative carbon solutions, enhanced energy efficiency initiatives, and continued focus on R&D for clean energy technologies. We do look forward to discussing these endeavors with you, as we continue to decarbonize our fleets in the years ahead. With that, Tom, I'll turn it back to you.\nTom Fanning: Thanks Drew. Adding to your comments and reinforcing the notion that Southern is the industry leader in research and development. The United States Department of Energy's Office of fossil energy and the National Energy Technology laboratory recently renewed an agreement with Southern Company to operate the National Carbon Capture Center, located in Wilsonville, Alabama. Through this $140 million agreement, Southern Company will continue to manage and operate the Research Center for an additional five years. Over the past decade, the National Carbon Capture Center has successfully advanced the wide range of technologies toward commercial scale, while improving performance and reducing cost. Southern Company is also partnering with African Gas Technology Institute to sponsor the low carbon resources initiative to accelerate the development and demonstration of low carbon energy technologies. And we recently received the Edison award, our industry's highest honor from the Edison Electric Institute for Southerns' work involving energy storage, research and development through the energy storage Research Center, and industry worldwide hub for battery energy storage, technology testing, evaluation and large scale demonstration in Birmingham, Alabama. Southern Company is providing leadership and technical expertise to advance energy storage, delivering a decarbonized future will require an influx of advanced technology. So it's essential that we leverage collaboration to find and advanced those next generation and transformational solutions. Despite unprecedented circumstances in 2020, our company and employees continue to demonstrate exemplary operational performance, which has translated into solid financial performance for the year today. As we move ahead, key priorities remain operating our utilities at best-in-class service levels, demonstrating cost discipline, and working diligently to bring Vogtle Units 3 and 4 online by the November regulatory approved in service states. We believe that Southern Company is well positioned to successfully execute on these fronts and uphold our goal of achieving an attractive risk adjusted return for our shareholders. In closing, earlier today Georgia Power, now that Paul Bowers plans to retire concurrent with unit three fuel load, expected in April 2021 after a remarkable 42 year career with Southern Company. For more than a decade, he has led Georgia Power to be the premier energy company it is today. From industry leading storm response and customer satisfaction to the growth of a diverse energy portfolio and a deep commitment to the communities we serve, he has positioned the company for continued success. He has led the company through the construction of Vogtle 3 and 4 and will be here as we continue progress at the site and begin loading fuel in unit three. The impact he has had on our company, its employees, our customers and our communities in the state of Georgia is immeasurable. At Southern Company we have strong leadership across our system and operating companies, fostered by our commitment to cross functional training and development. This is how we continue our long standing tradition of effective succession planning and cheering we always have strong leaders ready to continue serving our customers. I am very pleased that Chris Womack, our Executive Vice President and President of External Affairs will succeed Paul. Chris will serve as President of Georgia Power effective November 1, 2020 and assume his additional responsibilities as Chairman and CEO upon Paul's retirement. Now, we knew it would take a remarkable leader to follow after Paul, and we are confident Chris is that leader. With extensive experience leading at the national level, Chris has remained very active and well known in Georgia and across the South. He also previously served as Chief Production Officer and Head of External Affairs for Georgia Power. His depth of experience in the energy industry, government and regulatory affairs and the state will be incredibly valuable as Georgia Power works to continue providing clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy for millions of Georgians. More importantly, Chris leads with a passion for people. The company, its employees, and its customers and its communities are in awfully good hands. One final note, we have thousands of people today working to restore power from Hurricane Zeta that came across New Orleans, but then hit the bulk of its theory and Mississippi, Alabama and even here at Georgia, where we experienced wind gust in excess of 60 miles an hour. My Report as of this call was that at our Mac, we had around 1.2 million customers out and as of 1 o'clock, we're now about down to 1 million customers. So, we've already made some progress. In the days ahead, I know that we will continue our excellent track record of restoring service quickly and not only providing electricity, but hope to the communities we serve. So, thanks to those people for their efforts, and I know they'll work safely. So, thank you for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we're now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead, sir.\nTom Fanning: Hello Julien, thanks for joining us.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey good afternoon. This is Richie here for Julien. How you doing?\nTom Fanning: Hey, Richie. Glad to have you as well.\nUnidentified Analyst: All right. Thanks. I was just curious if you can provide a little bit color comparing the timeline for the hot functional testing from start to finish with what you've allocated looks like roughly 60 days compared to the peer China plant where it seems like 77 days is incited in the news. And I know it might be a direct comparison given labor and other political items, but I'm just curious if you can provide a little context on the differences there?\nTom Fanning: Yeah, well, honestly, the 77 days I think appeared in a magazine article, we've researched it. We can't see where that number came from -- that magazine. We -- I'll just say this, you know, we've had people at the plants -- site, [Indiscernible] as they went through these procedures, we had our own people there, we have people from Westinghouse there. And in fact, the people from Westinghouse that went through startup and hot functional tests, and all of that are now with us at plant Vogel 3 and 4. The people from Westinghouse endorse our plan to complete this test as we have laid it out. So, I don't know where that number comes from. We essentially plan for from the beginning of hot functional tests to kind of fuel load about 100 days, that's comprised 45 days of starting the test and running the test. And then 55 days from assessing kind of where we are at the end of hot functional test to fuel load that will include things like filing the last ITAC. And as we mentioned, I know there's been some conversation about the pace of ITAC tax. Recall, you don't file ITAC every month just because of the passage of time. We file ITAC associated with the turnover of systems associated with the accomplishment of milestone. And so as we laid it out, there's about 100 ITAC round numbers, that before we start hot functional tests that we will file during the test, that's another 100, following the test before fuel loads yet another 50. So, that's very clear I think. The other thing that I don't know, but I'm just guessing here may confuse how you start and begin or the duration of a test. We are very disciplined with what we're calling the start of hot functional tests. And that will involve the pressurization of the reactor area. There's a lot of activities that I guess conceivably you could say are pre-start activities, you could say, began hot functional tests. And maybe that's where they came up with 77. So, let me just finish it with the folks that were there in China are on site here, and they have been constructive and endorse our plan as we put it forward.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. That's very helpful. Appreciate the clarifying remarks there. And then just maybe turning over to Unit 4, I know you guys have indicated here that targeting June 2020, but in VCN 23, it looks like it's just slightly slipping behind the November schedule in terms of percentage complete per month. Just curious if you can provide a little bit of a color there on getting back on track, especially considering the remaining milestones needed to complete with Unit 3 here?\nTom Fanning: Yeah, thanks Richie and in fact, it's really not off track, it's by plan. If you recall, when we went back to the onset of the COVID virus at the site, recall we went through essentially a lessening of density at that site and reducing personnel from say 9,000 to 7,000. That also required us to re-sequence work which we disclosed along the way here. One of the ideas that we put into place was to borrow -- as we brought the numbers down was borrow some personnel from Unit 4 and put them on Unit 3 so we could maintain the progress of Unit 3. We intentionally brought down the productivity of Unit 4 for a period of time. Now in order to achieve November by, no -- in order to achieve the aggressive schedule, for Unit 4, we need about 1.4% per year, per month, in order to hit gym. What we have done is in October achieved 1.4% on Unit 4. We're going to add more people as we finish 3 that will move over to the other unit and drive that number up. So yeah, it would appear that for the month of say, July, August, September that it looks like we really went down on Unit 4. We did that was part of the plan. And now we're ramping back up. And I think our productivity in October is evidence of that.\nDrew Evans: Sort of, an odd concept and you probably shouldn't use the idea of reduced complexity when you're referring to a nuclear site. But I think it is completely fair to say that, as we move through Unit 3 construction, and move the principal focus to Unit 4, that will absolutely see improvements in -- in productivity over time. It's just a natural course of construction.\nTom Fanning: And just recall to that as we went through Unit 3, we had lots of learning. And so one of the things that we've been able to do on Unit 4 is apply those learnings. We see sequencing work. I remember initial energization, we did early on 3, we're going to push that on for and improve productivity there because there was frankly a lot of turn-on and turn-off of the equipment involved in that.\nDrew Evans: And Richie, as we move into or move through hot functional testing will start to provide you probably in the first quarter of next year, good sets of schedules for Unit work completion -- construction completion.\nTom Fanning: And I really like on the material we gave you today. I guess it's page 6, it's just a great visual of where we are on Unit 3. You know, it shows the aggressive timeframe. It shows the November timeframe. And there it shows our actual, well, sure enough, if you look at where we're projecting our expectation to be, and our expectation actually has an additional 30 days that we already had 30 days of contingent -- scheduled contingency in there. We actually added another month, in order to hit the end of the third quarter. I think will provide that kind of information, as Drew was suggesting for Unit 4 now.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. That's very helpful. And then just one more if I can slip it in. I guess, in terms of the operational data points for Unit 3 between now hot functional testing, I know, there's some subcontractor work left to be done, but anything that we should be focusing on here in the next couple months?\nTom Fanning: Yeah. I think there's kind of three things that I'm very mindful of right now. In terms of actual construction, I feel pretty good about that. I really think that our big focus, and we have a SWAT team assigned to this involves kind of the nomenclature of the paper, that is making sure that the as built condition of the systems that we will turnover actually reflect -- are reflected in the engineering plans. So if you want to just broadly call that make sure the paper works, that the as built, conform to the engineering, and that that goes into the itech that we submit them don't underscore that, I mean, that's a big deal. Don't underestimate that. Second, we have said consistently, really, through the past six months or whatever electrical productivity at the site continues to be a pacing factor. We think we have a reasonable schedule to do that. And then thirdly, is subcontractor performance. And I feel confident we'll get there. But it's one of the three areas we have particular focus on now. And what do we mean by that? It's like insulation, like the elevators need to be insulated before we can go through hard functional depth. So it's things like that. It's the seals on perforations through walls to make sure that they are tied up. It's a whole lot of myths that are involved in making sure we can get the hot functional test effectively. Those are the three things, like it's the same again, the paper, electrical and subcontractor performance.\nUnidentified Analyst: All right. Perfect. Thanks very much.\nTom Fanning: You bet. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Continuing on. Our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nTom Fanning: Hello, Shar.\nShar Pourreza: Good morning. How are you guys doing?\nTom Fanning: Fantastic. How are you?\nShar Pourreza: Not too bad. Not too bad.\nDrew Evans: You sound like you're recovering fully. So that's good.\nShar Pourreza: Yeah. \nTom Fanning: Absolutely.\nShar Pourreza: Just a couple of just a couple quick questions here. So, you know, the cost contingency in this schedule cost margin came down to 18% from 20%, when it was replenished on a second quarter call. So 91 million in schedule, cost margin was used during the quarter, as you've sort of highlighted Tom, in your in your prepared remarks? How should we, sort of, think about the shape of the remaining contingency going forward for the remaining months? Is it – should we think about it more front-end loaded or vice versa? As we kind of look to monitor the amounts you'll be utilizing? So just maybe, for us trying to assess if you're kind of on track or not over the next several months as we're trying to -- to monitor the contingencies?\nTom Fanning: Yeah, I mean, look I think we'll get there in terms of everything we know about cost right now. We think we'll use a contingency, and we see no reason to increase it right now. One of the things that gives us a lot of comfort, if you recall, go back to the call where we increased the estimate cost to complete, we actually funded through contingency, a lot of risks, both for Unit 3 and for Unit 4. So the landscape, if you will, a very abilities with respect to cost has really been reduced. Now, is there a chance that we could need more eventually? Sure, we don't know, we're continuing to monitor COVID. The estimate that we had given you so far, and moreover, the estimated time of completion that we now have guided you to, does take into account our experience on COVID. Could COVID get a lot worse, conceivably, but with the pace of COVID impact, that's the kind of estimate we've produced going forward. Little bit about time and so one of the ways that I've been thinking about it is – if look at fuel loads to COD, our budgets, our schedules are sort of 145 days – 144 days, and we plan for something that's probably more like 110. If you compare those two, the Chinese averages, I think they were 138. The best was 112. I think our planning assumptions around fuel load to COD are very, very consistent with a global experience, maybe put it in that term. And so the answer to your question maybe is likely in the very near-term that we'll understand, where we fall between the site schedule and the regulatory and service date for unit.\nDrew Evans: Yeah. There is the – that's a kind of schedule breaking, right? We kind of watched that. I don't know, somewhere in October, November, it's somewhere in there, we have funded that. So we'll keep our eye on that as well, if we ever slipped past the third quarter. Substantially, I get that could have an impact on cost.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. Perfect. Thank you for that. Just maybe just shifting from Vogel per second, just looking at the backdrop, obviously, you've narrowed your forecasts of load impact and the impact on revenues for the year, just maybe, how are you sort of thinking about the recovery into 2021 across the territory? I mean, we've seen and the reason why I ask is, we've seen in this space of, several players that you know, essentially have assumptions that are a lot more conservative, i.e., assuming a gradual recovery versus a V-shaped recovery. But the reality is the – the recoveries a lot faster than what's imbedded in plan and any sort of economic sort of forecasting there. So what do you think is Tom, what are you seeing, as we head into 2021 around that?\nTom Fanning: Yeah. So look, I guess in COVID here, we gave the estimate of 2.5% to 5% load reductions, I'm guessing now, revenue reduction. I'm guessing now we're going to come in around three, 250 million to 400 million we're projecting now around 300 million. So, I think the estimates that we are using assume about a mid year recovery. And we are expecting, since we're down for the year, probably what drew 3% on revenue that we're going to recover back about 3%. Now, that puts us flat to 2019. But I would assume and if you, watch all this stuff on Squawk and all that this morning. That's kind of following what people believe about GDP. So that's kind of my expectation. Drew?\nDrew Evans: Yeah. The only nuance, I'd say is, we came out of the recovery a little bit – or came out of the pandemic from its depths a little bit faster than we anticipated, but the duration may be a bit longer, so that you integrate that and you get to sort of 3% for the year. If we see a continuation of that through 2021, I think both the mechanisms that we've put in place with regard to cost control have been very effective and will serve us very well into next year. We're likely not to see a cost base for the business that's materially different than 2019. And so I think we've got a lot of pathways should the pandemic prove to be depressive to revenue. The other important thing to note though and I think it's in one of our slides, probably page 11 is that the mix of impact has been very different, a little bit different than what we anticipated. Residential is quite strong, commercial was much less than what we had anticipated, although still negative, and industrial has been a little bit deeper than we thought. But as Tom talked about this morning, on Squawk Box, 8 of the 10 measurements that we're taking within the industrial sector are showing generally positive signs, sort of expansive signs through the third quarter.\nTom Fanning: Yeah. And – let me just repeat that and a year over year all down, all the segments. But as I said, this morning, the first derivative, the momentum statistic would show 8 of 10 improving second quarter, third quarter. Hey, and that gives you the opportunity to correct something, I don’t know, on Live TV every now and then you have a brain cramp. Becky asked me, which one was down, and which one was flat. And for some reason, I said, chemicals was flat, chemicals was down. I can't do that, chemicals was down, and that was the only segment down. Petroleum was flat. So I just misspoke on the call and said that chemicals was flat, chemicals was the only one down.\nShar Pourreza: Got it.\nTom Fanning: The rest of the answer was okay.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. Thank you. Just one last one for me, if I may, just shift to annoy and just thinking about Nicor. Obviously, the policy down there is a bit of a disaster. It's a mess. And it's more of an electric issue versus a gas issue. But I know obviously under Pritzker's agenda, he did highlight a repeal of sort of the cliff that you guys have been utilizing. Just love to get your thoughts share with this thing, you find yourself in more frequent rate cases? Are you guys seeing any sort of traction with this part of his agenda?\nTom Fanning: Yeah. So certainly supportive of anything that the governor makes as a priority within Illinois. What I would say about it is that our width is a little bit different than what they have -- what they experienced on the electric side in that -- the way the mechanism works, you have to move in rate case, something out of the rider into primary rate base. And so we actually do that with quite a bit of frequency so that we can absorb the continued construction under what we call QIP. And so even if there were a change at the state level, I don't know that it would necessarily change our behavior materially in the way that one we construct and two that we seek recovery from customers.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. Terrific. Thanks, guys. Congrats.\nTom Fanning: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nTom Fanning: Hello, Mike. We're glad to have you.\nMichael Weinstein: Hi, guys.\nTom Fanning: Hey.\nMichael Weinstein: Hey, glad to be here. Hey, when do you think you'll be ready to quantify that higher expected earnings growth rate that you mentioned, after Vogel's and service? And what would be the first priorities for use of cash flow to achieve higher growth rates?\nTom Fanning: Oh, listen, I think a lot of this is baked in. Let's just kind of -- we're going to get you great detail as we historically do in our end of year earnings call, which I guess it was in February. But it's stuff that we've covered in the past, and therefore I thought it was okay to foreshadow it. As you start, you guys know that there's essentially a penalty rate in which a lot of the Vogel investment is earning right now. And we've still been able to stay within our 4% to 6% growth rate, even with Vogel under a penalty rate. The worst year for that penalty rate frankly, is 2021. As we emerge from clearing Vogel into service, and that's why we thought it was worth talking about now that we're estimating, we are expecting Vogel to clear into in service in the third quarter of 2021. From 2021 on, we start to have large increases in earnings per share. And in fact, the numbers roughly are, as we move from a debt rate, roughly the penalty rate associated with Vogel into a full mix of capitals the net income effect is over $200 million. Now, let's think about that, I don't care whether you use 2018 as your baseline, or 2021 as your baseline, our earnings per share growth rate goes way up. Our capital, our cash flow goes up significantly. And as you would expect, our dividend payout ratio goes way down. And so people after me will have the decision as to what dividend policy they want to carry on from there. But we've said this on earlier calls, we'll give you a great detail in February about all this.\nMichael Weinstein: Great. And thinking ahead, after the post election environment, I mean, are you seeing any new willingness on the part of environmentalist to accept nuclear as part of the integral solution to the global warming problem? And are you still willing to consider additional new nuclear construction? After this -- considering all the hard earned, valuable experience you guys have gained over the years?\nTom Fanning: Hey, Michael, not under my way. Hey, hey, I want to finish up on a CapEx comment too on the last conversation, we just have it. Yeah, absolutely. I would say one of the great thought leaders in America, a guy that was approved 98 to zero by the Senate, as Secretary of Energy was Ernest Moniz, he's on our board. He's published extensively, I think he has credibility on both sides of the aisle, it's very clear that nuclear needs to be a part of this nation's energy profile going forward. And I think we suggested on prior calls, that as a matter of national security for the United States to maintain a profile of consistent nuclear development, I think it's important to us all. And so you, maybe you just saw recently United States signed a pact with Poland to think about new nuclear development, we know that there is new nuclear development considered under the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and UAE. So my sense is the United States will continue. Now, when we think about our projections, and we have some pretty clear plans about how to transition the fleet, our next nuclear unit is probably in the 30s to 40s would be my guess. So back up, how many years 8 years before you start those to get them in service? So somewhere in that timeframe would be my sense. Okay. The other thing that's important on new nuclear is some of the things that we are spending a lot of money on, a lot of brain power, but working with DOE, Bill Gates, he and I are on the Energy Innovation Forum or whatever it is, American Energy Innovation Council. This idea of, kind of the next generation of nuclear that is, the nuclear fuel may have the physical characteristic of not being able to melt down. And therefore you don't need all the containment structures and therefore you drive down capital cost and operating costs. I think there's lots of ideas; SMR. Look, I -- this nation has to stay invested in nuclear in the next 5 years, 10 years, I don't know whether Southern will be or not. Thank goodness for the Senate of the United States, we stayed involved. But I think we're going to have to stay there eventually. \nDrew Evans: One last thing I just wanted to say on the future of CapEx, in the future financial plan. As I finished talking, I kind of had a hint of what do you have to do? And my answer was we have to finish Vogel. If you look at our CapEx provided in the slide, it doesn't really have big placeholders for new stuff. What you see in there is T&D CapEx and some relatively modest generation CapEx. What we're showing you in my view is a pretty conservative, modest case. There's plenty of room to do more, to execute on $500 million a year placeholders at Southern Power, for examples in renewables. We don't have that. So when we show this forecast, it is a conservative forecast, in terms of what we must do to achieve. I want you to make sure you understand that. \nMichael Weinstein: Yeah, That’s kind of what I was asking. So, I was just curious about what other kinds of projects you might be thinking about. I'll leave it there. I'll see to further questions. Okay. Thank you.\nTom Fanning: I think your answer to that question though, is relatively straightforward. If you look at the content of our constructions over the next five years, something like the $38 billion to $40 billion worth $8 or $9 billion per annum, most of that construction is being done in the transmission distribution segment, which is I think a highly important component of our mix and a very durable asset base. And then over the next 10 years, we'll do a very large continent of environmental remediation. And so as we move through those, the next generation of spend is likely to be modernization of the generating fleet. And so it's pretty easy to kind of flush out what the potential for CapEx is over a longer period of time.\nDrew Evans: And I want to assure everybody on the call, when we come up with growth rates, we don't plug CapEx in order to solve to a growth rate. What we're showing you is a reasonably conservative posture with respect to investment. And so therefore there's probably outside. \nMichael Weinstein: Thanks.\nDrew Evans: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. Please proceed.\nDrew Evans: Hello Angie, how are you?\nAngie Storozynski: Doing great. Thank you. Well, I have two questions. One is, so post 42 years at Georgia Power is almost unimaginable. But that change in the leadership has happening off the time when you're reading huge support from the commission. You have elections, the potential changes of the Georgia PFC. So how, how should we think about it, the ongoing support for the project, given the -- again, elections and the management change at Georgia Power? \nTom Fanning: You bet. And thanks. And that's a natural question. So thank you for asking. Look, Paul turns 65 next year. He's had a terrific track record of performance and he works around the clock. We fully blessed Paul's desire to retire and spend time with his grandkids. He's got a home on the beach there in Pensacola. He's got a farm in Alabama. He is absolutely entitled to enjoy his time in retirement. When we think about the right time to do it well, we could've waited till later in ‘21. But you know what, all of a sudden in ’22 now, we start filing the next triennial rate case. We start considering issues like prudence, and we thought it was a lot smarter to have somebody in the saddle well in advance of those issues, not as they are happening.  The other thing that I know Paul and Chris both did a lot of media today. I think it expresses a tremendous amount of confidence by Paul and us all to make his retirement effective with fuel load on three. I think that expresses a lot of confidence in our ability to execute from fuel load to in-service. And let me remind you, Chris Womack, as President of External Affairs, he had a very broad pallet of responsibility.  Chris has been involved in all of the regulatory execution of filings and monitors and everything else. Paul served as the Chief Production Officer. He was in charge of generation at Georgia Power for part of his career. He was also in charge of external affairs at Georgia for part of his career. So what you're getting is, is arguably the top external officer we have in the system. Now in the CEO role at Georgia, he will do a terrific job.\nQ – Angie Storozynski: Okay, thank you. My second question is, so we've always told us that there's going to be some a couple of weeks of additional work between the end of cold hydro testing and the beginning of hot functional testing. Now, I was under the impression, that we're talking maybe three, four weeks. It's a little bit longer than that. Is this something that that you guys identified, during that cold hydro testing that elongated that period, in between those two steps?\nTom Fanning: Oh, Angie, no, nothing at all. The cold hydro testing went fabulous. And in fact, it's kind of funny we got this argument, not argument discussion of 77 days versus whatever. We started doing pre-cold hydro test kind of well in advance of the final cold hydro test, such that, when we finally did the cold hydro test, it just a shade over one day to complete, because we had done all this work in advance, okay? What we have done with the expected schedule, is to give more time for some of this pre-work, so that when we get to hot functional test, it will go smoothly. Some of that pre-work involves the filing of ITAAC 100, kind of before. When I talked generally about paper, that is making sure the as builts meet the engineering specs and therefore, provide us a very easy way to use the UIN process where they already have been approved, to drop in the values and get things done in a very systematic way at the NRC. It gives us more time to deal with the paper. It gives us more time to finish with the electrical. Our pace of electrical is not dramatically different. There is a minor increase. But it is not dramatically different, than our experience that we've been having so far. So, what you see in the absence of an aggressive plan, it should lower the risk of getting to that day, and then executing once we do get to that day.\nQ – Angie Storozynski: Okay. And now completely changing topics, given that in this, the utility sector seems like, we have some sort of strategic app, they don't with every day. I know you guys are busy with Vogel. But would you have any comments about, potential ongoing consolidation, in the electric utilities industry, especially in the southeast? Should we think about it that once Vogel three is online, that's when you're ready to entertain any types of, future growth through acquisitions?\nTom Fanning: Well, now, that's a loaded question. Angie, you've been with us for some time. So I'm going to give you the old response, it remains true. It is a fiduciary responsibility of all CEOs, to seek out opportunities, buying and selling, anything that will accrue to shareholder value is something we should do, okay? And we have demonstrated that, I think over the years. The simple examples for us would have been Southern Company gas, formerly Agio resources was a great by us. And then, when you think about the strategic sales, that we've done since then, be Elizabethtown, Florida City Gas, Gulf power, if it made sense, we bought at attractive levels and sold at levels that were unprecedented from a multiple standpoint, both in the gas industry and the electric industry. And so, we will continue to do that going forward. The big caveat that you rightfully point out is this, is that, throughout probably the remainder of time to complete for Vogel three and four, it makes a lot more sense for us to be doubly focused on getting that done well, and executing. After that, we'll have lots of opportunities to consider thing. But I would argue even after Vogel, we will still maintain that discipline.\nQ – Angie Storozynski: Perfect. Thank you.\nTom Fanning: Thank you. Go ahead.\nQ – Angie Storozynski: Thanks. Operator: Thank you. Our next question … A - Tom Fanning Thanks Angie. Thanks for joining us. You bet.\nOperator: And thank you. Continuing on, our next question comes from line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nA – Tom Fanning: Hello, Sophie. How are you doing?\nQ – Sophie Karp: Hi. Good afternoon. All right. No complain? Hope you guys are doing well also. Congrats on a strong quarter. And thank you for let me in.\nA – Tom Fanning: Thank you.\nQ – Sophie Karp: Well, a lot has been discussed already. But maybe if you could give us a little bit more kind of color on, now that you've done with cold hydro and you're moving forwards the hot functional testing. What are found the factors that kind of can push some date in between, January and March as you outline the excess range? So, what are the factors that can push it sooner or later within that range that we should maybe follow, or think about?\nTom Fanning: Yeah. Sophie if it was me, I'm just giving you my judgment on this call right now. So I laid out three risk areas. And it would be broadly the paper. And then it would be electrical productivity. And then it would be subcontractor performance. I probably did those in order. In other words, maybe the biggest risk factor would be, making sure that the as built condition conformed with the engineering plan and making sure therefore that the process we've laid out on ITAAC will work well. So theoretically, if there's no material difference between what we build and what the engineering plans call for, then you should just be able to drop the values. In other words, the whole UIN process provided for the NRC to already say that the test was fair, the process to get to the test was fair, and therefore, all they really need to do is assess the value of the test. That's why we're able to accomplish so much in a short amount of time. So, I think it's really – and I think the as built condition is in conformity with the engineering, but you have to go out and prove it, you actually have to have what we call a field non-manual labor on the part of vector and Southern to work with our testing ITAAC team to assure that we have conformance in the test. You know, I think we all get high focused on turning the wrenches and connecting the electrical equipment. That is really important. And I can tell you, we have a whole room that we've been there, gosh, I guess every week now here at the last bits of this construction effort, making sure that that's going to go well. I would really focus on that one right now. But look, the others could, too. We could have a lack of productivity, we could have subcontractors that don't perform well, those three areas, I would really focus on the paper right now.\nSophie Karp: Right. So it sounds like a cold hydro test went well, like you're pointed out and so nothing that you've learned from that or gather from that could be – could potentially delay hot functional test. And it sounds like that's not the case.\nTom Fanning: Sophie, no, it went great. In fact, when we finally ran the test, you know, part of cold hydro was to pressurize all this equipment, you know, there's always a tolerance in a test. We went right through all the pressurization activities and only achieve something like a 10th of the allowable variances. I mean, we killed it on that test, it went exceedingly well.\nSophie Karp: Terrific, terrific. And one last one, just to clarify the ITAAC’s approval, should we expect them to sort of come in batches or kind of in a more of a straight line timeline towards the completion, is that something that we should be tracking?\nTom Fanning: It does feel like batches. Yeah, it is lumpy and recall. I'm sure it's our fault. But there was some, some idea out there that we should see ratable monthly, you know, that's not it. Everything is associated with a milestone. So there are systems that we have to finish in order to start hot functional testing. As we finish those systems, we will file ITAAC, those are the first hundred. There are systems that we will test successfully through hot functional, that's the next hundred. And then recall, when we finished the test, essentially you dismantle a lot of the equipment, and check to see how it performed, you actually open the engine, if you will, and look to see how the pistons and the stock I mean, the spark plugs and all that other stuff perform. And sure enough, we'll file the final ITAAC’s on that. So it will look lumpy to you.\nSophie Karp: Got it. All right. Super helpful comments. Thank you so much appreciate it.\nTom Fanning: Always good talking to you. Thank you for being on with us.\nOperator: Thank you. Continuing on our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nTom Fanning: Hi, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Hey, thanks for having me on here.\nTom Fanning: You bet.\nJeremy Tonet: Just want to just want to think about, you know, kind of look into the future a little bit for the period after Vogtle’s completion here. Do you see any kind of incremental investment opportunities that that kind of come out of net zero carbon by 2050 goal that you recently announced here? How should we think generally about renewable spending opportunities across the southern footprint and can you give us an update on the sentiment towards renewable integration across your jurisdictions here and how our commission's thinking about the integration of batteries with solar here, just want to get touch base on all that.\nTom Fanning: Yeah, so let's start with the sort of the long term plan. I think the United States certainly is adopting a net zero carbon posture. We were one of – I would argue that we were the first one to come out with low to know, I think that's equivalent to net zero. Net zero becomes important because it gives us flexibility on the very last kilowatts that we made to be carbon free. In other words, it might have been electric transportation, or it might have been more carbon capture on gas generation, if we are able to make net zero technology, either direct capture, biomass or hybrid, hybrid biomass. Those incremental kilowatt hours at the end of the tail to get to net zero are cheaper. Now, we need to continue to invest R&D to get there. If you look at the state of Georgia, for example, they have been out there in terms of a state. Remember, Georgia Power, I want to say was called out by the solar industry as the investor-owned utility of the year. And in fact, we had no mandate to do solar. They do it because it makes sense in the portfolio and is good for customers. Alabama recently has considered solar and put it into a special focus in some hearings that will be upcoming. I think even gas has some very interesting plans on net zero. So I would argue our state, certainly understand the idea. And our state had been so constructive in the past, in terms of balancing kind of an environmental need, with what's best for customers. I think it's going to be a great place to do business. And I think also, when you consider the role of batteries.  I have said, consistently. I know this is maybe a little bit apart from some of my brothers and sisters in the industry. We are going to need some material science advances, in order to make batteries a comprehensive solution. We have to incorporate not for and maybe even fix our battery technology, but seasonal battery technology. Recall the most important renewable probably in the southeast, not wind, its solar. And you know that during the summertime, you get a pretty good profile for solar generation. But as you go to the winter months, you have a much shorter period, and therefore you need seasonal storage strategies. So we got to figure that one out.  In Georgia already, they have addressed considering batteries and solar as part of the solutions for the future. But I think for us to get where we need to be in for Southern the numbers are roughly 50% renewables, which is the lion's share is going to be solar. We're going to need some advances in R&D on battery technology. That's going to make us I think, get there.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Yeah, that's very helpful. Thanks for that.\nTom Fanning: You bet.\nJeremy Tonet: And then, kind of shifting gears here. Is there anything we should be thinking about in regards to potential changes on the Georgia commission as elections approach here? If there is a change, how do you think Georgia Power's position? I realize this is kind of a difficult question to answer, but just wants to know if you had any thoughts on that?\nTom Fanning: Well, it's almost impossible to answer. I mean, look, this company has been designed over the years to thrive in any kind of administration at a federal level. If does Trump win and the Senate win or is there a Blue wave? I think Southern Company has the optionality, if you will and the credibility if you will, to do great under both administrations. Likewise, in our states, we have inextricably, intertwined our operation with the good, the well being of the communities we serve.  And I think on both sides of the aisle, whether it's Republican or Democrat. People understand that a healthy utility, one that is involved in something bigger than our bottom line, that we are inextricably intertwined with the communities. We're privileged to serve is a good thing for the state. When you think about our economic development and the role we have played historically, I think it has stayed forever, as a premise by politicians on both sides. Georgia Power is one of the great citizens in our service area. The same holds true for Alabama and Mississippi in the Southern gas utility. No matter what happens, we'll be fine.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That makes sense. Thank you very much.\nTom Fanning: You bet. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. \nAndrew Weisel: Thank you. Quick one here in terms of coal generation, the pie chart you show is really impactful and of course, consistent with the strategy toward decarbonisation. My question is, with demand down so much this year and milder weather, should we think about the reduction in coal and even natural gas and being temporary?  In other words, if next year, we get demand to rebound and it starts to look more like 2019. Would it be right to assume that you'd be running the coal plants more and the skew might look similar to how it did?\nTom Fanning: Yeah. The premise of your question is 100% correct. So let's just go through it real quick, interesting thing, what I love about the data point on that chart about coal being at 16%. Half of that is one plant, Plant Miller in Alabama Power. I know it is a terrific plant, highly efficient, cheap energy, really good stuff. So the whole rep that is one plant. The entire remaining portfolio of coal at Southern Company is only 8% of our energy. What does that tell you? It tells you that it's back in the stack.  In other words, its marginal cost to run is more expensive than most of the gas that you see here. So what are some things that could sway it? One is the gas prices go up? If there was some ban on fracking, if for some reason gas prices spiked, you may see an increase in coal. If however, to demand moves up. So if you think about the stack of generation, if the demand line moves to the right, you will pick up more expensive resources. That's absolutely right. And that could cause you to increase your generation of coal. But the inescapable truth are that with environmental pressures, cost pressures, supply pressures, the importance of coal is waning in the portfolio of Southern Company generation.\nAndrew Weisel: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then… \nTom Fanning: Did I get it? You bet.\nAndrew Weisel: Yep. Yep. I think do you have sort of a pro forma, or what's your latest thinking on a pro forma energy mix say in 2023, when the two nuclear units are out? And do you have round numbers available?\nTom Fanning: Yeah. I do. Yeah. I'd like to get my hands on them. If something like this, I think, depending on what it -- there's a little bit of an assumption there about what happens with environmental and what happens with coal and gas prices. But I think you're going to see something similar to this 2020 mix. Nuclear will go up a wee bit, maybe in a 2%. So maybe 19% would be nuclear something like that. Gas would drop down, the marginal cost of nuclear is very cheap. Coal depends on what happens with environmental. And that really depends a lot to a large extent on the elections going forward. If you have a blue wave, it may be that we would see perhaps tighter regulation and co-waning importance, but we'll see. The other big factor is you should see renewables increase in importance. And I think we're going to see particularly a Georgia Power, something like 2.2 gigawatts of solar, by 2023. It'll be a big deal. Now, whether we purchase it or own it. Renewables will continue a steady advance into the future. So right now, it says 15, when I took over it was zero. And this is where the company that round numbers. I know this is incorrect now, don't hold me to it. I used to say that we're a little bit less than the size of Australia. Australia has grown faster than we have. But we're still pretty big is the point to go from zero to 15. And the time I've been here is pretty important. And I think between now and 2050, getting to 50 is a big deal. So expect renewable to continue with steady increase in the percent and those renewables are most likely to be solar rather than wind. Okay?\nAndrew Weisel: Okay. Just to make sure I'm clear, though, are you saying that renewables will be more than nuclear as soon as 2023?\nTom Fanning: I think that's a possibility. Sure. Yeah, you could see renewables get up into the 20% range. What's fun about that is to say renewables plus nuclear, if you're 20% and 19%, you're 40% carbon-free. And recall, we've also said, we set in place an interim goal of achieving 50% reductions by 2030. I think it's going to be 2025 anyway, could even be better than that. We'll see.\nAndrew Weisel: Sounds great. Thank you so much.\nTom Fanning: Yes, sir.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar Research. Please go ahead.\nCharles Fishman: Thank you.\nTom Fanning: Hi, Charles. Thanks for joining.\nCharles Fishman: You bet. You've answered all my questions on Vogel, COVID-19. I wonder if I could just ask one sort of long range strategic question. You have a situation where you got this nuclear capacity coming on in the next few years, you're building a lot of solar, you'll continue to build solar. Southern is in a mild climate. It makes a lot of us to live up more jealous, mild in the winter, a higher summer peak versus winter peak. In your discussion have you thought about the fact that you like do some electrification of space heating because you're in a mild climate, air source heat pumps are efficient economical, does that enter into your thinking with respect to net zero carbon?\nTom Fanning: Yeah. Hey, Charles. I know I catch them great for this, There's no job electrify everywhere, gas will have an important part in the future. Don't get me wrong. But switching to electricity, it does make a lot of sense in many cases. Let me disabuse you of one point though, and that is a summer peak. That used to be the case. So if you did your research, it was probably old data. Absolutely, Alabama is a winter peaker right now. And what's fascinating about that is when you're a winter peaker, your reserve margin in the old days, when we were reliably a summer peaker you would have lots of warning about peak days in the summer, you could see heat waves coming, there was very elegant modeling about how that persisted and grew over the space of say a week. And you could really nail it. And what we used to say was you needed 13.5% reserve margin in the current period and 15% for the next two years in order to meet your needs. With winter peaking becoming a reality, particularly in Alabama, and with the penetration of solar generation not being available during the time you need winter peaks, right? At 7 AM in the morning roughly, you better have good storage, maybe that works, maybe it doesn't. And now you need reserve margin, they maybe in the 30s, okay? So it's a much different kettle of fish as we plan the system. Now, right now, what we see is one of the important issues, I really want to flip this over to Drew, because, Drew, as we bought Southern Company and as we bought AGL Resources, the CEO of AGL Resources really understands this conversion market very well. But I think the statistics for us right now is that heating loads, electric versus gas right now in the Southeast is about 50/50. And so I think the really interesting question is, where does that go? Drew?\nDrew Evans: Yeah, it is interesting. And I do carry a bit of a bias because of my background. And it does vary by climate for sure. The one nuance I'd say is that winter heating with electricity is a little bit more difficult to manage, I would say than probably an alternative fuel in that. It's not that our demand is greater in sheer megawatts as we've planned, but the volatility around it can be quite large. And so the peak requirements that you have to plan for a very high, it's exacerbated by exactly what Tom described, which is solar availability is lowest when we meet the highest peak in the middle of January at 6 AM on Monday morning as people prepare for work. The state though has done a good job. There has been very robust competition, particularly in Georgia between gas and electric, and where it makes the most sense it has migrated in that direction. And so as Tom described, about half of our customers across the Southeast utilize electricity as their heat source. In our Illinois jurisdiction, it's much more difficult to even contemplate that electricity could be an alternative to natural gas because of its efficiency, and because we really have to focus on reliability and affordability for that customer base, just as we do in the Southeast. And so, you will see continued electrification where it makes sense. But we have to be realistic about where those limits are for the particular customer that we serve.\nTom Fanning: Yeah. Absolutely, Drew knows his stuff. Thanks.\nCharles Fishman: Yeah. No, that's interesting. I certainly appreciate in Illinois, it's not going to work. But I would assume the air source heat pumps are competitive in your Southeast region?\nTom Fanning: In many and generally below the latitudes where Atlanta exists, and so it's everything if you move down into the plane.\nCharles Fishman: It's kind of in nat line, right?\nTom Fanning: Yeah. It's kind of making across. That's what they call the nat line down here.\nCharles Fishman: Okay.\nTom Fanning: We do see it.\nCharles Fishman: Okay, okay. Thank you. That was very helpful. That's it.\nTom Fanning: Thanks, Charles. Appreciate it. Thanks for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.\nTom Fanning: Hello, Paul, always glad to have you with us.\nPaul Patterson: Good to hear. So all I have left here is, I just wanted to follow-up you on PowerSecure. And just – I know, you guys have been shaping the business over the years since you bought it, you've sold a few things and what have you. But you guys mentioned, you call out that COVID had negative impact on it. And I was just wondering, how should we think about PowerSecure? A, I mean, I don't think it is a big earnings driver. But does it have significant earnings change that we should think about in the future? And also, how does it look for you? You think may be that more of this should be sold, or just strategically how's it figure in the future?\nTom Fanning: Yeah, we've actually put a bright young guy in charge of the confluence of Southern Power, PowerSecure and the part of Southern Company Gas it's called Sequent. Now, here is the issue, I think that we raise, COVID could have an impact, but it's because people are less likely to have people travel to their site to go get involved in the kind of things that PowerSecure does for a living, right. If you think about it in this iconic century old business model we have of large scale, central station making, moving and selling energy. You may recall, we bought PowerSecure as an idea that would position us to be able to influence through technology and working with -- changing customer requirements to essentially miniaturize that model, and put it on the customer premises. So make move and sell now at a Home Depot store, or at a defense installation. And you can imagine everything in between. We have and Paul you absolutely hit the nail on the head. We have been putting it into our fashion since we bought it that if we got rid of a electric lighting business, we got rid of a utility services business. We're really focused on that intersection of independent power generation. And kind of the equipment you would think about in the move and sell that would be proprietary switchgear and micro grids. I know this statistic is dated, but I'll quote it anyway. It's probably, what, two years old? That some magazine said that Southern Company in PowerSecure was responsible for something like 85% market share of microgrids in the United States. So when you hear about microgrids, most likely that's us. Now, I'll just bet those numbers have decreased over time. More people are getting into that market. But we remained by far the dominant, I think, solution for customers that can integrate all the way through that make, move and sell value chain. Some people will get in there with control equipments and some of them will get in there with distributed generation. But we are the integrator and, in fact, provider of all of that solution. The importance of Sequent is that, giving people control over fuel stocks, I mean, over their electricity production and all is really important. But they don't know how to procure fuel or be it natural gas or hydrogen or whatever it is, the people at Sequent can. And so, getting their capability to the Southern power generation centric and the PowerSecure broader equipment microgrid centric approach makes a lot of sense. Chris Kaminsky [ph] and our system is charged with making all of that make sense. And that isn't, excuse me, just a kind of arm's length little deal that we're trying to do in 50 states in the United States, I think we're virtually in every state in the United States doing that. One of the other big deals as PowerSecure’s earnings are a virtual peanut, compared to Southern Company earnings. It is important that our host utilities learn what's happening on other people's features. You're more vulnerable to this approach. That is, miniaturizing make, move and sell. If you do have – do not have a strong cost profile, or customer service or reliability. Those areas of weakness for some companies are areas of strength for our offering. Now fortunately, in the south, we do really well with price, service and reliability. It we always say about PowerSecure is and really the union of those three efforts is, it is a -- it is an offensively oriented defensive strategy, whose value relies in its option value. That is, once those markets get some oxygen and take off, we will be poised to play hard and influence. That's our idea. But in terms of our financial matter, this doesn’t matter.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. So there isn’t any significant drag or anything that we should be thinking.\nTom Fanning: No.\nPaul Patterson: You guys mentioned that there might be a goodwill impairment in -- even mentioned in the last couple quarters in your Q. And I just – hey, it seemed a little bit surprising in that, it seemed like it was COVID related, which I would think was sort of temporary. And I'm a little surprised that it might have an impact on goodwill. But, I mean, just in general, though, it sounds like. That's a separate accounting, sort of, an accounting or to factor something in…\nTom Fanning: Yeah, Paul, I would say, it's kind of a -- I mean, it's a disclosure item. I think it's kind of a minor point. I think the real shareholder interest in PowerSecure is as I described.\nPaul Patterson: Right.\nTom Fanning: This idea, miniaturizing make, move and sell for the future.\nPaul Patterson: All right. Well, power grids are picking up. So, I mean, there's a lot – I mean, microgrids are picking up. So it sounds like there could be opportunity.\nTom Fanning: Hey. Hey, Paul, I guess you’re right. They just had I think their best quarter ever. So, listen, when I say that, don't get the idea, we're going to increase our sale -- I mean, our EPS forecast on PowerSecure. They're just small. But they're doing well.\nPaul Patterson: Good to hear. Thanks so much.\nTom Fanning: You bet. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And that will conclude today's question and answer session, Mr. Fanning, I will turn it to you once again for your closing remarks.\nEnd of Q&A:\nTom Fanning: Hey, thanks everybody. What a great quarter, such exciting times to have the progress at Vogel 3 and 4. And, just for everybody's benefit, I asked Paul Bowers to join us. He did join us on this call and I know Paul was CFO and knows so many of you wanted to call today. I just want to give him the space to end the call. Paul, what would you like to say?\nPaul Bowers: Well, thanks Tom. And I'll put context and the decision associated with retirement, and that's a major decision personally, but also you've got to think about the context of how it impacts the company. And as Tom outline in opening, our confidence in delivering unit three on or before our regulatory date of November is one of the reflecting points for me to make my decision about retirement. You think about the third quarter in that period in which we think it'd be commercial operation. So when I'm contemplating timing for leadership change for Georgia Power and as Tom and I discussed, the transition seen obvious associated with the fuel load because that's the signal in and of itself that we're about complete with unit three. So with that, and as we have disclosed that concurrent to us loading fuel in unit 3, we'll make the leadership change at Georgia Power, with a great leader under Chris Womack to take the reins as we move forward. It's been a great privilege and honor to be part of this team and serve in a lot of different capacities over the years. But as you think about Southern Company, and you think about what we had before us, the momentum continues to grow, and it's got a great future in terms of what we can deliver for not only our customers, but all our shareholders. And as Tom pointed out, I am getting old. So thanks.\nTom Fanning: Okay. Hey, thanks, Paul. You've been a champion for your whole career here. He’s been a great friend and an awesome leader for the Power. Any thanks everybody on the call. Great stuff. We’ll talk to you soon.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen this concludes The Southern Company third quarter 2020 earnings call. You may now disconnect. Thank you once again. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Drew Evans",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. I hope you all are well. As Tom mentioned, we had a very strong quarter. Third quarter adjusted APS was $1.02 per share. While $0.12 lower than last year, it is $0.07 above our estimate for the quarter. One of the drivers of this variance was significantly warmer than normal weather in the third quarter of 2019. The weather impact relative to normal for the third quarter of 2020 was a positive $0.04, last year was a positive $0.14, hence the variance. In addition, we had a modest decline in third quarter of 2020 sales due to COVID-19 resulting in a $0.09 negative impact, which we mitigated through diligent cost control and constructive state regulatory actions at our utilities. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results is included in today's release and the earnings package. Year-over-year through September, the dynamics are very similar. For the first nine months of the year, adjusted EPS was $2.78 per share, which is $0.06 lower than last year. This year's milder temperatures through September resulted in a $0.21 variance in EPS when compared to 2019. COVID-19 impacts year-to-date have reduced income by $0.20, and weather impacts compared to normal added an additional $0.08. Despite these headwinds, we have substantially mitigated both weather and COVID-19 impacts throughout 2020, allowing us to exceed our estimates on an adjusted basis in each of the first three quarters. With the solid results through September, we expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be at the top end of our guidance range of $3.10 to $3.22 per share. We continue to assess the financial impacts of COVID-19 on our business. For the third quarter, the weather normal impact of COVID-19 reduced sales by 3% in the aggregate and slightly better than our baseline expectation. As you would expect, we are still seeing a slight uplift from the residential sector, due to people working from home. The trend for both commercial and industrial customer classes is markedly better relative to the troughs last spring. However, the timeline to full recovery for both sectors remains uncertain. Factoring in impacts across all customer classes year-to-date, our non-fuel revenues came in slightly above our forecast. Our retail sales projection for the full year is unchanged, with the expected overall decline in the range of 2% to 5% on a weather normal basis. Based on results to date, we expect total COVID-19 impacts to be approximately $300 million for the full year. In addition to sales, we are continuing to monitor customer arrears and the potential for an increase in bad debt expense. We have worked closely with customers across our regulated utilities, offering special payment plans for those with past-due account balances. Customer arrears have actually trended better than anticipated across our operating companies and our liquidity position remains robust. Constructive mechanisms have also been put in place by the commissions in many of our states, allowing us to address COVID-19 related cost and bad debt expense in future regulatory proceedings. Additionally, through the first three quarters of 2020, we are on target to meet our annual capital deployment plans. Turning to a brief capital markets update, during the third quarter Southern Company and several subsidiaries raised an aggregate of $3.4 billion, locking in record low coupon rates, increasing our liquidity positions and allowing us to redeem $1 billion of higher rate notes at the parent. Importantly, recall, we still forecast no equity need until at least 2024. From a ratings perspective, during the third quarter, Moody's upgraded Mississippi Power's senior unsecured long term debt rating to be Baa1. Fitch also upgraded Mississippi Power's senior unsecured rating to A-minus. Lastly, Fitch moved its outlook to stable for all issuers except Georgia Power. These positive changes demonstrate the continued commitment of Southern Company and our operating companies to financial integrity and strong credit ratings, both of which provides significant benefits to customers and investors. Before I turn it back to Tom, I'd like to highlight our energy mix trends so far for this year. Through September, nearly one-third of our energy supply was from zero carbon resources and coal represented just 16%. We continue to project that for the full year generation from coal could be below 20% for the first time in modern history. Last month, we published a supplemental carbon report for called Implementation and Action Toward Net Zero, in which we outlined our approach to achieving our goal of net zero by 2050. We've made significant progress toward this goal and currently project that we will achieve our 2030 interim goal of a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions as early as 2025. At a high level, we expect our path to net zero to be comprised of several key elements, including continued coal transition, utilization of natural gas to enable this transition, further growth in our portfolio of zero carbon resources, negative carbon solutions, enhanced energy efficiency initiatives, and continued focus on R&D for clean energy technologies. We do look forward to discussing these endeavors with you, as we continue to decarbonize our fleets in the years ahead. With that, Tom, I'll turn it back to you. Sort of, an odd concept and you probably shouldn't use the idea of reduced complexity when you're referring to a nuclear site. But I think it is completely fair to say that, as we move through Unit 3 construction, and move the principal focus to Unit 4, that will absolutely see improvements in -- in productivity over time. It's just a natural course of construction. And Richie, as we move into or move through hot functional testing will start to provide you probably in the first quarter of next year, good sets of schedules for Unit work completion -- construction completion. You sound like you're recovering fully. So that's good. Yeah. There is the – that's a kind of schedule breaking, right? We kind of watched that. I don't know, somewhere in October, November, it's somewhere in there, we have funded that. So we'll keep our eye on that as well, if we ever slipped past the third quarter. Substantially, I get that could have an impact on cost. Yeah. The only nuance, I'd say is, we came out of the recovery a little bit – or came out of the pandemic from its depths a little bit faster than we anticipated, but the duration may be a bit longer, so that you integrate that and you get to sort of 3% for the year. If we see a continuation of that through 2021, I think both the mechanisms that we've put in place with regard to cost control have been very effective and will serve us very well into next year. We're likely not to see a cost base for the business that's materially different than 2019. And so I think we've got a lot of pathways should the pandemic prove to be depressive to revenue. The other important thing to note though and I think it's in one of our slides, probably page 11 is that the mix of impact has been very different, a little bit different than what we anticipated. Residential is quite strong, commercial was much less than what we had anticipated, although still negative, and industrial has been a little bit deeper than we thought. But as Tom talked about this morning, on Squawk Box, 8 of the 10 measurements that we're taking within the industrial sector are showing generally positive signs, sort of expansive signs through the third quarter. One last thing I just wanted to say on the future of CapEx, in the future financial plan. As I finished talking, I kind of had a hint of what do you have to do? And my answer was we have to finish Vogel. If you look at our CapEx provided in the slide, it doesn't really have big placeholders for new stuff. What you see in there is T&D CapEx and some relatively modest generation CapEx. What we're showing you in my view is a pretty conservative, modest case. There's plenty of room to do more, to execute on $500 million a year placeholders at Southern Power, for examples in renewables. We don't have that. So when we show this forecast, it is a conservative forecast, in terms of what we must do to achieve. I want you to make sure you understand that. And I want to assure everybody on the call, when we come up with growth rates, we don't plug CapEx in order to solve to a growth rate. What we're showing you is a reasonably conservative posture with respect to investment. And so therefore there's probably outside. You bet. Hello Angie, how are you? Yeah, it is interesting. And I do carry a bit of a bias because of my background. And it does vary by climate for sure. The one nuance I'd say is that winter heating with electricity is a little bit more difficult to manage, I would say than probably an alternative fuel in that. It's not that our demand is greater in sheer megawatts as we've planned, but the volatility around it can be quite large. And so the peak requirements that you have to plan for a very high, it's exacerbated by exactly what Tom described, which is solar availability is lowest when we meet the highest peak in the middle of January at 6 AM on Monday morning as people prepare for work. The state though has done a good job. There has been very robust competition, particularly in Georgia between gas and electric, and where it makes the most sense it has migrated in that direction. And so as Tom described, about half of our customers across the Southeast utilize electricity as their heat source. In our Illinois jurisdiction, it's much more difficult to even contemplate that electricity could be an alternative to natural gas because of its efficiency, and because we really have to focus on reliability and affordability for that customer base, just as we do in the Southeast. And so, you will see continued electrification where it makes sense. But we have to be realistic about where those limits are for the particular customer that we serve."

            "name": "Tom Fanning",
            "content": "Thanks, Scott. Good afternoon. And thank you all for joining us. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted results for the third quarter, ahead of the estimate provided on our last conference call. COVID-19 related demand impacts have moderated from the levels we experienced earlier this year. And given results through September, we expect adjusted full year earnings per share to be at the top end of our guidance range. Throughout 2020, our customers and communities have been faced with historic challenges, and our businesses have continued to demonstrate resilience in serving and supporting them. Well COVID-19 has resulted in many employees working from home, nearly half of our employees staff essential facilities and perform essential functions, which means they have been in the field, and in the case of our gas employees and homes and in businesses working daily to ensure the delivery of clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to our customers. Safety and health protocols have never been more important to protect both our employees and our customers. Despite extraordinary circumstances in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and an exceedingly busy storm season, our business model has demonstrated substantial resilience, as we've delivered outstanding service to customers, provided excellent operational reliability and achieved strong year today financial performance. As we reach completion of Vogel Unit 3 and continue significant progress on Unit 4, we will set the foundation for an expected increase of our long-term earnings per share growth rate and improvement of our cash flow and a dramatically improving dividend payout ratio. Let's turn now to an update on plant Vogel Units 3 and 4. We continue to focus on meeting the November 2021 and November 2022 regulatory approved in service dates, and recently updated our work plan for the timing of Unit 3s remaining major milestones. Based on our current work plan, we now expect that the in-service date for Unit 3 to be during the third quarter of 2021 ahead of its November 2021 regulatory approved and service date. Now we continue to utilize an aggressive site work plan for Unit 4 as a tool to provide margin to its regulatory approved in-service date of November 2022 with a current targeted and service date of June 2022. From a cost perspective, Georgia Power share of the total project capital cost forecast is unchanged at $8.5 billion. With Unit 3 direct construction approximately 94% complete, our expectations around the scheduled ranges for reaching major milestones continues to narrow. For about three years, and as we have discussed on prior earnings calls, we have used an aggressive on-site work plan to drive productivity and as a tool to provide the margin to the November regulatory approved in-service date for Unit 3. Now, this strategy has served us well in motivating the workforce, advancing construction progress, providing early testing of systems and components and facilitating earlier identification and mitigation of risks. Indeed, this tool has created margin to the November regulatory approved in-service date. Considering the current pace of construction and milestones reached to date, as well as assumptions for future productivity, we are shifting away from the use of an aggressive site work plan for Unit 3; two, a work plan that reflects our current expectation. Under this updated work plan, we anticipate our next major milestone, hot functional testing to start in January 2021, followed by fuel load in April of 2021. That work plan projects in-service as early as the third quarter of 2021, which provides approximately two to three months of margin to the November regulatory approved in service date. It is important to remember that for Unit 3, we expect hot functional testing could start as late as the end of March of 2021, and fuel load could occur as late as mid-year of 2021, and still support the November regulatory approved in service date. In mid-October, we successfully completed cold hydro testing for Unit 3, which was a major milestone for the project. Since our last call, we also completed civil construction on Unit 3 shield building, started to successfully operate the Unit 3 reactor coolant pumps for the first time and place the Unit 3 turban on its turning gear. As the site prepares for its next major milestone, hot functional testing, critical areas of focus remain the timing of system turnovers and electrical and subcontractor performance. While the site is experienced and managed through two waves of COVID-19, we expect the pandemic will present continued challenges as we work towards completion. Now as we approach hot functional testing, system turnover and testing activities for Unit 3 continue to increase. And in the coming months, we expect ITAAC to middle and review to accelerate. Southern Nuclear and the NRC staff have been working together for years on a plan that provides Southern Nuclear the ability to submit the necessary documentation and allow the NRC ample time to conduct a review of that documentation prior to the Unit 3 fuel load. All of the UI ends or the uncompleted ITAAC notifications have been submitted and accepted by the NRC for both Unit 3 and 4. And nearly 40% of the 399 high ITAAC closure notifications, we call these ICNs, have been verified as complete by the NRC for Unit 3. At this point, ITAAC progress is consistent with our expectations and milestone achievements. Leading up to hot functional testing, we plan to submit over 100 ITAAC for review and verification to the NRC, followed by approximately 100 more during hot functional testing and approximately 50 more as we approach to fuel load. We expect that all Unit 3 ITAAC and ICNs will be submitted and reviewed in a timely fashion to support Unit 3 fuel load. The Vogtle 3 and 4 operations team continues in preparation for the initial fuel receipt later this year, and an increase in pre-operational testing. The team successfully completed the pre-startup safety review by the World Association of Nuclear Operators highlighting the Safety Strong Safety Culture we have developed to position the project for successful startup and operation. We also completed the NRC evaluated emergency preparedness exercise, and received 62 reactor and senior reactor operator licenses, the first operator licenses for Units 3 and 4. This number represents full staffing for both units. These accomplishments set the stage for the site to achieve approval for Unit 3 fuel load. Now let's turn to cost. Based on our most recent assessment, there is no change in the total project capital cost forecast. In the third quarter of 2020, Georgia Power allocated approximately $5 million of the construction contingency to the base capital forecast, reflecting cost risks associated with construction productivity and field support. Now recall, the estimated cost of the time between the site work plans and the regulatory approved November in service dates or a schedule cost margin is embedded in Georgia Power's base capital forecast. Following the update to Unit 3 and Unit 4 site work plans, approximately $90 million of this scheduled cost margin was utilized. The remaining scheduled cost margin and cost contingency combined represent approximately 18% of the remaining estimated cost to complete. As we have said, we expect to utilize all contingency funds as we progress towards completion of the project. Through the remainder of this year and into the first quarter of 2021, the Vogtle team will continue to focus on the final phases of Unit 3 construction, system turnover and testing activities, ITAAC submittals and our transmission -- our transit transition into plant operations ahead of Unit 3s regulatory approved in-service date. At the same time, a ramp up in construction production is underway for Unit 4 related to its major milestones in 2021. While there is still uncertainty, our current expectation is that when we reach completion for Unit 3, ahead of the November 2021 regulatory approved in-service date. Drew, I'll turn it over to you now for an update on the financials and our outlook. Thanks Drew. Adding to your comments and reinforcing the notion that Southern is the industry leader in research and development. The United States Department of Energy's Office of fossil energy and the National Energy Technology laboratory recently renewed an agreement with Southern Company to operate the National Carbon Capture Center, located in Wilsonville, Alabama. Through this $140 million agreement, Southern Company will continue to manage and operate the Research Center for an additional five years. Over the past decade, the National Carbon Capture Center has successfully advanced the wide range of technologies toward commercial scale, while improving performance and reducing cost. Southern Company is also partnering with African Gas Technology Institute to sponsor the low carbon resources initiative to accelerate the development and demonstration of low carbon energy technologies. And we recently received the Edison award, our industry's highest honor from the Edison Electric Institute for Southerns' work involving energy storage, research and development through the energy storage Research Center, and industry worldwide hub for battery energy storage, technology testing, evaluation and large scale demonstration in Birmingham, Alabama. Southern Company is providing leadership and technical expertise to advance energy storage, delivering a decarbonized future will require an influx of advanced technology. So it's essential that we leverage collaboration to find and advanced those next generation and transformational solutions. Despite unprecedented circumstances in 2020, our company and employees continue to demonstrate exemplary operational performance, which has translated into solid financial performance for the year today. As we move ahead, key priorities remain operating our utilities at best-in-class service levels, demonstrating cost discipline, and working diligently to bring Vogtle Units 3 and 4 online by the November regulatory approved in service states. We believe that Southern Company is well positioned to successfully execute on these fronts and uphold our goal of achieving an attractive risk adjusted return for our shareholders. In closing, earlier today Georgia Power, now that Paul Bowers plans to retire concurrent with unit three fuel load, expected in April 2021 after a remarkable 42 year career with Southern Company. For more than a decade, he has led Georgia Power to be the premier energy company it is today. From industry leading storm response and customer satisfaction to the growth of a diverse energy portfolio and a deep commitment to the communities we serve, he has positioned the company for continued success. He has led the company through the construction of Vogtle 3 and 4 and will be here as we continue progress at the site and begin loading fuel in unit three. The impact he has had on our company, its employees, our customers and our communities in the state of Georgia is immeasurable. At Southern Company we have strong leadership across our system and operating companies, fostered by our commitment to cross functional training and development. This is how we continue our long standing tradition of effective succession planning and cheering we always have strong leaders ready to continue serving our customers. I am very pleased that Chris Womack, our Executive Vice President and President of External Affairs will succeed Paul. Chris will serve as President of Georgia Power effective November 1, 2020 and assume his additional responsibilities as Chairman and CEO upon Paul's retirement. Now, we knew it would take a remarkable leader to follow after Paul, and we are confident Chris is that leader. With extensive experience leading at the national level, Chris has remained very active and well known in Georgia and across the South. He also previously served as Chief Production Officer and Head of External Affairs for Georgia Power. His depth of experience in the energy industry, government and regulatory affairs and the state will be incredibly valuable as Georgia Power works to continue providing clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy for millions of Georgians. More importantly, Chris leads with a passion for people. The company, its employees, and its customers and its communities are in awfully good hands. One final note, we have thousands of people today working to restore power from Hurricane Zeta that came across New Orleans, but then hit the bulk of its theory and Mississippi, Alabama and even here at Georgia, where we experienced wind gust in excess of 60 miles an hour. My Report as of this call was that at our Mac, we had around 1.2 million customers out and as of 1 o'clock, we're now about down to 1 million customers. So, we've already made some progress. In the days ahead, I know that we will continue our excellent track record of restoring service quickly and not only providing electricity, but hope to the communities we serve. So, thanks to those people for their efforts, and I know they'll work safely. So, thank you for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we're now ready to take questions. Hello Julien, thanks for joining us. Hey, Richie. Glad to have you as well. Yeah, well, honestly, the 77 days I think appeared in a magazine article, we've researched it. We can't see where that number came from -- that magazine. We -- I'll just say this, you know, we've had people at the plants -- site, [Indiscernible] as they went through these procedures, we had our own people there, we have people from Westinghouse there. And in fact, the people from Westinghouse that went through startup and hot functional tests, and all of that are now with us at plant Vogel 3 and 4. The people from Westinghouse endorse our plan to complete this test as we have laid it out. So, I don't know where that number comes from. We essentially plan for from the beginning of hot functional tests to kind of fuel load about 100 days, that's comprised 45 days of starting the test and running the test. And then 55 days from assessing kind of where we are at the end of hot functional test to fuel load that will include things like filing the last ITAC. And as we mentioned, I know there's been some conversation about the pace of ITAC tax. Recall, you don't file ITAC every month just because of the passage of time. We file ITAC associated with the turnover of systems associated with the accomplishment of milestone. And so as we laid it out, there's about 100 ITAC round numbers, that before we start hot functional tests that we will file during the test, that's another 100, following the test before fuel loads yet another 50. So, that's very clear I think. The other thing that I don't know, but I'm just guessing here may confuse how you start and begin or the duration of a test. We are very disciplined with what we're calling the start of hot functional tests. And that will involve the pressurization of the reactor area. There's a lot of activities that I guess conceivably you could say are pre-start activities, you could say, began hot functional tests. And maybe that's where they came up with 77. So, let me just finish it with the folks that were there in China are on site here, and they have been constructive and endorse our plan as we put it forward. Yeah, thanks Richie and in fact, it's really not off track, it's by plan. If you recall, when we went back to the onset of the COVID virus at the site, recall we went through essentially a lessening of density at that site and reducing personnel from say 9,000 to 7,000. That also required us to re-sequence work which we disclosed along the way here. One of the ideas that we put into place was to borrow -- as we brought the numbers down was borrow some personnel from Unit 4 and put them on Unit 3 so we could maintain the progress of Unit 3. We intentionally brought down the productivity of Unit 4 for a period of time. Now in order to achieve November by, no -- in order to achieve the aggressive schedule, for Unit 4, we need about 1.4% per year, per month, in order to hit gym. What we have done is in October achieved 1.4% on Unit 4. We're going to add more people as we finish 3 that will move over to the other unit and drive that number up. So yeah, it would appear that for the month of say, July, August, September that it looks like we really went down on Unit 4. We did that was part of the plan. And now we're ramping back up. And I think our productivity in October is evidence of that. And just recall to that as we went through Unit 3, we had lots of learning. And so one of the things that we've been able to do on Unit 4 is apply those learnings. We see sequencing work. I remember initial energization, we did early on 3, we're going to push that on for and improve productivity there because there was frankly a lot of turn-on and turn-off of the equipment involved in that. And I really like on the material we gave you today. I guess it's page 6, it's just a great visual of where we are on Unit 3. You know, it shows the aggressive timeframe. It shows the November timeframe. And there it shows our actual, well, sure enough, if you look at where we're projecting our expectation to be, and our expectation actually has an additional 30 days that we already had 30 days of contingent -- scheduled contingency in there. We actually added another month, in order to hit the end of the third quarter. I think will provide that kind of information, as Drew was suggesting for Unit 4 now. Yeah. I think there's kind of three things that I'm very mindful of right now. In terms of actual construction, I feel pretty good about that. I really think that our big focus, and we have a SWAT team assigned to this involves kind of the nomenclature of the paper, that is making sure that the as built condition of the systems that we will turnover actually reflect -- are reflected in the engineering plans. So if you want to just broadly call that make sure the paper works, that the as built, conform to the engineering, and that that goes into the itech that we submit them don't underscore that, I mean, that's a big deal. Don't underestimate that. Second, we have said consistently, really, through the past six months or whatever electrical productivity at the site continues to be a pacing factor. We think we have a reasonable schedule to do that. And then thirdly, is subcontractor performance. And I feel confident we'll get there. But it's one of the three areas we have particular focus on now. And what do we mean by that? It's like insulation, like the elevators need to be insulated before we can go through hard functional depth. So it's things like that. It's the seals on perforations through walls to make sure that they are tied up. It's a whole lot of myths that are involved in making sure we can get the hot functional test effectively. Those are the three things, like it's the same again, the paper, electrical and subcontractor performance. You bet. Thank you. Hello, Shar. Fantastic. How are you? Absolutely. Yeah, I mean, look I think we'll get there in terms of everything we know about cost right now. We think we'll use a contingency, and we see no reason to increase it right now. One of the things that gives us a lot of comfort, if you recall, go back to the call where we increased the estimate cost to complete, we actually funded through contingency, a lot of risks, both for Unit 3 and for Unit 4. So the landscape, if you will, a very abilities with respect to cost has really been reduced. Now, is there a chance that we could need more eventually? Sure, we don't know, we're continuing to monitor COVID. The estimate that we had given you so far, and moreover, the estimated time of completion that we now have guided you to, does take into account our experience on COVID. Could COVID get a lot worse, conceivably, but with the pace of COVID impact, that's the kind of estimate we've produced going forward. Little bit about time and so one of the ways that I've been thinking about it is – if look at fuel loads to COD, our budgets, our schedules are sort of 145 days – 144 days, and we plan for something that's probably more like 110. If you compare those two, the Chinese averages, I think they were 138. The best was 112. I think our planning assumptions around fuel load to COD are very, very consistent with a global experience, maybe put it in that term. And so the answer to your question maybe is likely in the very near-term that we'll understand, where we fall between the site schedule and the regulatory and service date for unit. Yeah. So look, I guess in COVID here, we gave the estimate of 2.5% to 5% load reductions, I'm guessing now, revenue reduction. I'm guessing now we're going to come in around three, 250 million to 400 million we're projecting now around 300 million. So, I think the estimates that we are using assume about a mid year recovery. And we are expecting, since we're down for the year, probably what drew 3% on revenue that we're going to recover back about 3%. Now, that puts us flat to 2019. But I would assume and if you, watch all this stuff on Squawk and all that this morning. That's kind of following what people believe about GDP. So that's kind of my expectation. Drew? Yeah. And – let me just repeat that and a year over year all down, all the segments. But as I said, this morning, the first derivative, the momentum statistic would show 8 of 10 improving second quarter, third quarter. Hey, and that gives you the opportunity to correct something, I don't know, on Live TV every now and then you have a brain cramp. Becky asked me, which one was down, and which one was flat. And for some reason, I said, chemicals was flat, chemicals was down. I can't do that, chemicals was down, and that was the only segment down. Petroleum was flat. So I just misspoke on the call and said that chemicals was flat, chemicals was the only one down. The rest of the answer was okay. Yeah. So certainly supportive of anything that the governor makes as a priority within Illinois. What I would say about it is that our width is a little bit different than what they have -- what they experienced on the electric side in that -- the way the mechanism works, you have to move in rate case, something out of the rider into primary rate base. And so we actually do that with quite a bit of frequency so that we can absorb the continued construction under what we call QIP. And so even if there were a change at the state level, I don't know that it would necessarily change our behavior materially in the way that one we construct and two that we seek recovery from customers. Thank you. Appreciate it. Hello, Mike. We're glad to have you. Hey. Oh, listen, I think a lot of this is baked in. Let's just kind of -- we're going to get you great detail as we historically do in our end of year earnings call, which I guess it was in February. But it's stuff that we've covered in the past, and therefore I thought it was okay to foreshadow it. As you start, you guys know that there's essentially a penalty rate in which a lot of the Vogel investment is earning right now. And we've still been able to stay within our 4% to 6% growth rate, even with Vogel under a penalty rate. The worst year for that penalty rate frankly, is 2021. As we emerge from clearing Vogel into service, and that's why we thought it was worth talking about now that we're estimating, we are expecting Vogel to clear into in service in the third quarter of 2021. From 2021 on, we start to have large increases in earnings per share. And in fact, the numbers roughly are, as we move from a debt rate, roughly the penalty rate associated with Vogel into a full mix of capitals the net income effect is over $200 million. Now, let's think about that, I don't care whether you use 2018 as your baseline, or 2021 as your baseline, our earnings per share growth rate goes way up. Our capital, our cash flow goes up significantly. And as you would expect, our dividend payout ratio goes way down. And so people after me will have the decision as to what dividend policy they want to carry on from there. But we've said this on earlier calls, we'll give you a great detail in February about all this. Hey, Michael, not under my way. Hey, hey, I want to finish up on a CapEx comment too on the last conversation, we just have it. Yeah, absolutely. I would say one of the great thought leaders in America, a guy that was approved 98 to zero by the Senate, as Secretary of Energy was Ernest Moniz, he's on our board. He's published extensively, I think he has credibility on both sides of the aisle, it's very clear that nuclear needs to be a part of this nation's energy profile going forward. And I think we suggested on prior calls, that as a matter of national security for the United States to maintain a profile of consistent nuclear development, I think it's important to us all. And so you, maybe you just saw recently United States signed a pact with Poland to think about new nuclear development, we know that there is new nuclear development considered under the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and UAE. So my sense is the United States will continue. Now, when we think about our projections, and we have some pretty clear plans about how to transition the fleet, our next nuclear unit is probably in the 30s to 40s would be my guess. So back up, how many years 8 years before you start those to get them in service? So somewhere in that timeframe would be my sense. Okay. The other thing that's important on new nuclear is some of the things that we are spending a lot of money on, a lot of brain power, but working with DOE, Bill Gates, he and I are on the Energy Innovation Forum or whatever it is, American Energy Innovation Council. This idea of, kind of the next generation of nuclear that is, the nuclear fuel may have the physical characteristic of not being able to melt down. And therefore you don't need all the containment structures and therefore you drive down capital cost and operating costs. I think there's lots of ideas; SMR. Look, I -- this nation has to stay invested in nuclear in the next 5 years, 10 years, I don't know whether Southern will be or not. Thank goodness for the Senate of the United States, we stayed involved. But I think we're going to have to stay there eventually. I think your answer to that question though, is relatively straightforward. If you look at the content of our constructions over the next five years, something like the $38 billion to $40 billion worth $8 or $9 billion per annum, most of that construction is being done in the transmission distribution segment, which is I think a highly important component of our mix and a very durable asset base. And then over the next 10 years, we'll do a very large continent of environmental remediation. And so as we move through those, the next generation of spend is likely to be modernization of the generating fleet. And so it's pretty easy to kind of flush out what the potential for CapEx is over a longer period of time. You bet. And thanks. And that's a natural question. So thank you for asking. Look, Paul turns 65 next year. He's had a terrific track record of performance and he works around the clock. We fully blessed Paul's desire to retire and spend time with his grandkids. He's got a home on the beach there in Pensacola. He's got a farm in Alabama. He is absolutely entitled to enjoy his time in retirement. When we think about the right time to do it well, we could've waited till later in ‘21. But you know what, all of a sudden in '22 now, we start filing the next triennial rate case. We start considering issues like prudence, and we thought it was a lot smarter to have somebody in the saddle well in advance of those issues, not as they are happening.  The other thing that I know Paul and Chris both did a lot of media today. I think it expresses a tremendous amount of confidence by Paul and us all to make his retirement effective with fuel load on three. I think that expresses a lot of confidence in our ability to execute from fuel load to in-service. And let me remind you, Chris Womack, as President of External Affairs, he had a very broad pallet of responsibility.  Chris has been involved in all of the regulatory execution of filings and monitors and everything else. Paul served as the Chief Production Officer. He was in charge of generation at Georgia Power for part of his career. He was also in charge of external affairs at Georgia for part of his career. So what you're getting is, is arguably the top external officer we have in the system. Now in the CEO role at Georgia, he will do a terrific job.\nQ – Angie Storozynski: Okay, thank you. My second question is, so we've always told us that there's going to be some a couple of weeks of additional work between the end of cold hydro testing and the beginning of hot functional testing. Now, I was under the impression, that we're talking maybe three, four weeks. It's a little bit longer than that. Is this something that that you guys identified, during that cold hydro testing that elongated that period, in between those two steps? Oh, Angie, no, nothing at all. The cold hydro testing went fabulous. And in fact, it's kind of funny we got this argument, not argument discussion of 77 days versus whatever. We started doing pre-cold hydro test kind of well in advance of the final cold hydro test, such that, when we finally did the cold hydro test, it just a shade over one day to complete, because we had done all this work in advance, okay? What we have done with the expected schedule, is to give more time for some of this pre-work, so that when we get to hot functional test, it will go smoothly. Some of that pre-work involves the filing of ITAAC 100, kind of before. When I talked generally about paper, that is making sure the as builts meet the engineering specs and therefore, provide us a very easy way to use the UIN process where they already have been approved, to drop in the values and get things done in a very systematic way at the NRC. It gives us more time to deal with the paper. It gives us more time to finish with the electrical. Our pace of electrical is not dramatically different. There is a minor increase. But it is not dramatically different, than our experience that we've been having so far. So, what you see in the absence of an aggressive plan, it should lower the risk of getting to that day, and then executing once we do get to that day.\nQ – Angie Storozynski: Okay. And now completely changing topics, given that in this, the utility sector seems like, we have some sort of strategic app, they don't with every day. I know you guys are busy with Vogel. But would you have any comments about, potential ongoing consolidation, in the electric utilities industry, especially in the southeast? Should we think about it that once Vogel three is online, that's when you're ready to entertain any types of, future growth through acquisitions? Well, now, that's a loaded question. Angie, you've been with us for some time. So I'm going to give you the old response, it remains true. It is a fiduciary responsibility of all CEOs, to seek out opportunities, buying and selling, anything that will accrue to shareholder value is something we should do, okay? And we have demonstrated that, I think over the years. The simple examples for us would have been Southern Company gas, formerly Agio resources was a great by us. And then, when you think about the strategic sales, that we've done since then, be Elizabethtown, Florida City Gas, Gulf power, if it made sense, we bought at attractive levels and sold at levels that were unprecedented from a multiple standpoint, both in the gas industry and the electric industry. And so, we will continue to do that going forward. The big caveat that you rightfully point out is this, is that, throughout probably the remainder of time to complete for Vogel three and four, it makes a lot more sense for us to be doubly focused on getting that done well, and executing. After that, we'll have lots of opportunities to consider thing. But I would argue even after Vogel, we will still maintain that discipline.\nQ – Angie Storozynski: Perfect. Thank you. Thank you. Go ahead.\nQ – Angie Storozynski: Thanks. Operator: Thank you. Our next question ... A - Tom Fanning Thanks Angie. Thanks for joining us. You bet. Yeah. Sophie if it was me, I'm just giving you my judgment on this call right now. So I laid out three risk areas. And it would be broadly the paper. And then it would be electrical productivity. And then it would be subcontractor performance. I probably did those in order. In other words, maybe the biggest risk factor would be, making sure that the as built condition conformed with the engineering plan and making sure therefore that the process we've laid out on ITAAC will work well. So theoretically, if there's no material difference between what we build and what the engineering plans call for, then you should just be able to drop the values. In other words, the whole UIN process provided for the NRC to already say that the test was fair, the process to get to the test was fair, and therefore, all they really need to do is assess the value of the test. That's why we're able to accomplish so much in a short amount of time. So, I think it's really – and I think the as built condition is in conformity with the engineering, but you have to go out and prove it, you actually have to have what we call a field non-manual labor on the part of vector and Southern to work with our testing ITAAC team to assure that we have conformance in the test. You know, I think we all get high focused on turning the wrenches and connecting the electrical equipment. That is really important. And I can tell you, we have a whole room that we've been there, gosh, I guess every week now here at the last bits of this construction effort, making sure that that's going to go well. I would really focus on that one right now. But look, the others could, too. We could have a lack of productivity, we could have subcontractors that don't perform well, those three areas, I would really focus on the paper right now. Sophie, no, it went great. In fact, when we finally ran the test, you know, part of cold hydro was to pressurize all this equipment, you know, there's always a tolerance in a test. We went right through all the pressurization activities and only achieve something like a 10th of the allowable variances. I mean, we killed it on that test, it went exceedingly well. It does feel like batches. Yeah, it is lumpy and recall. I'm sure it's our fault. But there was some, some idea out there that we should see ratable monthly, you know, that's not it. Everything is associated with a milestone. So there are systems that we have to finish in order to start hot functional testing. As we finish those systems, we will file ITAAC, those are the first hundred. There are systems that we will test successfully through hot functional, that's the next hundred. And then recall, when we finished the test, essentially you dismantle a lot of the equipment, and check to see how it performed, you actually open the engine, if you will, and look to see how the pistons and the stock I mean, the spark plugs and all that other stuff perform. And sure enough, we'll file the final ITAAC's on that. So it will look lumpy to you. Always good talking to you. Thank you for being on with us. Hi, Jeremy. You bet. Yeah, so let's start with the sort of the long term plan. I think the United States certainly is adopting a net zero carbon posture. We were one of – I would argue that we were the first one to come out with low to know, I think that's equivalent to net zero. Net zero becomes important because it gives us flexibility on the very last kilowatts that we made to be carbon free. In other words, it might have been electric transportation, or it might have been more carbon capture on gas generation, if we are able to make net zero technology, either direct capture, biomass or hybrid, hybrid biomass. Those incremental kilowatt hours at the end of the tail to get to net zero are cheaper. Now, we need to continue to invest R&D to get there. If you look at the state of Georgia, for example, they have been out there in terms of a state. Remember, Georgia Power, I want to say was called out by the solar industry as the investor-owned utility of the year. And in fact, we had no mandate to do solar. They do it because it makes sense in the portfolio and is good for customers. Alabama recently has considered solar and put it into a special focus in some hearings that will be upcoming. I think even gas has some very interesting plans on net zero. So I would argue our state, certainly understand the idea. And our state had been so constructive in the past, in terms of balancing kind of an environmental need, with what's best for customers. I think it's going to be a great place to do business. And I think also, when you consider the role of batteries.  I have said, consistently. I know this is maybe a little bit apart from some of my brothers and sisters in the industry. We are going to need some material science advances, in order to make batteries a comprehensive solution. We have to incorporate not for and maybe even fix our battery technology, but seasonal battery technology. Recall the most important renewable probably in the southeast, not wind, its solar. And you know that during the summertime, you get a pretty good profile for solar generation. But as you go to the winter months, you have a much shorter period, and therefore you need seasonal storage strategies. So we got to figure that one out.  In Georgia already, they have addressed considering batteries and solar as part of the solutions for the future. But I think for us to get where we need to be in for Southern the numbers are roughly 50% renewables, which is the lion's share is going to be solar. We're going to need some advances in R&D on battery technology. That's going to make us I think, get there. You bet. Well, it's almost impossible to answer. I mean, look, this company has been designed over the years to thrive in any kind of administration at a federal level. If does Trump win and the Senate win or is there a Blue wave? I think Southern Company has the optionality, if you will and the credibility if you will, to do great under both administrations. Likewise, in our states, we have inextricably, intertwined our operation with the good, the well being of the communities we serve.  And I think on both sides of the aisle, whether it's Republican or Democrat. People understand that a healthy utility, one that is involved in something bigger than our bottom line, that we are inextricably intertwined with the communities. We're privileged to serve is a good thing for the state. When you think about our economic development and the role we have played historically, I think it has stayed forever, as a premise by politicians on both sides. Georgia Power is one of the great citizens in our service area. The same holds true for Alabama and Mississippi in the Southern gas utility. No matter what happens, we'll be fine. You bet. Thank you. Yeah. The premise of your question is 100% correct. So let's just go through it real quick, interesting thing, what I love about the data point on that chart about coal being at 16%. Half of that is one plant, Plant Miller in Alabama Power. I know it is a terrific plant, highly efficient, cheap energy, really good stuff. So the whole rep that is one plant. The entire remaining portfolio of coal at Southern Company is only 8% of our energy. What does that tell you? It tells you that it's back in the stack.  In other words, its marginal cost to run is more expensive than most of the gas that you see here. So what are some things that could sway it? One is the gas prices go up? If there was some ban on fracking, if for some reason gas prices spiked, you may see an increase in coal. If however, to demand moves up. So if you think about the stack of generation, if the demand line moves to the right, you will pick up more expensive resources. That's absolutely right. And that could cause you to increase your generation of coal. But the inescapable truth are that with environmental pressures, cost pressures, supply pressures, the importance of coal is waning in the portfolio of Southern Company generation. Did I get it? You bet. Yeah. I do. Yeah. I'd like to get my hands on them. If something like this, I think, depending on what it -- there's a little bit of an assumption there about what happens with environmental and what happens with coal and gas prices. But I think you're going to see something similar to this 2020 mix. Nuclear will go up a wee bit, maybe in a 2%. So maybe 19% would be nuclear something like that. Gas would drop down, the marginal cost of nuclear is very cheap. Coal depends on what happens with environmental. And that really depends a lot to a large extent on the elections going forward. If you have a blue wave, it may be that we would see perhaps tighter regulation and co-waning importance, but we'll see. The other big factor is you should see renewables increase in importance. And I think we're going to see particularly a Georgia Power, something like 2.2 gigawatts of solar, by 2023. It'll be a big deal. Now, whether we purchase it or own it. Renewables will continue a steady advance into the future. So right now, it says 15, when I took over it was zero. And this is where the company that round numbers. I know this is incorrect now, don't hold me to it. I used to say that we're a little bit less than the size of Australia. Australia has grown faster than we have. But we're still pretty big is the point to go from zero to 15. And the time I've been here is pretty important. And I think between now and 2050, getting to 50 is a big deal. So expect renewable to continue with steady increase in the percent and those renewables are most likely to be solar rather than wind. Okay? I think that's a possibility. Sure. Yeah, you could see renewables get up into the 20% range. What's fun about that is to say renewables plus nuclear, if you're 20% and 19%, you're 40% carbon-free. And recall, we've also said, we set in place an interim goal of achieving 50% reductions by 2030. I think it's going to be 2025 anyway, could even be better than that. We'll see. Yes, sir. Hi, Charles. Thanks for joining. Yeah. Hey, Charles. I know I catch them great for this, There's no job electrify everywhere, gas will have an important part in the future. Don't get me wrong. But switching to electricity, it does make a lot of sense in many cases. Let me disabuse you of one point though, and that is a summer peak. That used to be the case. So if you did your research, it was probably old data. Absolutely, Alabama is a winter peaker right now. And what's fascinating about that is when you're a winter peaker, your reserve margin in the old days, when we were reliably a summer peaker you would have lots of warning about peak days in the summer, you could see heat waves coming, there was very elegant modeling about how that persisted and grew over the space of say a week. And you could really nail it. And what we used to say was you needed 13.5% reserve margin in the current period and 15% for the next two years in order to meet your needs. With winter peaking becoming a reality, particularly in Alabama, and with the penetration of solar generation not being available during the time you need winter peaks, right? At 7 AM in the morning roughly, you better have good storage, maybe that works, maybe it doesn't. And now you need reserve margin, they maybe in the 30s, okay? So it's a much different kettle of fish as we plan the system. Now, right now, what we see is one of the important issues, I really want to flip this over to Drew, because, Drew, as we bought Southern Company and as we bought AGL Resources, the CEO of AGL Resources really understands this conversion market very well. But I think the statistics for us right now is that heating loads, electric versus gas right now in the Southeast is about 50/50. And so I think the really interesting question is, where does that go? Drew? Yeah. Absolutely, Drew knows his stuff. Thanks. In many and generally below the latitudes where Atlanta exists, and so it's everything if you move down into the plane. Yeah. It's kind of making across. That's what they call the nat line down here. We do see it. Thanks, Charles. Appreciate it. Thanks for joining us. Hello, Paul, always glad to have you with us. Yeah, we've actually put a bright young guy in charge of the confluence of Southern Power, PowerSecure and the part of Southern Company Gas it's called Sequent. Now, here is the issue, I think that we raise, COVID could have an impact, but it's because people are less likely to have people travel to their site to go get involved in the kind of things that PowerSecure does for a living, right. If you think about it in this iconic century old business model we have of large scale, central station making, moving and selling energy. You may recall, we bought PowerSecure as an idea that would position us to be able to influence through technology and working with -- changing customer requirements to essentially miniaturize that model, and put it on the customer premises. So make move and sell now at a Home Depot store, or at a defense installation. And you can imagine everything in between. We have and Paul you absolutely hit the nail on the head. We have been putting it into our fashion since we bought it that if we got rid of a electric lighting business, we got rid of a utility services business. We're really focused on that intersection of independent power generation. And kind of the equipment you would think about in the move and sell that would be proprietary switchgear and micro grids. I know this statistic is dated, but I'll quote it anyway. It's probably, what, two years old? That some magazine said that Southern Company in PowerSecure was responsible for something like 85% market share of microgrids in the United States. So when you hear about microgrids, most likely that's us. Now, I'll just bet those numbers have decreased over time. More people are getting into that market. But we remained by far the dominant, I think, solution for customers that can integrate all the way through that make, move and sell value chain. Some people will get in there with control equipments and some of them will get in there with distributed generation. But we are the integrator and, in fact, provider of all of that solution. The importance of Sequent is that, giving people control over fuel stocks, I mean, over their electricity production and all is really important. But they don't know how to procure fuel or be it natural gas or hydrogen or whatever it is, the people at Sequent can. And so, getting their capability to the Southern power generation centric and the PowerSecure broader equipment microgrid centric approach makes a lot of sense. Chris Kaminsky [ph] and our system is charged with making all of that make sense. And that isn't, excuse me, just a kind of arm's length little deal that we're trying to do in 50 states in the United States, I think we're virtually in every state in the United States doing that. One of the other big deals as PowerSecure's earnings are a virtual peanut, compared to Southern Company earnings. It is important that our host utilities learn what's happening on other people's features. You're more vulnerable to this approach. That is, miniaturizing make, move and sell. If you do have – do not have a strong cost profile, or customer service or reliability. Those areas of weakness for some companies are areas of strength for our offering. Now fortunately, in the south, we do really well with price, service and reliability. It we always say about PowerSecure is and really the union of those three efforts is, it is a -- it is an offensively oriented defensive strategy, whose value relies in its option value. That is, once those markets get some oxygen and take off, we will be poised to play hard and influence. That's our idea. But in terms of our financial matter, this doesn't matter. No. Yeah, Paul, I would say, it's kind of a -- I mean, it's a disclosure item. I think it's kind of a minor point. I think the real shareholder interest in PowerSecure is as I described. This idea, miniaturizing make, move and sell for the future. Hey. Hey, Paul, I guess you're right. They just had I think their best quarter ever. So, listen, when I say that, don't get the idea, we're going to increase our sale -- I mean, our EPS forecast on PowerSecure. They're just small. But they're doing well. You bet. Thank you. Okay. Hey, thanks, Paul. You've been a champion for your whole career here. He's been a great friend and an awesome leader for the Power. Any thanks everybody on the call. Great stuff. We'll talk to you soon."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Southern Company Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, July 30, 2020. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Investor Relations Director. Please go ahead, sir.\nScott Gammill: Thank you, Rita. Good afternoon, and welcome to Southern Company’s second quarter 2020 earnings call. Joining me today are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Drew Evans, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you, we’ll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information, various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Qs and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I’ll turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Fanning: Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted results for the second quarter, meaningfully ahead of the estimate we provided last quarter. While we remain within our expected annual range of COVID-related revenue impacts, the second quarter impacts were not as severe as we originally estimated. Employees throughout the Company have worked hard to maintain excellent levels of customer service and implemented thoughtful cost containment measures. Of course, our peak electric load occurs in the third quarter, and consistent with our long standing practice, we will wait to address our annual guidance in October. Before turning to the business update, I want to recognize that these are unusual times on multiple fronts. Our role in the communities we are privileged to serve has never been more important and apparent. Whether it’s our response to the COVID pandemic or working within our communities from the racial justice, we continue to deliver results. I want to extend a huge thank you to our employees, customers, business partners and public officials. Southern Company and our operating companies remain committed to supporting our communities today and throughout what is expected to be a prolonged recovery period. Let’s turn now to an update on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. From a schedule perspective, we continue to remain focused on meeting the November 2021 and November 2022 regulatory approved in-service dates. We are maintaining an aggressive site work plan that targets a May 2021 in-service date for Unit 3, and seeks to provide margin through the regulatory approved in-service date. From a cost perspective, Georgia Power proportional share of the total project capital cost forecast increased in the second quarter by approximately $150 million to $8.5 billion largely reflecting estimated COVID-19 impacts and other costs and replenishment of contingency, based on our projections for the remainder of the project. As a result of these selected actions, Georgia Power recorded an after tax charge of approximately $110 million during the second quarter. Looking more closely at schedule, in the second quarter, we experienced significant impacts from COVID-19 among other factors. While the recent workforce reduction was effective in decreasing density at the site and increasing efficiency, we were unable to achieve the anticipated level of production. Recognizing these challenges, in June, we announced a re-sequencing of certain milestones. We shifted the expected start of cold hydro testing to the fall out of 2020 with the timing of the structural integrity test and integrated leak rate test to precede cold hydro. Both of these tests were successfully completed in mid July. In fact, the integrated leak rate test approached only 30% of the allowable margin and indication of the quality of the work being performed at the site. We accomplished several other interim milestones for Unit 3 during the second quarter, including the completion of closed vessel testing and the turbine assembly. The aggressive site work plan currently targets the September-October timeframe for the stars of cold hydro testing. We now expect Unit 3 hot functional testing to commence during the fourth quarter, and we continue to see a path to Unit 3 fuel load by year-end. However, recognizing that the aggressive site plan is now even more difficult to achieve than before the pandemic, it is important to remember that under the November benchmark fuel load is not required until mid-2021. And as a reference point, even if Unit 3 fuel load occurred in March, it would support an in-service date of next summer. We also reevaluated our estimates for costs and time to complete the final phases of construction, which resulted in hours being added to the direct construction projections for both units. Reflecting these additions, today, Unit 3 direct construction remains approximately 90% complete. We still expect construction completion of about 2% per month to be consistent with the aggressive site work plan and completion of approximately 1% per month to be consistent with the November benchmark schedule. Importantly, even amid the outbreak of the pandemic and our need to significantly modify work practices, our average monthly construction completion rate was approximately 1.5%. Over the last four weeks earned hours have surpassed our expectations relative to the November benchmark for each of the major work fronts, including electrical, mechanical and civil. As we move ahead, critical areas of focus remain electrical and subcontract performance. Now, turning to cost. We have always maintained that we expected to utilize our contingency accounts, but that was before the COVID pandemic occurred. As a result, we have increased Georgia Power’s share of the total capital cost forecast by approximately $150 million to $8.5 billion. This represents an increase of a little less than 2%, certainly not all, but largely due to the COVID impact. The second biggest factor was a re-estimate of the amount of effort, and therefore hours required to complete the final phases of construction. Georgia Power allocated its remaining contingency and added new contingency of approximately $115 million, further reducing future cost risk through the completion of Unit 4. Embedded in the project’s cost to complete are estimated COVID-19 related costs of between $70 million and $115 million for Georgia Power. Also recall, the estimated cost of the time between the aggressive site work plan target date and the regulatory approved November in-service date or a scheduled cost margin of approximately $250 million is also included in Georgia Power’s base capital forecast. Together, the replenish costs contingency and the scheduled cost margin continue to represent approximately 20% of the remaining estimated cost to complete. As we have said, we expect to utilize the entirety of contingency funds as we progress towards completion of the project.  The team at Vogtle Units 3 and 4 continues to work incredibly hard and drive meaningful progress at the site, even while managing through the pandemic. As we neared the final phases of construction for Unit 3 and move closer to fuel load, I can assure you that the construction team, our management team and our partners are more focused than ever on bringing in the first unit of this historic project to completion next year. As we approach the final key milestones, we recognize that the aggressive site work plan is increasingly difficult, as most of our optionality relative to May 2021 in-service day has been utilized. But both, management at the site and workforce remain motivated to pursue the aggressive schedule to provide margin to the November regulatory in-service date. Drew, I’ll turn it over to you now for an update on the financials and our outlook.\nDrew Evans: Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. I hope that you all are well. As Tom mentioned, we had a very strong quarter. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.78, which is $0.02 lower than last year and $0.13 above our estimate for the quarter. The primary driver compared to last year was a decline in sales led by COVID-19-related demand reduction, largely offset by diligent cost control and constructive state regulatory actions completed in 2019 at our utilities. The estimated impact during the quarter from COVID-19 was negative $0.10, and the weather impact relative to normal was negative $0.03. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results is included in today’s releases and earnings package. Year-to-date through June, the dynamics were similar, though COVID-19 impacts were largely absent in the first quarter. For the first six months of the year, adjusted EPS was $1.56, which is $0.06 higher than last year. Year-to-date, COVID-19 impacts are estimated at negative $0.11 and weather impacts were negative $0.13 compared to normal. We continue to assess the financial impacts of COVID-19 on our business with the key focus areas being sales declines, customer arrears and bad debt expectations. In the second quarter, total kilowatt hour sales impacts from COVID-19 were in line with the expectations we provided last quarter. Weather-normalized retail sales were down approximately 8% with residential sales up 5%, commercial sales down 12%, and industrial sales down 14%. COVID-19-related sales impacts on our commercial classes were a bit better than we anticipated with industrial impacts a bit worse than expectation for the quarter. Factoring in all customer classes, our non-fuel revenue came in slightly above our forecast. Looking ahead, we continue to base our COVID-19 forecasts for 2020 on a U-shaped recession, with modest economic recovery across our service territories over the balance of the year. Our retail sales projection for the full year is unchanged with an expected overall decline in the range of 2% to 5% on a weather-normal basis. Let me also reiterate our expectation that retail sales in these ranges with lower total non-fuel electric revenues by approximately $250 million to $400 million on a consolidated basis. Based on what we have achieved through the second quarter, we also continue to believe that pandemic-related sales impacts in 2020 can be mitigated through interim cost containment measures. As we undertake cost containment initiatives, we’re maintaining our focus on safety, customer service, reliability and affordability. With our solid results through the first half of the year, we’re well-positioned as we head into peak electric load season. Our estimate for the third quarter of 2020 is $1.15 per share on adjusted basis. And consistent with historical practice, we will address earnings for the year relative to our EPS guidance after the third quarter. In addition to sales, we’ve also been monitoring customer arrears and the potential for an increase in bad debt expense. Customer arrears have trended better than anticipated across our operating companies, and our liquidity position remains robust. Constructive mechanisms have been put in place by the Commission in many of our states allowing us to address COVID related costs and bad debt expense in future regulatory proceedings. Additionally, to the first half of 2020, we are on target to meet our annual capital plan. At this point, we do not anticipate the future impacts of COVID-19 or the Vogtle impact Tom discussed, will materially impact credit metrics across the Company. And as we said last quarter, we do expect these factors -- we do not expect these factors to affect our long-term outlook. Before I turn it over back to Tom, I’d like to highlight some statistics in our energy mix trends so far this year. Through June, generation from coal represents just 13% of our energy mix, and over one-third of our generation mix was from zero carbon resources. For the full year, our projections indicate that generation from coal could be below 20% for the first time in modern history. We acknowledge that this near-term outcome is partially driven by extremely low natural gas prices and electricity demand reductions from both the pandemic as well as mild weather. But the long term trend is also driven by less temporal factors, including a combination of coal plant retirements and a concerted effort to increase our renewables portfolio. In the coming weeks, we expect to publish a supplement to our 2018 carbon report. The supplemental report provides additional detail on potential pathways to achieve Southern Company’s goal of net zero emissions by 2050. This is an important transition for our Company and we look forward to discussing this report with you in the months ahead. With that, Tom, I’ll turn it back over to you.\nTom Fanning: Thanks, Drew. Before we take your questions, let me acknowledge Congressman, John Lewis. His funeral is being held in Atlanta today. He was a wonderful man. We are thankful for his service and his work combating racial injustice, and his commitment to non-violence. I also want to address the topic of racial injustice. Recent events have resulted in demonstrations around the world that are leading to necessary and important discussions about racial injustice in our society. One way to think about racial injustice issue is to imagine a series of sine waves over time. Every so often, the peak of the sine wave rises to the point that this issue impacts our national consciousness, and frankly, we all see it. But, with the passage of time, these events fade from the headlines of our nation. However, we all know the underlying systemic problems still exist. One of our objectives at Southern is to keep these important issues at the forefront by focusing on sustained improvement. In my opinion, that’s where we should place our efforts today, if we want to make lasting improvements to racial justice in America. We are having meaningful discussions in our Company and are committed to long-term actions. In closing, these are unusual times for our world and nation as we contend with the COVID pandemic, economic uncertainty, and racial injustice. While it is not unusual, it is the way our Company is responding. We’re delivering clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to our customers. We are consistently working to understand and meet the needs of our employees, customers and communities, and we remain focused on our key business objectives, including operating our utilities at best-in-class levels, demonstrating cost discipline, and working diligently to bring Vogtle Units 3 and 4 on line by the November regulatory approved in-service dates. We believe Southern Company is well positioned to successfully execute on these fronts and uphold our goal of achieving an attractive risk-adjusted return for our shareholders. We so appreciate you joining us this afternoon. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Turning to Vogtle, just if I can ask, COVID is making something of a wave -- a second wave here, how do you think about factoring that into your contingencies? And then, separately, I want to come back to the comments you made, because it sounds like worker productivity and absenteeism is not being impacted at least by the second wave?\nTom Fanning: It certainly is less than the first time. Look, if you remember when the United States went through this first wave, there was even a lot of conversation about stopping mega projects. We had lots of Southern Company Board meetings, management time, site time, really thinking through what is the best course of action to play here. And as you remember, and I think we’ve talked about this in the past, we took extraordinary measures to make sure that the workforce at Vogel Units 3 and 4 were better protected at the site than they would be kind of in the surrounding area or when they return home. We did things like we created a medical village at the site that provided testing and PPE and all sorts of things. And we received national acclaim for those steps by folks like the United States Building Trades. So, we did our whole lot. Even so, as we thought about what do we do about the workforce there, we saw a great deal of absenteeism. And so, one of the byproducts of the workforce reduction that we did at the site, roughly 2,000 people, we basically gave people the option to leave. And those people that were most concerned about working in a COVID environment, left. The people that have agreed to say, get the idea that we’ve got to continue work, that the COVID protocols we put in place make sense, and that their health is being looked after in an excellent way. And the data would show that. And in fact, we finished the first wave with -- we measure the cases of COVID positive tests, we had several periods of time where we went to zero. And so, everything we were doing was working. And, certainly, the productivity started doing pretty well. We are we think now in a second period of COVID wave. And we have -- and I would probably measure this thing probably from Memorial Day is where it kind of started, a lot of people left, coming back to the site, and they’ve gotten exposed to potentially other sources of impact from the COVID virus. And so, we’re seeing that now. So, the question we have to ourselves is, are we reaching a plateau? Are we starting to recover from this thing? We have our own medical staff that we hired to oversee. There are some beliefs that this thing will have a shape similar to the first wave and then it will start to erode, but time will tell. Okay? I mean, the other thing we don’t know Julien is whether there will be a third wave and a fourth wave, we just don’t know. But, certainly, the folks that are working right now get the idea of working in a COVID environment. And I don’t know whether you guys saw my time on Squawk Box this morning. We have a chart in your package, I forget what page it is, that also suggests -- I guess, it’s on page 12, that also suggests that America may be adapting to this new reality. And we’re seeing it in our numbers. We absolutely don’t know whether that will sustain. But, it’s a very interesting chart.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Well, I hope you’re doing well. Separately, if I can, on the contingencies just to wrap this up, what contingencies remain? How do you frame that? You made a lot of comments at the outset on contingency. I just want to try to summarize that a little bit more precisely and talk about what latitude remains here?\nTom Fanning: Yes. So, think about it in two pieces, right? So, one piece is just a straight cost estimate. And so, we’ve done things like added in additional hours, this effort we talked about. And this rally, we made an estimate on the completion of the construction activities about two years ago. And so, we made estimates on the final civil work, hanging concrete panels, what it would take to do the roof shield building. These are not increases in scope. Rather, they are really estimates of what we believe, how much effort, how much hours will be required in order to accomplish that scope. Another thing that we talk about is I&C, and this is how difficult it is, how much effort is required to run cable from say the sources of electricity to the cabinet, to the terminal point in the plant. Mechanical, how much piping, how much effort will be to finish the pipe work, electrical, cable tray installation, cable poles, we’ve talked about the size of the cables, and the amount of effort to terminate those cables. I could go on. But, that is where we have kind of taken into account other costs that ultimately go into an increase in the contingency account. It also -- we’ve added in an allowance for incurring per DM costs through 2021, really the finish of the construction of Unit 4, that wasn’t in there before. So we’ve added a lot in here. And let’s think about it in two pieces, one is cost, one is scheduled contingency. Let’s make sure we all understand that. 100% dollar is $540 million, Georgia Power share $250 million. You could make your own judgment about when we’re going to finish the project. But, that amount of money is derived from the cost of completing in May to November. So, just to pick -- just to give you a point of reference, everything else being equal, if you finished in August, you would have roughly half of that scheduled contingency available. So, that’s another way to think about scheduled contingency. Certainly, there could be other costs that can emerge over time. I’ll tell you one other thing, Julien. There was a great bit of debate about this whole issue. We really wrestled with this thing. When you think about it and we tried to have these concepts in the script, as we have allocated the remaining contingency and then added back to this 20% number, it is pretty clear to us that we have reduced risk. Because we’ve identified risk items, we’ve allocated current contingency and added new. So, there was some argument that said we don’t need 20% right now, maybe we should go with a lower number. At the end of the day, we think we took prudent action by this. Let’s keep contingency at 20%. Let’s not hit any of the contingency available and schedule. And let’s move forward on that basis. We think this is a disciplined approach. We think it is conservative. And I think, we’re in a good spot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Fleishman: So, look, I think since your last in between we got the staff [ph] report on Volvo and the staff did seem to disagree on some things and I think they say that the November date is highly unlikely.\nTom Fanning: Yes.\nSteve Fleishman: And also kind of talk to $1 billion potential cost increase and other kind of factors that they mentioned. Could you just address in your, I guess, view there, like where are the differences in view here?\nTom Fanning: You bet. And I think it’s going to be pretty clear stuff. And I think we’re going to give testimony here pretty soon about how we see it versus what they see. And certainly, there’s no new data that they’re working on. We used the same data. It’s really how you view the data is what gives rise to a difference. Like for example, we really start with data that was established some two years ago, and the staff doesn’t give us credit for the work done over the past year, in which we have earned a CPI multiple of 1.3. In order to derive their numbers, they use somewhere between 1.4 and 1.45. Well, in fact, they are ignoring our performance over the last two years. And we would argue that -- and we’ve talked about this on prior calls that all of this electrical work particularly has been especially difficult to do. We call that scheduled versus unscheduled electrical. And as we move into the scheduled electrical work has been really hard and it has given us high CPI numbers. But as we get to the unscheduled CPI numbers, we’re getting numbers less than 1. So, as we move forward and get the hard work behind us, there is some, at least reasonable expectation, we will be able to at least maintain the 1.3 CPI. So, we don’t believe in their 1.4, 1.45 assumption. The other thing they would say is that they go back to our assumptions, if you recall, on the schedule that was put in place two years ago, in which we had lots -- not a lot, that’s a qualitative term, but a good bit of a schedule float time, okay? And in fact, we’ve consumed a lot of that here recently with the re-estimate and re-sequencing and all that. And that’s where we said, we’ve taken a lot of that margin out. But, the schedule they would use would say things like this that, hot functional tests of fuel load is 5 to 6 months long. Well, we really think it’s more like three months. They would say fuel load in service is six months long. Well, we really think it’s four months. What they’re doing is counting all that management margin time that we now account for. So, look, we have a plan margin. We think that all adds up to that four to five months difference from their own estimate. And I want to say -- I hope somebody will correct me here that their own estimate said something like February of 23 for Unit 4. If you take four to five months away from that that puts us in the summer well in advance of November, at a lower cost. Those would be the big items.\nSteve Fleishman: Great. The other thing that was mentioned, which I think you’ve addressed before, and just even today, was just on the testing, and they highlighted, like 80% of tests failed initially. But, then I think you guys said a lot of them then test soon after, and then you just test these other key tests that you mentioned. Could you just give more color on that issue and just clarify why that wasn’t an important data point, I guess?\nTom Fanning: Yes. Well, it’s almost like you extrapolate from the worst data point and you projected results. Our actual results have been better than that. Yes. Look, I mean, the data is the same. We did have some failure rates on our early testing. We maintain that early testing. It’s so illuminating to the future challenges of the project and we have said forever, if you think about values, assumption of risk and return. Yeah, we spend a little more money to do early testing, but we think it is well worth it in risk reduction, in thinking about problems that may lay ahead. If we learn quickly, fail quickly, and then correct in the future, I think that really helps reduce risk in the project. And I think, we’ve done a great job there. From that 80% number, we have put Tiger teams in place. We have seen improvements. And if you look at these two major tests that were just done, they were put ahead of the cold hydro testing, the structural integrity test, integrated leak rate test. With the allowable margin on the ILRT, we were only at 30% of the allowable margin. I think, even oversight people were surprised that how well that went. I think that really speaks to the future quality of work. There will always be problems. And that’s part of what testing is all about, you find the problems and you fix them. So, I’m not saying there won’t be problems. But, I think, the rate that they use to extrapolate into the future is way too high.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay, great. Thanks for clarifying those things. I appreciate it.\nTom Fanning: You bet. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nTom Fanning: Hey, Michael, how are you?\nMichael Weinstein: All right, I’m good. I’m glad to hear that you sound like you’re doing well. I saw some headlines that you had tested positive at one point.\nTom Fanning: Yes. But, I was completely asymptomatic. My wife Sarah actually was the one that started feeling ill and when she did, she tested positive and then I went in and tested and I was positive. But, I think no germ will have me. I never had a bad -- and now, I’m negative.\nMichael Weinstein: Well, I’m glad to hear that. I just wanted to give my well wishes on your health.\nTom Fanning: Thank you.\nMichael Weinstein: Hey, do you have any -- can you tell us anything you know about what’s going on with the Chinese plants, the sentiment? Is there, any -- are other lessons that you’re already starting to apply now, as you enter the testing phase and sort of entering the final stages of construction? Have there been any lessons learned from China that you’re beginning to apply to lower risk?\nTom Fanning: Sure. I think, the good news is, is that they are all running well, and that any lesson we’ve had we’ve taken into account, and we’ve actually gone back and improved some processes that even are newer since. You remember, everybody was kind of freaked out and probably rightfully so on reactor coolant pumps, but we’ve gotten through that and no issues that we’ve seen on our site, didn’t expect any. The only other thing I would say, especially as we’re approaching kind of completion of our unit is that we have much more automation in terms of finishing construction, in terms of testing and variety of other things. The Chinese plant tended to throw personnel at any issue. So, I think we’re going to be a little bit different and there won’t be as many lessons learned just from the work process, so anyway.\nMichael Weinstein: Got you. And maybe we could just get kind of a regulatory update. I know there’s not much to update on this area, but I think there were some filings that you’re planning on making this fall on the gas utility side. And now maybe you can update on where you think the IRP process is going and future opportunities for construction of plants. And on the same token, what are your plans going forward for Southern Power?\nTom Fanning: Drew, why don’t you take the regulatory stuff? I’ll do Southern.\nDrew Evans: I’ll take a crack on regulatory. We’ve largely resolved the resource planning that was done in Alabama. And I think that you can take a look at what we filed in the Q, but specifically we will construct a gas facility. We will purchase the gas facility, and we will enter into some contracts for additional capacity. We have two other jurisdictions that are involved in rate making. D&G filed with the expectation that rates will be in effect subject to refund at the beginning of next year and will be resolved sometime in the first or second quarter of next. And then, AGL Resources -- I’m sorry. Atlanta Gas Light, filed its annual GRAM filing with the expectation that will be finalized by year end. So those are sort of the two outstanding, but three major rate filings for the year.\nTom Fanning: And remember, Georgia has kind of just completed its triennial deal and not much there. We do have a BCM filing in February, then it will be important. Otherwise, we’re carrying out the IRP. We’ve not received the final order in Alabama. Southern power, we are where we were. We’re out in those markets, particularly wind and solar, some storage, and we just find those -- that market be extraordinarily challenging. And we were big into it for a while, but that’s an end market was hot. The contract periods are shorter -- I mean the contract terms are tougher. We found that to be a tougher place to allocate capital. And so, what you see is, more than 90% of our net income is coming from these wonderful franchise businesses that are the electrics and the gas. We’ve allocated one time -- I forget how much it was, it was like 6 billion one year. But now, our allocation of capital to Southern Power, PowerSecure is now about 500 million a year. And I don’t know whether we’ll spend that or not. We’ll just see. But, it doesn’t have much of a near term impact. We had closed a couple of wind deals, both -- they were called Redding and Beech Ridge. But again, it’s not that big a deal. In terms of their operating performance they’re doing great. They’re producing what we thought they would. We’re just not allocating a lot of future capital that way.\nDrew Evans: Completed construction at Redding, in the process of construction at [indiscernible] I’d say our opportunities are largely wind related. Although there are two projects that we’re working on within the California jurisdiction for battery, which I think is an interesting place for us to explore and understand these battery additions to existing solar facilities and I think give us good intelligence on how to produce the asset, what the economics of the asset are and what the operational characteristics are. So, I’m pretty excited about that.\nTom Fanning: It was fascinating about kind of where we cast our die at this point. It’s with the franchise businesses. We used to talk a whole lot about Southern Power and what the markets were. Right now, we think regular, predictable, sustainable earnings on a good risk adjusted basis are coming out of our franchises. That’s how we’re making our money going forward.\nDrew Evans: The vast majority of our total capital plan over the next five years.\nTom Fanning: Yes.\nMichael Weinstein: Hey, one last question along these lines. The big nuclear plant about to come on line, are you guys thinking about maybe some experiments in terms of the hydrogen economy, producing hydrogen off a nuclear plant and green gas, just a thought I had?\nTom Fanning: As a matter of fact, we are. Now at the risk of telling long story, I’ll tell a short story. [Technical Difficulty] my kind of term here, we did something called a SO Prize kind of built along the XPRIZE concept. One of the six winners was hydrogen. So, we’ve been working on hydrogen now for seven years roughly. Very fascinating kind of idea about hydrogen is that it’s a great storage medium. And you can pair hydrogen or hydrogen technology with kind of electrolysis and solar and a variety of other things. The other thing we’re looking at is future gas generation that may be able to use hydrogen as a mix with natural gas, or even at the extreme, exclusively in place of natural gas. Remember, we toyed around a little bit of this with Plant Ratcliffe. We think there are applications going forward. And we are hard at work with that. It’s one of these things that’s R&D for sure. I think right now it’s kind of out of the money. But remember, the job of R&D is to say things that are out of the money and make them in the money. That does occupy a certain segment of our R&D budget right now. Funny, you should ask that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski from Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question.\nAngie Storozynski: So, I have a question about the contingency. So, I think, we all expected that you guys are going to tap into this contingency at some point. We’re hopefully getting close to the end of construction cycle for Unit 3. I think, what is somewhat surprising is one that you have rescaled with the contingency and that by writing down this additional process, and I assume that you will not be seeking recovery of the additional funding, even though it seems like it’s driven by COVID, which is not something that you could have control. And then, secondly, so, we’re getting seemingly very close, as I said, to the end of construction, at least for Unit 3. And so, some of those assertions that you’ve been making about the project progressing faster than what the staff [ph] believes, about to be in essence validated. So, how can you make us more comfortable that one, there’s no additional, basically realignment of the construction plan for Unit 3 coming within the next three months. And then well, that is probably the main issue is one, why did you increase the contingency and wrote it down and two, how comfortable should we feel about this new schedule, given that we have still little time left until the end of the year?\nTom Fanning: That is right. And thank you for all the questions. You are at the heart. I think I mentioned before that we really had enormous debates internally about all this. But, let's just kind of put it this way. In the script, I refer to the fact that when we established the original contingency it was before we had COVID. And COVID was arguably the biggest factor in thinking about, reestablishing a higher contingency level. Of course there were other factors. But that was one of them. And, with respect to recovery, I think that is an issue for the future. We are not saying no and never. And I know there have been some writings in the analyst community about likelihood there. But I don't think it is appropriate for us to go through those issues right now. And therefore, we would not seek to offset and accounting charge with a belief of probable outcome in that regard. The other one that came into that argument was schedule. I will let you all make your own belief about what schedule is. We think May this is consistent with every time we have ever said this. The May aggressive schedule is aggressive, less than 50%, et cetera. And recently, we said it has even gotten tougher, because we have removed margin. At the same time, we say that we expect to achieve November. So we tried to suggest that there range between May and November. And all other things being equal, forget other new challenges we may face. Some event scheduled contingency may be available, but we weren't willing and I should say that scheduled contingency is also referred to in the text here as owners contingency, which requires all of our co-owners, [Indiscernible] me and Dalton Sue agreed to. So we have left it in place.  I think the approach we have taken Angie with respect to the accounting charge associated with the increase in costs and part of increasing costs was a replenishment less contingency is just conservative and prudent. And we think it is the right thing to do.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. And the second part which is if you will be able to look to by the end of this year, or even early next year? I mean, how soon in the sense will you know if that is achievable come the EI where we know?\nTom Fanning: Yes, good question. So if I got you to page seven or the chart seven, whatever it is, Vogtle unit three direct, construction and major milestones, we suggested that we could start cold hydro, kind of in the September, October time frame. And that it would take - I don't know, 10-days. And then shortly thereafter, we will start our functional testing. It is so interesting listening to the investors and thank you for hanging with us through all this. A lot of the bet, if you will, on Southern are taken by the accomplishment of these milestones. We have suggested in the past, if you get to fuel load, that certainly is a whole lot of information. I mean, you passed hot functional test, data to have an operating plan. And it just doesn't operate off nuclear fuel yet. And we passed the ITACs and now we load nuclear fuel and we go on from there. Other people have suggested the next big lever is the hot functional testing. In other words, with a third-party if you will heat source, not nuclear fuel, does the plant work. Every milestone that we have been passing so far, has given us comfort that we have a quality plan and then we will be able to hit our schedule expectations. This chart, I think, lays out our best guess as to what those things may be. And the other thing we added to the script this time was just to give you some comfort on variants Angie and it really goes to the idea. We have said that fuel by the end of the year is our objective and the site is working like dogs to get there. But even if we were three months late, then that suggests perhaps summer in service say. I think all this is meant to give you some sensitivity and an indication of our ability to hit November. I hope that is helpful.\nAngie Storozynski: Yes. Thank you.\nTom Fanning: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.\nSophie Karp: So I'm looking at Slide 10 on your deck, right? And it seems like what you have here is $0.05, tailwind from O&M, right? Is that net of $0.10 negative with COVID impacts? Is it like the right way of creating that?\nTom Fanning: So Sophie COVID impacts are in rates, pricing usage and other. And so that would be the impact of COVID, which we have denominated for you for each of the two periods. And then you would add back to it any changes in rates or usage of utilities related to the rate activity from last year. And so these really represent O&M relative to last year's performance.\nSophie Karp: So basically the O&M is the clean $0.5 O&M number and should we expect a similar kind of run rate for the second half?\nTom Fanning: It is a good question. We are spending an awful lot of time thinking about costs in general, Southern has always been very strong, had a strong ability to compensate for changes in weather demand, in particular. This year, we have been faced with weather demand and with impacts related to the Corona Virus. And we have been very pleased with the discipline that each of our employees has exhibited. We are looking at the components of those costs. And in general, you could imagine with the cessation of hiring will have a reduction in headcount relative to our expectation, no reduction in our actual workforce, which leads to reduction of benefits and incentives and travel and entertainment and a number of cascading factors. We have also had a series of expenses related to operations of facilities, which are not safety related, but because generation has been lighter due to COVID and whether, we actually had been able to through normal cycles deferred. This is not a deferral of maintenance, maintenance that will pass until the unit has operated for certain number of hours is maybe the right way to think about it. We also have other factors like vegetation management that works, I guess the seven year cycle. But suffice it to say there were a number of items that are one in period. And two that might create a headwind for future. And we are just monitoring those buckets and we want to make sure we are responsive to current period, but also future period. And so, I wouldn't say that these would necessarily hold in that will examine what our needs are after we get through the next three months, which is the lion share of the summer cooling season.\nDrew Evans: Yes. I think you said exceedingly well. And we have talked about this in years past, where we have some optionality in terms of spending, right? Some stuff we have to do and we do it, some stuff we have the ability to do it today, tomorrow, the next month and the next month or after next year. And if we have the ability through better-than-expected weather, et cetera, we will do here. So, we can move with loads, and that what is kind of interesting about what Drew said earlier about kind of where we are in our revenue expectation for this COVID, where we set it up this year. I mean, I'm just going to guess right now we are mid-point or below, certainly not trending adversely. And if you look at that July thing, I don't know whether that is going to sustain or not. But our revenue picture is coming in a little better than what we thought. Therefore, there may open up some opportunities some more. We will see.\nSophie Karp: Terrific. Thank you for this color. And then, I was just wondering on the COVID impact as it relates to Vogtle, right. So clearly that is causing some of the impact here. And that is not something that was contemplated or you are obviously foreseeing at the time of 2017 settlements. Is there a point where it is merit for you to visit that settlement or is it just too insignificant in the grand scheme of things right now to be thinking about them?\nTom Fanning: Well no, I think it is a fair question. But I think it is a question for kind of, right now, everything you are dealing is an estimate. It really isn't a cash impact right now, not a material one. This is really what we are estimating going forward. Let some time pass and let's see what we are doing, and we certainly have the history of ongoing constructive conversations with regulators about unforeseen circumstances, and that is probably not going to happen this year. Let's see in the future.\nSophie Karp: Got it. Well, thank you so much. I appreciate you taking my questions.\nTom Fanning: Thank you. Always glad to have you with us.\nOperator: Thank you. our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey. Thanks Tom and glad to see you are doing well. Thank you for taking my question. So, maybe Drew first to you, just, you showed this very good slide on slide 11 that is, which shows sort of the projection and the actual results. What is embedded into the Q3 $1.15 EPS guidance on that front? What kind of retail production are you embedding specifically in that Q3 number? Can you share that with us?\nDrew Evans: I can tell you is that, we think that Q3 might have a impact that is very similar in aggregate to Q2. And so, which would make it a smaller percentage of the total, maybe $0.10 or $0.11 cents in aggregate and that is simply because the summer period is much higher sustained output of kilowatt hour sales given the cooling load.\nDurgesh Chopra: Understood. Thank you for that. And just one quick one. You didn't put out any materials reaffirming your long-term guidance in [indiscernible] plant. And I think that is consistent with how you have done it previously. For the Q1 print actually had you reforming the long-term growth guidance, I guess, but no change to your - I think you said this in your commentary, but I wanted to clarify, no change your long term capital plan as well as your long term EPS growth rate is it correct?\nDrew Evans: And capital requirements, all three of those factors are true, in fact.\nTom Fanning: And once again, historically, we deal with that in our first quarter or no, our year-end call, which would be early February. We will update all that, but yeah, there is - and if there was something material we would say so. But you should just travel with what you have.\nDurgesh Chopra: Understood. Thank you guys be safe and healthy. Thanks.\nTom Fanning: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nPaul Fremont: I guess my first question is, how many remaining ITACs are there on unit three?\nTom Fanning: 261. Those are those are open that is out of 399. So, we have completed 138, just to save you from the math. Paul, one another thing on the 261, a lot of those are what we call UIN. That means we have essentially had these ITACs approved Ethics Commission except for the results of the test.\nPaul Fremont: So I mean, I think if I recalled on the first quarter call, it looks like you have reduced that number by roughly 10. From the first from the first quarter call?\nTom Fanning: Yes.\nPaul Fremont: Okay. And then do you have construction work hours scheduled after the revised sort of hot functional testing? I think one of the things that staff mentioned in their report was it was unusual. Normally, that construction is complete when you start hot functional testing.\nTom Fanning: Yes, but I wouldn't get excited about that. We made that change in February. And so if you have construction work hours after hot functional test, it would be things that aren't critical to the operation of the plant, in other words, not critical to the nuclear operation. So it may be civil were.\nDrew Evans: In the coding phase.\nTom Fanning: Yes.\nPaul Fremont: Okay. And then I guess this cold hydro testing needs to be completed before hot heart functional testing begins or can you see doing both at this?\nTom Fanning: Yes.\nPaul Fremont: It does have to be complete?\nTom Fanning: Yes sir.\nPaul Fremont: Okay, because if I go to your slide seven then -.\nTom Fanning: So let's say we start kind of early September around cold hydro. I think that is what that blue is meant to do. We think there is probably a month difference between the start of cold hydro and the start of hot function. I mentioned cold hydro test about -.\nPaul Fremont: I'm sorry, you complete that cold hydro in a month. \nTom Fanning: Oh gosh. We can complete it in 10-days.\nPaul Fremont: Okay. I just wanted to understand sort of the timeline a little bit better. And then last thing is, I mean, you talked about sort of looking at what staff is looking for in terms of scheduling versus what Sothern’s plan is and the differences there. But I think what staff has said was typically for other nuclear plants, both in this country and other countries, it is roughly six months from the end of hot functional testing until fuel load and then another six months to commercial operation. So they are sort of looking at the body of nuclear plants that have come before Vogtle 3 and 4. What gives you confidence I guess in your planning process that you think you can do that more quickly?\nTom Fanning: Yes. I mean, the simple volley on that logic sale is that they are using data that is more than 30-years old, you know, that is kind of the way they think about it in that regard. The more relevant way to think about it is what China was able to do. We originally allowed six months, China was able to do it in four and a half months, our numbers, and we have our own opinion. But the other thing that I might should have mentioned before, but I will say now Westinghouse is consistent between the work in China and the work here in the United States at Vogtle. And we get the benefit of their experience. And remember, we have always had people in China looking at all that experience, we have had our own people there. So, I think that is an obvious, in my opinion, and I hope they don't make anybody mad, but I just think there is a logic law that is you are going to make your estimate based on heaven forbid 1970s, 80s data world is different now, and we have a much better marker for experience in China than we do those projects.\nDrew Evans: Paul. I would like to clarify maybe one thing, because that may be helpful to other folks on the call, a Slide 7, this is an important slide for us. So let me help you maybe decipher it a little bit. The blue circle represents the aggressive site work plan and when those milestones would need to start the stay on that plan. It is not meant to be the duration between the orange and the blue, the orange circle represents the point at which we think that needs to start those activities to maintain the November schedule.\nTom Fanning: And even the orange could be moved. You could start hot functional test later than what we show here that is a good schedule shot of what November would look like. If you chose to do November, you can actually start hot functional test much later than what we indicate here and still hit November. \nPaul Fremont: And hot functional test is roughly three months based on what you guys had talked about in earlier calls.\nTom Fanning: It is two months, we used to have in there, Paul and what you may be remembering is 30 days of kind of management, but it is a two month schedule. \nPaul Fremont: Great. Thanks you. that is it for me.\nTom Fanning: Thank you sir.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotia Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Weisel: Good afternoon, Tom. I just want to echo, I'm glad to hear that you and your wife are feeling better. My first question is, if I understand your answer Sofia's questions, it sounds like most of the O&M savings in 2020 are going to be related to timing flexibility or short term adjustments in reaction to COVID-19. But now that we are a few months into the pandemic and modified utility operations, what is your latest thinking on how much it cost saving initiatives might be sustainable as opposed to one time?\nTom Fanning: Well, listen, well you are getting some we are going to attack the question, you are hitting a very interesting question. Okay. How much of the O&M saving through Drew and were arguing about this the other day is deferrals and those are going to show up later 15%. So, 85% are captured and permanent is what we believe. Okay, only 15% is temporal. And that may be made up with what happened kind of at the summer, we get, a long period of warm weather or less than expected COVID impacts or not then we will turn that money on this year, it probably would be more vegetation management related and it would say deferral of outages because through explained it beautifully if the plants not running, you take an outage based on essentially, the time on turbans and things like that. If they're not running you defer the outage. Was that helpful?\nDrew Evans: And I think part of the question that you are asking, too, is that these will some of these things be made permanent. So, I don't know that that is necessarily a fair assertion to make. We built our budgets around what we thought was a complement of people that we felt we needed to operate our business or grow our business. And we have had to take a pause in hiring this year because we have to be responsive to customers and responses to shareholders. And so we have, we have waited a bit when we are outside of COVID, we might certainly make the determination that these are things that we still need to do. Now, there are absolutely things that we have examined. There are work groups that are working remotely now that are incredibly efficient that we might ultimately determine can work in that mode for a while, but I'm not sure we are ready to put a stake in the ground around 2021 or a non-COVID environment. So, we have had a little bit more time to operate the way we are operating. \nTom Fanning: But he is exactly right. I mean, we are debating these things around the Management Council table as the CEOs of all of our opco and the major functional. It is a fascinating question. What does this tell us about a way to operate more efficiently in the future. I think we have gained on O&M I think we do lose by the collegiality of walking down the halls and working with each other. We are trying to make that up, with texts and phone calls and emails. It is not the same, but there's something in between that we need to capture.\nAndrew Weisel: Lastly, switching to midstream, not a huge focus of yours obviously, but in light of dominions asset sale and ACTB and cancels a few questions. Obviously, you have exited ACT, but I guess how committed are you to this business? Would you consider selling your assets or conversely, how would you describe your appetite for new midstream projects? And then lastly, would you consider taking capacity on MVP to diversify your supply sources?\nTom Fanning: Yes, so let's dial the clock back to when we were just getting buffeted by all sorts of offers, if you will express in - right, but would there were, I think I have mentioned this before, whatever something like five different big deals that we were looking at, and then one came in at the end, there's almost five and a half, I don't know. We have never been committed in a kind of deep way to pipeline growth. So, what did we do? Go back and look, it was we bought 50% of the Southern Natural Gas system. owned by Kinder Morgan at the time. And recall that the reason we did that deal was we felt that natural gas generation, particularly in the northern half of our system, was inextricably tied to SONAP Southern Natural Gas Pipe. And if you remember that day, I think most everybody would say we bought that well, we got a good price. It was really important, I think to Kinder Morgan for us to say a customer. And so we were able to do that. I forget what our share is of that pipe is 50% or better of the throughput of SONAP comes to us. So there was this kind of notion of synergy and integration. The other thing we said that day was we viewed this as an annuity. It is a good annuity because we bought it at a good price. We did not include any expansion of that pipe in any of our financial plans. We have done a few things around the edges but nothing material. So here is my view. There was so much symbiosis between SONAP in our plans for generation and Southern, we felt like that was a smart bet. And because we were able to buy it well, it fit in very well in our portfolio, but it fits in as an annuity, not as a growth engine. In terms of our appetite going forward look, I just think that is an extraordinarily difficult business right now. And, I'm sorry for my friends, Tom Farrell, and Lynn Good on ACP. I know they work very hard to make that a reality. It was just the right thing for us not to be part of that. \nDrew Evans: And I would say the character of our midstream businesses is also very different. You touched on it with SONAP. But if we have never really been involved in gathering and processing. We have very modest storage representation, although we own a fair amount of storage within our LDPs. And the transportation leg that is the dominant piece of our investment is a primary supply source for our Southeast utilities. And that has a character that looks a little bit more like transmission and transportation than midstream in aggregate. \nTom Fanning: And the other thing is, what is the future of gas pipeline? Look, I said when we did AGL deal that I thought gas was a bridge to 2050. I kind of blinked in that now to say boy beyond 2050. But in order to hit net zero. What we are going to have to do and that is what Southern does uniquely compared to any other company in our industry, is invest in technologies are going to be able to deal with the carbon atom coming off gas generation. We are doing that. There is no a national leader that compares to us. We run the nation's Carbon Capture Research Center, we run the International Carbon Capture Research Center. We are doing all sorts of other money where our mouth is activities to deal with carbon. That is why we are confident. As we think about the portfolio going forward, that we are investing in optionality, that is going to be able to keep gas part of the solution, but we will have to deal with the carbon atoms.\nAndrew Weisel: Okay, great. And MVP appetite?\nTom Fanning: I'm sorry, what was that?\nAndrew Weisel: Mountain Valley Pipeline?\nDrew Evans: I don't think so. That is something –you would have to hear from our utilities directly from -.\nTom Fanning: It is not a front burner issue though.\nAndrew Weisel: Alright. Thank you so much. \nTom Fanning: Thank you, sir.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.\nPaul Patterson: I'm glad that and congrats on the company's ability to drove navigate COVID-19 the big projects and everything. But I wanted to ask you about a guest is footnote three in the release discusses, the last sentence discusses that there might be some potential future write-offs. And I was wondering whether or not associate with Vogtle? And that is what this is basically sort of boilerplate standard, safe harbor stuff, or is this something that we should be -is there anything more you would elaborate on that in terms of what we should be expecting with respect to that?\nTom Fanning: I have looked through all this stuff. I don't that one doesn't jump off the page. It sounds like, we believe in conservative disclosures. We don't know of any exposure to future write-off in the future. I mean, we've given you everything. Is it possible there could be further?\nPaul Patterson: I got you. No, I just, noticed that and I looked a little, I just want to make sure. The other thing was on the leverage leases. It looks to me like you guys have written off the entire value those. But there is some language about how there might be a monthly or whether or not there is some additional obligations you might have with respect to closing it. Is there any exposure here that you think is material that we should be thinking about?\nTom Fanning: What, I don't think so. I mean, in just to replay this one, this was, this is a legacy business unit, it was very important to, if you guys remember Southern Energy it started out Southern Electric International. In fact, I was effectively the CFO of that for a while. And then it became Southern Energy and then we spun it out and became merit in the spin out. We took over the leasing business. Those guys liked financial engineering. I don't like financial engineering never had. But the leasing business was kind of hot at one time in the world, because you could kind of structure net income. That was the idea. [indiscernible] was one of those projects. The reassessment really dealt with the terminal value of that plan and I think it has a power sale contract with TDA that expires in 32. We reevaluated, the terminal value based on what it costs we think to operate the plant in 33 and beyond relative to the market for this plant compared to say natural gas. Natural gas prices up 35% cheaper this year than they were last year. And therefore the assessment of terminal value went to zero. And therefore you failed the impairment test and therefore we wrote the whole thing off. \nPaul Patterson: Okay. I just wanted to make sure on that. And then with respect to the 150 million in COVID-19. It says COVID-19 in other costs. Is there any significant other cost that you call out on this? Just sort of what is the sense of how much it serves COVID-19 versus something else, I guess, and if there is something significant, what might that be?\nTom Fanning: Why don’t you pick up on that, we kind of drafted around that one a little bit or the 75 to 115 refers to COVID. Okay, comma, and then there are other potential costs. Okay. So what you are reading there, 75 to 115 is COVID and then there may be other things. And other things may go to the performance of subcontractors that may go to I don't know - per GN an extension and 21 beyond where we are now things like that.\nPaul Patterson: Awesome. So thanks so much for the presentation. Very helpful and glad everybody is doing well.\nTom Fanning: Super. Thank you my friend.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Webber from Webber Research.\nMichael Webber: Thanks for squeezing us in. I just wanted to circle back real quick to a couple global EPC related questions. We specifically to kind of get our arms around onsite headcount and craft labor productivity, it is kind of in a pre-COVID and a kind of a post-COVID world or a mid-COVID world. And forgive me, I know you touched on this a bit already. So forgive me, if I missed it. But to be clear, is that headcount is currently onsite in line are enough to hit that May 21 in service day, and then maybe more specifically, had there been any changes to the underlying craft labor productivity assumptions used to kind of get to that timeframe?\nTom Fanning: We are adding, we are a little below, so if you do, they're just the big numbers. We went from 9,000 to 7,000. Actually, we just below 7000. We are adding back now about a 100 of 200 new electricians. In effect, this is a summary of what we have said before. But recall, we move people off of unit 4 to unit 3, or adding back electricians to kind of catch up on unit four now, that is kind of the way you should think about it. So that is about where we are. The other thing that is kind of good is we think there's personnel available, particularly on the Gulf Coast and some other areas, the labor unions, yields, building trades and others have been terrific to work with here. \nMichael Webber: And then just to the second part of that, in terms of the underlying crap labor productivity assumptions that are kind of underpinning that May 21 data, there been any changes to those in a kind of a post-COVID environment?\nTom Fanning: Well, it doesn't assume, so remember, the aggressive schedule is aggressive. It does assume improvement in productivity for sure. So, I mean, the other data point I guess, I can give you is if you just kind of extend where we have been with no improvement. We are trying to hit the 2% per month and the 1% per month, 2% associated with aggressive schedule, 1% associated with November. We are kind of hitting right down the middle of airway with no improvement. Let me assure you, we are trying to reach improvement. And the other thing I mentioned earlier on this call that I hope people remember. We are finishing up this tough part of electrical, that is the cable trays and pulling these gigantic cables and terminating them in very close basis. And remember, we refer to this in the language in the script. When we talk about losing the production. As we went to a COVID protocol, for example, said having an army of people in a closed space. We would have like no more than three people in a work space. So we couldn't make the amount of action done, just because we had fewer people there. That pushed out construct and that gave rise to the change in the assets. All of those are COVID impact. Worked hard to get it done, we will see.\nMichael Webber: And then, just specifically related to productivity related costs that is our - any other major contractors have any risk or cost share exposure there, specifically the thanks to productivity related costs?\nTom Fanning: Yes, their fee is at risk. That is the big thing. And let me just tag on those guys. Brendan [indiscernible], Jack Future, Brian. Anyway, they are terrific. And Brian Miley, they are terrific folks to work with. We meet with them all the time. I'm in the meetings where we meet with them now the - our onsite team that [indiscernible] and others meets with him daily right. But there are monthly meet with Brendan [indiscernible] Jack Future himself. Come to the meeting with Paul Bowers, CEO of Georgia Power, me, Drew Evans is there. Our co-owners is there. Dr. Jacobs is there, the PSC stat, DOE is there, NRC is there. Everybody sees a completely transparent picture of where we are. And we think this is served us, so well.\nMichael Webber: Got you. Just dig into it in terms of - how exactly there is fee risks.\nTom Fanning: Yes, I think that is a question you would rather ask [indiscernible] or even, boiler room kind of stuff. But it started successfully, incentives is a way to -.\nMichael Webber: Fair enough. Well, first of all, that sounds like a very big room with all those deal there, but I appreciate the color and thanks again for seeing squeezing in.\nTom Fanning: Sure. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks?\nTom Fanning: Thanks, everybody. These are unique times, aren't they? I think we are going to look back at 2020. And maybe the way we look back at 1968, or some other big years in history in the United States. When I think about the work being done at Vogtle 3 and 4 and the adjustments those people have made to continue to progress the Vogtle 3 and 4 site. It is nothing short of heroic. And they deserve our gratitude. And I think they continue to make great progress under a lot of duress. So, thanks for that team there. Thanks to our co-workers at [indiscernible] And all the subcontractors. I know it is important to you guys. We see ourselves now in the short rows of that process, at least for unit 3. And it is such an exciting time to look at the end of the tunnel and in fact see daylight. So we look forward to making progress in October when we meet back with you at the end of the third quarter. We will have a lot more transparency on what the summer did for revenues. And we will have I think a new estimate on what we are going to do this year. And on in terms of guidance, and we will have a lot more, I think visibility on where we are in 3 and 4, such exciting times. If we can just get our social unrest under order, and pay attention to making sure that not only the watts of our business are done well, but the house of our business are done well in a systemic way. Not in a periodic way. I think we will all be better as a company and as a nation. Thank you all so much for following us. We appreciate your time today. Operator, that concludes the call.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Southern Company’s second quarter 2020 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Drew Evans",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. I hope that you all are well. As Tom mentioned, we had a very strong quarter. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.78, which is $0.02 lower than last year and $0.13 above our estimate for the quarter. The primary driver compared to last year was a decline in sales led by COVID-19-related demand reduction, largely offset by diligent cost control and constructive state regulatory actions completed in 2019 at our utilities. The estimated impact during the quarter from COVID-19 was negative $0.10, and the weather impact relative to normal was negative $0.03. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results is included in today's releases and earnings package. Year-to-date through June, the dynamics were similar, though COVID-19 impacts were largely absent in the first quarter. For the first six months of the year, adjusted EPS was $1.56, which is $0.06 higher than last year. Year-to-date, COVID-19 impacts are estimated at negative $0.11 and weather impacts were negative $0.13 compared to normal. We continue to assess the financial impacts of COVID-19 on our business with the key focus areas being sales declines, customer arrears and bad debt expectations. In the second quarter, total kilowatt hour sales impacts from COVID-19 were in line with the expectations we provided last quarter. Weather-normalized retail sales were down approximately 8% with residential sales up 5%, commercial sales down 12%, and industrial sales down 14%. COVID-19-related sales impacts on our commercial classes were a bit better than we anticipated with industrial impacts a bit worse than expectation for the quarter. Factoring in all customer classes, our non-fuel revenue came in slightly above our forecast. Looking ahead, we continue to base our COVID-19 forecasts for 2020 on a U-shaped recession, with modest economic recovery across our service territories over the balance of the year. Our retail sales projection for the full year is unchanged with an expected overall decline in the range of 2% to 5% on a weather-normal basis. Let me also reiterate our expectation that retail sales in these ranges with lower total non-fuel electric revenues by approximately $250 million to $400 million on a consolidated basis. Based on what we have achieved through the second quarter, we also continue to believe that pandemic-related sales impacts in 2020 can be mitigated through interim cost containment measures. As we undertake cost containment initiatives, we're maintaining our focus on safety, customer service, reliability and affordability. With our solid results through the first half of the year, we're well-positioned as we head into peak electric load season. Our estimate for the third quarter of 2020 is $1.15 per share on adjusted basis. And consistent with historical practice, we will address earnings for the year relative to our EPS guidance after the third quarter. In addition to sales, we've also been monitoring customer arrears and the potential for an increase in bad debt expense. Customer arrears have trended better than anticipated across our operating companies, and our liquidity position remains robust. Constructive mechanisms have been put in place by the Commission in many of our states allowing us to address COVID related costs and bad debt expense in future regulatory proceedings. Additionally, to the first half of 2020, we are on target to meet our annual capital plan. At this point, we do not anticipate the future impacts of COVID-19 or the Vogtle impact Tom discussed, will materially impact credit metrics across the Company. And as we said last quarter, we do expect these factors -- we do not expect these factors to affect our long-term outlook. Before I turn it over back to Tom, I'd like to highlight some statistics in our energy mix trends so far this year. Through June, generation from coal represents just 13% of our energy mix, and over one-third of our generation mix was from zero carbon resources. For the full year, our projections indicate that generation from coal could be below 20% for the first time in modern history. We acknowledge that this near-term outcome is partially driven by extremely low natural gas prices and electricity demand reductions from both the pandemic as well as mild weather. But the long term trend is also driven by less temporal factors, including a combination of coal plant retirements and a concerted effort to increase our renewables portfolio. In the coming weeks, we expect to publish a supplement to our 2018 carbon report. The supplemental report provides additional detail on potential pathways to achieve Southern Company's goal of net zero emissions by 2050. This is an important transition for our Company and we look forward to discussing this report with you in the months ahead. With that, Tom, I'll turn it back over to you. I'll take a crack on regulatory. We've largely resolved the resource planning that was done in Alabama. And I think that you can take a look at what we filed in the Q, but specifically we will construct a gas facility. We will purchase the gas facility, and we will enter into some contracts for additional capacity. We have two other jurisdictions that are involved in rate making. D&G filed with the expectation that rates will be in effect subject to refund at the beginning of next year and will be resolved sometime in the first or second quarter of next. And then, AGL Resources -- I'm sorry. Atlanta Gas Light, filed its annual GRAM filing with the expectation that will be finalized by year end. So those are sort of the two outstanding, but three major rate filings for the year. Completed construction at Redding, in the process of construction at [indiscernible] I'd say our opportunities are largely wind related. Although there are two projects that we're working on within the California jurisdiction for battery, which I think is an interesting place for us to explore and understand these battery additions to existing solar facilities and I think give us good intelligence on how to produce the asset, what the economics of the asset are and what the operational characteristics are. So, I'm pretty excited about that. The vast majority of our total capital plan over the next five years. Yes. I think you said exceedingly well. And we have talked about this in years past, where we have some optionality in terms of spending, right? Some stuff we have to do and we do it, some stuff we have the ability to do it today, tomorrow, the next month and the next month or after next year. And if we have the ability through better-than-expected weather, et cetera, we will do here. So, we can move with loads, and that what is kind of interesting about what Drew said earlier about kind of where we are in our revenue expectation for this COVID, where we set it up this year. I mean, I'm just going to guess right now we are mid-point or below, certainly not trending adversely. And if you look at that July thing, I don't know whether that is going to sustain or not. But our revenue picture is coming in a little better than what we thought. Therefore, there may open up some opportunities some more. We will see. I can tell you is that, we think that Q3 might have a impact that is very similar in aggregate to Q2. And so, which would make it a smaller percentage of the total, maybe $0.10 or $0.11 cents in aggregate and that is simply because the summer period is much higher sustained output of kilowatt hour sales given the cooling load. And capital requirements, all three of those factors are true, in fact. In the coding phase. Paul. I would like to clarify maybe one thing, because that may be helpful to other folks on the call, a Slide 7, this is an important slide for us. So let me help you maybe decipher it a little bit. The blue circle represents the aggressive site work plan and when those milestones would need to start the stay on that plan. It is not meant to be the duration between the orange and the blue, the orange circle represents the point at which we think that needs to start those activities to maintain the November schedule. And I think part of the question that you are asking, too, is that these will some of these things be made permanent. So, I don't know that that is necessarily a fair assertion to make. We built our budgets around what we thought was a complement of people that we felt we needed to operate our business or grow our business. And we have had to take a pause in hiring this year because we have to be responsive to customers and responses to shareholders. And so we have, we have waited a bit when we are outside of COVID, we might certainly make the determination that these are things that we still need to do. Now, there are absolutely things that we have examined. There are work groups that are working remotely now that are incredibly efficient that we might ultimately determine can work in that mode for a while, but I'm not sure we are ready to put a stake in the ground around 2021 or a non-COVID environment. So, we have had a little bit more time to operate the way we are operating. And I would say the character of our midstream businesses is also very different. You touched on it with SONAP. But if we have never really been involved in gathering and processing. We have very modest storage representation, although we own a fair amount of storage within our LDPs. And the transportation leg that is the dominant piece of our investment is a primary supply source for our Southeast utilities. And that has a character that looks a little bit more like transmission and transportation than midstream in aggregate. I don't think so. That is something –you would have to hear from our utilities directly from -."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Tom Fanning",
            "content": "Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted results for the second quarter, meaningfully ahead of the estimate we provided last quarter. While we remain within our expected annual range of COVID-related revenue impacts, the second quarter impacts were not as severe as we originally estimated. Employees throughout the Company have worked hard to maintain excellent levels of customer service and implemented thoughtful cost containment measures. Of course, our peak electric load occurs in the third quarter, and consistent with our long standing practice, we will wait to address our annual guidance in October. Before turning to the business update, I want to recognize that these are unusual times on multiple fronts. Our role in the communities we are privileged to serve has never been more important and apparent. Whether it's our response to the COVID pandemic or working within our communities from the racial justice, we continue to deliver results. I want to extend a huge thank you to our employees, customers, business partners and public officials. Southern Company and our operating companies remain committed to supporting our communities today and throughout what is expected to be a prolonged recovery period. Let's turn now to an update on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. From a schedule perspective, we continue to remain focused on meeting the November 2021 and November 2022 regulatory approved in-service dates. We are maintaining an aggressive site work plan that targets a May 2021 in-service date for Unit 3, and seeks to provide margin through the regulatory approved in-service date. From a cost perspective, Georgia Power proportional share of the total project capital cost forecast increased in the second quarter by approximately $150 million to $8.5 billion largely reflecting estimated COVID-19 impacts and other costs and replenishment of contingency, based on our projections for the remainder of the project. As a result of these selected actions, Georgia Power recorded an after tax charge of approximately $110 million during the second quarter. Looking more closely at schedule, in the second quarter, we experienced significant impacts from COVID-19 among other factors. While the recent workforce reduction was effective in decreasing density at the site and increasing efficiency, we were unable to achieve the anticipated level of production. Recognizing these challenges, in June, we announced a re-sequencing of certain milestones. We shifted the expected start of cold hydro testing to the fall out of 2020 with the timing of the structural integrity test and integrated leak rate test to precede cold hydro. Both of these tests were successfully completed in mid July. In fact, the integrated leak rate test approached only 30% of the allowable margin and indication of the quality of the work being performed at the site. We accomplished several other interim milestones for Unit 3 during the second quarter, including the completion of closed vessel testing and the turbine assembly. The aggressive site work plan currently targets the September-October timeframe for the stars of cold hydro testing. We now expect Unit 3 hot functional testing to commence during the fourth quarter, and we continue to see a path to Unit 3 fuel load by year-end. However, recognizing that the aggressive site plan is now even more difficult to achieve than before the pandemic, it is important to remember that under the November benchmark fuel load is not required until mid-2021. And as a reference point, even if Unit 3 fuel load occurred in March, it would support an in-service date of next summer. We also reevaluated our estimates for costs and time to complete the final phases of construction, which resulted in hours being added to the direct construction projections for both units. Reflecting these additions, today, Unit 3 direct construction remains approximately 90% complete. We still expect construction completion of about 2% per month to be consistent with the aggressive site work plan and completion of approximately 1% per month to be consistent with the November benchmark schedule. Importantly, even amid the outbreak of the pandemic and our need to significantly modify work practices, our average monthly construction completion rate was approximately 1.5%. Over the last four weeks earned hours have surpassed our expectations relative to the November benchmark for each of the major work fronts, including electrical, mechanical and civil. As we move ahead, critical areas of focus remain electrical and subcontract performance. Now, turning to cost. We have always maintained that we expected to utilize our contingency accounts, but that was before the COVID pandemic occurred. As a result, we have increased Georgia Power's share of the total capital cost forecast by approximately $150 million to $8.5 billion. This represents an increase of a little less than 2%, certainly not all, but largely due to the COVID impact. The second biggest factor was a re-estimate of the amount of effort, and therefore hours required to complete the final phases of construction. Georgia Power allocated its remaining contingency and added new contingency of approximately $115 million, further reducing future cost risk through the completion of Unit 4. Embedded in the project's cost to complete are estimated COVID-19 related costs of between $70 million and $115 million for Georgia Power. Also recall, the estimated cost of the time between the aggressive site work plan target date and the regulatory approved November in-service date or a scheduled cost margin of approximately $250 million is also included in Georgia Power's base capital forecast. Together, the replenish costs contingency and the scheduled cost margin continue to represent approximately 20% of the remaining estimated cost to complete. As we have said, we expect to utilize the entirety of contingency funds as we progress towards completion of the project.  The team at Vogtle Units 3 and 4 continues to work incredibly hard and drive meaningful progress at the site, even while managing through the pandemic. As we neared the final phases of construction for Unit 3 and move closer to fuel load, I can assure you that the construction team, our management team and our partners are more focused than ever on bringing in the first unit of this historic project to completion next year. As we approach the final key milestones, we recognize that the aggressive site work plan is increasingly difficult, as most of our optionality relative to May 2021 in-service day has been utilized. But both, management at the site and workforce remain motivated to pursue the aggressive schedule to provide margin to the November regulatory in-service date. Drew, I'll turn it over to you now for an update on the financials and our outlook. Thanks, Drew. Before we take your questions, let me acknowledge Congressman, John Lewis. His funeral is being held in Atlanta today. He was a wonderful man. We are thankful for his service and his work combating racial injustice, and his commitment to non-violence. I also want to address the topic of racial injustice. Recent events have resulted in demonstrations around the world that are leading to necessary and important discussions about racial injustice in our society. One way to think about racial injustice issue is to imagine a series of sine waves over time. Every so often, the peak of the sine wave rises to the point that this issue impacts our national consciousness, and frankly, we all see it. But, with the passage of time, these events fade from the headlines of our nation. However, we all know the underlying systemic problems still exist. One of our objectives at Southern is to keep these important issues at the forefront by focusing on sustained improvement. In my opinion, that's where we should place our efforts today, if we want to make lasting improvements to racial justice in America. We are having meaningful discussions in our Company and are committed to long-term actions. In closing, these are unusual times for our world and nation as we contend with the COVID pandemic, economic uncertainty, and racial injustice. While it is not unusual, it is the way our Company is responding. We're delivering clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to our customers. We are consistently working to understand and meet the needs of our employees, customers and communities, and we remain focused on our key business objectives, including operating our utilities at best-in-class levels, demonstrating cost discipline, and working diligently to bring Vogtle Units 3 and 4 on line by the November regulatory approved in-service dates. We believe Southern Company is well positioned to successfully execute on these fronts and uphold our goal of achieving an attractive risk-adjusted return for our shareholders. We so appreciate you joining us this afternoon. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. It certainly is less than the first time. Look, if you remember when the United States went through this first wave, there was even a lot of conversation about stopping mega projects. We had lots of Southern Company Board meetings, management time, site time, really thinking through what is the best course of action to play here. And as you remember, and I think we've talked about this in the past, we took extraordinary measures to make sure that the workforce at Vogel Units 3 and 4 were better protected at the site than they would be kind of in the surrounding area or when they return home. We did things like we created a medical village at the site that provided testing and PPE and all sorts of things. And we received national acclaim for those steps by folks like the United States Building Trades. So, we did our whole lot. Even so, as we thought about what do we do about the workforce there, we saw a great deal of absenteeism. And so, one of the byproducts of the workforce reduction that we did at the site, roughly 2,000 people, we basically gave people the option to leave. And those people that were most concerned about working in a COVID environment, left. The people that have agreed to say, get the idea that we've got to continue work, that the COVID protocols we put in place make sense, and that their health is being looked after in an excellent way. And the data would show that. And in fact, we finished the first wave with -- we measure the cases of COVID positive tests, we had several periods of time where we went to zero. And so, everything we were doing was working. And, certainly, the productivity started doing pretty well. We are we think now in a second period of COVID wave. And we have -- and I would probably measure this thing probably from Memorial Day is where it kind of started, a lot of people left, coming back to the site, and they've gotten exposed to potentially other sources of impact from the COVID virus. And so, we're seeing that now. So, the question we have to ourselves is, are we reaching a plateau? Are we starting to recover from this thing? We have our own medical staff that we hired to oversee. There are some beliefs that this thing will have a shape similar to the first wave and then it will start to erode, but time will tell. Okay? I mean, the other thing we don't know Julien is whether there will be a third wave and a fourth wave, we just don't know. But, certainly, the folks that are working right now get the idea of working in a COVID environment. And I don't know whether you guys saw my time on Squawk Box this morning. We have a chart in your package, I forget what page it is, that also suggests -- I guess, it's on page 12, that also suggests that America may be adapting to this new reality. And we're seeing it in our numbers. We absolutely don't know whether that will sustain. But, it's a very interesting chart. Yes. So, think about it in two pieces, right? So, one piece is just a straight cost estimate. And so, we've done things like added in additional hours, this effort we talked about. And this rally, we made an estimate on the completion of the construction activities about two years ago. And so, we made estimates on the final civil work, hanging concrete panels, what it would take to do the roof shield building. These are not increases in scope. Rather, they are really estimates of what we believe, how much effort, how much hours will be required in order to accomplish that scope. Another thing that we talk about is I&C, and this is how difficult it is, how much effort is required to run cable from say the sources of electricity to the cabinet, to the terminal point in the plant. Mechanical, how much piping, how much effort will be to finish the pipe work, electrical, cable tray installation, cable poles, we've talked about the size of the cables, and the amount of effort to terminate those cables. I could go on. But, that is where we have kind of taken into account other costs that ultimately go into an increase in the contingency account. It also -- we've added in an allowance for incurring per DM costs through 2021, really the finish of the construction of Unit 4, that wasn't in there before. So we've added a lot in here. And let's think about it in two pieces, one is cost, one is scheduled contingency. Let's make sure we all understand that. 100% dollar is $540 million, Georgia Power share $250 million. You could make your own judgment about when we're going to finish the project. But, that amount of money is derived from the cost of completing in May to November. So, just to pick -- just to give you a point of reference, everything else being equal, if you finished in August, you would have roughly half of that scheduled contingency available. So, that's another way to think about scheduled contingency. Certainly, there could be other costs that can emerge over time. I'll tell you one other thing, Julien. There was a great bit of debate about this whole issue. We really wrestled with this thing. When you think about it and we tried to have these concepts in the script, as we have allocated the remaining contingency and then added back to this 20% number, it is pretty clear to us that we have reduced risk. Because we've identified risk items, we've allocated current contingency and added new. So, there was some argument that said we don't need 20% right now, maybe we should go with a lower number. At the end of the day, we think we took prudent action by this. Let's keep contingency at 20%. Let's not hit any of the contingency available and schedule. And let's move forward on that basis. We think this is a disciplined approach. We think it is conservative. And I think, we're in a good spot. Yes. You bet. And I think it's going to be pretty clear stuff. And I think we're going to give testimony here pretty soon about how we see it versus what they see. And certainly, there's no new data that they're working on. We used the same data. It's really how you view the data is what gives rise to a difference. Like for example, we really start with data that was established some two years ago, and the staff doesn't give us credit for the work done over the past year, in which we have earned a CPI multiple of 1.3. In order to derive their numbers, they use somewhere between 1.4 and 1.45. Well, in fact, they are ignoring our performance over the last two years. And we would argue that -- and we've talked about this on prior calls that all of this electrical work particularly has been especially difficult to do. We call that scheduled versus unscheduled electrical. And as we move into the scheduled electrical work has been really hard and it has given us high CPI numbers. But as we get to the unscheduled CPI numbers, we're getting numbers less than 1. So, as we move forward and get the hard work behind us, there is some, at least reasonable expectation, we will be able to at least maintain the 1.3 CPI. So, we don't believe in their 1.4, 1.45 assumption. The other thing they would say is that they go back to our assumptions, if you recall, on the schedule that was put in place two years ago, in which we had lots -- not a lot, that's a qualitative term, but a good bit of a schedule float time, okay? And in fact, we've consumed a lot of that here recently with the re-estimate and re-sequencing and all that. And that's where we said, we've taken a lot of that margin out. But, the schedule they would use would say things like this that, hot functional tests of fuel load is 5 to 6 months long. Well, we really think it's more like three months. They would say fuel load in service is six months long. Well, we really think it's four months. What they're doing is counting all that management margin time that we now account for. So, look, we have a plan margin. We think that all adds up to that four to five months difference from their own estimate. And I want to say -- I hope somebody will correct me here that their own estimate said something like February of 23 for Unit 4. If you take four to five months away from that that puts us in the summer well in advance of November, at a lower cost. Those would be the big items. Yes. Well, it's almost like you extrapolate from the worst data point and you projected results. Our actual results have been better than that. Yes. Look, I mean, the data is the same. We did have some failure rates on our early testing. We maintain that early testing. It's so illuminating to the future challenges of the project and we have said forever, if you think about values, assumption of risk and return. Yeah, we spend a little more money to do early testing, but we think it is well worth it in risk reduction, in thinking about problems that may lay ahead. If we learn quickly, fail quickly, and then correct in the future, I think that really helps reduce risk in the project. And I think, we've done a great job there. From that 80% number, we have put Tiger teams in place. We have seen improvements. And if you look at these two major tests that were just done, they were put ahead of the cold hydro testing, the structural integrity test, integrated leak rate test. With the allowable margin on the ILRT, we were only at 30% of the allowable margin. I think, even oversight people were surprised that how well that went. I think that really speaks to the future quality of work. There will always be problems. And that's part of what testing is all about, you find the problems and you fix them. So, I'm not saying there won't be problems. But, I think, the rate that they use to extrapolate into the future is way too high. You bet. Thank you. Hey, Michael, how are you? Yes. But, I was completely asymptomatic. My wife Sarah actually was the one that started feeling ill and when she did, she tested positive and then I went in and tested and I was positive. But, I think no germ will have me. I never had a bad -- and now, I'm negative. Thank you. Sure. I think, the good news is, is that they are all running well, and that any lesson we've had we've taken into account, and we've actually gone back and improved some processes that even are newer since. You remember, everybody was kind of freaked out and probably rightfully so on reactor coolant pumps, but we've gotten through that and no issues that we've seen on our site, didn't expect any. The only other thing I would say, especially as we're approaching kind of completion of our unit is that we have much more automation in terms of finishing construction, in terms of testing and variety of other things. The Chinese plant tended to throw personnel at any issue. So, I think we're going to be a little bit different and there won't be as many lessons learned just from the work process, so anyway. Drew, why don't you take the regulatory stuff? I'll do Southern. And remember, Georgia has kind of just completed its triennial deal and not much there. We do have a BCM filing in February, then it will be important. Otherwise, we're carrying out the IRP. We've not received the final order in Alabama. Southern power, we are where we were. We're out in those markets, particularly wind and solar, some storage, and we just find those -- that market be extraordinarily challenging. And we were big into it for a while, but that's an end market was hot. The contract periods are shorter -- I mean the contract terms are tougher. We found that to be a tougher place to allocate capital. And so, what you see is, more than 90% of our net income is coming from these wonderful franchise businesses that are the electrics and the gas. We've allocated one time -- I forget how much it was, it was like 6 billion one year. But now, our allocation of capital to Southern Power, PowerSecure is now about 500 million a year. And I don't know whether we'll spend that or not. We'll just see. But, it doesn't have much of a near term impact. We had closed a couple of wind deals, both -- they were called Redding and Beech Ridge. But again, it's not that big a deal. In terms of their operating performance they're doing great. They're producing what we thought they would. We're just not allocating a lot of future capital that way. It was fascinating about kind of where we cast our die at this point. It's with the franchise businesses. We used to talk a whole lot about Southern Power and what the markets were. Right now, we think regular, predictable, sustainable earnings on a good risk adjusted basis are coming out of our franchises. That's how we're making our money going forward. Yes. As a matter of fact, we are. Now at the risk of telling long story, I'll tell a short story. [Technical Difficulty] my kind of term here, we did something called a SO Prize kind of built along the XPRIZE concept. One of the six winners was hydrogen. So, we've been working on hydrogen now for seven years roughly. Very fascinating kind of idea about hydrogen is that it's a great storage medium. And you can pair hydrogen or hydrogen technology with kind of electrolysis and solar and a variety of other things. The other thing we're looking at is future gas generation that may be able to use hydrogen as a mix with natural gas, or even at the extreme, exclusively in place of natural gas. Remember, we toyed around a little bit of this with Plant Ratcliffe. We think there are applications going forward. And we are hard at work with that. It's one of these things that's R&D for sure. I think right now it's kind of out of the money. But remember, the job of R&D is to say things that are out of the money and make them in the money. That does occupy a certain segment of our R&D budget right now. Funny, you should ask that. That is right. And thank you for all the questions. You are at the heart. I think I mentioned before that we really had enormous debates internally about all this. But, let's just kind of put it this way. In the script, I refer to the fact that when we established the original contingency it was before we had COVID. And COVID was arguably the biggest factor in thinking about, reestablishing a higher contingency level. Of course there were other factors. But that was one of them. And, with respect to recovery, I think that is an issue for the future. We are not saying no and never. And I know there have been some writings in the analyst community about likelihood there. But I don't think it is appropriate for us to go through those issues right now. And therefore, we would not seek to offset and accounting charge with a belief of probable outcome in that regard. The other one that came into that argument was schedule. I will let you all make your own belief about what schedule is. We think May this is consistent with every time we have ever said this. The May aggressive schedule is aggressive, less than 50%, et cetera. And recently, we said it has even gotten tougher, because we have removed margin. At the same time, we say that we expect to achieve November. So we tried to suggest that there range between May and November. And all other things being equal, forget other new challenges we may face. Some event scheduled contingency may be available, but we weren't willing and I should say that scheduled contingency is also referred to in the text here as owners contingency, which requires all of our co-owners, [Indiscernible] me and Dalton Sue agreed to. So we have left it in place.  I think the approach we have taken Angie with respect to the accounting charge associated with the increase in costs and part of increasing costs was a replenishment less contingency is just conservative and prudent. And we think it is the right thing to do. Yes, good question. So if I got you to page seven or the chart seven, whatever it is, Vogtle unit three direct, construction and major milestones, we suggested that we could start cold hydro, kind of in the September, October time frame. And that it would take - I don't know, 10-days. And then shortly thereafter, we will start our functional testing. It is so interesting listening to the investors and thank you for hanging with us through all this. A lot of the bet, if you will, on Southern are taken by the accomplishment of these milestones. We have suggested in the past, if you get to fuel load, that certainly is a whole lot of information. I mean, you passed hot functional test, data to have an operating plan. And it just doesn't operate off nuclear fuel yet. And we passed the ITACs and now we load nuclear fuel and we go on from there. Other people have suggested the next big lever is the hot functional testing. In other words, with a third-party if you will heat source, not nuclear fuel, does the plant work. Every milestone that we have been passing so far, has given us comfort that we have a quality plan and then we will be able to hit our schedule expectations. This chart, I think, lays out our best guess as to what those things may be. And the other thing we added to the script this time was just to give you some comfort on variants Angie and it really goes to the idea. We have said that fuel by the end of the year is our objective and the site is working like dogs to get there. But even if we were three months late, then that suggests perhaps summer in service say. I think all this is meant to give you some sensitivity and an indication of our ability to hit November. I hope that is helpful. Thank you. So Sophie COVID impacts are in rates, pricing usage and other. And so that would be the impact of COVID, which we have denominated for you for each of the two periods. And then you would add back to it any changes in rates or usage of utilities related to the rate activity from last year. And so these really represent O&M relative to last year's performance. It is a good question. We are spending an awful lot of time thinking about costs in general, Southern has always been very strong, had a strong ability to compensate for changes in weather demand, in particular. This year, we have been faced with weather demand and with impacts related to the Corona Virus. And we have been very pleased with the discipline that each of our employees has exhibited. We are looking at the components of those costs. And in general, you could imagine with the cessation of hiring will have a reduction in headcount relative to our expectation, no reduction in our actual workforce, which leads to reduction of benefits and incentives and travel and entertainment and a number of cascading factors. We have also had a series of expenses related to operations of facilities, which are not safety related, but because generation has been lighter due to COVID and whether, we actually had been able to through normal cycles deferred. This is not a deferral of maintenance, maintenance that will pass until the unit has operated for certain number of hours is maybe the right way to think about it. We also have other factors like vegetation management that works, I guess the seven year cycle. But suffice it to say there were a number of items that are one in period. And two that might create a headwind for future. And we are just monitoring those buckets and we want to make sure we are responsive to current period, but also future period. And so, I wouldn't say that these would necessarily hold in that will examine what our needs are after we get through the next three months, which is the lion share of the summer cooling season. Well no, I think it is a fair question. But I think it is a question for kind of, right now, everything you are dealing is an estimate. It really isn't a cash impact right now, not a material one. This is really what we are estimating going forward. Let some time pass and let's see what we are doing, and we certainly have the history of ongoing constructive conversations with regulators about unforeseen circumstances, and that is probably not going to happen this year. Let's see in the future. Thank you. Always glad to have you with us. And once again, historically, we deal with that in our first quarter or no, our year-end call, which would be early February. We will update all that, but yeah, there is - and if there was something material we would say so. But you should just travel with what you have. Thank you so much. 261. Those are those are open that is out of 399. So, we have completed 138, just to save you from the math. Paul, one another thing on the 261, a lot of those are what we call UIN. That means we have essentially had these ITACs approved Ethics Commission except for the results of the test. Yes. Yes, but I wouldn't get excited about that. We made that change in February. And so if you have construction work hours after hot functional test, it would be things that aren't critical to the operation of the plant, in other words, not critical to the nuclear operation. So it may be civil were. Yes. Yes. Yes sir. So let's say we start kind of early September around cold hydro. I think that is what that blue is meant to do. We think there is probably a month difference between the start of cold hydro and the start of hot function. I mentioned cold hydro test about -. Oh gosh. We can complete it in 10-days. Yes. I mean, the simple volley on that logic sale is that they are using data that is more than 30-years old, you know, that is kind of the way they think about it in that regard. The more relevant way to think about it is what China was able to do. We originally allowed six months, China was able to do it in four and a half months, our numbers, and we have our own opinion. But the other thing that I might should have mentioned before, but I will say now Westinghouse is consistent between the work in China and the work here in the United States at Vogtle. And we get the benefit of their experience. And remember, we have always had people in China looking at all that experience, we have had our own people there. So, I think that is an obvious, in my opinion, and I hope they don't make anybody mad, but I just think there is a logic law that is you are going to make your estimate based on heaven forbid 1970s, 80s data world is different now, and we have a much better marker for experience in China than we do those projects. And even the orange could be moved. You could start hot functional test later than what we show here that is a good schedule shot of what November would look like. If you chose to do November, you can actually start hot functional test much later than what we indicate here and still hit November. It is two months, we used to have in there, Paul and what you may be remembering is 30 days of kind of management, but it is a two month schedule. Thank you sir. Well, listen, well you are getting some we are going to attack the question, you are hitting a very interesting question. Okay. How much of the O&M saving through Drew and were arguing about this the other day is deferrals and those are going to show up later 15%. So, 85% are captured and permanent is what we believe. Okay, only 15% is temporal. And that may be made up with what happened kind of at the summer, we get, a long period of warm weather or less than expected COVID impacts or not then we will turn that money on this year, it probably would be more vegetation management related and it would say deferral of outages because through explained it beautifully if the plants not running, you take an outage based on essentially, the time on turbans and things like that. If they're not running you defer the outage. Was that helpful? But he is exactly right. I mean, we are debating these things around the Management Council table as the CEOs of all of our opco and the major functional. It is a fascinating question. What does this tell us about a way to operate more efficiently in the future. I think we have gained on O&M I think we do lose by the collegiality of walking down the halls and working with each other. We are trying to make that up, with texts and phone calls and emails. It is not the same, but there's something in between that we need to capture. Yes, so let's dial the clock back to when we were just getting buffeted by all sorts of offers, if you will express in - right, but would there were, I think I have mentioned this before, whatever something like five different big deals that we were looking at, and then one came in at the end, there's almost five and a half, I don't know. We have never been committed in a kind of deep way to pipeline growth. So, what did we do? Go back and look, it was we bought 50% of the Southern Natural Gas system. owned by Kinder Morgan at the time. And recall that the reason we did that deal was we felt that natural gas generation, particularly in the northern half of our system, was inextricably tied to SONAP Southern Natural Gas Pipe. And if you remember that day, I think most everybody would say we bought that well, we got a good price. It was really important, I think to Kinder Morgan for us to say a customer. And so we were able to do that. I forget what our share is of that pipe is 50% or better of the throughput of SONAP comes to us. So there was this kind of notion of synergy and integration. The other thing we said that day was we viewed this as an annuity. It is a good annuity because we bought it at a good price. We did not include any expansion of that pipe in any of our financial plans. We have done a few things around the edges but nothing material. So here is my view. There was so much symbiosis between SONAP in our plans for generation and Southern, we felt like that was a smart bet. And because we were able to buy it well, it fit in very well in our portfolio, but it fits in as an annuity, not as a growth engine. In terms of our appetite going forward look, I just think that is an extraordinarily difficult business right now. And, I'm sorry for my friends, Tom Farrell, and Lynn Good on ACP. I know they work very hard to make that a reality. It was just the right thing for us not to be part of that. And the other thing is, what is the future of gas pipeline? Look, I said when we did AGL deal that I thought gas was a bridge to 2050. I kind of blinked in that now to say boy beyond 2050. But in order to hit net zero. What we are going to have to do and that is what Southern does uniquely compared to any other company in our industry, is invest in technologies are going to be able to deal with the carbon atom coming off gas generation. We are doing that. There is no a national leader that compares to us. We run the nation's Carbon Capture Research Center, we run the International Carbon Capture Research Center. We are doing all sorts of other money where our mouth is activities to deal with carbon. That is why we are confident. As we think about the portfolio going forward, that we are investing in optionality, that is going to be able to keep gas part of the solution, but we will have to deal with the carbon atoms. I'm sorry, what was that? It is not a front burner issue though. Thank you, sir. I have looked through all this stuff. I don't that one doesn't jump off the page. It sounds like, we believe in conservative disclosures. We don't know of any exposure to future write-off in the future. I mean, we've given you everything. Is it possible there could be further? What, I don't think so. I mean, in just to replay this one, this was, this is a legacy business unit, it was very important to, if you guys remember Southern Energy it started out Southern Electric International. In fact, I was effectively the CFO of that for a while. And then it became Southern Energy and then we spun it out and became merit in the spin out. We took over the leasing business. Those guys liked financial engineering. I don't like financial engineering never had. But the leasing business was kind of hot at one time in the world, because you could kind of structure net income. That was the idea. [indiscernible] was one of those projects. The reassessment really dealt with the terminal value of that plan and I think it has a power sale contract with TDA that expires in 32. We reevaluated, the terminal value based on what it costs we think to operate the plant in 33 and beyond relative to the market for this plant compared to say natural gas. Natural gas prices up 35% cheaper this year than they were last year. And therefore the assessment of terminal value went to zero. And therefore you failed the impairment test and therefore we wrote the whole thing off. Why don't you pick up on that, we kind of drafted around that one a little bit or the 75 to 115 refers to COVID. Okay, comma, and then there are other potential costs. Okay. So what you are reading there, 75 to 115 is COVID and then there may be other things. And other things may go to the performance of subcontractors that may go to I don't know - per GN an extension and 21 beyond where we are now things like that. Super. Thank you my friend. We are adding, we are a little below, so if you do, they're just the big numbers. We went from 9,000 to 7,000. Actually, we just below 7000. We are adding back now about a 100 of 200 new electricians. In effect, this is a summary of what we have said before. But recall, we move people off of unit 4 to unit 3, or adding back electricians to kind of catch up on unit four now, that is kind of the way you should think about it. So that is about where we are. The other thing that is kind of good is we think there's personnel available, particularly on the Gulf Coast and some other areas, the labor unions, yields, building trades and others have been terrific to work with here. Well, it doesn't assume, so remember, the aggressive schedule is aggressive. It does assume improvement in productivity for sure. So, I mean, the other data point I guess, I can give you is if you just kind of extend where we have been with no improvement. We are trying to hit the 2% per month and the 1% per month, 2% associated with aggressive schedule, 1% associated with November. We are kind of hitting right down the middle of airway with no improvement. Let me assure you, we are trying to reach improvement. And the other thing I mentioned earlier on this call that I hope people remember. We are finishing up this tough part of electrical, that is the cable trays and pulling these gigantic cables and terminating them in very close basis. And remember, we refer to this in the language in the script. When we talk about losing the production. As we went to a COVID protocol, for example, said having an army of people in a closed space. We would have like no more than three people in a work space. So we couldn't make the amount of action done, just because we had fewer people there. That pushed out construct and that gave rise to the change in the assets. All of those are COVID impact. Worked hard to get it done, we will see. Yes, their fee is at risk. That is the big thing. And let me just tag on those guys. Brendan [indiscernible], Jack Future, Brian. Anyway, they are terrific. And Brian Miley, they are terrific folks to work with. We meet with them all the time. I'm in the meetings where we meet with them now the - our onsite team that [indiscernible] and others meets with him daily right. But there are monthly meet with Brendan [indiscernible] Jack Future himself. Come to the meeting with Paul Bowers, CEO of Georgia Power, me, Drew Evans is there. Our co-owners is there. Dr. Jacobs is there, the PSC stat, DOE is there, NRC is there. Everybody sees a completely transparent picture of where we are. And we think this is served us, so well. Yes, I think that is a question you would rather ask [indiscernible] or even, boiler room kind of stuff. But it started successfully, incentives is a way to -. Sure. Thank you. Thanks, everybody. These are unique times, aren't they? I think we are going to look back at 2020. And maybe the way we look back at 1968, or some other big years in history in the United States. When I think about the work being done at Vogtle 3 and 4 and the adjustments those people have made to continue to progress the Vogtle 3 and 4 site. It is nothing short of heroic. And they deserve our gratitude. And I think they continue to make great progress under a lot of duress. So, thanks for that team there. Thanks to our co-workers at [indiscernible] And all the subcontractors. I know it is important to you guys. We see ourselves now in the short rows of that process, at least for unit 3. And it is such an exciting time to look at the end of the tunnel and in fact see daylight. So we look forward to making progress in October when we meet back with you at the end of the third quarter. We will have a lot more transparency on what the summer did for revenues. And we will have I think a new estimate on what we are going to do this year. And on in terms of guidance, and we will have a lot more, I think visibility on where we are in 3 and 4, such exciting times. If we can just get our social unrest under order, and pay attention to making sure that not only the watts of our business are done well, but the house of our business are done well in a systemic way. Not in a periodic way. I think we will all be better as a company and as a nation. Thank you all so much for following us. We appreciate your time today. Operator, that concludes the call."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Southern Company's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today's call is being recorded Thursday, April 30, 2020. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Investor Relations Director. Please go ahead, sir.\nScott Gammill: Thank you, Nelson. Good afternoon, and welcome to Southern Company's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Drew Evans, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you, we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Qs and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.\nTom Fanning: Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. I hope that you're well. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted results for the first quarter, ahead of our estimate. This solid start to the year positions us well as we look to overcome short-term sales impacts from the coronavirus. Drew will provide you with more detail on our financials momentarily, so I will go ahead and turn to our current operating environment, amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Southern Company, our top priority remains keeping every employee healthy and safe, while we continue to provide clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy for our customer. We were well prepared to quickly make necessary adjustments across our business activating internet response team throughout the company in February. We continue to execute COVID-19 pandemic plans for our business. And to-date, our operational performance has been exceptional. We have not experienced nor do we currently foresee supply chain disruptions for our utilities or our construction projects. We often talk about the importance of the reliability and resilience of our electric and natural gas infrastructure, which has delivered remarkably well during this time. In face of COVID-19, our biggest asset has really been the reliability and resiliency of our workforce. I want to thank our employees who have risen to every challenge. We have been resourceful and rapidly procuring and deploying necessary protective equipment and implementing effective protocols to safeguard against the virus. Our operations and customer service teams have continued to work around the clock. We are finding solutions to effectively work in teams remotely, and we are communicating with our workforce and external stakeholders in a whole new way. We've implemented a wide range of projects to support the physical, financial and emotional well being of our employees during this time as they continue their superb work to support the operation of our company. It's also a hallmark of our company to be a citizen wherever we serve. So we have worked to identify, how we can best assist our communities during these difficult times. Southern and its subsidiaries are targeting a commitment of nearly $10 million in financial -- I'm sorry, in foundation and charitable contributions. And our employees have logged thousands of volunteer hours to assist those impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. I expect, we will do even more in the coming months. Let’s turn now to an update on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. We remain focused on meeting the November '21 and November 2022 regulatory-approved in-service dates. And we continue to maintain an aggressive work plan on-site as a tool to help position us to meet those dates. Recall, in February, we refined the aggressive site work plan to reflect a May 2021 completion target for Unit 3 and a March 2022 completion target for Unit 4. We also laid out a November benchmark schedule and related milestone for Unit 3. Through March, production for Unit 3 was generally consistent with the refined aggressive site work plan. April's performance was challenged due to COVID 19 impact, which put us slightly behind the aggressive site work plan. Despite these challenges, today, direct construction is approximately 90% complete. And notably, just late breaking new, we have just completed open vessel testing. That came in about 1 p.m. today. We also reached several interim construction milestones for Unit 4 during the quarter, including the installation of the Polar train and setting the containment vessel topic. Before giving an update on recent productivity, I want to highlight our commitment to the safety of our workforce on-site and in the surrounding community. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken a number of proactive measures intended to protect our workforce and the community against the spread of COVID-19. As we implement these measures, we’ve engage independent medical advisors to guide our actions to reduce the possible spread of the virus. Among other measures, we have provided additional protective equipment, enhanced sanitation practices and implemented its social distancing strategy, such as spreading out and increasing common areas, eliminating group transportation at the site and mandating those who can tell a work to do so. Beyond these basics, early on, our protocol on-site ensured that anyone tested and their closed contacts will promptly self isolated off-site. We acted quickly to build an on-site medical clinic, designed to expedite test results, mineralize turn around time for close proximity screening and improved facilitation of clearing personnel to return to work. Throughout this time, we have remained in close consultation with the nuclear regulatory commission and the projects co-owners as well as local and state authorities. We are also consulting with and monitoring other mega projects. Notably last month, the President of the North American Building Trade Unions Commended Southern Company for going above and beyond the call of duty to keep their members on the Vogtle construction site, safe and healthy. Now turning to our recent progress. Although overall monthly production through March was largely consistent with the refined aggressive site work plan, mechanical, electrical and subcontract activities began to build a backlog to Unit 3 aggressive site work plan at the end of March. That trend was exacerbated through April, as we began experiencing impact across the site related to the coronavirus pandemic, including an increase in workforce absenteeism. Two weeks ago, in an effort to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19, we announced our intent to reduce density on the site and take workforce down by 20%. As we work through this transition, we expect to see a decrease in near term production, similar to the sawtooth effects that we have experienced in the past. Longer term objectives is to gain operational efficiencies and productivity by reducing workforce fatigue and absenteeism. As we move ahead, we will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of our streamlined workforce. As you know, we regularly evaluate both costs and schedule, and we have factored recent developments into our ongoing analysis. Looking first its schedule. We are prioritizing keyword fronts on Unit 3 and continue to work towards the aggressive site work plan targets, which have been pushed back slightly in light of recent events. The next major milestone for Unit 3 is the start of cold hydro testing, which is currently planned to occur in the June to July timeframe. Considering our expected timing on the start of cold hydro testing, we expect Unit 3 hot functional testing to commence in the August to September timeframe. On the assumption that we are able to stabilize and increase productivity to pre-pandemic levels, we are maintaining the aggressive site work plan targets of year end for Unit 3 fuel load. As a reminder, construction completion of about 2% per month is consistent with the aggressive site work plan. Taking into account our performance to date, we now project that we need to complete approximately 1% per month to meet the November benchmark schedule. Now, this is slightly down from the 1.3%, we discussed last quarter. Importantly, even amid the outbreak of the pandemic for April, our construction completion rate was about 1.25%, which supports meeting the November 2021 regulatory-approved in-service dates. Critical areas of focus remain electrical and subcontract performance. Lastly, consisting with the prioritization of Unit 3 and related staffing, we have shifted the target completion date on the aggressive site work plan for Unit 4 back to May 2022, which still provides six months of margin to the regulatory-approved in-service date. Recall, under the refined aggressive site work plan we laid out in February, we accelerated the target completion date for Unit 4 by two months to March. So the current action takes us back to the prior day of May, 2022. Turning now to cost. Based on our most recent assessment, there is no change in the total project capital cost forecast. In the first quarter of 2020, Georgia Power allocated an additional 66 million of its project contingency, reflecting cost risks associated with construction productivity, field support, subcontract and procurement, as well as the impacts of the April 2020 reduction in workforce. Recall the estimated cost of time between the aggressive site work plan and the regulatory-approved November in-service date or a schedule embedded in Georgia Power's based capital forecast. With this quarter's contingency allocation, the scheduled cost margin and the remaining cost contingency combined continue to represent approximately 20% of the remaining estimated cost to complete. As we have said, we expect to utilize the entirety of the contingency funds as we progress towards the completion of the project. The team at Vogtle Units 3 and 4 have worked incredibly hard to create an environment at the site that has led to meaningful progress over the past few months even while managing through this unprecedented pandemic. The next few months will be pivotal as we adjust to a smaller, more streamlined workforce and seek to improve productivity. The safety of our workforce and the surrounding community remains paramount and we continue to guide our decision making at the site. Importantly, we still expect to meet the November regulatory approved and service from both Units 3 and 4. Drew, I'll turn it over now to you for an updated on our financials and our outlook.\nDrew Evans: Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everybody. I hope you all are well. As Tom mentioned, we have a very strong start to the year, first quarter adjusted EPS was $0.78, which is $0.08 higher than last year and $0.06 above our estimate for the quarter. The primary driver compared to last year was constructive state regulatory actions, which were completed in 2019 at our utilities. In addition, through aggressive cost control, we were able to decreased non-fuel O&M year-over-year, which helped us overcome and hence an impact from warmer to normal weather in the first quarter. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results is included in today's release and earnings package. Weather normalized retail sales for the first quarter 2020 were up slightly compared to last year led by our residential customer flats, with only modest impacts from COVID-19 evidence in the last two weeks of the quarter. We added over 20,000 new electric and natural gas customers across the system, which is consistent with our expectations. With COVID-19, top of mind, let's go ahead and turn our assessment of potential -- to the assessment of potential business impacts. While we did not see a meaningful earnings impact from COVID-19 in the first quarter, we are continually assessing potential financial impacts on our business. At this time, we do not expect coronavirus impact to materially affect our long-term outlook. Our expected long-term EPS growth rate remains 46%, our $40 billion five-year capital investment plan is unchanged, we do not foresee a need to issue equity for 2024, liquidity is strong with good access to the capital markets at both the parent and our subsidiaries. And with last week's announcements of $0.08 annual dividend increase -- the 19th consecutive annual increase we continue to demonstrate our commitment to enhancing shareholder value. As we think about the potential near-term impact of COVID-19 on our 2020 expectations our key focus areas are sales, bad debt expense and liquidity. Just a moment, I am going to switch microphones, so both can hear me better. Starting with sales, as I mentioned, whether normalized retail sales, were up slightly for the first quarter, slightly reflecting higher residential demand, at the end of March, as people begin to Tele working, thus far, in April, total estimated weather-normalized electric retail demand is lower than our forecast by approximately 8%. So April lows are historically volatile and customer switched between heating and cooling. We have seen demand stabilize at these approximate levels over the last few weeks. We'll continue to closely monitor trends, as businesses within our states begin to reopen. Looking ahead, we are basing our current forecast for 2020 on a U-shaped economic recovery that reflects a mid-summer phase out of the stay at home policies with modest economic recovery, across the service territories, over the balance of the year. Using these assumptions are projections indicate an overall defined retail sales, for the full year in a range of 2% to 5%, on or whether normalize basis whereas residential up 1% to 3%, commercial down 5% to 10%, and industrial down 4% to 8%. As a reminder, construction completion of about 2% per month is consistent with the aggressive site about each customer plans. Retail sales in these ranges with lower total non-critical electrical revenue by approximately $250 million to $400 million on a consolidated basis, we plan to mitigate these impacts by continuing to aggressively manage on them throughout the remainder of the year. While the current situation is unprecedented, we demonstrated a similar level of cost discipline in response to the 2008, 2009 recession, which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver in the current environment. Of course, actual impacts will be highly dependent on the duration of stable polices and the pace of economic recovery. As visibility of these factors improves, we will hone our expectations around an appropriate level of cost control. At this time, we do not anticipate significant sales or financial impacts from COVID-19 on Southern power we're Southern Company gas. Due to the long-term contracted nature of Southern Power's business model, we expect it to be largely insulated from pandemic impacts. Southern Company Gas has already achieved roughly half of its expected full year net income, in the first quarter. And we expect earnings over the remainder of the year to be consistent with our forecast. In addition to sales, we are also assessing the potential for an increase in bad debt expense. Specifically, our electric utilities, utilities, sellers most around the country are not disconnecting customers for non payment. And we are temporarily waiting late payment fees. Our states regulators are taking these defer incremental bad debt expenses related to this pandemic for recovering future -- recovery in future rate proceedings. In addition, our gas utilities are largely decoupled and may have bad debt and may have bad debt mechanisms already in place, which helped to insulate them from both sales and non-payment impacts. We also expect increased federal funding for programs like lightning and certain provisions in the TTC program to assist eligible customers with built in. Including regulatory mechanisms and customer assistance programs, we believe that expensive acts will be largely mitigated. Turning now to liquidity depend on the actions we took in the first quarter, Southern's net liquidity at the end of March -- by $800 million relative to year-end 2019 and currently stands at over $7 billion. In the second quarter, we have already taken steps to further strengthen our liquidity position, including completion of a $1 billion issuance with a parent in April. At this juncture, we believe we have ample liquidity for Apple [ph] investment plans, protect our dividends, and weather potential COVID-related volatility in debt markets, as well as elevated [ph] periods of customer non-payment With solid results through the first quarter, our current belief is that O&M reductions can largely offset pandemic-related sales impacts with peak electric loads still to come, we see no reason to deviate from our current financial objectives. Consistent with historical practice, we will address earnings for the year, relative to our EPS guidance after the third quarter. For the second quarter, we assume that pressure on retail sales will persist, so it is too early to predict with precision like the overall [indiscernible], recognizing all of these factors, we are providing adjusted EPS for the second quarter of $0.55. Before I turn it back to Tom, I'd like to give a brief update on some regulatory matters. In March, the Mississippi Public Service Commission unanimously approved the rate settlement breach between Mississippi Power and TSP staff [ph], resulting in a rate decrease for customers, and an increase in the allowed equity ratio for Mississippi Power of 55%. On the global front, we filed DCM 22 [ph] with Georgia PSC in mid-February, requesting verification and approval of $674 million spend of the period of July through December of 2019. We expect a decision from PFC in August. Before I turn it back to Tom, I’d like to thank our Southern family for an outstanding job during this period. Everyone has taken the new normal and stride has remained focused on our customer at all levels. You've shown superior performance and total commitment. I hope everyone stays well, and with that I'll turn it back to Tom.\nTom Fanning: Thanks, Drew. As our nation seeks a path to recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, at Southern Company, we are resolute in our commitment to provide clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy for your customers. To ensure that we are actively supporting recovery efforts, Southern Company and our subsidiaries are engaged with policymakers at both the State and Federal level as they make critical decisions about reopening our economies. Notably, Alabama Power's CEO, Mark Crosswhite and I were named as part of the President's Economic Revival Initiative. Along with the work that I do to help lead the Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council, the principal liaison between the federal Government and the electric power industry, which has been heavily involved in pandemic recovery efforts. Southern Company continues its leadership at a national level. Before we take your questions, I also want to highlight the extraordinary response of our teams after the recent severe storms. In April, we experienced two successive weekends of devastating tornadoes across our Southeast service territories that damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes and businesses. Our employees on the frontlines worked tirelessly to restore service to the thousands of electric and natural gas customers that were affected by these storms. In the aggregate, we restored service to over 600,000 customers within 24 hours, improved our capacity to work under duress effectively with coronavirus protocols. I am grateful for and extremely proud of the men and women of Southern Company, who continue to work hard each day to deliver value to customers and shareholders during these extraordinary times. In closing, the COVID-19 pandemic will undoubtedly have a lasting impact on the U.S. and global economies and on communities we serve. Under what we currently view as a reasonable economic recovery scenario, we are positioning ourselves to mitigate potential financial impacts on our company through aggressive and thoughtful cost control. The next several months will be particularly instructive for Southern and our utilities as we monitor the pace of recovery, move into the warm summer season and work to increase productivity at Vogtle Units 3 and 4. We expect our business will remain reliable and resilient over the long-term in keeping with our long history of delivering on our commitments to customers, employees and shareholders. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed.\nTom Fanning: Hello, Shar. How are you?\nShar Pourreza: Hey, guys. Good. How are you doing?\nTom Fanning: Great.\nShar Pourreza: So just a couple of questions here. First, just sort of, thinking about some of the moving pieces. We're looking at COVID sales impact for a 2% to 5 % reduction versus prior guidance of flat to up 1%, better-than-expected Q1, slightly weaker Q2 guidance versus, I guess, expectations, OEM lever. We're assuming kind of normal weather, where do you see coming in within your earnings guidance range for the year? And then just remind us the sales growth figures for March and April on slide 11. Are they weather normalized, especially with the recent storms in your jurisdictions. How do we extrapolate, how much of that was weather versus COVID versus anything else?\nTom Fanning: So with respect to the first question, when we set a guidance range, I think, you know, we broadly think that kind of the midpoint of the range is a place that without all these other impacts we do that we would expect to land. I think we remain consistent with our financial objectives for the year. You know, I will add, I know we received some conversation about should we reaffirm. Let me just hit that real quick. It has never been our practice to reaffirm guidance in interim periods. We give you guidance in -- at the end of the year so that would be late January, February. And then once we get through our peak kind of earnings season, which would be the third quarter that’s one when we give a update as to our guidance. We believe we're committed to hitting our financial objectives. Of course, there is uncertainty in front of us, and we run the same uncertainty everybody else does. But with what we know right now with reasonable impacts, we remain committed to everything that we've said so far. So we are sticking with that. I think further evidence of that is the recent increase in dividend.  Shar, what else did you want there?\nShar Pourreza: Sorry, just the weather on slide 11, the impacts that you have from March through April. How much is that weather normalized, and how much of it is impacted from COVID versus the recent storms?\nDrew Evans: That is weather normalized. So virtually all open. Shar, I think I have just addressed one other piece of your question related to our guidance strong estimate for second quarter. Second quarter typically is a relatively light quarter for us in terms of total demand and you can imagine that there's a big difference between June’s expectation and April's expectation. We also feel like this is the period where COVID-19 is going have the greatest amount of impact across the retail customer base, whether it's residential, commercial or industrial. And even though we are putting measures in place to reduce expenses, those will largely be over the balance of the period and you're looking some adjusted to what is a very constrained quarter in terms of sales. So I would just take it in that light. Also, if you look at last year, I think we reported $0.18 for the quarter, $0.18 of that mix was weather related. So I think what we're putting out consistent with what we've already reported for the first quarter is\nTom Fanning: Yes, Drew, thanks for that. I actually went back over the last eight years and just look at what did we estimate. And believe it or not, this is within the range of estimates. The kind of low was 65. In fact, I want to say, in 2018, we estimate it $0.65. And when you consider you have the effect of the covirus -- the coronavirus impact, who knows, but it seems like a reasonably conservative estimate for -- from my standpoint. I'm okay with it\nShar Pourreza: Got it. And just on Vogtle, given the impact of COVID and the move to push the aggressive unit foresight plan back to May from March, I know we've in the past, we've talked about being hopeful that we could see the units come online somewhere between the budgeted and the more aggressive time lines. Is that kind of not reality at this point? And I know you will continue to keep that May aggressive schedule until there's zero probability it could be met. What probabilities are the site managers placing now on meeting the aggressive schedule and at what point could you move away from May to something closer to the midpoint between the aggressive and budget as schedule? Thanks.\nTom Fanning: Shar, let me pick it. One of the predicates in your question, and that was until there's zero probability. That's really not the case. We've kind of do a reasonable shot, and we stick with that. Look, we have used some margin here. We had an extra month of kind of hidden margin between hot functional test and fuel load. Essentially, we have seen so far losing kind of 10 days to 14 days in the aggressive schedule. We think through May, we'll lose another two weeks. The site people are going to work like crazy to mitigate the loss of that month. But we had a month of, if you will, margin in between now and fuel load that we're just consuming. Is it riskier than it was before? Yes. But it's still a reasonable objective. Otherwise, we wouldn't stick with it, okay? One last point. When we go from in the schedule from fuel load to in-service, recall, we have maintained -- and I know this has been a conversation in many earnings calls. We have maintained a six-month schedule there. China did it in 4.5 months, and we think we can meet or beat China. So we actually have a little more margin even to November and to May. So look, November is what matters. We got to beat November, and our eyes are on that. The site continues to believe they can hit a May schedule. Has it gotten more aggressive? Yes, still is a reasonable shot at it.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. Congrats guys on the results and stay safe, and we'll see you soon.\nTom Fanning: Sure. Thanks. Same to you, bud.\nShar Pourreza: All right.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.\nTom Fanning: Hi, Steve.\nSteve Fleishman: Hey, Tom. Good afternoon.\nTom Fanning: Good afternoon.\nSteve Fleishman: So a couple of questions. So the -- has the workforce reduction been implemented now? And did it end up being around 20% that took that plan?\nTom Fanning: Yes. Yes.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And is it -- okay. And is it -- maybe just give some color on -- obviously, there's different people doing different things there. Are there areas where you need to refill people for certain skills? Or just how does that play out?\nTom Fanning: Yes. In general, what we were able to do is to bring people off of four on to three. That's how we filled whatever gaps we thought we may see. Recall, and this was in the 8-K, I think, the first reduction was voluntary. And then we moved to what we call rightsizing. So the voluntary effort didn't produce an optimal kind of result for all the work phases that we have at the plant. And remember, as I said in the script and everything else, we're particularly concerned with getting the right mix and the right productivity in electrical and with subcontracts. And so what we did by moving resources away from four, we bolstered the mix on unit three, so that we believe that there's a reasonable shot to maintain the aggressive schedule, which has a May in-service date. So that really is what has happened. Now, the other thing I just want to put out is that, we are in transition. In the script, I mentioned, the idea about this sawtooth effect. And we've seen that every time now, and those of you that follow these calls will remember, that every time we open up a new workforce - a new work phase in the plant, every time we lead to an increase in personnel, well, and now, even with the decrease in personnel as we may mix crews and schedules and everything else. We believe that sawtooth effect will occur. And so, that's why we're being reasonably conservative with May. In other words, we did 1.25% in April, would still beat the 1% that we need for November. May maybe similarly challenged. We hope it's a little better, but don't be surprised if it's not that great. But then we expect in June and beyond to really pick up the sawtooth effect and achieve what we want to do, as we have done in the past. So, when we've talked to you about sawtooth effect in the past, in fact, it has occurred. So let us readjust, get the teams right, get the work practices back together and then we think we'll get the performance we want to see.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And then, when will we kind of get an update of how the Commission is kind of feeling about how Vogtle is going? Is that -- would that be in this VCM or really the next one? Are they going to do any special hearing on it?\nTom Fanning: Yes. Well, let me answer that a couple of ways. Steve, I know you're really good about this and others on the call are in terms of contacting the Commission directly or looking at all the filings and everything else. So you have heard directly kind of from the Commissioner himself, I would never put words in their mouth. But the other thing that I would just highlight to people is that Tuesday, so just a few days, the company will be testifying. And you'll be able to see the interplay between the company and the staff and everybody else. And so we'll get some illumination there.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And then my last question is just on -- just making sure I understand the assumptions for sales. And when you talk about kind of start-up later in the summer and then recovery, is recovery kind of off of this very low level now? Or when you're talking about recovery, what do you mean by that?\nDrew Evans: Steve, actually, can you hear me all right? We're having some technical difficulties, as Tom and I socially distance.\nSteve Fleishman: I hear you well.\nDrew Evans: Good.\nSteve Fleishman: Yes.\nDrew Evans: We're modelling a bunch of different things, whether it's V, U, W or L, In general, the midline of our sort of 250 to 400 is probably something like delayed re-emergence from stay-at-home kind of through mid-summer, maybe even until August and then some recovery through the balance of the year, but certainly not complete. If we look at the different customer classes that we're tracking today, I mean, our industrial segment, which is not the largest contributor to earnings, by the way, is actually performing quite well, but it is very. And so things like pulp and paper, some of the larger segments, chemical, are doing quite well because of low input cost because of demand on product. Some of the things like precursors to automotive or light still are going to take a little bit longer to rebound. But those industries as we're watching are starting to reopen and automotive production is beginning to restart across Georgia and Alabama, in particular. On the commercial side, we've seen a pretty exaggerated decrease. Some of our bigger customers there are certainly in retail and education, but some of those segments are starting to move back. And so I think the 2% to 5% total that we gave you really represents those different actions in aggregate, but we're looking at it in a pretty detailed way.\nTom Fanning: And I'll just add to that, too. So everybody, I think, knows that Georgia is one of the states stepping out on re-emerging. Of course, we're doing it in a thoughtful phased process. The other issue that I would put out there is fuel prices are really low. For the quarter, natural gas was $1.88 per million BTU. And I think the amount of natural gas cost borne by customers was around $250 million -- $247 million lower than last year. So cost of electricity, and therefore, consumption of energy is more cost-efficient than it has been before. There's a lot in the mix right now. And also, I'll just say that been in contact with my friend, Jay Powell from the Fed, I would complement, and I know there's all kinds of disagreement about this, but I would complement broadly the federal response, whether it's the administration, whether it's Congress, whether it's the Fed, in terms of the timeliness of their response and supporting the economy, especially as compared to, say, 2008, 2009, these guys are on top of it. And I'm sure we can all criticize one step here or there. But I think all the necessary chemicals are in the sea to produce something that will minimize hopefully the impact going forward.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. Thank you.\nTom Fanning: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nTom Fanning: Hey, Steven. How are you?\nStephen Byrd: Hi, good afternoon. Good. I just wanted to follow-up on the status of COVID at the Vogtle work site. And you've taken steps to reduce risk. Is there -- we're trying to sort of track the number of cases. Is there a risk of a trajectory of more cases such that you have to sort of adjust work practices at the site further? Or do you feel that sort of the changes you've made have made the impacts to the number of cases that you were looking for?\nTom Fanning: No. In fact, look, we started very early on before there were any COVID-19 effects, we were planning that there would be. And one of the very first things we did, I remember it was a weekend all of the executive team, was to move to the site, essentially of medical village staff by nurses and doctors, we have a disease specialist that's been advising the site daily. We have all the PPE we need. We have turnaround and testing conservative work practices. And in fact, on realization, I kind of -- we've debated about talking about this on the call, but I'll throw a little bit of it out there. Our incidence rate compared to the utility industry is about half, maybe 40%, something like that. Our severity of cases is way low. One of the very smart steps that the site did very early on was to remove from the site at least on a voluntary basis with pay, people that would be most likely to be severely impacted. That is elderly or older. Look, I'm probably that category. I don't want to describe myself as elderly and if they had a pre-existing condition. So if you look at it, one other thing we do that's very conservative that other people aren't doing. That is, if somebody at the site just feels funny, if they don't feel well and want to get tested, we get them tested. Not only that, we take their work associates out that have the close contact and we test them. When you look at the amount of testing per person at the site relative to anywhere in the community we serve, it is somewhere we are testing between five and 10 times more people then what's being tested elsewhere in the region. So it's amazing stuff. So sometimes in these close contact cases, we will test somebody that is asymptomatic, oh, ensure they turned up positive, we removed them. And the other kind of telling factor is severity. I think we've only had one or two people be hospitalized or go to a hospital. Otherwise, they're being tested with the folks on-site and about half of the people that have been tested positive have returned to work. I think that's all pretty positive stuff. A couple more things that we're doing. At any work front, we limit the amount of people doing the social distancing to three per work site. So sometimes, we exceed that with everybody's approval, but that generally is the practice. We have eliminated close quarters great areas, close quarter lunch areas, the big bussing, and all that stuff. We really have worked hard right away early on to make sure and the principle was that we wanted Plant Vogtle 3 and 4 to be a better environment for the workers there than what they could find elsewhere in their homes or in their communities in the surrounding area. And I think we’ve done that.\nStephen Byrd: That's really helpful color. Thank you very much. And just checking in on the status of just equipment testing on the site, would you mind just giving a high-level update on, I guess, maybe percentage of equipment tested or whatever else is most relevant as we think about just sort of overall status of testing all the equipment on site?\nTom Fanning: Well, all the major equipment is tested, right? So in fact, it was -- I mean, right as we entered the call, we got to sign off from Westinghouse. The open vessel testing, the testing was complete. Just as you get your children and teenagers, check your work before you turn it in. That's what we have been doing in the past, just recent day hours, whatever. And in fact, we just got clearance from Westinghouse. And in fact, we had -- they had verified that we had passed all the tests on OVT. So, we were very happy to announce that today. I don't know how -- what else would you want to hear?\nStephen Byrd: Well, I think that makes sense. I think in the past, there was some sort of metric of percentage of equipment that's been inspected. But I can follow-up afterwards.\nTom Fanning: I'd say all the major equipment is there and has been tested. We'll test it again once it goes into a system, but we're done.\nDrew Evans: Hey, one other thing, the RCP, right, is all on-site and everybody admires it as they walk by it. It's a spare. We got that from Summer.\nStephen Byrd: Great. That’s all I had. Thank you.\nTom Fanning: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.\nTom Fanning: Thanks for joining us.\nDurgesh Chopra: Thanks Tom. Thanks for taking my question. Just -- I want to take you back to '08, '09. You mentioned you were able to offset a lot of the impact there with cost cuttings. But also, I believe it was Georgia and correct me if I'm wrong, were you were able to amortize some of the regulatory accounts to kind of mitigate the earnings hit there? Is that sort of an opportunity available this time around?\nTom Fanning: Well, you've got a great memory, and you're correct. That is, in fact, what we did. We took some steps to lessen the burden, but we don't feel the need to take those steps right now. Those are certainly options in the future to approach regulators if we need to. The one thing I think that you can just point to around the system is that I think we've received -- in fact, I would just go broadly. Our PSCs, but also, I would say, FERC and NERC at the national level, folks have really, I think, spent over backwards to accommodate the needs of this unique environment. And I think the issue of being able to set aside as a regulatory asset recovery of disconnect costs and a variety of other things has been another evidence of constructive practice by our states. And at the NERC and FERC level, I'll tell you, they've been on these ESCC calls like. Likewise, they're doing what they need to do in order to help the industry get through this period. Not by imposing over regulations, et cetera. I'm very complementary of what are generally very tough regulators taking constructive approaches to help in assisting through this time frame.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. Thanks. And then maybe just shifting gears, and can you talk a little bit about the credit metrics and you're really confident in your 2020 EPS numbers, but I'm just kind of curious as to what impact, if any, are you seeing or do you expect to see on your FFO to debt versus the targets? And any color on any dialogue you may have had with the credit rating agencies?\nDrew Evans: This is Drew. I would say that we've had numerous conversations with the credit rating agencies across a variety of topics and did a very fulsome review of each of those individual business units, not 4 weeks ago. While we're meeting targets, FFO debt doesn't change much. Our goal is to sort of stay with a buffer relative to what's expected for the ratings categories that we maintain. And generally, as we get through the construction of Vogtle that are on an improving trajectory, which is a function really of just how the economics work of Vogtle. The other thing that we've been working through is general liquidity, which we think is Paramount operating a well-functioning business. And we were fortunate to be good credit in good reasonable markets, and we accelerated all of the debt issuance that we needed to do for the balance of the year, at least for ourselves in a position to not have to face those challenges later on. So I think very comfortable with how we're managing liquidity and credit in total.\nTom Fanning: Yes. And Drew, I'm just going to ask you if you're comfortable saying something here, but our relationship with not only our regulators, but also the rating agencies, etcetera, is continuous, not discrete. And just recently, you went through a pretty intensive review by the rating agencies. What can you say about their response to that?\nDrew Evans: Just as you would expect and probably very similar to 2008 and 2009 that they have sectors that they worry about far more than utility. I think they're focused on is are the constructive and proactive nature of regulators and the behaviors that we've seen insulating us from things like bad debt expense, I think, is a very protective and productive thing. But in general, the rating agencies are still concerned with the same thing they were concerned with before. But I think, certainly, our sector is less of a concern than most others.\nTom Fanning: And I think we got a favorable review from them?\nDrew Evans: Yes.\nDurgesh Chopra: Okay, perfect guys. Really appreciate you taking the time to answer our questions today. Thank you very much.\nDrew Evans: Yes sir, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please proceed.\nDrew Evans: Hello Sophie.\nSophie Karp: Good afternoon. Congrats on a solid quarter, and thank you for squeezing me in here.\nDrew Evans: Absolutely.\nSophie Karp: Yes. A lot of the questions have been asked and answered, but maybe if I can just follow-up on a couple of points here. So firstly on Vogtle, right, you mentioned that you reduced the size of teams to three people, I think you said, and the overall workforce by 20%. And is that based on kind of CDC guidelines or your internal guidelines that you've developed? And like when may you go back to like larger teams or reduce this because, obviously, it would be fair to say, I believe that this is causing some productivity declines, right? So is that sort of a new normal duration of the projects in your mind? Or are we going to go back to like more normal staffing at some point?\nTom Fanning: Yes. Sophie, that's a great question. So if you recall, the -- I think we've done this in the past, kind of CapEx by quarter, we've jumped these curves. We're kind of at the peak of our curve. And assuming that we continue to be productive, the curve actually starts to turn down on Unit 3. Now, it'll ramp up a little bit more on Unit 4 going forward. So, my sense is we're going to evaluate our progress in the months ahead. But it could be that this level of activity is appropriate for where we want to be on Unit 3 and 4. We were on the downturn of activity at Unit 3, just right there. So, dropping the whole site from nine to seven isn't exactly unexpected. It's a little accelerated, which means that we're probably going to push out some hours. But it's not unexpected and we didn't intend it when we refinanced the schedule the refinement we did in February, but accelerating for those two months gave us essentially a bank of more margin that we're able to use and moving people from 4 to 3 to accommodate the difference in the resizing after this voluntary reduction. So, it's actually not a bad place to be. Let's see what happens in the months ahead.\nSophie Karp: And then my other question was on bad debt expense, right. And we're pretty early I guess in this as far as the wind cycles go, but is there a point where it might be an issue for the balance sheet that you might want to approach the regulators to maybe cover it before the next rate case cycle which is now sometime away? I guess, how do you think about it internally? What is the threshold, if any?\nDrew Evans: So, Sophie, this is Drew. I'd say a number of things. In general, our gas utilities have riders or trackers for these types of things and so our exposures were probably more isolated the electric utilities. We've had very constructive regulatory conversations. And in fact, not so much in mechanism, but at least an understanding that bad debt expense would track through regulatory assets that we could recover when we get together next to discuss rates. Your question, I think was around the interim period. And to be honest, bad debt expense is not one of the things that I fear. It's a relatively low percentage of our total revenue. The thing that we're tracking really is sort of for late payment of bills. And so we've been monitoring the number of customers in arrears. It has not changed materially over the last month. We typically have about 15% of our customers in arrears in any given time any more than a normal time and we know that if we were to happen provisions is something like a 40% of our customers being in arrears that we would probably have to provision somewhere between $800,000 and a $1 billion worth of additional capital per quarter. All of that is incredibly management, all within the existing liquidity that we have within the business. And so we don't anticipate that they'll be anything more than maybe some temporary impacts of liquidity, but really no long term impact to bad debt.\nTom Fanning: Yes, and let me let me add another comment. It's under the -- who knows, but I think it's still something we've talked about getting ready for the call. And that is when you think about the intensive impact of COVID-19, it's occurring during light revenue month for us. It's occurring during April in May, which are not strong month. This is Atlanta, particularly, but the southeast is known for these beautiful long springs and our big revenue month -- 60% of our revenue, I think, comes out of the summer. So that's going to be -- so when you think about the intense impact is coming during low revenue, and therefore, if we have some recovery, that's the who knows part, that will get us back to, I think, a good spot. Hey, Sophie, one more thing you mentioned, somebody pointed out to me that I didn't cover, you said, do we follow CDC guidelines? In fact, yes, we do. And in fact, I think we're even more conservative than CDC in terms of recovery and all that stuff. We keep people out 14 days, even if they've been around somebody that's been tested, a variety of other things. One other thing. Yes, just one last thing. We do survey. We do stay in touch with the other megaprojects around the U.S. and their experience is not that different than ours. I think 95% are still progressing kind of as we are.\nSophie Karp: Great. Thank you,\nTom Fanning: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.\nMichael Weinstein: Hey, Tom. How you doing?\nTom Fanning: How you doing?\nMichael Weinstein: On residential sales, it looks like your forecast is about 1% to 3% open. It is a little bit light as a forecast for up compared to what I've been hearing from other utilities, range of 3% to 4% for residential sales. Is there something about residential sales that you expect to be a little more, I guess, not as enthusiastic about it an offsetting factor?\nTom Fanning: No, Michael, I think probably what you're noting maybe a difference in time period, we're -- the 2% to 3% that we've got on our churn on slide 11 really is meant to represent what we think the full year impacts might be. We certainly are seeing across all of these classes, commercial, industrial and residential, more exaggerated response than what's depicted here. What we're trying to show is just that this is what we think the full year impact would be given the point in time we're the point in the heating and cooling cycle, where we are today. And as Tom said, April is sort of an interesting month in Georgia, people are starting to change over from heating into air conditioning and so demand is quite light. What we expect in May is a fraction of what we expect in June.\nDrew Evans: And August and September here are crazy.\nMichael Weinstein: Right. [Technical Difficulty]\nTom Fanning: Where are they manufactured? Did you say -- you're breaking up. Did you say where is the fuel manufactured?\nMichael Weinstein: Yes.\nTom Fanning: South Carolina,\nMichael Weinstein: [Technical Difficulty]\nTom Fanning: Yes. I'm sorry, you're breaking up. What would -- I'm sorry, you're really breaking up. But what we hear is, where is the fuel manufactured in it South Carolina.\nMichael Weinstein: Are there any issues on-site or manufacturing process?\nTom Fanning: Is there any fuel on-site? No. That will -- \nMichael Weinstein: [Technical Difficulty]\nTom Fanning: No, no.\nMichael Weinstein: Got you. Okay. Thank you.\nTom Fanning: Yes, Michael, thank you. If we missed your question there, please call us after, and we'll be glad to hit it for you. You were just breaking up a lot.\nMichael Weinstein: Thank you. Thank you.\nTom Fanning: Yes, sir. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nTom Fanning: Hello, Jeremy. How are you?\nJeremy Tonet: Good. Good afternoon. Thanks for having me.\nTom Fanning: You bet.\nJeremy Tonet: I wanted to come back to Vogtle here a little bit, if I could. And with the lower Vogtle workforce, I was just wondering, what type of working hours per week are you guys achieving now? And kind of what levels would have a concern with regards to the schedule? Or ask definitely what type of working hour numbers do you guys need to see to hit that monthly completion rate of about 1%?\nTom Fanning: Yes, I think we're on 510s. And then we don't do as many weekends as we have. So we backed off a little bit. That gives us a little bit of optionality should we need to work weekend. So we backed-off a little bit during this timeframe and less density and everything else. Further, we have shifted more work into the daylight hours as opposed to the night shift. And we have shifted more hours on to Unit 3. So, that's kind of the broad approach there.\nJeremy Tonet: That's helpful, and thanks. And just want to shift gears I guess, to load and appreciate that it might be just well too early to tell. But it seems like a Georgia has recently started to reopen a bit here. With that process started just wondering if you could share anything you're seeing with us live time. And was that able to inform kind of your load projections that you provided early on the call?\nTom Fanning: Well, look, we're in contact with our key account customers. I think we always do a pretty good job there. And let the estimate stay where the estimates are. So, you have a little bit of a different question kind of what's our pulse of the community. I think there is a positive vibrate right now, that people are trying to figure out ways to start again the restaurants. They are doing all this takeout. It just -- it feels a little better. Drew is in a different part. He lives right in the heart of the city. I live in the burbs. What's kind of your experience?\nDrew Evans: Well, another way to sort of think about this is we have real time data on actual usage. And then as you described, Tom, we have four polling of all of our commercial and industrial customers. And I would say that the fact that the governor has opened the state has not changed human behaviour materially. But I would say that in general, as we pulled commercial customers in particular, confidence around coming back as load as has improved in the last couple of weeks, the last set of data that I saw out of Georgia in particular. But these are just sort of early chutes kinds of signs. And we'll have to look at what the actual demand is. We certainly have some categories where we don't expect any immediate improvement. Education is one of our top virtual segments and we don't anticipate people being back in school for this season. Then there are other loads like hospital, where they have exceeded historical consumption. That's to be expected. So, I just give us a few more -- few more months, we'll be able to give you a little bit better daily.\nJeremy Tonet: But Drew, you reminded me to -- I think you guys have time. It’s interesting. Drew is on the board, probably half the hospital beds in the State here in Georgia anyway, and his wife is a doctor. Give a sense as to how many of the beds are being used because this is kind of this capacity flatten the curve concept?\nDrew Evans: Yes. It’s -- I probably have to stay away from absolute numbers. And I prefer that some of these institutions report for themselves. I would just say that I am intimate with the functioning of Emory and Grady sort of safety in hospital, our academic institutions in town. I'm incredibly amazed their ability to ramp to an expected demand. And in general, I think that we're seeing cases in those hospitals that are a little bit lighter than models were projected. But the ability of those hospitals to grasp to accommodate them, what could be a crush there has been really incredible, very sophisticated institutions in our area.\nTom Fanning: So we have 100% more capacity than what we're seeing in terms of actual cases right now. So when you think about coming back to work, there's a whole lot of gating issues that we've been working on. I've been working on in a national level in the industry and here at Southern. One of the big indicators is, have we flattened the curve? Do you have capacity? Yes. The fact is, and I think it's been very instructive at Vogtle that we have to learn to work with the virus. We have to learn for American Commerce to get along, because the only way you can be assured you don't have the virus is to have widespread available vaccines, and we don't have that yet. Until we get there, you won't have complete recovery. So how do you act? How are you able to persist in this environment? And I think that's why -- I mean, who knows, but I think that's why Governor Kemp that was one of the issues he was looking at, do we have available capacity? Yes. The next question we will all have as a nation is, do we have a second wave later this fall? We'll see.\nJeremy Tonet: That’s really helpful. Thank you for taking my question.\nTom Fanning: Yes, you bet. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed.\nTom Fanning: Hello, Paul. Glad to have you with us.\nPaul Fremont: Hey, great to be here. Hope you're all safe and healthy.\nTom Fanning: Yes, we're great.\nPaul Fremont: You had initially planned turnover and testing to occur simultaneous with construction. Is that still the plan? And does COVID-19 complicate this due to the small footprint of the plant?\nTom Fanning: Turnover and testing a construction have been going hand in glove along the way. We get thorough reports. I know we do thorough reports once a month with everybody at the PSC and the co-owners and everything else, that's going according to pace. And sometimes you speed up testing. Remember, we got into a discussion about that in past calls. Sometimes you slow it down, letting construction catch up, or you test in other areas of the plant while you focus on construction in a particular area. All that's going as expected. I wouldn't say that's anything other than exactly what we've expected. And I think this approach has really served us well. We've talked about that in the past, but fail fast and learn in other areas has been really helpful to us.\nPaul Fremont: And then secondly, can you update us on how many final approvals you've had from the NRC on ITAC? And are you going to have to wait until construction is fully complete for a lot of the remaining ITACs to be signed off on? Or how should we think about the time frame for that?\nTom Fanning: Yes. Let me just give you a quick numbers. The ITACs that have been submitted, all the UIN, so this is the ITACs that have been submitted in form without the number. Have been accepted by the NRC, so every one of those. So that really lessen the bow wave that we have. We had originally, I think, 449 ITACs fully that need to be submitted for Unit 3. And we've had a whole lot of those complete. I guess, we still have about 270 left before they're certified and we get the clearance to load fuel. That's been going well. Let me just -- yes, go ahead. Go ahead, Paul.\nPaul Fremont: I was going to just ask for the 270 to be approved. Do you essentially have to wait until construction is complete? Are you expecting that to happen, earlier?\nTom Fanning: There's, it's a pace along the way. There is some elements of the 270 that are after construction. But we think it's, ITACs are going well. We're either ahead of schedule or whatever. Paul, you may remember, I used to say that ITAC would reach my top three of concerns. And while we're concerned about everything, I think, electrical work and subcontract work, are much bigger concerns at this point in our ability to deliver on ITAC. I really think those guys have done great. And I want to throw a bouquet to the NRC. They have staffed up appropriately. And the teams that have been charged with approving the UINs and the ITAC that are fully complete have done a very timely job of doing that. I personally have worked with Steve Kaczynski [ph] and team visiting with the NRC commissioners, and they are committed to holding up their end of the bargain. I feel I feel good, it's still a big issue. Let me not minimize it. But it's something I feel pretty good about.\nDrew Evans: Good. Tom, I think the only thing that I add is we try to emphasize with folks is this testing and turnover approve constantly, and the best indicator that we're making progress on testing the turnover on the actual starts of the milestones themselves. So you'll see a couple of those milestones that are progressed against the summer. That's the best indicator you can have a successful customer turnover.\nTom Fanning: Yes, and it's just been following you know, I forget. I did -- we do these -- variety of these town halls. I did one with Shar recently and sometime ago with Weissman [ph]. And sure enough back then I said end of the month well, we finished OBT end of the month. So we're able to follow through on the schedule despite the challenges of COVID.\nPaul Fremont: And then after implementing the 20% workforce reduction, are you anticipating a significant improvement in productivity at the plant?\nTom Fanning: Yes, yes. And you just got to remember the sawtooth discussion, we've had before. Anytime we staff up or now staff down we have to right-size and bring new people on and, you know, getting used to a new work front and new people working together and new supervision. There always is a bit of a learning curve. That's a sawtooth. Yes, we are expecting an improvement. But let me point out again, we have been at, I think, the chart on slide 7 really shows it, but even with April, it's just a slight down tick from our aggressive schedule. And I think pretty far away from November. Even during April, we completed 1.25%, target was 2%. The November scheduled called for 1%. So we even made some margin to November even during a bad month.\nPaul Fremont: And then my last question looking, sort of, it's at your slide 11 with respect to potential cost reduction, where in relation to the 250 million to 400 million of potential revenue erosion? Where would you see the ability to, sort of, offset that with O&M towards the lower end, the middle, the high end? How should we think about that?\nDrew Evans: Well, I think we're going to have to see how this quarter goes. But we're going to put plans in place, at least give us bookends to achieve at either end of the spectrum is the simple way I describe it to you. There are certainly costs that we will categorize that are things where you reduce the absolute on the run expense them, travel, entertainment or travel, in particular, is perfect example. Workforce of nearly 30,000 people, very few people were travelling for a number of months. We don't expect that, that creates a backlog of travel that will then come back into our cost ratting. There will be things for the far end of the spectrum where we will be delaying expenses into future periods. And so we're just going through an effort to identifying both of those categories and across this entire spectrum of potential revenue declines, how we might function in either -- with either of these outcomes.\nTom Fanning: We're not -- as a principle, we're not refilling open jobs without CEO approval, which really freezes them. And has the effect of a freeze.\nPaul Fremont: I mean, are there sort of examples of like past years, where you've gone through cost reduction and any numbers that you can share based on past experience?\nTom Fanning: Yes, go ahead.\nDrew Evans: So 2008 and 2009, I think the number was probably a little bit towards the lower end of this range, but I think a pretty good indication of what the capabilities are, understanding the 2008 and 2009 of company was a bit smaller. So the acquisition of AGL Resources came in heads and so our cost complex is quite a bit larger than this. Our O&M -- total O&M is something in the $5-plus billion range, maybe addressable a little bit smaller than that. But I think it gives us plenty of room to be responsible around this range.\nPaul Fremont: Great. Thank you.\nTom Fanning: Yes, sir. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nTom Fanning: Hey, Michael. How are you?\nMichael Lapides: I am well Tom, how are you? Glad to hear everybody in the Southern Company family is doing as well as possible. Thank you for taking the question. I actually want to ask you about the jurisdiction that people don't ask you about, that may be one of the best ones people don't think about enough. Can you talk about Alabama? And can you talk about both where things stand with the approval of both the gas plants and the solar both the PPAs and ownership that you all filed at the PSC? And also, I thought there was a -- a rate docket there this year as well or undergoing in the winter and into the spring. Can you just give us an update on that? And then finally, how different is Alabama demand trends relative to ordinal ones?\nTom Fanning: Yes. I would say, in general, you're in a giant process that's on track in Georgia for all that stuff -- I'm sorry, in Alabama. Yes, I think everything is going as we thought it would there.\nDrew Evans: Yes. Your question about customer mix, just like in the entirety of our jurisdictions, it tends to move toward more industrial as you move west generally.\nTom Fanning: That's true. But what's interesting in Mississippi? 25% of Mississippi sales are wholesale. And those wholesale sales are largely residential. So you give it a bit of a different mix in Mississippi, but it's small, but Drew is exactly right. Alabama and Georgia are pretty similar.\nMichael Lapides: Okay. And can you remind us in Alabama, what the rate request was? And also what the time line to get approval for the gas plant, both acquisition and development?\nTom Fanning: I think we were looking towards June, summer -- early summer for that process to occur.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thank you.\nDrew Evans: And I think the only other piece of news there, it's not Alabama PSC news, but the FERC did approve the gas plant acquisition that we projected early summer. So we got that out of the way.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, Tom. Much appreciated.\nTom Fanning: Thank you my friend.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nTom Fanning: Hey, Julien. How are you doing?\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, how are you guys. Thanks you very much. I just wanted to follow-up on the O&M front. So you guys have -- revenue, right? I wanted to be very clear about this. When you think about the cost savings effort just to quantify a little bit more, basically, you're saying that you can offset anything in that range or how do you think about the sort of the magnitude of cost savings that you're contemplating today? You're doing -- you're looking at this as 250 to 400, is that's the equivalent O&M amount that you're looking at in your planning here?\nDrew Evans: Yes. No, I think the simple way to think about it is that we're going to put plans in place or work through plans that could help us in either under this range. What we actually have to execute against is going to be determined by how quickly the economies respond in our service territories.\nTom Fanning: And the other thing I would just say, I mean, that's a range that's here, again, I hate to say with all this uncertainty, it's kind of who knows. But I think earlier, maybe a month ago, I was saying $250 million to $350 million, we track down $50 million, just out of conservatism and a more prolonged kind of effect.\nDrew Evans: I don't want to give you the impression, Julien, that this is limitless pool. There are certainly limitations and we're just going to have to see how the demand responsive also over time.\nTom Fanning: But there, again, too, that would reflect even at highest ends, we're still within the range.\nDrew Evans: Yes. And probably most folks don't know. The easiest way to turn this into earnings per share that we generally are about $10 million per penny and so you can divide this by 10 and get some sense of the range of impact in total on a gross revenue basis and that adjusted. That's for pre-tax.\nTom Fanning: You need to tax effect that. He was -- Drew just gave you an after-tax net income effect. So this is pre-tax.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes, understood. All right. Let me come back to the --. When you guys talk about the sawtooth 20% reduction here in workforce, how are you thinking about making that up on the project? And you also talked about delaying the Unit 4 in this year. Are you thinking that you're going to be ramp back up labour later in the schedule here at this point? Or how do you make up for that 20% workforce reduction cumulatively?\nTom Fanning: Yes. Thanks, Julien. There's a good draw with my finger here in the air. But if we were doing a one-on-one, I draw my little piece of paper, my hand written things, I'm so payment for there. Just imagine this, if I had a curve that showed 9,000 people on site, as we wind down Unit 3 construction heading into hot functional tests, the wind down of people on-site for Unit 3 occurs. So the curve actually goes down. What we're doing is and what we've said about kind of hot functional tests being kind of now August, September. All we did was push it out a little. Imagine you pushed your hand down on the peak of 9,000 and it pushes out a little bit to the right. So all we've done is tried to maintain that level. I don’t think you're going to see another big peak here. We were already at the peak. And I think now that peak starts to wind down. That's why we feel comfortable with the movement from 9,000 to 7,000 on-site, drawing some off of 4, which pushes 4 back to its original schedule and still maintaining our ability to hit the aggressive site plan for Unit 3. All we did was shift the curve a little bit, and we funded that curve with Unit 4.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Okay. And quick follow-up here, and I'll round it out here. Under what scenarios would you consider stopping construction around COVID? So it sounds like you guys have a lot of mitigating factors already implemented, a lot of compartmentalization of labour already going on in terms of mitigating factors. But how do you think about what that scenario might look like? And when you might trigger that, just to address the range of scenarios here?\nTom Fanning: Yes. You know what, I suppose there is a hypothetical in there. Julien, I just don't think that's likely. I think America, let me just speak broadly, and I'll take it down to the site. America has to learn to live with the virus. Our experience so far, knock on wood, has been much less than what you've seen in the industry about half. And our experience on site, likewise, have been less severe, I think largely because of the smart actions, the people on the site have taken, for example, removing the at-risk personnel and paying them well before we saw the effects of the site -- on the site. People are now coming back to work. One other point is, it looks like the average over the past, I don't know, four weeks. If you do a four-week look at average, it looks as if we may be past the peak on the site. Now, that will only be borne out in the next few weeks to come. But if you do a seven-day rolling average, it looks as if incidence levels are decreasing. So look, there's a hypothetical in there. I really think it's a practical manner. The job at hand is, continue the good work we're doing on site, make that an attractive place for people to work, which I think we're doing. And I think the labour unions at all are calling us out for that kind of unprecedented response and keep going. I just don't think -- I don't see it right now, but we'll see.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. All right. Yes. You can tell me its happening. Excellent. Well, thank you for the time. All the best.\nTom Fanning: Thank you, Julien. Appreciate it, bud.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotia Howard Weil. Please proceed.\nTom Fanning: Hello, Andrew. Thanks for joining us.\nAndrew Weisel: Hey, everyone. In the interest of time, I'll really stick to one question here on Page 11. I'm a little surprised. Maybe I missed this, I apologize if I did, but you're forecasting a bigger decline for commercial volumes in industrial. Most other utilities you're talking about it the other way. And I know you mentioned your mix is roughly a-third, a-third, a-third. So can you explain why you're expecting a deeper hit to commercial than industrial?\nTom Fanning: Yes. Look, I -- and the good news there is, if that's what your big hit is, I think your ability to come back is much better. It will come back quicker. Your ability to shut down a plant and then get it back is harder than restarting a restaurant. In fact, I was on CNBC this morning, and I know right after me was the CEO of IMAX. He says, our ability to turn theatres back on, is almost instantaneous. So, look, that is an assessment of our key accounts, and our marketing teams across the system. That's just what we see. Our industrial make up, the kind of folks that we see, really have been having a great quarter. And in fact, if you look at the month-by-month sales at industrial, gosh, our momentum statistics, I'm fond of mentioning, we're showing really quite positive momentum through February. And it's just with COVID, what we saw were some companies taking outages. They said, 'Well, if we're going to want a socially distance, why don't we go ahead and take an outage and do some maintenance, sending a lot of people home.' We actually think industrial will recover faster, more resilient. The other thing that we have in the Southeast here is industrial dependent upon natural gas as a feedstock, particularly in the chemicals area. I think that's our number one industrial customer. And with natural gas being where it is, those guys are producing product at really attractive levels. We saw this again in 2008 and 2009. And essentially, I would say, Alabama has been particularly proactive in putting in place rate plans that preserve industrial load, where across the United States, they didn't have those things and industrials tended to shut down plants in other parts of the United States and move their productive capacity to the Southeast. For all those reasons, that's why we think industrial is more resilient than commercial. Good news is commercial is going to recover pretty quickly, in my opinion.\nAndrew Weisel: Okay. Thank you.\nTom Fanning: You bet. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed.\nPaul Patterson: Thanks, Tom, happy to hear you. How you doing? It sounds you guys are doing well.\nTom Fanning: Yes. We are hanging in there.\nPaul Patterson: So, I wanted to touch base with you on was served just basically your economic forecast, I guess. It sounds like you guys are quite optimistic that once this, the sort of stay at home and the social distancing stuff is resolved, people coming back and it will be business as usual. Is that the case? Are you guys basically thinking that -- I'm just wondering what is your economic forecast given your growth rate? And are you still sort of expecting 1% sales growth after this year?\nTom Fanning: The 400 million estimate assumes that there's more of a through the year impact. Yes. I don't know that, we want to portray too much optimism. We Certainly, U-shape, it feels better where we're sitting today than maybe on the downward slope of it a couple of weeks ago. But our projection for a 5% reduction in total retail sales is quite exaggerated relative to what we've seen in history. And so this will not be without economic pain for sure. We do think that our economies generally in the Southeast benefit from the fact that we've got good in migration. And it's a good place to do business and so long-term, we -- relative to others, we think that we've got pretty decent economic climate. The amount of time it takes to get back to normalcy though is inestimable. Yes. There are lots of degrees of freedom in all this. It's just our most reasonable guess at this point. And I know, and my heart goes out to most of you guys on the phone and lives in the New York area. I'm from New Jersey, we all have relatives and people have been impacted by this. And so, we're very mindful of the grave circumstance. That's not the case down here; at least we haven't seen it. It's much less severe in the southeast than what you're experiencing up there.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. But just to sort of make sure I understand this, did you guys see a hit this year, but then it sounds like beginning of next year or pretty soon thereafter, you expect in terms of your earnings guidance and everything, your long-term growth rate that essentially that the economy will -- the global pandemic will not have that meaningful impact on economic activity in your region?\nTom Fanning: So, yes. Okay. So now that's a -- I'm sorry, that's like a different question and it's interesting. Will there be destruction in the economy as a result of the COVID deal? That may be. My sense is the United States is in a pretty good position relative to global economies with respect to this issue we will see. In other words, is there going to be less demand from Europe for American products? What about China? One of the other impacts that we've been talking about at a federal level on this return to work is kind of revitalizing the supply chain to the United States, making us a little less dependent, particularly in critical infrastructure for reliance on foreign economies. Still sitting there in Congress is an infrastructure bill. My sense is, there's more energy used upon, behind future legislative initiatives, that could overcome some continuing sustaining impact of destruction in the economy. Some other things could emerge. My sense is right now, if I just sit here and think about 2021 and 2022, there may be some continuing impacts. But at this point, I don't think they're at all significant to the point where we would change our forward guidance on a 4% to 6% EPS growth rate. We the dominant issue for us is getting Vogtle Bill. Once we clear Unit 3 and Unit 4 to service, the rate of increase because of the earnings rates inside the construction period recover to a full return on capital. It's hard to beat that down.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. Just on Vogtle, just sort of quickly here. It looks like you guys are -- if I'm correct, when I've been estimating, it looks like for the people that you've been testing, and I think it's up into the 400 range now or something. It looks to me from the report something that it's remarkably pretty consistent at 28% to 30% or something. And I'm just wondering, is there any thought of maybe -- I mean, obviously, there are a lot more people than that working at the site. Is there any thought about doing antibody testing? Or are you guys thinking anything about heard immunity or anything like that? Or is it just basically sort of people who come in and say, hey, I don't feel well, give me a test kind of thing?'\nTom Fanning: Look, we're -- we got early availability on the best test we can get the time, the antibody tests are really pretty interesting. In fact, we're talking about that at a national level. We have had Admiral Giroir from HHS. He's the Director of Health, and he kind of has the whole testing regime in place. That's something that's attractive, but it's just not available right now. We can test all over the place. And in fact, you can test everybody and they go home, and you'll have to retest them the next day and the next day and the next day. Testing is really valuable, and I don't underestimate it, but it doesn't solve the problem. Until we get a vaccine in place, we're going to be having to live with this environment in the nation.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. And then just really quickly on the sales numbers. They include -- they're not adjusted out for leap year. Is that correct for the quarter?\nTom Fanning: I think they are not adjusted.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. That's it for me. I really appreciate it. Thanks so much.\nTom Fanning: Thank you. Appreciate you join us.\nDrew Evans: Thanks, Paul.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.\nDrew Evans: Hi, Charles.\nCharles Fishman: Hey, thank you. Hi. Hey, just one question. You got a $40 billion five-year CapEx program. The bulk of it is not Vogtle. You've given us great detail on Vogtle. You had a statement, no expected supply chain problems, disruptions. What -- I get that, but what is causing you some concern within the supply chain? Is there something that's going to be more expensive in that CapEx? Is there something maybe you've pushed out a year or two that you'll still get done within the five-year plan? Any additional color on that, no expected supply chain disruption comment would be appreciated.\nTom Fanning: Yes. So we're the size of the nation of Australia in round numbers. I get that statistic. We're a little bit smaller, but when you think about energy production, we're kind of in that league. We have long-standing relationships, and we are considered a high priority customer with a variety of resources. And when I say, we don't see any problems in the long run, that doesn't mean people aren't working really hard to make sure that they understand what the perturbations may be, and what they're going to do to resource them. We have been seeing some challenges, but we've always been able to overcome the challenges. And I want to say, Drew, we have about at least a six-month kind of forward window where we're absolutely confident of no problems. So that's kind of our safety margin, if you will. When you think about the nature of our CapEx budget, however, it is really tied up in making our system more resilient from a transmission and distribution standpoint. It is tied up in future generation, whether it is renewables or some of the new generation required in Alabama and Georgia. And then it is tied up in environmental matters, particularly for us, ash ponds, which I think is $10 billion over 10 years in round numbers. So it is stuff that I think we've got great visibility into the availability of the equipment required to support that program. It's not subject to, I guess, Drew uses the word smalls, we have a lot of visibility, and we're a big customer and people generally work very hard to meet our needs. And we have pushed on this a lot. We've got a great guy, Jeff Franklin that runs our supply chain for the system. We don't see a problem right now.\nDrew Evans: Yes. I'd say labour is a large component of our total CapEx plan. And as you said, environmental remediation at ash ponds isn't really reliant on technology in general. And we've got enough material for a pretty decent work front for a good period of time and expect in the long-term, some block chain is full replenish to meet whatever need we might have about.\nTom Fanning: And let me throw one more factor out there. I'll throw another bouquet at somebody. The Director of CISA in Homeland Security is a guy named Chris Krebs; he's doing a terrific job within the confines of his responsibility in calling out. And my word, they put out an advisory bulletin of essential functions in America. And of course, Health and Human Services is right at top right now. But right behind that is the electricity function in America. That's also part of the recommendations by NIAC, National Infrastructure Advisory Council, and also the work product, of the Solarium Commission that I'm on. Look, people will put a high priority on making sure that our needs are met. One last point, we have a terrific relationship with our valued partners in the labour market. So the U.S. building trades have done a hell of a job, making sure that the people are there. And I think we work very hard to make sure that they are valued partners and treated as well as anybody treats them in the United States. They are strategic partners for decades, and we treat them like that. And I think the labour will be there when we need it.\nCharles Fishman: Okay. Tom, thank you for the extra long call on a extraordinary times. That was it.\nTom Fanning: Yes. Thank you. No. We appreciate your attention.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Verition. Please proceed.\nTom Fanning: Hello, Ashar. How are you? Always glad to have you with us.\nAshar Khan: Great, Tom. Doing -- the progress is, I would say, exceptional and really very well you guys are doing. Can I just ask, I didn't want to ask the question, but I thought because of Reg I have seen -- because of disclosures and less contact. Usually, you have earned around $0.80 for the last four years in the second quarter except for one year 17, where we had like $0.05 or $0.06 of dilution, which hurt that quarter. And even then we earned 73. So can you just ascribe to me why the pattern of earnings is going to go from the average 80 to like 65 in the second quarter? What is it making it an abnormal second quarter versus the prior trajectory of how the earnings have come up?\nTom Fanning: Yes, Ashar, let me actually -- I went deeper in preparing for this for the call. But like I said, I have in front of me the data last eight years, our low was $0.66, but we had three years in the 60, $0.66, $0.69, $0.68, $0.71, $0.73, $0.75. And only the last two years have been $0.80. All we're doing is taking a conservative shot at what the second quarter, COVID-19 thing is. It's always a fight. I always laugh. I used to be CFO, and I had always extract an estimate from the system CFOs. And well, the inside joke inside Southern is when the CFOs kind of report what they think, they always have a conservative bias. And the joke is that, the positive variances are always temporary and the permanent variances -- the negative variances are permanent. So we always have to fight through what the right answer is. I think Drew has done a great job. I can't say that 65% is light. I'll just say that, it's reasonable. There's a lot of degrees of freedom of conservatism around what's going to happen with COVID 19. We'll see, but that's the data. I got the data, right in front of me.\nDrew Evans: Ashar, it is fair to say that, this quarter will have most -- hopefully, the largest open hopefully the due to largest COVID-19 impact of any quarter that we'll experience. That's the hope and that's the expectation. If we're going to reduce our expense structure and as Tom said, that's generally through halting, adding additional headcount, which was part of our plan that is something that will reduce expenses over the course of the year and not be isolated to the second quarter. So we have to plan for light revenue in second and less expense mitigation that we think we can achieve over the balance of the year.\nDrew Evans: But we're still committed to our financial objectives for the year. I wouldn't get excited about the second quarter. We're still committed for the year.\nAshar Khan: Okay. Thank you.\nTom Fanning: And we had a good first quarter. I know you did. Excellent quarter. Yes. So good start. Operator, anything else?\nOperator: That will conclude today's question-and-answer session, sir. Are there any closing remarks?\nTom Fanning: Drew, you want to lead us off?\nDrew Evans: Again, I'd jus say, thank you to all the folks that are working hard on behalf of customers every day. I think we're living our core values. And I'm impressed that with 15,000 or 17,000 people working from home, we're getting the job done. So thank you very much to all the work teams that are working hard to have such a great outcome for us.\nTom Fanning: And from my perspective, working at a national level, whether it's thinking about Homeland Security with Chris Krebs and his team, Department of Energy, Secretary Danbury all of his team is doing a terrific job. The industry is responding exceedingly well. And you should know that the industry in this case is a union of the investor-owned utilities and the cooperatives and the municipals. We are all working together to solve the problems as they arise. And in fact, the favourite Gretsky saying skate to where the puck will be. I think this industry is way beyond reacting to the present and really into thinking about the future. We're very mindful that hurricane season, storm season is ahead of us and being able to demonstrate as we have for decades, effective mutual response to the problem that will arise this year. I think the industry is doing a terrific job, so kudos to all of my brothers and sisters out there. And then finally, for Southern, what a great start to the year, that's given us some tailwind I think to address some of these things. There is a lot of uncertainty ahead. I'm very encouraged with the team at Vogtle. When you look at the data, I think they're managing these unexpected conditions in an exceedingly prudent manner. And the rest of the system is going great with their ability to respond to the storms and still serve customers well with this coronavirus protocol in place. I'm just very encouraged about our ability to deal with whatever comes our way for the rest of the year. That's why we remain committed. I want to thank you all. I know, especially those of you all in the Northeast, you know I'm from New Jersey; I got relatives up there. And I know you guys are dealing with some very tough times. And I know maybe your families or maybe friends of family are all being impacted. My thoughts and prayers go out to you all and I think working together, we're going to get through this thing. Thanks everybody for being with us today. I know it's an extra long call, but I hope we gave enough color around not only Southern situation, but the national situation to give everybody confidence in the next steps forward. Thanks, everybody. Talk to you soon. Operator, that's the conclusion of the call.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Southern Company First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Drew Evans",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everybody. I hope you all are well. As Tom mentioned, we have a very strong start to the year, first quarter adjusted EPS was $0.78, which is $0.08 higher than last year and $0.06 above our estimate for the quarter. The primary driver compared to last year was constructive state regulatory actions, which were completed in 2019 at our utilities. In addition, through aggressive cost control, we were able to decreased non-fuel O&M year-over-year, which helped us overcome and hence an impact from warmer to normal weather in the first quarter. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results is included in today's release and earnings package. Weather normalized retail sales for the first quarter 2020 were up slightly compared to last year led by our residential customer flats, with only modest impacts from COVID-19 evidence in the last two weeks of the quarter. We added over 20,000 new electric and natural gas customers across the system, which is consistent with our expectations. With COVID-19, top of mind, let's go ahead and turn our assessment of potential -- to the assessment of potential business impacts. While we did not see a meaningful earnings impact from COVID-19 in the first quarter, we are continually assessing potential financial impacts on our business. At this time, we do not expect coronavirus impact to materially affect our long-term outlook. Our expected long-term EPS growth rate remains 46%, our $40 billion five-year capital investment plan is unchanged, we do not foresee a need to issue equity for 2024, liquidity is strong with good access to the capital markets at both the parent and our subsidiaries. And with last week's announcements of $0.08 annual dividend increase -- the 19th consecutive annual increase we continue to demonstrate our commitment to enhancing shareholder value. As we think about the potential near-term impact of COVID-19 on our 2020 expectations our key focus areas are sales, bad debt expense and liquidity. Just a moment, I am going to switch microphones, so both can hear me better. Starting with sales, as I mentioned, whether normalized retail sales, were up slightly for the first quarter, slightly reflecting higher residential demand, at the end of March, as people begin to Tele working, thus far, in April, total estimated weather-normalized electric retail demand is lower than our forecast by approximately 8%. So April lows are historically volatile and customer switched between heating and cooling. We have seen demand stabilize at these approximate levels over the last few weeks. We'll continue to closely monitor trends, as businesses within our states begin to reopen. Looking ahead, we are basing our current forecast for 2020 on a U-shaped economic recovery that reflects a mid-summer phase out of the stay at home policies with modest economic recovery, across the service territories, over the balance of the year. Using these assumptions are projections indicate an overall defined retail sales, for the full year in a range of 2% to 5%, on or whether normalize basis whereas residential up 1% to 3%, commercial down 5% to 10%, and industrial down 4% to 8%. As a reminder, construction completion of about 2% per month is consistent with the aggressive site about each customer plans. Retail sales in these ranges with lower total non-critical electrical revenue by approximately $250 million to $400 million on a consolidated basis, we plan to mitigate these impacts by continuing to aggressively manage on them throughout the remainder of the year. While the current situation is unprecedented, we demonstrated a similar level of cost discipline in response to the 2008, 2009 recession, which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver in the current environment. Of course, actual impacts will be highly dependent on the duration of stable polices and the pace of economic recovery. As visibility of these factors improves, we will hone our expectations around an appropriate level of cost control. At this time, we do not anticipate significant sales or financial impacts from COVID-19 on Southern power we're Southern Company gas. Due to the long-term contracted nature of Southern Power's business model, we expect it to be largely insulated from pandemic impacts. Southern Company Gas has already achieved roughly half of its expected full year net income, in the first quarter. And we expect earnings over the remainder of the year to be consistent with our forecast. In addition to sales, we are also assessing the potential for an increase in bad debt expense. Specifically, our electric utilities, utilities, sellers most around the country are not disconnecting customers for non payment. And we are temporarily waiting late payment fees. Our states regulators are taking these defer incremental bad debt expenses related to this pandemic for recovering future -- recovery in future rate proceedings. In addition, our gas utilities are largely decoupled and may have bad debt and may have bad debt mechanisms already in place, which helped to insulate them from both sales and non-payment impacts. We also expect increased federal funding for programs like lightning and certain provisions in the TTC program to assist eligible customers with built in. Including regulatory mechanisms and customer assistance programs, we believe that expensive acts will be largely mitigated. Turning now to liquidity depend on the actions we took in the first quarter, Southern's net liquidity at the end of March -- by $800 million relative to year-end 2019 and currently stands at over $7 billion. In the second quarter, we have already taken steps to further strengthen our liquidity position, including completion of a $1 billion issuance with a parent in April. At this juncture, we believe we have ample liquidity for Apple [ph] investment plans, protect our dividends, and weather potential COVID-related volatility in debt markets, as well as elevated [ph] periods of customer non-payment With solid results through the first quarter, our current belief is that O&M reductions can largely offset pandemic-related sales impacts with peak electric loads still to come, we see no reason to deviate from our current financial objectives. Consistent with historical practice, we will address earnings for the year, relative to our EPS guidance after the third quarter. For the second quarter, we assume that pressure on retail sales will persist, so it is too early to predict with precision like the overall [indiscernible], recognizing all of these factors, we are providing adjusted EPS for the second quarter of $0.55. Before I turn it back to Tom, I'd like to give a brief update on some regulatory matters. In March, the Mississippi Public Service Commission unanimously approved the rate settlement breach between Mississippi Power and TSP staff [ph], resulting in a rate decrease for customers, and an increase in the allowed equity ratio for Mississippi Power of 55%. On the global front, we filed DCM 22 [ph] with Georgia PSC in mid-February, requesting verification and approval of $674 million spend of the period of July through December of 2019. We expect a decision from PFC in August. Before I turn it back to Tom, I'd like to thank our Southern family for an outstanding job during this period. Everyone has taken the new normal and stride has remained focused on our customer at all levels. You've shown superior performance and total commitment. I hope everyone stays well, and with that I'll turn it back to Tom. That is weather normalized. So virtually all open. Shar, I think I have just addressed one other piece of your question related to our guidance strong estimate for second quarter. Second quarter typically is a relatively light quarter for us in terms of total demand and you can imagine that there's a big difference between June's expectation and April's expectation. We also feel like this is the period where COVID-19 is going have the greatest amount of impact across the retail customer base, whether it's residential, commercial or industrial. And even though we are putting measures in place to reduce expenses, those will largely be over the balance of the period and you're looking some adjusted to what is a very constrained quarter in terms of sales. So I would just take it in that light. Also, if you look at last year, I think we reported $0.18 for the quarter, $0.18 of that mix was weather related. So I think what we're putting out consistent with what we've already reported for the first quarter is Steve, actually, can you hear me all right? We're having some technical difficulties, as Tom and I socially distance. Good. We're modelling a bunch of different things, whether it's V, U, W or L, In general, the midline of our sort of 250 to 400 is probably something like delayed re-emergence from stay-at-home kind of through mid-summer, maybe even until August and then some recovery through the balance of the year, but certainly not complete. If we look at the different customer classes that we're tracking today, I mean, our industrial segment, which is not the largest contributor to earnings, by the way, is actually performing quite well, but it is very. And so things like pulp and paper, some of the larger segments, chemical, are doing quite well because of low input cost because of demand on product. Some of the things like precursors to automotive or light still are going to take a little bit longer to rebound. But those industries as we're watching are starting to reopen and automotive production is beginning to restart across Georgia and Alabama, in particular. On the commercial side, we've seen a pretty exaggerated decrease. Some of our bigger customers there are certainly in retail and education, but some of those segments are starting to move back. And so I think the 2% to 5% total that we gave you really represents those different actions in aggregate, but we're looking at it in a pretty detailed way. Hey, one other thing, the RCP, right, is all on-site and everybody admires it as they walk by it. It's a spare. We got that from Summer. This is Drew. I would say that we've had numerous conversations with the credit rating agencies across a variety of topics and did a very fulsome review of each of those individual business units, not 4 weeks ago. While we're meeting targets, FFO debt doesn't change much. Our goal is to sort of stay with a buffer relative to what's expected for the ratings categories that we maintain. And generally, as we get through the construction of Vogtle that are on an improving trajectory, which is a function really of just how the economics work of Vogtle. The other thing that we've been working through is general liquidity, which we think is Paramount operating a well-functioning business. And we were fortunate to be good credit in good reasonable markets, and we accelerated all of the debt issuance that we needed to do for the balance of the year, at least for ourselves in a position to not have to face those challenges later on. So I think very comfortable with how we're managing liquidity and credit in total. Just as you would expect and probably very similar to 2008 and 2009 that they have sectors that they worry about far more than utility. I think they're focused on is are the constructive and proactive nature of regulators and the behaviors that we've seen insulating us from things like bad debt expense, I think, is a very protective and productive thing. But in general, the rating agencies are still concerned with the same thing they were concerned with before. But I think, certainly, our sector is less of a concern than most others. Yes. Yes sir, thank you. Hello Sophie. Absolutely. So, Sophie, this is Drew. I'd say a number of things. In general, our gas utilities have riders or trackers for these types of things and so our exposures were probably more isolated the electric utilities. We've had very constructive regulatory conversations. And in fact, not so much in mechanism, but at least an understanding that bad debt expense would track through regulatory assets that we could recover when we get together next to discuss rates. Your question, I think was around the interim period. And to be honest, bad debt expense is not one of the things that I fear. It's a relatively low percentage of our total revenue. The thing that we're tracking really is sort of for late payment of bills. And so we've been monitoring the number of customers in arrears. It has not changed materially over the last month. We typically have about 15% of our customers in arrears in any given time any more than a normal time and we know that if we were to happen provisions is something like a 40% of our customers being in arrears that we would probably have to provision somewhere between $800,000 and a $1 billion worth of additional capital per quarter. All of that is incredibly management, all within the existing liquidity that we have within the business. And so we don't anticipate that they'll be anything more than maybe some temporary impacts of liquidity, but really no long term impact to bad debt. And August and September here are crazy. Well, another way to sort of think about this is we have real time data on actual usage. And then as you described, Tom, we have four polling of all of our commercial and industrial customers. And I would say that the fact that the governor has opened the state has not changed human behaviour materially. But I would say that in general, as we pulled commercial customers in particular, confidence around coming back as load as has improved in the last couple of weeks, the last set of data that I saw out of Georgia in particular. But these are just sort of early chutes kinds of signs. And we'll have to look at what the actual demand is. We certainly have some categories where we don't expect any immediate improvement. Education is one of our top virtual segments and we don't anticipate people being back in school for this season. Then there are other loads like hospital, where they have exceeded historical consumption. That's to be expected. So, I just give us a few more -- few more months, we'll be able to give you a little bit better daily. Yes. It's -- I probably have to stay away from absolute numbers. And I prefer that some of these institutions report for themselves. I would just say that I am intimate with the functioning of Emory and Grady sort of safety in hospital, our academic institutions in town. I'm incredibly amazed their ability to ramp to an expected demand. And in general, I think that we're seeing cases in those hospitals that are a little bit lighter than models were projected. But the ability of those hospitals to grasp to accommodate them, what could be a crush there has been really incredible, very sophisticated institutions in our area. Good. Tom, I think the only thing that I add is we try to emphasize with folks is this testing and turnover approve constantly, and the best indicator that we're making progress on testing the turnover on the actual starts of the milestones themselves. So you'll see a couple of those milestones that are progressed against the summer. That's the best indicator you can have a successful customer turnover. Well, I think we're going to have to see how this quarter goes. But we're going to put plans in place, at least give us bookends to achieve at either end of the spectrum is the simple way I describe it to you. There are certainly costs that we will categorize that are things where you reduce the absolute on the run expense them, travel, entertainment or travel, in particular, is perfect example. Workforce of nearly 30,000 people, very few people were travelling for a number of months. We don't expect that, that creates a backlog of travel that will then come back into our cost ratting. There will be things for the far end of the spectrum where we will be delaying expenses into future periods. And so we're just going through an effort to identifying both of those categories and across this entire spectrum of potential revenue declines, how we might function in either -- with either of these outcomes. So 2008 and 2009, I think the number was probably a little bit towards the lower end of this range, but I think a pretty good indication of what the capabilities are, understanding the 2008 and 2009 of company was a bit smaller. So the acquisition of AGL Resources came in heads and so our cost complex is quite a bit larger than this. Our O&M -- total O&M is something in the $5-plus billion range, maybe addressable a little bit smaller than that. But I think it gives us plenty of room to be responsible around this range. Yes. Your question about customer mix, just like in the entirety of our jurisdictions, it tends to move toward more industrial as you move west generally. And I think the only other piece of news there, it's not Alabama PSC news, but the FERC did approve the gas plant acquisition that we projected early summer. So we got that out of the way. Yes. No, I think the simple way to think about it is that we're going to put plans in place or work through plans that could help us in either under this range. What we actually have to execute against is going to be determined by how quickly the economies respond in our service territories. I don't want to give you the impression, Julien, that this is limitless pool. There are certainly limitations and we're just going to have to see how the demand responsive also over time. Yes. And probably most folks don't know. The easiest way to turn this into earnings per share that we generally are about $10 million per penny and so you can divide this by 10 and get some sense of the range of impact in total on a gross revenue basis and that adjusted. That's for pre-tax. Thanks, Paul. Hi, Charles. Yes. I'd say labour is a large component of our total CapEx plan. And as you said, environmental remediation at ash ponds isn't really reliant on technology in general. And we've got enough material for a pretty decent work front for a good period of time and expect in the long-term, some block chain is full replenish to meet whatever need we might have about. Ashar, it is fair to say that, this quarter will have most -- hopefully, the largest open hopefully the due to largest COVID-19 impact of any quarter that we'll experience. That's the hope and that's the expectation. If we're going to reduce our expense structure and as Tom said, that's generally through halting, adding additional headcount, which was part of our plan that is something that will reduce expenses over the course of the year and not be isolated to the second quarter. So we have to plan for light revenue in second and less expense mitigation that we think we can achieve over the balance of the year. But we're still committed to our financial objectives for the year. I wouldn't get excited about the second quarter. We're still committed for the year. Again, I'd jus say, thank you to all the folks that are working hard on behalf of customers every day. I think we're living our core values. And I'm impressed that with 15,000 or 17,000 people working from home, we're getting the job done. So thank you very much to all the work teams that are working hard to have such a great outcome for us."

            "content": "Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. I hope that you're well. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted results for the first quarter, ahead of our estimate. This solid start to the year positions us well as we look to overcome short-term sales impacts from the coronavirus. Drew will provide you with more detail on our financials momentarily, so I will go ahead and turn to our current operating environment, amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Southern Company, our top priority remains keeping every employee healthy and safe, while we continue to provide clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy for our customer. We were well prepared to quickly make necessary adjustments across our business activating internet response team throughout the company in February. We continue to execute COVID-19 pandemic plans for our business. And to-date, our operational performance has been exceptional. We have not experienced nor do we currently foresee supply chain disruptions for our utilities or our construction projects. We often talk about the importance of the reliability and resilience of our electric and natural gas infrastructure, which has delivered remarkably well during this time. In face of COVID-19, our biggest asset has really been the reliability and resiliency of our workforce. I want to thank our employees who have risen to every challenge. We have been resourceful and rapidly procuring and deploying necessary protective equipment and implementing effective protocols to safeguard against the virus. Our operations and customer service teams have continued to work around the clock. We are finding solutions to effectively work in teams remotely, and we are communicating with our workforce and external stakeholders in a whole new way. We've implemented a wide range of projects to support the physical, financial and emotional well being of our employees during this time as they continue their superb work to support the operation of our company. It's also a hallmark of our company to be a citizen wherever we serve. So we have worked to identify, how we can best assist our communities during these difficult times. Southern and its subsidiaries are targeting a commitment of nearly $10 million in financial -- I'm sorry, in foundation and charitable contributions. And our employees have logged thousands of volunteer hours to assist those impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. I expect, we will do even more in the coming months. Let's turn now to an update on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. We remain focused on meeting the November '21 and November 2022 regulatory-approved in-service dates. And we continue to maintain an aggressive work plan on-site as a tool to help position us to meet those dates. Recall, in February, we refined the aggressive site work plan to reflect a May 2021 completion target for Unit 3 and a March 2022 completion target for Unit 4. We also laid out a November benchmark schedule and related milestone for Unit 3. Through March, production for Unit 3 was generally consistent with the refined aggressive site work plan. April's performance was challenged due to COVID 19 impact, which put us slightly behind the aggressive site work plan. Despite these challenges, today, direct construction is approximately 90% complete. And notably, just late breaking new, we have just completed open vessel testing. That came in about 1 p.m. today. We also reached several interim construction milestones for Unit 4 during the quarter, including the installation of the Polar train and setting the containment vessel topic. Before giving an update on recent productivity, I want to highlight our commitment to the safety of our workforce on-site and in the surrounding community. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken a number of proactive measures intended to protect our workforce and the community against the spread of COVID-19. As we implement these measures, we've engage independent medical advisors to guide our actions to reduce the possible spread of the virus. Among other measures, we have provided additional protective equipment, enhanced sanitation practices and implemented its social distancing strategy, such as spreading out and increasing common areas, eliminating group transportation at the site and mandating those who can tell a work to do so. Beyond these basics, early on, our protocol on-site ensured that anyone tested and their closed contacts will promptly self isolated off-site. We acted quickly to build an on-site medical clinic, designed to expedite test results, mineralize turn around time for close proximity screening and improved facilitation of clearing personnel to return to work. Throughout this time, we have remained in close consultation with the nuclear regulatory commission and the projects co-owners as well as local and state authorities. We are also consulting with and monitoring other mega projects. Notably last month, the President of the North American Building Trade Unions Commended Southern Company for going above and beyond the call of duty to keep their members on the Vogtle construction site, safe and healthy. Now turning to our recent progress. Although overall monthly production through March was largely consistent with the refined aggressive site work plan, mechanical, electrical and subcontract activities began to build a backlog to Unit 3 aggressive site work plan at the end of March. That trend was exacerbated through April, as we began experiencing impact across the site related to the coronavirus pandemic, including an increase in workforce absenteeism. Two weeks ago, in an effort to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19, we announced our intent to reduce density on the site and take workforce down by 20%. As we work through this transition, we expect to see a decrease in near term production, similar to the sawtooth effects that we have experienced in the past. Longer term objectives is to gain operational efficiencies and productivity by reducing workforce fatigue and absenteeism. As we move ahead, we will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of our streamlined workforce. As you know, we regularly evaluate both costs and schedule, and we have factored recent developments into our ongoing analysis. Looking first its schedule. We are prioritizing keyword fronts on Unit 3 and continue to work towards the aggressive site work plan targets, which have been pushed back slightly in light of recent events. The next major milestone for Unit 3 is the start of cold hydro testing, which is currently planned to occur in the June to July timeframe. Considering our expected timing on the start of cold hydro testing, we expect Unit 3 hot functional testing to commence in the August to September timeframe. On the assumption that we are able to stabilize and increase productivity to pre-pandemic levels, we are maintaining the aggressive site work plan targets of year end for Unit 3 fuel load. As a reminder, construction completion of about 2% per month is consistent with the aggressive site work plan. Taking into account our performance to date, we now project that we need to complete approximately 1% per month to meet the November benchmark schedule. Now, this is slightly down from the 1.3%, we discussed last quarter. Importantly, even amid the outbreak of the pandemic for April, our construction completion rate was about 1.25%, which supports meeting the November 2021 regulatory-approved in-service dates. Critical areas of focus remain electrical and subcontract performance. Lastly, consisting with the prioritization of Unit 3 and related staffing, we have shifted the target completion date on the aggressive site work plan for Unit 4 back to May 2022, which still provides six months of margin to the regulatory-approved in-service date. Recall, under the refined aggressive site work plan we laid out in February, we accelerated the target completion date for Unit 4 by two months to March. So the current action takes us back to the prior day of May, 2022. Turning now to cost. Based on our most recent assessment, there is no change in the total project capital cost forecast. In the first quarter of 2020, Georgia Power allocated an additional 66 million of its project contingency, reflecting cost risks associated with construction productivity, field support, subcontract and procurement, as well as the impacts of the April 2020 reduction in workforce. Recall the estimated cost of time between the aggressive site work plan and the regulatory-approved November in-service date or a schedule embedded in Georgia Power's based capital forecast. With this quarter's contingency allocation, the scheduled cost margin and the remaining cost contingency combined continue to represent approximately 20% of the remaining estimated cost to complete. As we have said, we expect to utilize the entirety of the contingency funds as we progress towards the completion of the project. The team at Vogtle Units 3 and 4 have worked incredibly hard to create an environment at the site that has led to meaningful progress over the past few months even while managing through this unprecedented pandemic. The next few months will be pivotal as we adjust to a smaller, more streamlined workforce and seek to improve productivity. The safety of our workforce and the surrounding community remains paramount and we continue to guide our decision making at the site. Importantly, we still expect to meet the November regulatory approved and service from both Units 3 and 4. Drew, I'll turn it over now to you for an updated on our financials and our outlook. Thanks, Drew. As our nation seeks a path to recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, at Southern Company, we are resolute in our commitment to provide clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy for your customers. To ensure that we are actively supporting recovery efforts, Southern Company and our subsidiaries are engaged with policymakers at both the State and Federal level as they make critical decisions about reopening our economies. Notably, Alabama Power's CEO, Mark Crosswhite and I were named as part of the President's Economic Revival Initiative. Along with the work that I do to help lead the Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council, the principal liaison between the federal Government and the electric power industry, which has been heavily involved in pandemic recovery efforts. Southern Company continues its leadership at a national level. Before we take your questions, I also want to highlight the extraordinary response of our teams after the recent severe storms. In April, we experienced two successive weekends of devastating tornadoes across our Southeast service territories that damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes and businesses. Our employees on the frontlines worked tirelessly to restore service to the thousands of electric and natural gas customers that were affected by these storms. In the aggregate, we restored service to over 600,000 customers within 24 hours, improved our capacity to work under duress effectively with coronavirus protocols. I am grateful for and extremely proud of the men and women of Southern Company, who continue to work hard each day to deliver value to customers and shareholders during these extraordinary times. In closing, the COVID-19 pandemic will undoubtedly have a lasting impact on the U.S. and global economies and on communities we serve. Under what we currently view as a reasonable economic recovery scenario, we are positioning ourselves to mitigate potential financial impacts on our company through aggressive and thoughtful cost control. The next several months will be particularly instructive for Southern and our utilities as we monitor the pace of recovery, move into the warm summer season and work to increase productivity at Vogtle Units 3 and 4. We expect our business will remain reliable and resilient over the long-term in keeping with our long history of delivering on our commitments to customers, employees and shareholders. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Hello, Shar. How are you? Great. So with respect to the first question, when we set a guidance range, I think, you know, we broadly think that kind of the midpoint of the range is a place that without all these other impacts we do that we would expect to land. I think we remain consistent with our financial objectives for the year. You know, I will add, I know we received some conversation about should we reaffirm. Let me just hit that real quick. It has never been our practice to reaffirm guidance in interim periods. We give you guidance in -- at the end of the year so that would be late January, February. And then once we get through our peak kind of earnings season, which would be the third quarter that's one when we give a update as to our guidance. We believe we're committed to hitting our financial objectives. Of course, there is uncertainty in front of us, and we run the same uncertainty everybody else does. But with what we know right now with reasonable impacts, we remain committed to everything that we've said so far. So we are sticking with that. I think further evidence of that is the recent increase in dividend.  Shar, what else did you want there? Yes, Drew, thanks for that. I actually went back over the last eight years and just look at what did we estimate. And believe it or not, this is within the range of estimates. The kind of low was 65. In fact, I want to say, in 2018, we estimate it $0.65. And when you consider you have the effect of the covirus -- the coronavirus impact, who knows, but it seems like a reasonably conservative estimate for -- from my standpoint. I'm okay with it Shar, let me pick it. One of the predicates in your question, and that was until there's zero probability. That's really not the case. We've kind of do a reasonable shot, and we stick with that. Look, we have used some margin here. We had an extra month of kind of hidden margin between hot functional test and fuel load. Essentially, we have seen so far losing kind of 10 days to 14 days in the aggressive schedule. We think through May, we'll lose another two weeks. The site people are going to work like crazy to mitigate the loss of that month. But we had a month of, if you will, margin in between now and fuel load that we're just consuming. Is it riskier than it was before? Yes. But it's still a reasonable objective. Otherwise, we wouldn't stick with it, okay? One last point. When we go from in the schedule from fuel load to in-service, recall, we have maintained -- and I know this has been a conversation in many earnings calls. We have maintained a six-month schedule there. China did it in 4.5 months, and we think we can meet or beat China. So we actually have a little more margin even to November and to May. So look, November is what matters. We got to beat November, and our eyes are on that. The site continues to believe they can hit a May schedule. Has it gotten more aggressive? Yes, still is a reasonable shot at it. Sure. Thanks. Same to you, bud. Hi, Steve. Good afternoon. Yes. Yes. Yes. In general, what we were able to do is to bring people off of four on to three. That's how we filled whatever gaps we thought we may see. Recall, and this was in the 8-K, I think, the first reduction was voluntary. And then we moved to what we call rightsizing. So the voluntary effort didn't produce an optimal kind of result for all the work phases that we have at the plant. And remember, as I said in the script and everything else, we're particularly concerned with getting the right mix and the right productivity in electrical and with subcontracts. And so what we did by moving resources away from four, we bolstered the mix on unit three, so that we believe that there's a reasonable shot to maintain the aggressive schedule, which has a May in-service date. So that really is what has happened. Now, the other thing I just want to put out is that, we are in transition. In the script, I mentioned, the idea about this sawtooth effect. And we've seen that every time now, and those of you that follow these calls will remember, that every time we open up a new workforce - a new work phase in the plant, every time we lead to an increase in personnel, well, and now, even with the decrease in personnel as we may mix crews and schedules and everything else. We believe that sawtooth effect will occur. And so, that's why we're being reasonably conservative with May. In other words, we did 1.25% in April, would still beat the 1% that we need for November. May maybe similarly challenged. We hope it's a little better, but don't be surprised if it's not that great. But then we expect in June and beyond to really pick up the sawtooth effect and achieve what we want to do, as we have done in the past. So, when we've talked to you about sawtooth effect in the past, in fact, it has occurred. So let us readjust, get the teams right, get the work practices back together and then we think we'll get the performance we want to see. Yes. Well, let me answer that a couple of ways. Steve, I know you're really good about this and others on the call are in terms of contacting the Commission directly or looking at all the filings and everything else. So you have heard directly kind of from the Commissioner himself, I would never put words in their mouth. But the other thing that I would just highlight to people is that Tuesday, so just a few days, the company will be testifying. And you'll be able to see the interplay between the company and the staff and everybody else. And so we'll get some illumination there. And I'll just add to that, too. So everybody, I think, knows that Georgia is one of the states stepping out on re-emerging. Of course, we're doing it in a thoughtful phased process. The other issue that I would put out there is fuel prices are really low. For the quarter, natural gas was $1.88 per million BTU. And I think the amount of natural gas cost borne by customers was around $250 million -- $247 million lower than last year. So cost of electricity, and therefore, consumption of energy is more cost-efficient than it has been before. There's a lot in the mix right now. And also, I'll just say that been in contact with my friend, Jay Powell from the Fed, I would complement, and I know there's all kinds of disagreement about this, but I would complement broadly the federal response, whether it's the administration, whether it's Congress, whether it's the Fed, in terms of the timeliness of their response and supporting the economy, especially as compared to, say, 2008, 2009, these guys are on top of it. And I'm sure we can all criticize one step here or there. But I think all the necessary chemicals are in the sea to produce something that will minimize hopefully the impact going forward. Thank you. Hey, Steven. How are you? No. In fact, look, we started very early on before there were any COVID-19 effects, we were planning that there would be. And one of the very first things we did, I remember it was a weekend all of the executive team, was to move to the site, essentially of medical village staff by nurses and doctors, we have a disease specialist that's been advising the site daily. We have all the PPE we need. We have turnaround and testing conservative work practices. And in fact, on realization, I kind of -- we've debated about talking about this on the call, but I'll throw a little bit of it out there. Our incidence rate compared to the utility industry is about half, maybe 40%, something like that. Our severity of cases is way low. One of the very smart steps that the site did very early on was to remove from the site at least on a voluntary basis with pay, people that would be most likely to be severely impacted. That is elderly or older. Look, I'm probably that category. I don't want to describe myself as elderly and if they had a pre-existing condition. So if you look at it, one other thing we do that's very conservative that other people aren't doing. That is, if somebody at the site just feels funny, if they don't feel well and want to get tested, we get them tested. Not only that, we take their work associates out that have the close contact and we test them. When you look at the amount of testing per person at the site relative to anywhere in the community we serve, it is somewhere we are testing between five and 10 times more people then what's being tested elsewhere in the region. So it's amazing stuff. So sometimes in these close contact cases, we will test somebody that is asymptomatic, oh, ensure they turned up positive, we removed them. And the other kind of telling factor is severity. I think we've only had one or two people be hospitalized or go to a hospital. Otherwise, they're being tested with the folks on-site and about half of the people that have been tested positive have returned to work. I think that's all pretty positive stuff. A couple more things that we're doing. At any work front, we limit the amount of people doing the social distancing to three per work site. So sometimes, we exceed that with everybody's approval, but that generally is the practice. We have eliminated close quarters great areas, close quarter lunch areas, the big bussing, and all that stuff. We really have worked hard right away early on to make sure and the principle was that we wanted Plant Vogtle 3 and 4 to be a better environment for the workers there than what they could find elsewhere in their homes or in their communities in the surrounding area. And I think we've done that. Well, all the major equipment is tested, right? So in fact, it was -- I mean, right as we entered the call, we got to sign off from Westinghouse. The open vessel testing, the testing was complete. Just as you get your children and teenagers, check your work before you turn it in. That's what we have been doing in the past, just recent day hours, whatever. And in fact, we just got clearance from Westinghouse. And in fact, we had -- they had verified that we had passed all the tests on OVT. So, we were very happy to announce that today. I don't know how -- what else would you want to hear? I'd say all the major equipment is there and has been tested. We'll test it again once it goes into a system, but we're done. Thank you. Thanks for joining us. Well, you've got a great memory, and you're correct. That is, in fact, what we did. We took some steps to lessen the burden, but we don't feel the need to take those steps right now. Those are certainly options in the future to approach regulators if we need to. The one thing I think that you can just point to around the system is that I think we've received -- in fact, I would just go broadly. Our PSCs, but also, I would say, FERC and NERC at the national level, folks have really, I think, spent over backwards to accommodate the needs of this unique environment. And I think the issue of being able to set aside as a regulatory asset recovery of disconnect costs and a variety of other things has been another evidence of constructive practice by our states. And at the NERC and FERC level, I'll tell you, they've been on these ESCC calls like. Likewise, they're doing what they need to do in order to help the industry get through this period. Not by imposing over regulations, et cetera. I'm very complementary of what are generally very tough regulators taking constructive approaches to help in assisting through this time frame. Yes. And Drew, I'm just going to ask you if you're comfortable saying something here, but our relationship with not only our regulators, but also the rating agencies, etcetera, is continuous, not discrete. And just recently, you went through a pretty intensive review by the rating agencies. What can you say about their response to that? And I think we got a favorable review from them? Yes. Sophie, that's a great question. So if you recall, the -- I think we've done this in the past, kind of CapEx by quarter, we've jumped these curves. We're kind of at the peak of our curve. And assuming that we continue to be productive, the curve actually starts to turn down on Unit 3. Now, it'll ramp up a little bit more on Unit 4 going forward. So, my sense is we're going to evaluate our progress in the months ahead. But it could be that this level of activity is appropriate for where we want to be on Unit 3 and 4. We were on the downturn of activity at Unit 3, just right there. So, dropping the whole site from nine to seven isn't exactly unexpected. It's a little accelerated, which means that we're probably going to push out some hours. But it's not unexpected and we didn't intend it when we refinanced the schedule the refinement we did in February, but accelerating for those two months gave us essentially a bank of more margin that we're able to use and moving people from 4 to 3 to accommodate the difference in the resizing after this voluntary reduction. So, it's actually not a bad place to be. Let's see what happens in the months ahead. Yes, and let me let me add another comment. It's under the -- who knows, but I think it's still something we've talked about getting ready for the call. And that is when you think about the intensive impact of COVID-19, it's occurring during light revenue month for us. It's occurring during April in May, which are not strong month. This is Atlanta, particularly, but the southeast is known for these beautiful long springs and our big revenue month -- 60% of our revenue, I think, comes out of the summer. So that's going to be -- so when you think about the intense impact is coming during low revenue, and therefore, if we have some recovery, that's the who knows part, that will get us back to, I think, a good spot. Hey, Sophie, one more thing you mentioned, somebody pointed out to me that I didn't cover, you said, do we follow CDC guidelines? In fact, yes, we do. And in fact, I think we're even more conservative than CDC in terms of recovery and all that stuff. We keep people out 14 days, even if they've been around somebody that's been tested, a variety of other things. One other thing. Yes, just one last thing. We do survey. We do stay in touch with the other megaprojects around the U.S. and their experience is not that different than ours. I think 95% are still progressing kind of as we are. Thank you. How you doing? No, Michael, I think probably what you're noting maybe a difference in time period, we're -- the 2% to 3% that we've got on our churn on slide 11 really is meant to represent what we think the full year impacts might be. We certainly are seeing across all of these classes, commercial, industrial and residential, more exaggerated response than what's depicted here. What we're trying to show is just that this is what we think the full year impact would be given the point in time we're the point in the heating and cooling cycle, where we are today. And as Tom said, April is sort of an interesting month in Georgia, people are starting to change over from heating into air conditioning and so demand is quite light. What we expect in May is a fraction of what we expect in June. Where are they manufactured? Did you say -- you're breaking up. Did you say where is the fuel manufactured? South Carolina, Yes. I'm sorry, you're breaking up. What would -- I'm sorry, you're really breaking up. But what we hear is, where is the fuel manufactured in it South Carolina. Is there any fuel on-site? No. That will -- No, no. Yes, Michael, thank you. If we missed your question there, please call us after, and we'll be glad to hit it for you. You were just breaking up a lot. Yes, sir. Thank you. Hello, Jeremy. How are you? You bet. Yes, I think we're on 510s. And then we don't do as many weekends as we have. So we backed off a little bit. That gives us a little bit of optionality should we need to work weekend. So we backed-off a little bit during this timeframe and less density and everything else. Further, we have shifted more work into the daylight hours as opposed to the night shift. And we have shifted more hours on to Unit 3. So, that's kind of the broad approach there. Well, look, we're in contact with our key account customers. I think we always do a pretty good job there. And let the estimate stay where the estimates are. So, you have a little bit of a different question kind of what's our pulse of the community. I think there is a positive vibrate right now, that people are trying to figure out ways to start again the restaurants. They are doing all this takeout. It just -- it feels a little better. Drew is in a different part. He lives right in the heart of the city. I live in the burbs. What's kind of your experience? So we have 100% more capacity than what we're seeing in terms of actual cases right now. So when you think about coming back to work, there's a whole lot of gating issues that we've been working on. I've been working on in a national level in the industry and here at Southern. One of the big indicators is, have we flattened the curve? Do you have capacity? Yes. The fact is, and I think it's been very instructive at Vogtle that we have to learn to work with the virus. We have to learn for American Commerce to get along, because the only way you can be assured you don't have the virus is to have widespread available vaccines, and we don't have that yet. Until we get there, you won't have complete recovery. So how do you act? How are you able to persist in this environment? And I think that's why -- I mean, who knows, but I think that's why Governor Kemp that was one of the issues he was looking at, do we have available capacity? Yes. The next question we will all have as a nation is, do we have a second wave later this fall? We'll see. Yes, you bet. Thank you. Hello, Paul. Glad to have you with us. Yes, we're great. Turnover and testing a construction have been going hand in glove along the way. We get thorough reports. I know we do thorough reports once a month with everybody at the PSC and the co-owners and everything else, that's going according to pace. And sometimes you speed up testing. Remember, we got into a discussion about that in past calls. Sometimes you slow it down, letting construction catch up, or you test in other areas of the plant while you focus on construction in a particular area. All that's going as expected. I wouldn't say that's anything other than exactly what we've expected. And I think this approach has really served us well. We've talked about that in the past, but fail fast and learn in other areas has been really helpful to us. Yes. Let me just give you a quick numbers. The ITACs that have been submitted, all the UIN, so this is the ITACs that have been submitted in form without the number. Have been accepted by the NRC, so every one of those. So that really lessen the bow wave that we have. We had originally, I think, 449 ITACs fully that need to be submitted for Unit 3. And we've had a whole lot of those complete. I guess, we still have about 270 left before they're certified and we get the clearance to load fuel. That's been going well. Let me just -- yes, go ahead. Go ahead, Paul. There's, it's a pace along the way. There is some elements of the 270 that are after construction. But we think it's, ITACs are going well. We're either ahead of schedule or whatever. Paul, you may remember, I used to say that ITAC would reach my top three of concerns. And while we're concerned about everything, I think, electrical work and subcontract work, are much bigger concerns at this point in our ability to deliver on ITAC. I really think those guys have done great. And I want to throw a bouquet to the NRC. They have staffed up appropriately. And the teams that have been charged with approving the UINs and the ITAC that are fully complete have done a very timely job of doing that. I personally have worked with Steve Kaczynski [ph] and team visiting with the NRC commissioners, and they are committed to holding up their end of the bargain. I feel I feel good, it's still a big issue. Let me not minimize it. But it's something I feel pretty good about. Yes, and it's just been following you know, I forget. I did -- we do these -- variety of these town halls. I did one with Shar recently and sometime ago with Weissman [ph]. And sure enough back then I said end of the month well, we finished OBT end of the month. So we're able to follow through on the schedule despite the challenges of COVID. Yes, yes. And you just got to remember the sawtooth discussion, we've had before. Anytime we staff up or now staff down we have to right-size and bring new people on and, you know, getting used to a new work front and new people working together and new supervision. There always is a bit of a learning curve. That's a sawtooth. Yes, we are expecting an improvement. But let me point out again, we have been at, I think, the chart on slide 7 really shows it, but even with April, it's just a slight down tick from our aggressive schedule. And I think pretty far away from November. Even during April, we completed 1.25%, target was 2%. The November scheduled called for 1%. So we even made some margin to November even during a bad month. We're not -- as a principle, we're not refilling open jobs without CEO approval, which really freezes them. And has the effect of a freeze. Yes, go ahead. Yes, sir. Thank you. Hey, Michael. How are you? Yes. I would say, in general, you're in a giant process that's on track in Georgia for all that stuff -- I'm sorry, in Alabama. Yes, I think everything is going as we thought it would there. That's true. But what's interesting in Mississippi? 25% of Mississippi sales are wholesale. And those wholesale sales are largely residential. So you give it a bit of a different mix in Mississippi, but it's small, but Drew is exactly right. Alabama and Georgia are pretty similar. I think we were looking towards June, summer -- early summer for that process to occur. Thank you my friend. Hey, Julien. How are you doing? And the other thing I would just say, I mean, that's a range that's here, again, I hate to say with all this uncertainty, it's kind of who knows. But I think earlier, maybe a month ago, I was saying $250 million to $350 million, we track down $50 million, just out of conservatism and a more prolonged kind of effect. But there, again, too, that would reflect even at highest ends, we're still within the range. You need to tax effect that. He was -- Drew just gave you an after-tax net income effect. So this is pre-tax. Yes. Thanks, Julien. There's a good draw with my finger here in the air. But if we were doing a one-on-one, I draw my little piece of paper, my hand written things, I'm so payment for there. Just imagine this, if I had a curve that showed 9,000 people on site, as we wind down Unit 3 construction heading into hot functional tests, the wind down of people on-site for Unit 3 occurs. So the curve actually goes down. What we're doing is and what we've said about kind of hot functional tests being kind of now August, September. All we did was push it out a little. Imagine you pushed your hand down on the peak of 9,000 and it pushes out a little bit to the right. So all we've done is tried to maintain that level. I don't think you're going to see another big peak here. We were already at the peak. And I think now that peak starts to wind down. That's why we feel comfortable with the movement from 9,000 to 7,000 on-site, drawing some off of 4, which pushes 4 back to its original schedule and still maintaining our ability to hit the aggressive site plan for Unit 3. All we did was shift the curve a little bit, and we funded that curve with Unit 4. Yes. You know what, I suppose there is a hypothetical in there. Julien, I just don't think that's likely. I think America, let me just speak broadly, and I'll take it down to the site. America has to learn to live with the virus. Our experience so far, knock on wood, has been much less than what you've seen in the industry about half. And our experience on site, likewise, have been less severe, I think largely because of the smart actions, the people on the site have taken, for example, removing the at-risk personnel and paying them well before we saw the effects of the site -- on the site. People are now coming back to work. One other point is, it looks like the average over the past, I don't know, four weeks. If you do a four-week look at average, it looks as if we may be past the peak on the site. Now, that will only be borne out in the next few weeks to come. But if you do a seven-day rolling average, it looks as if incidence levels are decreasing. So look, there's a hypothetical in there. I really think it's a practical manner. The job at hand is, continue the good work we're doing on site, make that an attractive place for people to work, which I think we're doing. And I think the labour unions at all are calling us out for that kind of unprecedented response and keep going. I just don't think -- I don't see it right now, but we'll see. Thank you, Julien. Appreciate it, bud. Hello, Andrew. Thanks for joining us. Yes. Look, I -- and the good news there is, if that's what your big hit is, I think your ability to come back is much better. It will come back quicker. Your ability to shut down a plant and then get it back is harder than restarting a restaurant. In fact, I was on CNBC this morning, and I know right after me was the CEO of IMAX. He says, our ability to turn theatres back on, is almost instantaneous. So, look, that is an assessment of our key accounts, and our marketing teams across the system. That's just what we see. Our industrial make up, the kind of folks that we see, really have been having a great quarter. And in fact, if you look at the month-by-month sales at industrial, gosh, our momentum statistics, I'm fond of mentioning, we're showing really quite positive momentum through February. And it's just with COVID, what we saw were some companies taking outages. They said, 'Well, if we're going to want a socially distance, why don't we go ahead and take an outage and do some maintenance, sending a lot of people home.' We actually think industrial will recover faster, more resilient. The other thing that we have in the Southeast here is industrial dependent upon natural gas as a feedstock, particularly in the chemicals area. I think that's our number one industrial customer. And with natural gas being where it is, those guys are producing product at really attractive levels. We saw this again in 2008 and 2009. And essentially, I would say, Alabama has been particularly proactive in putting in place rate plans that preserve industrial load, where across the United States, they didn't have those things and industrials tended to shut down plants in other parts of the United States and move their productive capacity to the Southeast. For all those reasons, that's why we think industrial is more resilient than commercial. Good news is commercial is going to recover pretty quickly, in my opinion. You bet. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed. Yes. We are hanging in there. The 400 million estimate assumes that there's more of a through the year impact. Yes. I don't know that, we want to portray too much optimism. We Certainly, U-shape, it feels better where we're sitting today than maybe on the downward slope of it a couple of weeks ago. But our projection for a 5% reduction in total retail sales is quite exaggerated relative to what we've seen in history. And so this will not be without economic pain for sure. We do think that our economies generally in the Southeast benefit from the fact that we've got good in migration. And it's a good place to do business and so long-term, we -- relative to others, we think that we've got pretty decent economic climate. The amount of time it takes to get back to normalcy though is inestimable. Yes. There are lots of degrees of freedom in all this. It's just our most reasonable guess at this point. And I know, and my heart goes out to most of you guys on the phone and lives in the New York area. I'm from New Jersey, we all have relatives and people have been impacted by this. And so, we're very mindful of the grave circumstance. That's not the case down here; at least we haven't seen it. It's much less severe in the southeast than what you're experiencing up there. So, yes. Okay. So now that's a -- I'm sorry, that's like a different question and it's interesting. Will there be destruction in the economy as a result of the COVID deal? That may be. My sense is the United States is in a pretty good position relative to global economies with respect to this issue we will see. In other words, is there going to be less demand from Europe for American products? What about China? One of the other impacts that we've been talking about at a federal level on this return to work is kind of revitalizing the supply chain to the United States, making us a little less dependent, particularly in critical infrastructure for reliance on foreign economies. Still sitting there in Congress is an infrastructure bill. My sense is, there's more energy used upon, behind future legislative initiatives, that could overcome some continuing sustaining impact of destruction in the economy. Some other things could emerge. My sense is right now, if I just sit here and think about 2021 and 2022, there may be some continuing impacts. But at this point, I don't think they're at all significant to the point where we would change our forward guidance on a 4% to 6% EPS growth rate. We the dominant issue for us is getting Vogtle Bill. Once we clear Unit 3 and Unit 4 to service, the rate of increase because of the earnings rates inside the construction period recover to a full return on capital. It's hard to beat that down. Look, we're -- we got early availability on the best test we can get the time, the antibody tests are really pretty interesting. In fact, we're talking about that at a national level. We have had Admiral Giroir from HHS. He's the Director of Health, and he kind of has the whole testing regime in place. That's something that's attractive, but it's just not available right now. We can test all over the place. And in fact, you can test everybody and they go home, and you'll have to retest them the next day and the next day and the next day. Testing is really valuable, and I don't underestimate it, but it doesn't solve the problem. Until we get a vaccine in place, we're going to be having to live with this environment in the nation. I think they are not adjusted. Thank you. Appreciate you join us. Yes. So we're the size of the nation of Australia in round numbers. I get that statistic. We're a little bit smaller, but when you think about energy production, we're kind of in that league. We have long-standing relationships, and we are considered a high priority customer with a variety of resources. And when I say, we don't see any problems in the long run, that doesn't mean people aren't working really hard to make sure that they understand what the perturbations may be, and what they're going to do to resource them. We have been seeing some challenges, but we've always been able to overcome the challenges. And I want to say, Drew, we have about at least a six-month kind of forward window where we're absolutely confident of no problems. So that's kind of our safety margin, if you will. When you think about the nature of our CapEx budget, however, it is really tied up in making our system more resilient from a transmission and distribution standpoint. It is tied up in future generation, whether it is renewables or some of the new generation required in Alabama and Georgia. And then it is tied up in environmental matters, particularly for us, ash ponds, which I think is $10 billion over 10 years in round numbers. So it is stuff that I think we've got great visibility into the availability of the equipment required to support that program. It's not subject to, I guess, Drew uses the word smalls, we have a lot of visibility, and we're a big customer and people generally work very hard to meet our needs. And we have pushed on this a lot. We've got a great guy, Jeff Franklin that runs our supply chain for the system. We don't see a problem right now. And let me throw one more factor out there. I'll throw another bouquet at somebody. The Director of CISA in Homeland Security is a guy named Chris Krebs; he's doing a terrific job within the confines of his responsibility in calling out. And my word, they put out an advisory bulletin of essential functions in America. And of course, Health and Human Services is right at top right now. But right behind that is the electricity function in America. That's also part of the recommendations by NIAC, National Infrastructure Advisory Council, and also the work product, of the Solarium Commission that I'm on. Look, people will put a high priority on making sure that our needs are met. One last point, we have a terrific relationship with our valued partners in the labour market. So the U.S. building trades have done a hell of a job, making sure that the people are there. And I think we work very hard to make sure that they are valued partners and treated as well as anybody treats them in the United States. They are strategic partners for decades, and we treat them like that. And I think the labour will be there when we need it. Yes. Thank you. No. We appreciate your attention. Hello, Ashar. How are you? Always glad to have you with us. Yes, Ashar, let me actually -- I went deeper in preparing for this for the call. But like I said, I have in front of me the data last eight years, our low was $0.66, but we had three years in the 60, $0.66, $0.69, $0.68, $0.71, $0.73, $0.75. And only the last two years have been $0.80. All we're doing is taking a conservative shot at what the second quarter, COVID-19 thing is. It's always a fight. I always laugh. I used to be CFO, and I had always extract an estimate from the system CFOs. And well, the inside joke inside Southern is when the CFOs kind of report what they think, they always have a conservative bias. And the joke is that, the positive variances are always temporary and the permanent variances -- the negative variances are permanent. So we always have to fight through what the right answer is. I think Drew has done a great job. I can't say that 65% is light. I'll just say that, it's reasonable. There's a lot of degrees of freedom of conservatism around what's going to happen with COVID 19. We'll see, but that's the data. I got the data, right in front of me. And we had a good first quarter. I know you did. Excellent quarter. Yes. So good start. Operator, anything else? Drew, you want to lead us off? And from my perspective, working at a national level, whether it's thinking about Homeland Security with Chris Krebs and his team, Department of Energy, Secretary Danbury all of his team is doing a terrific job. The industry is responding exceedingly well. And you should know that the industry in this case is a union of the investor-owned utilities and the cooperatives and the municipals. We are all working together to solve the problems as they arise. And in fact, the favourite Gretsky saying skate to where the puck will be. I think this industry is way beyond reacting to the present and really into thinking about the future. We're very mindful that hurricane season, storm season is ahead of us and being able to demonstrate as we have for decades, effective mutual response to the problem that will arise this year. I think the industry is doing a terrific job, so kudos to all of my brothers and sisters out there. And then finally, for Southern, what a great start to the year, that's given us some tailwind I think to address some of these things. There is a lot of uncertainty ahead. I'm very encouraged with the team at Vogtle. When you look at the data, I think they're managing these unexpected conditions in an exceedingly prudent manner. And the rest of the system is going great with their ability to respond to the storms and still serve customers well with this coronavirus protocol in place. I'm just very encouraged about our ability to deal with whatever comes our way for the rest of the year. That's why we remain committed. I want to thank you all. I know, especially those of you all in the Northeast, you know I'm from New Jersey; I got relatives up there. And I know you guys are dealing with some very tough times. And I know maybe your families or maybe friends of family are all being impacted. My thoughts and prayers go out to you all and I think working together, we're going to get through this thing. Thanks everybody for being with us today. I know it's an extra long call, but I hope we gave enough color around not only Southern situation, but the national situation to give everybody confidence in the next steps forward. Thanks, everybody. Talk to you soon. Operator, that's the conclusion of the call."

At this time, I’d like to welcome everyone to The Southern Company Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Investor Relations Director. Please go ahead, sir.\nScott Gammill: Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon and welcome to Southern Company’s year-end 2021 earnings call. Joining me today are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company, and Dan Tucker, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you, we’ll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Qs and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure, are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I’ll turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Fanning: Thank you, Scott. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. As you can see from the materials that we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted earnings per share for 2021, exceeding both our original 2021 guidance and the estimate that we provided on our third quarter call. This performance is due in no small part to our outstanding service territories and the unparalleled commitment of our employee to deliver clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to our customers. Our outstanding customer service, our commitment to the communities we serve and our proactive engagement with our stakeholders are reflected in the numerous honors we’ve highlighted in our slide deck, including recent recognition as number two in the nation on Forbes 2022 list of America’s Best Large Employers. Many of the initiatives that support this distinction are reflected in our inaugural transformation report which we released earlier this week. This report details our sustained commitment and actions to further advance equity, both within our company and our communities. These commitments allow Southern Company to help lead change within our communities and provide an enduring reflection of our values. We are proud with the progress we have made and continue to recognize the opportunity to do more. As an example of the work we’re doing to drive our customer satisfaction results, a meaningful portion of our capital plan in recent years has been allocated to the continued modernization of our electric grids. Our grid automation strategies and investments are delivering real value to customers. And in 2021, our customers experienced 15% fewer minutes of interruptions. Similar initiatives will continue to be a major component of our capital plans going forward. Across all of our stakeholder groups, including employees, customers, communities and investors, we’re focused on sustainability and a long-term view of value. That objective remains sound. The long-term financial plan that we outlined for you last year remains intact. And we are reaffirming our 5% to 7% long-term growth rate expectation, consistent with adjusted earnings per share in a range of $4 to $4.30 in 2024. Let’s now turn to an update regarding some of the recent developments related to our progress on Plant Vogtle units three and four. As you can see in the materials provided earlier today, we updated our expected completion timeline for both units, extending the in-service dates for each unit by three to six months. As we discussed on previous calls, the paper process is a critical aspect of turning plant components and systems over from construction to testing and operations. We have discovered incomplete and missing inspection records concerning much of the materials and equipment that have been installed at Unit 3. These inspection records are an important part of the documentation that is necessary to file ITAACs. Our progress on Unit 3 ITAAC has slowed as we address a backlog of tens of thousands of inspection records needing completion to support system turnovers. Through hard work over the last several weeks, we have reduced this backlog by more than 30%. Documentation within these inspection records is a critical aspect of getting it right and the time and resources to complete the remaining inspection records and remediate construction issues identified in the process, including the impact of borrowing Unit 4 resources are key drivers for the change in schedule. We have 123 ITAACs remaining for Unit 3. The revised ITAAC completion schedule we’ve included in our slide deck is consistent with a three-month change in the Unit 3 schedule. Over the past year, a number of challenges including shortcomings in construction and documentation quality have continued to emerge, adding to project timelines and cost. In recognition of the possibility for new challenges to emerge, we further risk adjusted our current forecast by establishing a range of three to six additional months for each unit. And we’ve reserved for the maximum amount. We continue to make meaningful progress on both units. Notably for Unit 3, all 157 fuel assemblies have been loaded into the spent fuel pool in preparation for fuel load. For Unit 4, direct construction is now approximately 92% complete, open vessel testing has started, and we recently completed the structural integrity and integrated leak rate tests without issue. The aforementioned challenges on Unit 3 are serving as lessons learned for Unit 4, and have benefited our performance on Unit 4 to date, relative to Unit 3. First time quality on both construction and documentation are key areas to focus. Our priority is bringing Vogtle Units 3 and 4 safely on line, and again to get it right, to provide Georgia with a reliable carbon-free energy resource for the next 60 to 80 years. With this most recent change in project costs and schedule, provisions in the Vogtle 3 and 4 co-owner agreement came to the forefront, requiring the owners to affirmatively vote to proceed with the project. Vogtle 3 and 4 is incredibly important to the state of Georgia and its robust growing economy. Furthermore, the addition of 2,000 megawatts of baseload carbon-free energy is vital to increasing the availability of net zero energy resources across the state. Considering the facts and our proximity to commercial operation, Georgia Power has already voted to proceed. The other owners are required to vote by March 8th, which allows time for them to work through their own governance processes. Consistent with the schedule extension of up to six months additional for each unit, Georgia Power’s share of the total project capital cost forecast increased by $480 million largely as a function of time, additional resources to complete the remaining work with the unnecessary focus on quality construction and documentation and the replenishment of contingency. We continue working constructively with our co-owners to resolve different interpretations of the cost sharing agreement within expected potential range of outcomes of $100 million to $900 million. We have included $440 million of the $900 million in our total project cost estimates. In aggregate, Georgia Power’s resulting total capital cost forecast is $920 million. And as a result, Georgia Power recorded an after tax charge of $686 million during the fourth quarter. We value our partners on Vogtle 3 and 4 and the relationship we’ve had with them across multiple assets for decades. We look forward to our continued partnership on each new unit as they transition to commercial operation, providing millions of Georgians with clean, safe, reliable and affordable electricity for decades to come. Before turning the call over to Dan for an update on our 2021 financial performance, and our long-term outlook, I’d like to briefly touch on Georgia Power’s triennial Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP, which was filed with the Georgia Public Service Commission late last month. The proposed plan sets forth a proactive, innovative and transformational roadmap for how Georgia Power expects to support customers in its growing service territory for decades to come. Consistent with Southern Company’s path to net zero carbon emissions, the plan describes a tangible path to transition Georgia Power’s generating fleet to cleaner more economical resources. This plan includes retirement of all of the coal units, Georgia Power controls by 2028, except for Plant Bowen Units 3 and 4, which are scheduled to be retired no later than 2035. The plan also includes a request for the addition of 6,000 megawatts of renewable generation by 2035, more than doubling Georgia Power’s current renewable resources. Additionally, 1,000 megawatts of storage is requested by 2030 to improve the capacity value of these intermittent resources. In recognition of the changing energy landscape, Georgia Power proposed innovative programs to promote reliability and resilience, including a distributed energy resource program. The comprehensive long-term plan also addresses continued investment in our transmission system and energy efficiency programs for customers. The IRP is subject to the review and approval of the Georgia Public Service Commission. Hearings will take place during the first half of 2021, with a final decision due this summer. Dan, I’ll turn the call over now to you. Please take it away.\nDan Tucker: Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. All of our major subsidiaries had a strong 2021. As a result, our full year adjusted earnings were $3.41 per share, $0.16 higher than adjusted results in 2020 and $0.06 above the top end of our original 2021 guidance range. Financial performance for year was highlighted by strong customer growth, improving retail sales trends and continued investment in our state regulated utilities. These positive factors were partially offset by milder temperatures throughout 2021, resulting in a negative $0.05 variance for weather as compared to 2020 and a negative $0.14 variance compared to normal weather. Additionally, 2021 nonfuel O&M reflected the trend towards more normal operating conditions relative to the significantly reduced levels in 2020. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results compared to 2020 is included in today’s release and earnings package. Weather-adjusted retail electricity sales were up 2.4% compared to 2020, approximately 1% better than our forecast for 2021. Almost all of this positive variance can be accounted for in residential electricity sales as a result of continued robust customer growth and an extension of the increased usage trends, which began in 2020. Residential sales outpaced our expectation for the year by 2.7%, reflecting what we think could represent a transition to sustained hybrid work practices across our service territories. We continue to analyze retail electricity sales relative to pre-pandemic levels. And in aggregate, in the fourth quarter, our weather-normalized retail electric sales exceeded sales in the fourth quarter of 2019. We are encouraged by these trends, and we’ll continue to monitor the implications of supply chain constraints, labor force participation and inflation pressures on our outlook. Our stronger-than-expected customer growth is a trend that differentiates our service territories. Over the last two years, we’ve added an average of nearly 55,000 new residential electric customers and 30,000 residential natural gas customers across our regulated utilities. Average residential electric customer additions were 43% higher over the past two years than the average for the five years ended in 2019. Customer growth continues to be driven by a strong labor market recovery, and our Southeast territories are on track to reach pre-pandemic levels of employment later this year. Further supporting these trends, the economic development pipeline within our Southeast service territories remains robust. For example, the average number of job announcements was 22% higher and business investment in Georgia was 39% higher than average for the years leading up to the pandemic. Macro trends in e-commerce and electric transportation, combined with a diverse well-trained workforce and a low cost of living, have combined to drive major locations and expansions of distribution centers, data centers, manufacturing facilities and headquarters into our service territories. Turning now to our expectations for 2022. Our adjusted earnings guidance for the year is $3.50 to $3.60 per share. The $3.55 midpoint represents a growth rate of approximately 7.5% from the midpoint of our original 2021 guidance range. In the first quarter of 2022, we estimate that we will earn $0.90 per share. Included in our guidance is a more normalized assumption for retail electric sales growth of 0% to 1%, although a continuation of recent trends could deliver upside to that assumption. We continue to see long-term adjusted EPS growth in the range of 5% to 7%, consistent with adjusted earnings in a range of $4 to $4.30 per share in 2024. With 90% of total projected earnings over the five-year planning horizon coming from our state-regulated utilities, our expected EPS trajectory has a solid foundation. Additionally, our history of constructive regulation, strong credit ratings and disciplined O&M spending served to strengthen our outlook. Underlying our long-term adjusted EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% is a robust capital investment plan that continues to be driven by significant investment in our state-regulated businesses. Our base capital investment plan of approximately $41 billion, which excludes the capital required to complete Vogtle Units 3 and 4, supports our 2024 estimate for adjusted earnings per share of $4 to $4.30. This forecast represents a $2 billion increase in state-regulated utility investment for the common years 2022 through 2025 from our forecast a year ago. These increases in our forecast are the result of greater visibility into investments to upgrade our enterprise applications, serve major known customer expansions or additions, further improve our grid and protect our technology infrastructure as well as investments related to the transition of our fleet. We have long maintained a disciplined approach to capital forecasting within our state-regulated utility businesses. We don’t use placeholders, and we don’t include capital that isn’t expected to earn our allowed returns. The result of this approach is that our forecast tend to grow, especially in the latter years as our visibility into customer growth increases, as regulatory processes unfold, as compliance obligations evolve and as our long-term system planning is refined. We fully expect this trend to continue, including in relation to Georgia Power’s IRP. For example, neither the long-term hydro investment, nor the proposed company-owned energy storage systems are fully reflected in our forecast. Additionally, none of the renewable additions proposed in the IRP are included due to both their time frames and the potential for selecting purchased resources. Furthermore, we continue to believe Southern Power has significant opportunity to continue growing through investments to facilitate fleet transitions and the growth in clean energy infrastructure broadly across the United States. Southern Power’s model has been distinctive since its beginning in the early 2000s, focused on long contracts with creditworthy counterparties and a risk-adjusted return profile that marries well with our overall value proposition. While we expect near-term opportunities to meet our criteria to be modest, we do believe opportunities will accelerate in future years. We have allocated up to $3 to Southern Power over the five-year plan, with approximately $250 million in 2022, $500 million in 2023 and $750 million annually for the remainder of the forecast. Again, these allocations of capital are not included in our base capital forecasts. In aggregate, our financial plan is anchored to our base capital forecast of $41 billion, and we believe upside potential exists in our state-regulated utility forecasts and our Southern Power allocation, representing spending of over $44 billion as part of our strategy to sustainably drive long-term growth in earnings and dividends. We also believe many of the same drivers for additional potential investment over the next five years could translate to investment opportunities beyond 2026 as we continue on our journey to net zero. And finally, we’ve included an updated three-year financing plan in the appendix to our slide deck today. This plan, which is consistent with our updated capital investment plans and the potential capital investment opportunities we’ve highlighted, continues to assume no equity need over our five-year plan horizon. Credit quality and strong investment-grade credit ratings remains a top priority. The expected improvement in our consolidated FFO to debt metrics equates to 200 to 300 -- a 200 to 300 basis-point increase from 2021 to 2022 levels by 2024. We’ve included a slide in the appendix to highlight some of the drivers for this expected improvement. Combined with the expected reduction in construction risk over the next 12 to 18 months, we believe we are well positioned to support our credit quality objectives. Tom, I’ll turn the call back over to you.\nTom Fanning: Thanks, Dan. Southern Company strives to deliver superior risk-adjusted total shareholder returns, and I believe the plan that we’ve laid out supports that objective. Our customer and community-focused business model, our growing investments into our premier state-regulated utility franchises, the priority we place on credit quality and our commitment and actions towards net zero, all contribute towards making Southern Company a sustainable premier investment. A remarkable track record for dividends is another major contributor to that equation. For nearly three quarters of a century, we have paid a quarterly dividend that is equal to or greater than the previous quarter, including dividend increases in each of the past 20 years. As we look ahead, assuming adjusted earnings within our estimated range of $4 to $4.30 per share in 2024, a payout ratio that is expected to be at or below 70%, and a sustainable long-term adjusted EPS growth rate of 5% to 7%, we believe that once Vogtle 3 and 4 are completed, our Board will have the opportunity to consider an increase in the rate of growth of dividends, further solidifying our long-term value proposition. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey. Listen, on the incremental cost, I just want to break this down, if you will. I mean it’s -- a lot of numbers flying around here, if you can. So, of the $440 million you talked about in incremental cost, how much of that is driven by the co-owners agreement? Can you break that down, right? So you’ve got $180 million from the sharing band. And then above that sharing band, what percentage of the cost is -- warrants you, if you will. So, can you kind of break down the sort of the successive pies, if you will? And then, of that, what was the base project cost that was agreed upon with co-owners? And what was the decision on COVID-related costs, right? Emphasis on that last piece, if you don’t mind.\nDan Tucker: So, Julien, this is Dan. So, the $440 million, you absolutely hit it right. Within there is $180 million. That $180 million is consistent with provisions in our agreement with co-owners, where Georgia Power bears a fixed percentage of incremental cost up to a certain point. And so, that $180 million is the maximum amount of exposure under those provisions. Above the thresholds for those provisions is where this option to tender cost responsibility to Georgia Power kicks in. And that number embedded in $440 million is $260 million. So, what that represents is Georgia Power’s assumption of bearing $260 million, said a different way, 100% of all the dollars above the threshold. So that $260 million represents -- their share is already captured in the $480 million. This is capturing the co-owners piece that is assumed in these numbers to be tendered. And what was the second part of your question, Julien?\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: COVID-related costs. I got a follow-up, more holistic as well.\nDan Tucker: Yes. So, as we’ve disclosed and we talked about last quarter, there is differing interpretations in this co-owner agreement as to exactly how those provisions work and exactly what the starting point works. So, rather than air those specific differences here on the call, let’s let those conversations take place in the proper form. But suffice it to say, the two differing points of view is the starting point for where the initial provisions kick in and how COVID costs ultimately adjust any cost before sharing.\nTom Fanning: And Dan, one more point, I think, and please, I know you’ll correct me if I get this wrong, but we’ve associated the cost with tender in this estimate. We have not given any credit for the value of megawatts tendered. At the high end of the estimate, the amount of megawatts tendered, if everybody tendered, maybe around 75 to 80 megawatts. At the level in which we’ve estimated, we think it could be around 30.\nDan Tucker: That’s correct, Tom.\nTom Fanning: And we’ve given no credit to any value associated with those megawatts. We’ve talked about this on prior calls, the fact that you may have megawatts that’s going to be carbon-free, resilient for decades to come, we think it would have real value. We’ve reflected no value in any of these estimates.\nDan Tucker: And just to put a finer point on all this, Julien, we’ve included this $440 million, and that represents an estimate of an outcome. We do not, at this stage, have an agreement with our co-owners. We still have that difference of opinion.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: And maybe can you speak a little bit to this process then, right? You talked about this March 8th date with the co-owners here. Any initial indications on where they stand? Obviously, this 90% is a high bar. But theoretically, they could vote to proceed and then related to that, they could tender the incremental cost to you, right? I just want to make sure I understand the kind of two separate parallel processes here.\nTom Fanning: Yes. Julien, the way we would think about that is make them completely separate, okay? Well, the process is simple. By the contract that we entered into way back when, what was it, 2018, I guess, and I guess we signed it in early ‘19. But that kind of provision spoke to a potential outcome that was really onerous, like there was some cataclysmic problem, and we could all go our way. Our calculus was pretty simple. We are this close to loading fuel and ultimately getting Unit 3 on service and then ultimately Unit 4. To us, it was an easy decision to proceed.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: But the processes are separate. And from their perspective, they could vote to proceed and then ultimately allocate -- tender their megawatts to you, as you just talked about a moment ago, right?\nDan Tucker: It’s completely separate processes. Yes.\nTom Fanning: So, they could decide to proceed and separately they can tender.\nDan Tucker: That’s right. And there’s a 120-day to 180-day clock that we’ve disclosed in our 10-K as well that is really the time period to clarify tender or not. And the ultimate calculation, we alluded to megawatts, we alluded to dollars, all of that would not get buttoned up until Unit 4 was in service and all of the costs were known.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nJames Ward: Hey. Tom, it’s actually James Ward on for Shar. Thank you for taking my question. Tom, at a high level, when we think about the IRPs and let’s say, Georgia Power specifically, as you were mentioning before, I understand that any storage or hydro improvement spend would be incremental. But what about transmission? Is there any IRP-related spend baked into the $41 billion base plan, or is anything that comes out of the IRP going to be incremental?\nDan Tucker: Hey. James, this is Dan. So yes, there is transmission spend in there. In this forecast period for the five years, it is modest. Keep in mind that the plan includes retiring coal units in the ‘27, ‘28 time frame and then further again in 2035. So, the time line to construct and frankly, plan and permit these transmission projects is going to take the bulk of this forecast period and spending really occurs beyond. The other just detail, James, in the way you asked your question, I just want to make sure it’s clear. There is some storage reflected in the capital forecast, but not -- it’s a fraction of what has been assumed as a planning assumption in the IRP. It’s the one project that Georgia Power is specifically asking for approval of is in our capital plan.\nTom Fanning: And the only other thing I’ll add is that -- go ahead.\nJames Ward: Sorry, please go ahead.\nTom Fanning: The only other thing I will add, I think I’ve done this before in kind of private conversations with you all one-on-one. But, as you start thinking about retiring Vogtle -- I mean -- I’m sorry, Bowen 3 and 4, there creates a need in North Georgia. And we’ve talked about that further study is required in order to evaluate how you replace that? Is that going to be more solar? Is it going to be a combined cycle? Is it going to be importing megawatts from the south to the north and therefore, incremental transmission. We just haven’t done all that work yet.\nJames Ward: Got you. Okay. That’s very helpful. I appreciate the color there. Switching gears to asset optimization, understanding that you do not need equity in the five-year plan. You’ve been very clear about that. But when you look at LDCs trading hands at nearly 2 times rate base, how do you think about the opportunity to sell an asset at that level and then reinvest the proceeds into decarbonization efforts at your electric utilities?\nTom Fanning: Well, I think we demonstrated over the years that we’re both -- in the world of M&A, we’re both buyers and sellers. What we’re always seeking to do is put assets in the hands of the best owner. That’s just kind of our dogma, and I think we follow through on it. What’s interesting about our gas properties is that they have been able to contribute like 10% earnings per share growth, primarily focused on safety-related pipeline replacement programs. Since the acquisition of what is now Southern Company Gas, we have well exceeded our expectations on the acquisition. So, in order to think about cap allocation, as you do and we think about it all the time, selling something like our asset in Illinois relative to reinvesting in the core, we always have to consider what’s best for our long-term growth rate, what’s best on a risk-adjusted basis. We’ll continually do that.\nDan Tucker: Yes. And James, you made the point in your question. I mean, we don’t have an identified equity need in the forecast, and we think our LDCs are a great property.\nTom Fanning: Yes. It would be purely a value play as opposed to a need.\nJames Ward: And then one final one here just to follow on from Julien’s question earlier to clarify here. So given that the Vogtle co-owners are already protected by cost caps, and this is just at a high level here, is there any incentive or other reasons that we should be aware of or that might be worth keeping in mind for why Oglethorpe or MEAG would not want to proceed at this point since they have those cost caps in place? Just help us understand how they might be thinking.\nTom Fanning: We’re not aware of any reason that exists like that.\nJames Ward: Got it.\nDan Tucker: They have to go through different processes, James.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Tonet: Maybe just coming back to Vogtle real quick here. Just trying to get a little bit more clarity. Have any of the missing inspection reports resulted in the need to rework completed sections of the plant? And also just curious if the NRC has kind of weighed in here on the ITACC issue? And any thoughts you have as far as what could be done in the future for Vogtle 4 to -- controls that could be implemented to avoid these issues?\nTom Fanning: Yes. Interestingly, I was just in Augusta visiting with Glen Chick, our -- I think he’s just a superlative manager of the site, along with Steve Kuczynski. And we actually went through different systems, at this point, and we are trying, we are efforting to begin with the inspection report fixed with what we believe are the toughest, hardest issues to deal with. I can’t guarantee that. But so far, with 30% complete, we haven’t found a need for any of that comprehensive rework. Certainly, as we see things that aren’t according to specs or per an inspection requirement, then we will fix it. But nothing comprehensive, as you’re suggesting. Second question?\nJeremy Tonet: Well, I was just curious, I guess -- that’s helpful there. Thank you for that. And the NRC, if they’ve kind of weighed in on the ITACC issues and any kind of...\nTom Fanning: NRC. Yes. Thanks, Jeremy. Hey. The NRC’s posture, again, I think I say this pretty regularly. They’re a very tough requiring regulator, but we think they do a great job. And that’s the reason why the United States nuclear fleet is the envy of the world. Getting it right, as we so often say, will allow us to have an asset that will provide energy carbon-free, resilient for 60 to 80 years. So, we’re all in on getting it right. The NRC, likewise, is their primary focus. In other words, they’re not as concerned, I’m guessing, with schedule and cost. They want to make sure that whatever we build is as appropriate to nuclear safety standards as exist in America today. So, they support our efforts to find these things. And I think for the amount of ITACCs that we’ve already submitted, something like 275 or so, I think we’ve had very few problems with those ITACCs. That process has gone well, which says that once we get the work packages turned over and all the paper done in nuclear standard as it is supposed to be, we’ve had an enormous success rate in dealing with the NRC part of the equation.\nJeremy Tonet: And then, just pivoting a bit towards SMRs, just wondering if you could discuss Southern’s involvement with SMRs? And where you see the tech going over the coming years? And do you think there will be support to rate base spend if the technology has proven up in the future? Just wondering if you’ve had conversations with commissioners or other stakeholders on if this could be a potential down the road?\nTom Fanning: Yes. My conversations with kind of future nuclear technologies have really been more -- I haven’t talked to the states at all. That really would be the realm of Mark Crosswhite in Alabama or Chris Womack in Georgia or Anthony Wilson in Mississippi. In my conversations with DOE, with folks in that or in the administration, I’ve had those conversations, too. In my opinion, I know other people are more bullish on SMRs than I am. But you still have to deal with enormous security issues. You still have to deal with kind of the NIMBY issues associated with nuclear. So, I’ve always felt that nuclear lends itself to scale, now. SMRs do absolutely have an important place in our nuclear future. My opinion, it would be in the niche areas like military bases. The military already does SMRs on submarines and aircraft carriers. So, it’s easy to conceive SMRs showing up on big nuclear installations. So, it also provides them a degree of resilience. I get that. We have been -- and we participate in SMRs, you should know that. So, our nuclear team and our R&D team are involved in the SMR process. We’ve actually been asked to get involved in a significant way in SMRs and given -- I don’t want to be distracted with anything other than getting Vogtle 3 and 4 done, we’ve really stayed away from that. On the other hand, we view great progress, potential with the so called Gen IV reactors, the molten chloride salts. We’ve worked with Bill Gates and his team on that. We are -- when you think about the R&D S curve, I think we’ve done a lot of work on the science, and I would call it the bench science of it and the very small kind of element of starting up that S curve. The next kind of big slugs of development on the Gen IV reactors will require hundreds of millions of dollars. I know I’ve talked to Secretary Granholm; Deputy Secretary, Turk, other folks that it would be great as the DOE is looking to put money to work, especially in the technology development area. This is a place where we could partner with the federal government and really move quickly up that S curve to make Gen IV reactors a commercial reality. In our own planning processes, they start to show up as an option, probably in the late 2030. So, let’s say, 2035 to 2040. And as an economic matter, they tend to compete with CCS-controlled combined cycle technologies. So depending on how the technology and cost expectations evolve, you will see us either continue with combined cycles and capturing the carbon and sequestering it or pursuing new Gen 4 reactors. But again, that’s an issue that’s going to show up in the very late 2030s.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Maybe just a real quick follow-up here. Curious on advanced nuclear. Thanks for your thoughts there. But as far as what technologies could make the most sense? Just wondering, light water, what Vogtle is doing versus molten salt or other technologies. Just wondering what you think of give and takes between them.\nTom Fanning: Well, I think, the obvious difference between kind of what we’re building at Vogtle and the so-called Gen IV reactors is this issue of the fuel and the core. Effectively, the Gen IV reactors have the characteristic that a meltdown is virtually impossible. And therefore, you need less containment structures and therefore less capital cost in order to put those units into play and have them be as safe as we expect them to be. That is the real big difference. It’s a capital cost difference associated with how the reactors melt down characteristic could occur.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.\nAngie Storozynski: So, I have a question. I don’t think I’ve ever actually asked the question about Southern Power. So, looking at your past disclosure, and it seems like your gas plants are only hedged to about 80%, meaning the contracts are for about 80% of the output. We’ve seen quite an expansion of spark spreads across the country. I struggle with your regions. So, what, Georgia, Alabama, and North Carolina, and I’m not sure if that translates into higher dispatch or earnings of these assets. Again, if you could comment.\nTom Fanning: Yes. Angie, I don’t know we’d have to run the numbers down with you. Our own math would say, they’re 92% contracted for about 10 years.\nDan Tucker: Yes. And importantly, Angie, so in front of the Georgia Public Service Commission, as part of the IRP, the vast majority of the gas PPAs that are in front of them for approval are Southern Power gas plants. And so, that’s going to extend those units coverage for another 10 years.\nTom Fanning: And recall that we follow the same kind of rubric in contracting our assets as opposed to merchant players. In that, we don’t take fuel risk. We earn a return on and return of capital and pass through the fuel and energy price.\nAngie Storozynski: Just moving on...\nTom Fanning: In fact, Angie, -- Angie, excuse me. I’ll just give you one more data point. 95% contracted through 2026, 92% through 2031. That’s the nerdy data.\nAngie Storozynski: Good. Now just going back to Vogtle. So, yes, I read -- I actually just reread the agreement -- the ownership agreement and that additional around about COVID-related costs. So, we’re still seemingly in the COVID era. So, I’m assuming that some of this incremental cost related to the asset is still related to COVID and how does that come into this whole discussion about the sharing agreement with the co-owners? And then, secondly, we haven’t -- you haven’t mentioned inflation. And so, I’m just wondering, how is that impacting the cost profile of this construction project?\nTom Fanning: Yes. And thanks for that. This is my opinion I’m giving you as opposed to fact, I guess. But in my opinion, it is unquestionable. It is unreasonable to assume that COVID had no impact. And so, the real art of the deal is to figure out how much of that impact manifested itself. If you dial back on to those dark days when the first COVID thing hit and we were deciding whether to shut the project down or not, I think it’s very clear that we had to operate under a completely different operating regime on the site. Remember, we stood up a medical village. We did all sorts of things in order to continue this very important project. We have estimates that we provided to Georgia Public Service Commission. I don’t think we’ve updated those recently. But certainly, I think any reasonable person would say that there have been COVID impacts on the site.\nDan Tucker: Yes. And I would just say in terms of this most recent cost increase, it’s certainly not the driver. It’s not a major driver. But Tom’s point, it’s logically an element of what’s going on.\nTom Fanning: And I think we provided the chart in the appendix material, you can see even this most recent whatever this -- Omicron, it had an enormous spike in the December to January time frame. So, certainly, it had an impact. We saw it in -- especially over the holidays, we always expect to see more absenteeism and a variety of other things. We certainly saw it there as well.\nDan Tucker: But it’s fair to say, like everyone is, with every wave, with every impact, we are getting better at working in this environment, and it becomes increasingly less disruptive and thus less of a cost impact.\nTom Fanning: And let me hit one other kind of controversial point, but we watch this like hawks. Recall, at one time, we had 9,000 people on site. And there was a lot of concern was this somehow COVID hot bed. Well, in fact, the data shows that our COVID experience is just about similar to the surrounding communities. We don’t have a different experience on the site than in the surrounding counties.\nAngie Storozynski: Yes. Thank you. How about inflation though? Is it already embedded in this additional cost estimate?\nTom Fanning: Yes. But, Angie, most of the inflation sensitive stuff is already procured. Our supply chains are already spoken for all the major equipments there. I suppose there would be some labor. We’re paying top decile right now. I suppose that could come up later, but it hasn’t been a big effect now.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. And then, the last question. So, looking on stronger earnings where -- I mean, have been actually over the last couple of years. Now, despite unfavorable weather, so is the load growth the main driver, or is it just cost efficiencies? What is putting you above the high end of your guidance almost consistently despite unfavorable weather?\nTom Fanning: Well, Dan’s done a great job managing the cost structures of the system. Actually, Dan didn’t have anything to do with it all, but people in the operating companies did. But, I’ll tell you the big surprise. I said this on Squawk Box this morning and the data we’ve provided you, shows it. We beat our residential estimates by 2.7%. In other words, we were projecting that to be down, and it was actually up. And we think that that is due to a change in lifestyle. I think we budgeted as if we thought there was this return to work and therefore, we would see like a 2.2% reduction in residential sales because people are showing up at work. Well, in fact, our own data, if you look at Southern Company’s experience, our old model was about 80% of the people came to work every day. I think -- and they were 20% that were virtual, probably call centers. Now, we’re seeing about only 25% are here every day with about 50% hybrid. They’re coming in and out a few days a week, some more, some less, and then about 25% virtual. What’s interesting about that is the sales in the residential sector were sustained at a much higher level than what we thought. We thought they’d drop off. They actually increased a bit. That uplift really helped us this year.\nDan Tucker: And just as you look at our forecast, look, we certainly haven’t assumed that that continues into the future because one year doesn’t make a trend, but we reasonably believe it might. So if you look at our forecast for residential sales for 2022, it actually reflects year-over-year negative. And that’s, frankly, mitigated by assumption of strong customer growth. So, to your point, Angie, there’s certainly upside even in 2022 if we see these trends continue.\nTom Fanning: The customer growth has been awfully attractive for us, so over 50,000 on the electric side, what was it 27,000, something like that on the on the gas side. So, we continue to do that. And we think that is kind of a function too of people being able to work remotely. And so, they tend to go to places that have low input costs, attractive place to live. Our economic development data shows that as well. So, I think some of the stuff, Dan, you talked about in the script, it just looks good, particularly for Georgia, but even Alabama is coming back, and we’re doing well. We have reason to be bullish about the long-term viability of our franchise.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteve Fleishman: So, two questions. First, just on the Vogtle ITACC issues. So, I know you knew all along that the paperwork and that the trail of all that was super important, and you’ve been doing all the work. So, kind of -- could you give us a little flavor of just what has gone wrong here because obviously, it’s something that you were very focused on from the beginning?\nTom Fanning: 100%, Steve. And I think I said this in media earlier, but it’s true. I get up every morning throughout the day, in the middle of the night, think about Vogtle and what we can do and all that. And I was, the folks at the site have been particularly frustrated at this recent development. When we left you on the call and I guess it was late October, early November, everybody, the site too, was very bullish on the fact that man, here we go, we’re getting ready to file for 103(g) and load fuel in the whole bit. And when we started getting into the final systems related to the final ITACC, so right, we’ve done 100 and -- I mean, we’ve done 275, we had 123 left. We had already done in order to complete these tests and a lot of this equipment is already operated within the testing regimes. We had done physical and visual inspections, but what we found when we got ready to turn over these systems for the paper, and important part of the paper are these inspection reports. And we found in many cases, they were just either incomplete or missing. Let me give you an example. But, this is an example. This is relevant. For every bolt in that plant theoretically, we would have to ascertain certificate the provenance of that bolt. In other words, we’d have to prove that we know that the metallurgy worked and where it came from and everything else to the extent an inspection report did not account for the provenance of a bolt, we had to either take the bolt out and put in the bolt that was certified or take the bolt out and test it to make sure that it met our standards. This is at the very end of the process for the very final equipment and systems that were related to the turnover before we filed for 103(g). This is at the tail end of the process. And when we found this out, we just had to go stop, we’ve got to do a complete review of all of these inspection reports. And that’s what you see right now. I am frustrated about it, but it is something we have to do. We talk about this is the first plant we’ve constructed in 40 years. Well, this is the first nuclear documentation we’ve had to do in 40 years. I wish we had found it sooner. We just didn’t.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And then, totally separate topic. You were, I think, Tom, pretty accurate with caution about the build back better getting done last year. And I’m just curious how you’re feeling about maybe a climate only type package getting done in Congress this year?\nTom Fanning: Strictly my opinion, and I was in the meeting with the President and all that. You know what’s interesting, and I work with both sides of the aisle here. I think long term, both parties agree that we should do some something. I think the methods of doing something, especially in light of the inflation signals we are seeing and potentially the national security issues we are seeing right now lend themselves to nothing happening for the rest of the year. I wish it would. I don’t think it will.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Paul Fremont with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nPaul Fremont: I guess, my first question is going to be on turnovers. I think initially, you had talked about doing some of the turnovers, those that were necessary to load fuel and delaying other turnovers that you thought were less necessary. In light of the documentation issues, are you now looking to do all of the turnovers before you load fuel?\nTom Fanning: No. I think there’s a set you have to turn over in order to get to 103(g). And there could be some others in between 103(g) and loading fuel. Let me give you a little bit of kind of where we are. So on Unit 3, now I’m doing big hunky thing. There’s a little less than 100 systems, 96 or so. You would split those into 162 subsystems, okay? So, there’s 11 total to go. And since our last call, we’ve gotten 5 of those turnovers complete. If I think about what’s remaining here, I would say that we have 3 to go for 103(g) and 6 to go on fuel load and 2 that we can complete after fuel load. They’re not necessary to the nuclear safety side of things. Was that helpful?\nPaul Fremont: Absolutely. In the past, I think you’ve estimated or you’ve put out estimates of COVID-related costs that went as high as 400. In the upcoming VCM 26 filing, are you going to update your estimate of COVID-related costs or not?\nTom Fanning: Yes. The 400 -- 444 was at 100% dollars, our share of that was 160. I don’t know the stats of that. It didn’t come up recently. So, I think it’s still an open issue.\nDan Tucker: Yes. And there was some degree of estimating future impacts in the original number, and I think it’s been consistent with that.\nTom Fanning: Yes. We’ve not provided…\nPaul Fremont: So, is that 440 the sort of the most recent number that you’ve put out publicly?\nTom Fanning: Yes.\nDan Tucker: Yes. And so, you typically see us disclose it as 160 to 200, that’s our share. The 440 is 100% dollars. And just to be clear, no change reflected in VCM 26.\nPaul Fremont: You’re saying no change?\nDan Tucker: Correct.\nPaul Fremont: In VCM 26?\nTom Fanning: We just haven’t created an addition based on the latest Omicron effects. I mean, clearly, there were, we just haven’t updated the estimate.\nPaul Fremont: And then the numbers you put out for the cost sharing, potential write-offs are after-tax numbers. Can we get pretax numbers for those? The $480 million and the $440 million?\nDan Tucker: Yes. Those are pretax, Paul. Those are pretax.\nTom Fanning: So, that adds $920 million, $686 million is the after-tax portion.\nDan Tucker: Yes. If you look at our deck on slide 6, there’s $920 million listed there. That’s pretax. Total after tax for that is $686 million, and then we’ve broken down the components. But all those -- all that breakdown is pretax.\nPaul Fremont: All that is pretax. Okay. And then, the most -- the highest number of ITACCs that you’ve done in a given month, I think, is 18. How confident are you in being able to sort of do mid-30s type numbers once you’re able to sort of do the catch-up work on the documentation?\nTom Fanning: Yes. Paul, what you have to understand and back where we were in October, November, we’re basically finishing the work, and what we found is the inspection reports were lacking. So, this work is ready to go. The table is set. Once we get the documentation done, we’ll be ready to send those things in. We feel good about the schedule. It’s not that we’re finishing construction.\nPaul Fremont: And in terms of the -- so are you completely done with all of the construction or the remediation work for Unit 3 that you had identified sort of in the fall?\nTom Fanning: Yes. No, I just mentioned like an example of some of the remediation that might have to be done in order to conform with an inspection report. So, there’s other examples, but that’s it.\nPaul Fremont: Okay. And then, maybe the last question. The contracting of the Southern Power plants under the Georgia IRP, it sounds like the net income that you’re earning is based on some book value calculation on the plan. So, would the Georgia IRP, if it were adopted, at least with respect to the Southern Power plants, likely the earnings from those plants would remain roughly the same, or would there be any type of sort of -- would there be any material change?\nDan Tucker: I think the short answer, Paul, is no material change. These are market contracts. So, all of these contracts are being awarded to Southern Power under a competitive RFP process. And so, it’s going to reflect the current market for those senior contracts.\nTom Fanning: Over the life of the contract, the IRRs would be similar. And when you think about -- what we have said about the market broadly is that we’ve kind of pulled back on the market. This is kind of elsewhere in the United States because there was so much supply and the demand was waning and there was a lot of uncertainty. We saw the margins really getting tight and so we didn’t play. But for the things we do that we ultimately will sign up for pretty consistent IRRs and pretty consistent ROEs. The ROEs typically are a wee bit better than what we would find in our regulated jurisdiction, reflective of a little bit of the higher risk.\nPaul Fremont: Great. And then last question for me. The $686 million, should we assume either equity or asset sales to fund that?\nDan Tucker: Yes. So, again, we -- I think I said in my prepared remarks, Paul, that we don’t see a need for equity in this five-year outlook. So, let me just hit that a little more broadly because I think it’s important. But absolutely, nothing has changed about our near-term or long-term objectives when it comes to credit quality. We’ve said kind of the last several months that as we move closer to completion of the project, any change in the cost or schedule will evaluate to see if equity is needed, essentially because we are getting so close to the end and because of all the proactive things that we did in response to other changes, and frankly, we did a little bit more than what was needed. So that has positioned us really well. And I want to also emphasize the improvement in the metrics that comes later on. I think we put a slide in the appendix that shows some of the component of the uplift in FFO that will occur in a ‘23, ‘24 time frame. That also is near enough in time horizon to give us comfort with our overall financial profile.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Lapides: Commodity prices are up across the board, obviously, that’s a bigger issue than any one team or person can manage. How should we think about -- given what’s happened to commodity prices, and given the investment you’re making, some of which like Vogtle will help reduce the commodity exposure. How should we just think about the bill across your biggest businesses? So I’m thinking in Alabama and Georgia Power, I’m thinking about the bill and for Southern Company Gas. Like what’s happening to the total bill for the customer as we enter 2022 and think about ‘23 as well?\nTom Fanning: Yes. It’s interesting stuff, man. When you look at the data, gas prices increased ‘21 versus ‘20, 92%, like we averaged, I think, $3.82 per million Btu versus $1.99 a year ago. So that’s kind of a big deal. Now each of our jurisdictions have managed, I think, well, their unrecovered fuel balances. Georgia just got an increase, doesn’t wipe it out completely, but it did really well. Alabama used some of its earnings otherwise in 2021 to completely wipe out its fuel balance. So, one of the things we are very mindful of -- and I appreciate the way you phrased the question. We are very mindful of burden to customers, and we manage that like hawks. I think we’re in really good shape right now.\nMichael Lapides: Okay. I know you’ve done a lot of work over the years with the Federal Reserve in Atlanta. Just curious how -- when you think about just the economic impact to the service territory and you’ve got a high-growth service territory relative to a lot of your peers. How does this kind of -- how do you think about it when you meet with folks outside of the Company about what it means for economic growth?\nTom Fanning: Yes. Very interesting stuff. If you look at the data, we’re seeing -- even our industrial numbers, I said this on Squawk today, while it will show that it looks like things are slowing down a bit on the industrial sales side, the momentum numbers would tell you that and potentially the first derivative. In fact, two of the segments that underperformed or decreased year-over-year were chemicals and paper, but the paper was newsprint had a big closure of a plant there. The chemicals was a -- chemical plant, caustic soda and chlorine, that closed as well. If you wipe away those two big plant closures, our industrial sales actually were better than what we expected again. So pretty good stuff. Now, it is very clear that inflation will eventually eat into the growth in the economy. I was kind of visiting with some of the Fed work and all that here recently, you’re familiar with the old permanent income hypothesis. I think people have felt wealthier lately, and people are still spending as if inflation hasn’t visited them yet. It is inconceivable though that that won’t catch up at some point. You saw these hot retail sales. My sense is as inflation effects continue that those sales will start to wane. So, there will be a slowdown in the economy. Now, the real $50,000 question is, when does inflation start to recede a bit? A lot of stuff right now says that’s a 2023 issue that we could start to see inflation getting back to a more normal level. I think the underlying presumption in that one is that the supply chain works itself out. Right now, we’ve had such an imbalance in supply and demand that prices invariably are high. And for the lead time to procure certain goods and services, it is really sticky right now. So, the big swings are supply chain unwinding and getting back to normal, people adjusting to higher prices and therefore, reduced spending and therefore, reduced heat in the economy. Those are all the factors that I think will go into this point. For now, the economy looks really good in the Southeast, but it’s inconceivable to me that it won’t slow down a bit over the next year or so.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. And then, one last one, just thinking about whether you do the gigawatt of storage at Georgia Power, obviously, that kind of depends on the end of the IRP process as well as if you were to wind up doing more incremental solar at either Georgia or Alabama Power or at Southern Power. How are you thinking about the renewable supply chain? Because there’s been lots of discussion and commentary. One or Two of your peers have talked about supply chain becoming an issue for their non-regulated contracted solar business. I’m just curious what insights your team is getting in terms of the ability to procure things like panels or lithium-ion other, and the ability to actually install at the pace you’d like to install?\nDan Tucker: Yes. So Michael, this is Dan. So right now, we’re not in a big construction period. And so, we’re fortunate to not be experiencing as acutely as some of our peers right now, some of those plays. We’ve seen some. We are in the middle of the storage project out in California, we’ve seen some modest delays, but nothing that’s going to impact the project overall. That’s part of the supply chain and then really combined with I think how everyone is seeing the near-term markets is why we also have this ramp-up in our expectations for Southern Power. You heard me say we’ve allocated just the $250 million this year, $500 million the following year. And that’s really in recognition that there are projects actively on our radar screen today, and we’re a bit aspirational that those might come to fruition. But to the extent they don’t, I think what you’ll see us logically do is push those dollars out a little further in time and have opportunities later.\nTom Fanning: There’s another conversation I’ve been having in D.C., whether it’s Secretary Granholm, who’s been terrific or Dep Sec, David Turk who is a terrific. As a matter of national security, as a matter of economic opportunity, one of the things that we need to do as a the nation is resource these important supply chains domestically that will grow manufacturing, grow jobs, grow personal income. It’s a real winner. And I think some of the money that’s been put out in the incentives, whether it’s inside DOE right now or in the infrastructure bill elsewhere is to think about ways to promote the domestic supply of these things and really get it going. Now, when I say that, you’re talking five years from now. That isn’t going to happen immediately, but people are considering it. And I bet you, you would get broad bipartisan support for that strategy.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, Tom. Thanks, Dan.\nTom Fanning: You bet, Michael.\nOperator: And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks?\nTom Fanning: No. Thank you all for attending with us this afternoon. This is an important call. This is a frustrating time for us all. We were ready to go there, we thought kind of early this year. And now with this delay, it looks as if we’ll be end of the year for Unit 3. And we’ve allowed for an additional quarter, just given the uncertainty that we’ve seen in the past. We think these schedules align closer to what the staff and the commission has been kind of thinking about. But I can assure you we’re on the case. We all spend our time at the site. Those people are fixated on getting it right along our partners Bechtel. And when we build this thing, when we get it in service, we are right at the end of that process, it will be of the quality that is necessary in the United States nuclear industry. And we’re going to be proud of it for decades to come. Otherwise, the Company is performing as well as it possibly can, whether it’s our reliability, our resilience, our customer satisfaction, the way our employees feel, we were number one in military employer. Look, all of these data, they sound like kind of headlines and billboards and pablum. But I think they really speak to our dogma here at Southern that this is a company built to last, that these indicators are things that will prove that we are sustainable in our business model for years and years to come, and we’re very proud of that. And I want to thank all the thousands of employees at Southern for making that their part of their day, every day. It’s way beyond making, moving and selling. It’s all wound up and making sure that the communities we serve are better off because we’re there. We do that every day, and we will continue to do that. We look forward to getting the projects behind us and getting into 2024, and a financial position, the integrity of this company will be better than it ever has been, in my experience. So, thank you, and we’ll talk to you soon.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Southern Company fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tom Fanning",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. As you can see from the materials that we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted earnings per share for 2021, exceeding both our original 2021 guidance and the estimate that we provided on our third quarter call. This performance is due in no small part to our outstanding service territories and the unparalleled commitment of our employee to deliver clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to our customers. Our outstanding customer service, our commitment to the communities we serve and our proactive engagement with our stakeholders are reflected in the numerous honors we've highlighted in our slide deck, including recent recognition as number two in the nation on Forbes 2022 list of America's Best Large Employers. Many of the initiatives that support this distinction are reflected in our inaugural transformation report which we released earlier this week. This report details our sustained commitment and actions to further advance equity, both within our company and our communities. These commitments allow Southern Company to help lead change within our communities and provide an enduring reflection of our values. We are proud with the progress we have made and continue to recognize the opportunity to do more. As an example of the work we're doing to drive our customer satisfaction results, a meaningful portion of our capital plan in recent years has been allocated to the continued modernization of our electric grids. Our grid automation strategies and investments are delivering real value to customers. And in 2021, our customers experienced 15% fewer minutes of interruptions. Similar initiatives will continue to be a major component of our capital plans going forward. Across all of our stakeholder groups, including employees, customers, communities and investors, we're focused on sustainability and a long-term view of value. That objective remains sound. The long-term financial plan that we outlined for you last year remains intact. And we are reaffirming our 5% to 7% long-term growth rate expectation, consistent with adjusted earnings per share in a range of $4 to $4.30 in 2024. Let's now turn to an update regarding some of the recent developments related to our progress on Plant Vogtle units three and four. As you can see in the materials provided earlier today, we updated our expected completion timeline for both units, extending the in-service dates for each unit by three to six months. As we discussed on previous calls, the paper process is a critical aspect of turning plant components and systems over from construction to testing and operations. We have discovered incomplete and missing inspection records concerning much of the materials and equipment that have been installed at Unit 3. These inspection records are an important part of the documentation that is necessary to file ITAACs. Our progress on Unit 3 ITAAC has slowed as we address a backlog of tens of thousands of inspection records needing completion to support system turnovers. Through hard work over the last several weeks, we have reduced this backlog by more than 30%. Documentation within these inspection records is a critical aspect of getting it right and the time and resources to complete the remaining inspection records and remediate construction issues identified in the process, including the impact of borrowing Unit 4 resources are key drivers for the change in schedule. We have 123 ITAACs remaining for Unit 3. The revised ITAAC completion schedule we've included in our slide deck is consistent with a three-month change in the Unit 3 schedule. Over the past year, a number of challenges including shortcomings in construction and documentation quality have continued to emerge, adding to project timelines and cost. In recognition of the possibility for new challenges to emerge, we further risk adjusted our current forecast by establishing a range of three to six additional months for each unit. And we've reserved for the maximum amount. We continue to make meaningful progress on both units. Notably for Unit 3, all 157 fuel assemblies have been loaded into the spent fuel pool in preparation for fuel load. For Unit 4, direct construction is now approximately 92% complete, open vessel testing has started, and we recently completed the structural integrity and integrated leak rate tests without issue. The aforementioned challenges on Unit 3 are serving as lessons learned for Unit 4, and have benefited our performance on Unit 4 to date, relative to Unit 3. First time quality on both construction and documentation are key areas to focus. Our priority is bringing Vogtle Units 3 and 4 safely on line, and again to get it right, to provide Georgia with a reliable carbon-free energy resource for the next 60 to 80 years. With this most recent change in project costs and schedule, provisions in the Vogtle 3 and 4 co-owner agreement came to the forefront, requiring the owners to affirmatively vote to proceed with the project. Vogtle 3 and 4 is incredibly important to the state of Georgia and its robust growing economy. Furthermore, the addition of 2,000 megawatts of baseload carbon-free energy is vital to increasing the availability of net zero energy resources across the state. Considering the facts and our proximity to commercial operation, Georgia Power has already voted to proceed. The other owners are required to vote by March 8th, which allows time for them to work through their own governance processes. Consistent with the schedule extension of up to six months additional for each unit, Georgia Power's share of the total project capital cost forecast increased by $480 million largely as a function of time, additional resources to complete the remaining work with the unnecessary focus on quality construction and documentation and the replenishment of contingency. We continue working constructively with our co-owners to resolve different interpretations of the cost sharing agreement within expected potential range of outcomes of $100 million to $900 million. We have included $440 million of the $900 million in our total project cost estimates. In aggregate, Georgia Power's resulting total capital cost forecast is $920 million. And as a result, Georgia Power recorded an after tax charge of $686 million during the fourth quarter. We value our partners on Vogtle 3 and 4 and the relationship we've had with them across multiple assets for decades. We look forward to our continued partnership on each new unit as they transition to commercial operation, providing millions of Georgians with clean, safe, reliable and affordable electricity for decades to come. Before turning the call over to Dan for an update on our 2021 financial performance, and our long-term outlook, I'd like to briefly touch on Georgia Power's triennial Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP, which was filed with the Georgia Public Service Commission late last month. The proposed plan sets forth a proactive, innovative and transformational roadmap for how Georgia Power expects to support customers in its growing service territory for decades to come. Consistent with Southern Company's path to net zero carbon emissions, the plan describes a tangible path to transition Georgia Power's generating fleet to cleaner more economical resources. This plan includes retirement of all of the coal units, Georgia Power controls by 2028, except for Plant Bowen Units 3 and 4, which are scheduled to be retired no later than 2035. The plan also includes a request for the addition of 6,000 megawatts of renewable generation by 2035, more than doubling Georgia Power's current renewable resources. Additionally, 1,000 megawatts of storage is requested by 2030 to improve the capacity value of these intermittent resources. In recognition of the changing energy landscape, Georgia Power proposed innovative programs to promote reliability and resilience, including a distributed energy resource program. The comprehensive long-term plan also addresses continued investment in our transmission system and energy efficiency programs for customers. The IRP is subject to the review and approval of the Georgia Public Service Commission. Hearings will take place during the first half of 2021, with a final decision due this summer. Dan, I'll turn the call over now to you. Please take it away. Thanks, Dan. Southern Company strives to deliver superior risk-adjusted total shareholder returns, and I believe the plan that we've laid out supports that objective. Our customer and community-focused business model, our growing investments into our premier state-regulated utility franchises, the priority we place on credit quality and our commitment and actions towards net zero, all contribute towards making Southern Company a sustainable premier investment. A remarkable track record for dividends is another major contributor to that equation. For nearly three quarters of a century, we have paid a quarterly dividend that is equal to or greater than the previous quarter, including dividend increases in each of the past 20 years. As we look ahead, assuming adjusted earnings within our estimated range of $4 to $4.30 per share in 2024, a payout ratio that is expected to be at or below 70%, and a sustainable long-term adjusted EPS growth rate of 5% to 7%, we believe that once Vogtle 3 and 4 are completed, our Board will have the opportunity to consider an increase in the rate of growth of dividends, further solidifying our long-term value proposition. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. And Dan, one more point, I think, and please, I know you'll correct me if I get this wrong, but we've associated the cost with tender in this estimate. We have not given any credit for the value of megawatts tendered. At the high end of the estimate, the amount of megawatts tendered, if everybody tendered, maybe around 75 to 80 megawatts. At the level in which we've estimated, we think it could be around 30. And we've given no credit to any value associated with those megawatts. We've talked about this on prior calls, the fact that you may have megawatts that's going to be carbon-free, resilient for decades to come, we think it would have real value. We've reflected no value in any of these estimates. Yes. Julien, the way we would think about that is make them completely separate, okay? Well, the process is simple. By the contract that we entered into way back when, what was it, 2018, I guess, and I guess we signed it in early ‘19. But that kind of provision spoke to a potential outcome that was really onerous, like there was some cataclysmic problem, and we could all go our way. Our calculus was pretty simple. We are this close to loading fuel and ultimately getting Unit 3 on service and then ultimately Unit 4. To us, it was an easy decision to proceed. So, they could decide to proceed and separately they can tender. And the only other thing I'll add is that -- go ahead. The only other thing I will add, I think I've done this before in kind of private conversations with you all one-on-one. But, as you start thinking about retiring Vogtle -- I mean -- I'm sorry, Bowen 3 and 4, there creates a need in North Georgia. And we've talked about that further study is required in order to evaluate how you replace that? Is that going to be more solar? Is it going to be a combined cycle? Is it going to be importing megawatts from the south to the north and therefore, incremental transmission. We just haven't done all that work yet. Well, I think we demonstrated over the years that we're both -- in the world of M&A, we're both buyers and sellers. What we're always seeking to do is put assets in the hands of the best owner. That's just kind of our dogma, and I think we follow through on it. What's interesting about our gas properties is that they have been able to contribute like 10% earnings per share growth, primarily focused on safety-related pipeline replacement programs. Since the acquisition of what is now Southern Company Gas, we have well exceeded our expectations on the acquisition. So, in order to think about cap allocation, as you do and we think about it all the time, selling something like our asset in Illinois relative to reinvesting in the core, we always have to consider what's best for our long-term growth rate, what's best on a risk-adjusted basis. We'll continually do that. Yes. It would be purely a value play as opposed to a need. We're not aware of any reason that exists like that. Yes. Interestingly, I was just in Augusta visiting with Glen Chick, our -- I think he's just a superlative manager of the site, along with Steve Kuczynski. And we actually went through different systems, at this point, and we are trying, we are efforting to begin with the inspection report fixed with what we believe are the toughest, hardest issues to deal with. I can't guarantee that. But so far, with 30% complete, we haven't found a need for any of that comprehensive rework. Certainly, as we see things that aren't according to specs or per an inspection requirement, then we will fix it. But nothing comprehensive, as you're suggesting. Second question? NRC. Yes. Thanks, Jeremy. Hey. The NRC's posture, again, I think I say this pretty regularly. They're a very tough requiring regulator, but we think they do a great job. And that's the reason why the United States nuclear fleet is the envy of the world. Getting it right, as we so often say, will allow us to have an asset that will provide energy carbon-free, resilient for 60 to 80 years. So, we're all in on getting it right. The NRC, likewise, is their primary focus. In other words, they're not as concerned, I'm guessing, with schedule and cost. They want to make sure that whatever we build is as appropriate to nuclear safety standards as exist in America today. So, they support our efforts to find these things. And I think for the amount of ITACCs that we've already submitted, something like 275 or so, I think we've had very few problems with those ITACCs. That process has gone well, which says that once we get the work packages turned over and all the paper done in nuclear standard as it is supposed to be, we've had an enormous success rate in dealing with the NRC part of the equation. Yes. My conversations with kind of future nuclear technologies have really been more -- I haven't talked to the states at all. That really would be the realm of Mark Crosswhite in Alabama or Chris Womack in Georgia or Anthony Wilson in Mississippi. In my conversations with DOE, with folks in that or in the administration, I've had those conversations, too. In my opinion, I know other people are more bullish on SMRs than I am. But you still have to deal with enormous security issues. You still have to deal with kind of the NIMBY issues associated with nuclear. So, I've always felt that nuclear lends itself to scale, now. SMRs do absolutely have an important place in our nuclear future. My opinion, it would be in the niche areas like military bases. The military already does SMRs on submarines and aircraft carriers. So, it's easy to conceive SMRs showing up on big nuclear installations. So, it also provides them a degree of resilience. I get that. We have been -- and we participate in SMRs, you should know that. So, our nuclear team and our R&D team are involved in the SMR process. We've actually been asked to get involved in a significant way in SMRs and given -- I don't want to be distracted with anything other than getting Vogtle 3 and 4 done, we've really stayed away from that. On the other hand, we view great progress, potential with the so called Gen IV reactors, the molten chloride salts. We've worked with Bill Gates and his team on that. We are -- when you think about the R&D S curve, I think we've done a lot of work on the science, and I would call it the bench science of it and the very small kind of element of starting up that S curve. The next kind of big slugs of development on the Gen IV reactors will require hundreds of millions of dollars. I know I've talked to Secretary Granholm; Deputy Secretary, Turk, other folks that it would be great as the DOE is looking to put money to work, especially in the technology development area. This is a place where we could partner with the federal government and really move quickly up that S curve to make Gen IV reactors a commercial reality. In our own planning processes, they start to show up as an option, probably in the late 2030. So, let's say, 2035 to 2040. And as an economic matter, they tend to compete with CCS-controlled combined cycle technologies. So depending on how the technology and cost expectations evolve, you will see us either continue with combined cycles and capturing the carbon and sequestering it or pursuing new Gen 4 reactors. But again, that's an issue that's going to show up in the very late 2030s. Well, I think, the obvious difference between kind of what we're building at Vogtle and the so-called Gen IV reactors is this issue of the fuel and the core. Effectively, the Gen IV reactors have the characteristic that a meltdown is virtually impossible. And therefore, you need less containment structures and therefore less capital cost in order to put those units into play and have them be as safe as we expect them to be. That is the real big difference. It's a capital cost difference associated with how the reactors melt down characteristic could occur. Yes. Angie, I don't know we'd have to run the numbers down with you. Our own math would say, they're 92% contracted for about 10 years. And recall that we follow the same kind of rubric in contracting our assets as opposed to merchant players. In that, we don't take fuel risk. We earn a return on and return of capital and pass through the fuel and energy price. In fact, Angie, -- Angie, excuse me. I'll just give you one more data point. 95% contracted through 2026, 92% through 2031. That's the nerdy data. Yes. And thanks for that. This is my opinion I'm giving you as opposed to fact, I guess. But in my opinion, it is unquestionable. It is unreasonable to assume that COVID had no impact. And so, the real art of the deal is to figure out how much of that impact manifested itself. If you dial back on to those dark days when the first COVID thing hit and we were deciding whether to shut the project down or not, I think it's very clear that we had to operate under a completely different operating regime on the site. Remember, we stood up a medical village. We did all sorts of things in order to continue this very important project. We have estimates that we provided to Georgia Public Service Commission. I don't think we've updated those recently. But certainly, I think any reasonable person would say that there have been COVID impacts on the site. And I think we provided the chart in the appendix material, you can see even this most recent whatever this -- Omicron, it had an enormous spike in the December to January time frame. So, certainly, it had an impact. We saw it in -- especially over the holidays, we always expect to see more absenteeism and a variety of other things. We certainly saw it there as well. And let me hit one other kind of controversial point, but we watch this like hawks. Recall, at one time, we had 9,000 people on site. And there was a lot of concern was this somehow COVID hot bed. Well, in fact, the data shows that our COVID experience is just about similar to the surrounding communities. We don't have a different experience on the site than in the surrounding counties. Yes. But, Angie, most of the inflation sensitive stuff is already procured. Our supply chains are already spoken for all the major equipments there. I suppose there would be some labor. We're paying top decile right now. I suppose that could come up later, but it hasn't been a big effect now. Well, Dan's done a great job managing the cost structures of the system. Actually, Dan didn't have anything to do with it all, but people in the operating companies did. But, I'll tell you the big surprise. I said this on Squawk Box this morning and the data we've provided you, shows it. We beat our residential estimates by 2.7%. In other words, we were projecting that to be down, and it was actually up. And we think that that is due to a change in lifestyle. I think we budgeted as if we thought there was this return to work and therefore, we would see like a 2.2% reduction in residential sales because people are showing up at work. Well, in fact, our own data, if you look at Southern Company's experience, our old model was about 80% of the people came to work every day. I think -- and they were 20% that were virtual, probably call centers. Now, we're seeing about only 25% are here every day with about 50% hybrid. They're coming in and out a few days a week, some more, some less, and then about 25% virtual. What's interesting about that is the sales in the residential sector were sustained at a much higher level than what we thought. We thought they'd drop off. They actually increased a bit. That uplift really helped us this year. The customer growth has been awfully attractive for us, so over 50,000 on the electric side, what was it 27,000, something like that on the on the gas side. So, we continue to do that. And we think that is kind of a function too of people being able to work remotely. And so, they tend to go to places that have low input costs, attractive place to live. Our economic development data shows that as well. So, I think some of the stuff, Dan, you talked about in the script, it just looks good, particularly for Georgia, but even Alabama is coming back, and we're doing well. We have reason to be bullish about the long-term viability of our franchise. 100%, Steve. And I think I said this in media earlier, but it's true. I get up every morning throughout the day, in the middle of the night, think about Vogtle and what we can do and all that. And I was, the folks at the site have been particularly frustrated at this recent development. When we left you on the call and I guess it was late October, early November, everybody, the site too, was very bullish on the fact that man, here we go, we're getting ready to file for 103(g) and load fuel in the whole bit. And when we started getting into the final systems related to the final ITACC, so right, we've done 100 and -- I mean, we've done 275, we had 123 left. We had already done in order to complete these tests and a lot of this equipment is already operated within the testing regimes. We had done physical and visual inspections, but what we found when we got ready to turn over these systems for the paper, and important part of the paper are these inspection reports. And we found in many cases, they were just either incomplete or missing. Let me give you an example. But, this is an example. This is relevant. For every bolt in that plant theoretically, we would have to ascertain certificate the provenance of that bolt. In other words, we'd have to prove that we know that the metallurgy worked and where it came from and everything else to the extent an inspection report did not account for the provenance of a bolt, we had to either take the bolt out and put in the bolt that was certified or take the bolt out and test it to make sure that it met our standards. This is at the very end of the process for the very final equipment and systems that were related to the turnover before we filed for 103(g). This is at the tail end of the process. And when we found this out, we just had to go stop, we've got to do a complete review of all of these inspection reports. And that's what you see right now. I am frustrated about it, but it is something we have to do. We talk about this is the first plant we've constructed in 40 years. Well, this is the first nuclear documentation we've had to do in 40 years. I wish we had found it sooner. We just didn't. Strictly my opinion, and I was in the meeting with the President and all that. You know what's interesting, and I work with both sides of the aisle here. I think long term, both parties agree that we should do some something. I think the methods of doing something, especially in light of the inflation signals we are seeing and potentially the national security issues we are seeing right now lend themselves to nothing happening for the rest of the year. I wish it would. I don't think it will. No. I think there's a set you have to turn over in order to get to 103(g). And there could be some others in between 103(g) and loading fuel. Let me give you a little bit of kind of where we are. So on Unit 3, now I'm doing big hunky thing. There's a little less than 100 systems, 96 or so. You would split those into 162 subsystems, okay? So, there's 11 total to go. And since our last call, we've gotten 5 of those turnovers complete. If I think about what's remaining here, I would say that we have 3 to go for 103(g) and 6 to go on fuel load and 2 that we can complete after fuel load. They're not necessary to the nuclear safety side of things. Was that helpful? Yes. The 400 -- 444 was at 100% dollars, our share of that was 160. I don't know the stats of that. It didn't come up recently. So, I think it's still an open issue. Yes. We've not provided... Yes. We just haven't created an addition based on the latest Omicron effects. I mean, clearly, there were, we just haven't updated the estimate. So, that adds $920 million, $686 million is the after-tax portion. Yes. Paul, what you have to understand and back where we were in October, November, we're basically finishing the work, and what we found is the inspection reports were lacking. So, this work is ready to go. The table is set. Once we get the documentation done, we'll be ready to send those things in. We feel good about the schedule. It's not that we're finishing construction. Yes. No, I just mentioned like an example of some of the remediation that might have to be done in order to conform with an inspection report. So, there's other examples, but that's it. Over the life of the contract, the IRRs would be similar. And when you think about -- what we have said about the market broadly is that we've kind of pulled back on the market. This is kind of elsewhere in the United States because there was so much supply and the demand was waning and there was a lot of uncertainty. We saw the margins really getting tight and so we didn't play. But for the things we do that we ultimately will sign up for pretty consistent IRRs and pretty consistent ROEs. The ROEs typically are a wee bit better than what we would find in our regulated jurisdiction, reflective of a little bit of the higher risk. Yes. It's interesting stuff, man. When you look at the data, gas prices increased ‘21 versus ‘20, 92%, like we averaged, I think, $3.82 per million Btu versus $1.99 a year ago. So that's kind of a big deal. Now each of our jurisdictions have managed, I think, well, their unrecovered fuel balances. Georgia just got an increase, doesn't wipe it out completely, but it did really well. Alabama used some of its earnings otherwise in 2021 to completely wipe out its fuel balance. So, one of the things we are very mindful of -- and I appreciate the way you phrased the question. We are very mindful of burden to customers, and we manage that like hawks. I think we're in really good shape right now. Yes. Very interesting stuff. If you look at the data, we're seeing -- even our industrial numbers, I said this on Squawk today, while it will show that it looks like things are slowing down a bit on the industrial sales side, the momentum numbers would tell you that and potentially the first derivative. In fact, two of the segments that underperformed or decreased year-over-year were chemicals and paper, but the paper was newsprint had a big closure of a plant there. The chemicals was a -- chemical plant, caustic soda and chlorine, that closed as well. If you wipe away those two big plant closures, our industrial sales actually were better than what we expected again. So pretty good stuff. Now, it is very clear that inflation will eventually eat into the growth in the economy. I was kind of visiting with some of the Fed work and all that here recently, you're familiar with the old permanent income hypothesis. I think people have felt wealthier lately, and people are still spending as if inflation hasn't visited them yet. It is inconceivable though that that won't catch up at some point. You saw these hot retail sales. My sense is as inflation effects continue that those sales will start to wane. So, there will be a slowdown in the economy. Now, the real $50,000 question is, when does inflation start to recede a bit? A lot of stuff right now says that's a 2023 issue that we could start to see inflation getting back to a more normal level. I think the underlying presumption in that one is that the supply chain works itself out. Right now, we've had such an imbalance in supply and demand that prices invariably are high. And for the lead time to procure certain goods and services, it is really sticky right now. So, the big swings are supply chain unwinding and getting back to normal, people adjusting to higher prices and therefore, reduced spending and therefore, reduced heat in the economy. Those are all the factors that I think will go into this point. For now, the economy looks really good in the Southeast, but it's inconceivable to me that it won't slow down a bit over the next year or so. There's another conversation I've been having in D.C., whether it's Secretary Granholm, who's been terrific or Dep Sec, David Turk who is a terrific. As a matter of national security, as a matter of economic opportunity, one of the things that we need to do as a the nation is resource these important supply chains domestically that will grow manufacturing, grow jobs, grow personal income. It's a real winner. And I think some of the money that's been put out in the incentives, whether it's inside DOE right now or in the infrastructure bill elsewhere is to think about ways to promote the domestic supply of these things and really get it going. Now, when I say that, you're talking five years from now. That isn't going to happen immediately, but people are considering it. And I bet you, you would get broad bipartisan support for that strategy. You bet, Michael. No. Thank you all for attending with us this afternoon. This is an important call. This is a frustrating time for us all. We were ready to go there, we thought kind of early this year. And now with this delay, it looks as if we'll be end of the year for Unit 3. And we've allowed for an additional quarter, just given the uncertainty that we've seen in the past. We think these schedules align closer to what the staff and the commission has been kind of thinking about. But I can assure you we're on the case. We all spend our time at the site. Those people are fixated on getting it right along our partners Bechtel. And when we build this thing, when we get it in service, we are right at the end of that process, it will be of the quality that is necessary in the United States nuclear industry. And we're going to be proud of it for decades to come. Otherwise, the Company is performing as well as it possibly can, whether it's our reliability, our resilience, our customer satisfaction, the way our employees feel, we were number one in military employer. Look, all of these data, they sound like kind of headlines and billboards and pablum. But I think they really speak to our dogma here at Southern that this is a company built to last, that these indicators are things that will prove that we are sustainable in our business model for years and years to come, and we're very proud of that. And I want to thank all the thousands of employees at Southern for making that their part of their day, every day. It's way beyond making, moving and selling. It's all wound up and making sure that the communities we serve are better off because we're there. We do that every day, and we will continue to do that. We look forward to getting the projects behind us and getting into 2024, and a financial position, the integrity of this company will be better than it ever has been, in my experience. So, thank you, and we'll talk to you soon."

            "name": "Dan Tucker",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. All of our major subsidiaries had a strong 2021. As a result, our full year adjusted earnings were $3.41 per share, $0.16 higher than adjusted results in 2020 and $0.06 above the top end of our original 2021 guidance range. Financial performance for year was highlighted by strong customer growth, improving retail sales trends and continued investment in our state regulated utilities. These positive factors were partially offset by milder temperatures throughout 2021, resulting in a negative $0.05 variance for weather as compared to 2020 and a negative $0.14 variance compared to normal weather. Additionally, 2021 nonfuel O&M reflected the trend towards more normal operating conditions relative to the significantly reduced levels in 2020. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results compared to 2020 is included in today's release and earnings package. Weather-adjusted retail electricity sales were up 2.4% compared to 2020, approximately 1% better than our forecast for 2021. Almost all of this positive variance can be accounted for in residential electricity sales as a result of continued robust customer growth and an extension of the increased usage trends, which began in 2020. Residential sales outpaced our expectation for the year by 2.7%, reflecting what we think could represent a transition to sustained hybrid work practices across our service territories. We continue to analyze retail electricity sales relative to pre-pandemic levels. And in aggregate, in the fourth quarter, our weather-normalized retail electric sales exceeded sales in the fourth quarter of 2019. We are encouraged by these trends, and we'll continue to monitor the implications of supply chain constraints, labor force participation and inflation pressures on our outlook. Our stronger-than-expected customer growth is a trend that differentiates our service territories. Over the last two years, we've added an average of nearly 55,000 new residential electric customers and 30,000 residential natural gas customers across our regulated utilities. Average residential electric customer additions were 43% higher over the past two years than the average for the five years ended in 2019. Customer growth continues to be driven by a strong labor market recovery, and our Southeast territories are on track to reach pre-pandemic levels of employment later this year. Further supporting these trends, the economic development pipeline within our Southeast service territories remains robust. For example, the average number of job announcements was 22% higher and business investment in Georgia was 39% higher than average for the years leading up to the pandemic. Macro trends in e-commerce and electric transportation, combined with a diverse well-trained workforce and a low cost of living, have combined to drive major locations and expansions of distribution centers, data centers, manufacturing facilities and headquarters into our service territories. Turning now to our expectations for 2022. Our adjusted earnings guidance for the year is $3.50 to $3.60 per share. The $3.55 midpoint represents a growth rate of approximately 7.5% from the midpoint of our original 2021 guidance range. In the first quarter of 2022, we estimate that we will earn $0.90 per share. Included in our guidance is a more normalized assumption for retail electric sales growth of 0% to 1%, although a continuation of recent trends could deliver upside to that assumption. We continue to see long-term adjusted EPS growth in the range of 5% to 7%, consistent with adjusted earnings in a range of $4 to $4.30 per share in 2024. With 90% of total projected earnings over the five-year planning horizon coming from our state-regulated utilities, our expected EPS trajectory has a solid foundation. Additionally, our history of constructive regulation, strong credit ratings and disciplined O&M spending served to strengthen our outlook. Underlying our long-term adjusted EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% is a robust capital investment plan that continues to be driven by significant investment in our state-regulated businesses. Our base capital investment plan of approximately $41 billion, which excludes the capital required to complete Vogtle Units 3 and 4, supports our 2024 estimate for adjusted earnings per share of $4 to $4.30. This forecast represents a $2 billion increase in state-regulated utility investment for the common years 2022 through 2025 from our forecast a year ago. These increases in our forecast are the result of greater visibility into investments to upgrade our enterprise applications, serve major known customer expansions or additions, further improve our grid and protect our technology infrastructure as well as investments related to the transition of our fleet. We have long maintained a disciplined approach to capital forecasting within our state-regulated utility businesses. We don't use placeholders, and we don't include capital that isn't expected to earn our allowed returns. The result of this approach is that our forecast tend to grow, especially in the latter years as our visibility into customer growth increases, as regulatory processes unfold, as compliance obligations evolve and as our long-term system planning is refined. We fully expect this trend to continue, including in relation to Georgia Power's IRP. For example, neither the long-term hydro investment, nor the proposed company-owned energy storage systems are fully reflected in our forecast. Additionally, none of the renewable additions proposed in the IRP are included due to both their time frames and the potential for selecting purchased resources. Furthermore, we continue to believe Southern Power has significant opportunity to continue growing through investments to facilitate fleet transitions and the growth in clean energy infrastructure broadly across the United States. Southern Power's model has been distinctive since its beginning in the early 2000s, focused on long contracts with creditworthy counterparties and a risk-adjusted return profile that marries well with our overall value proposition. While we expect near-term opportunities to meet our criteria to be modest, we do believe opportunities will accelerate in future years. We have allocated up to $3 to Southern Power over the five-year plan, with approximately $250 million in 2022, $500 million in 2023 and $750 million annually for the remainder of the forecast. Again, these allocations of capital are not included in our base capital forecasts. In aggregate, our financial plan is anchored to our base capital forecast of $41 billion, and we believe upside potential exists in our state-regulated utility forecasts and our Southern Power allocation, representing spending of over $44 billion as part of our strategy to sustainably drive long-term growth in earnings and dividends. We also believe many of the same drivers for additional potential investment over the next five years could translate to investment opportunities beyond 2026 as we continue on our journey to net zero. And finally, we've included an updated three-year financing plan in the appendix to our slide deck today. This plan, which is consistent with our updated capital investment plans and the potential capital investment opportunities we've highlighted, continues to assume no equity need over our five-year plan horizon. Credit quality and strong investment-grade credit ratings remains a top priority. The expected improvement in our consolidated FFO to debt metrics equates to 200 to 300 -- a 200 to 300 basis-point increase from 2021 to 2022 levels by 2024. We've included a slide in the appendix to highlight some of the drivers for this expected improvement. Combined with the expected reduction in construction risk over the next 12 to 18 months, we believe we are well positioned to support our credit quality objectives. Tom, I'll turn the call back over to you. So, Julien, this is Dan. So, the $440 million, you absolutely hit it right. Within there is $180 million. That $180 million is consistent with provisions in our agreement with co-owners, where Georgia Power bears a fixed percentage of incremental cost up to a certain point. And so, that $180 million is the maximum amount of exposure under those provisions. Above the thresholds for those provisions is where this option to tender cost responsibility to Georgia Power kicks in. And that number embedded in $440 million is $260 million. So, what that represents is Georgia Power's assumption of bearing $260 million, said a different way, 100% of all the dollars above the threshold. So that $260 million represents -- their share is already captured in the $480 million. This is capturing the co-owners piece that is assumed in these numbers to be tendered. And what was the second part of your question, Julien? Yes. So, as we've disclosed and we talked about last quarter, there is differing interpretations in this co-owner agreement as to exactly how those provisions work and exactly what the starting point works. So, rather than air those specific differences here on the call, let's let those conversations take place in the proper form. But suffice it to say, the two differing points of view is the starting point for where the initial provisions kick in and how COVID costs ultimately adjust any cost before sharing. That's correct, Tom. And just to put a finer point on all this, Julien, we've included this $440 million, and that represents an estimate of an outcome. We do not, at this stage, have an agreement with our co-owners. We still have that difference of opinion. It's completely separate processes. Yes. That's right. And there's a 120-day to 180-day clock that we've disclosed in our 10-K as well that is really the time period to clarify tender or not. And the ultimate calculation, we alluded to megawatts, we alluded to dollars, all of that would not get buttoned up until Unit 4 was in service and all of the costs were known. Hey. James, this is Dan. So yes, there is transmission spend in there. In this forecast period for the five years, it is modest. Keep in mind that the plan includes retiring coal units in the ‘27, ‘28 time frame and then further again in 2035. So, the time line to construct and frankly, plan and permit these transmission projects is going to take the bulk of this forecast period and spending really occurs beyond. The other just detail, James, in the way you asked your question, I just want to make sure it's clear. There is some storage reflected in the capital forecast, but not -- it's a fraction of what has been assumed as a planning assumption in the IRP. It's the one project that Georgia Power is specifically asking for approval of is in our capital plan. Yes. And James, you made the point in your question. I mean, we don't have an identified equity need in the forecast, and we think our LDCs are a great property. They have to go through different processes, James. Yes. And importantly, Angie, so in front of the Georgia Public Service Commission, as part of the IRP, the vast majority of the gas PPAs that are in front of them for approval are Southern Power gas plants. And so, that's going to extend those units coverage for another 10 years. Yes. And I would just say in terms of this most recent cost increase, it's certainly not the driver. It's not a major driver. But Tom's point, it's logically an element of what's going on. But it's fair to say, like everyone is, with every wave, with every impact, we are getting better at working in this environment, and it becomes increasingly less disruptive and thus less of a cost impact. And just as you look at our forecast, look, we certainly haven't assumed that that continues into the future because one year doesn't make a trend, but we reasonably believe it might. So if you look at our forecast for residential sales for 2022, it actually reflects year-over-year negative. And that's, frankly, mitigated by assumption of strong customer growth. So, to your point, Angie, there's certainly upside even in 2022 if we see these trends continue. Yes. And there was some degree of estimating future impacts in the original number, and I think it's been consistent with that. Yes. And so, you typically see us disclose it as 160 to 200, that's our share. The 440 is 100% dollars. And just to be clear, no change reflected in VCM 26. Correct. Yes. Those are pretax, Paul. Those are pretax. Yes. If you look at our deck on slide 6, there's $920 million listed there. That's pretax. Total after tax for that is $686 million, and then we've broken down the components. But all those -- all that breakdown is pretax. I think the short answer, Paul, is no material change. These are market contracts. So, all of these contracts are being awarded to Southern Power under a competitive RFP process. And so, it's going to reflect the current market for those senior contracts. Yes. So, again, we -- I think I said in my prepared remarks, Paul, that we don't see a need for equity in this five-year outlook. So, let me just hit that a little more broadly because I think it's important. But absolutely, nothing has changed about our near-term or long-term objectives when it comes to credit quality. We've said kind of the last several months that as we move closer to completion of the project, any change in the cost or schedule will evaluate to see if equity is needed, essentially because we are getting so close to the end and because of all the proactive things that we did in response to other changes, and frankly, we did a little bit more than what was needed. So that has positioned us really well. And I want to also emphasize the improvement in the metrics that comes later on. I think we put a slide in the appendix that shows some of the component of the uplift in FFO that will occur in a ‘23, ‘24 time frame. That also is near enough in time horizon to give us comfort with our overall financial profile. Yes. So Michael, this is Dan. So right now, we're not in a big construction period. And so, we're fortunate to not be experiencing as acutely as some of our peers right now, some of those plays. We've seen some. We are in the middle of the storage project out in California, we've seen some modest delays, but nothing that's going to impact the project overall. That's part of the supply chain and then really combined with I think how everyone is seeing the near-term markets is why we also have this ramp-up in our expectations for Southern Power. You heard me say we've allocated just the $250 million this year, $500 million the following year. And that's really in recognition that there are projects actively on our radar screen today, and we're a bit aspirational that those might come to fruition. But to the extent they don't, I think what you'll see us logically do is push those dollars out a little further in time and have opportunities later."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Southern Company's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Investor Relations Director. Please go ahead, sir.\nScott Gammill: Good afternoon and welcome to Southern Company's third quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company, and Dan Tucker Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you that we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K Form 10-Q and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure, are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor. southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.\nTom Fanning: Thank you, Scott. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. As you can see from the materials released this morning, we reported strong adjusted results for the Third Quarter. The economies in our service territories continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. And in particular, customer growth continues to exceed our expectations. Given results through September, we expect full-year adjusted earnings per share to be above the top end of our guidance range. Dan will share more on this in a moment. So let's begin with an update on Vogtle Units 3 and 4. 2 weeks ago, we updated our expected completion timeline for both units, extending the in-service dates by 3 months. For Unit 3, following the completion of hot functional testing, we completed walk down of the 158 safety-related rooms within the nuclear island to assess the extent of remediation work required, consistent with the electrical installation quality issues we highlighted earlier this year, The number of instances of items needing remediation found during our full assessment process, however, exceeded our estimate from July. The change in the Unit 3 schedule into the third quarter of 2022 is primarily a function of the time needed to address the full scope of the remaining remediation work and to account for the impacts on productivity resulting from higher than expected attrition and slower than expected on-boarding of new electricians, field engineers, and supervisors. For Unit 4, recent progress has slowed. that's craft labor, and support resources have been temporarily shifted to support Unit 3's concert -- completion efforts. Considering this decrease in available resources over the next several months, plus recent productivity trends, we now expect Unit 4 in-service during the second quarter of 2023. Importantly, with the corrective actions beside is implemented after discovery of the Unit 3 quality issues, including reinforcement of the importance of first time quality with craft personnel, and improvements to the application of Bechtel's quality program. we believe that as we turn systems over on Unit 4, the amount of remediation work required will be less than what we experienced on Unit 3. During the third quarter, consistent with the surrounding areas, the site experienced a spike in COVID-19 cases that approached the peak of cases we experienced early in 2021. While the availability of vaccines and well-established protocols helped preclude the same degree of disruption experienced during the first wave of COVID-19, the pandemic was certainly a contributing factor to overall productivity and resource availability. For Unit 3, repairs to the spent fuel pool, system turnovers and ITAAC submittals continued throughout the third quarter. Repairs to the spent fuel pool are now complete. And the next major milestone for Unit 3 will be the receipt of the 103 G letter from the NRC. To-date, 242 ITAAC have been submitted to the NRC with 156 remaining. On Slide 7 of today's earnings call deck, we have included a forecast of the remaining ITAAC submittals required to support a projected May 2022 fuel load and third quarter 2022 projected in service date. Now, considering our recent volume of ITAAC of metals in October, and the expected completion and turnover of significant systems in the months ahead, the site is targeting ITAAC completion earlier than what is indicated in this forecast, which would provide margin to Unit 3's remaining schedule. We expect to use the time between ITAAC completion and fuel load to finalize the non-safety-related elements of the plant, and to complete any remaining pre -fuel load testing. Turning now to Unit 4, direct construction is now approximately 89% complete. A revised projected in service date of the second quarter 2023, reflects the temporary shift of services to Unit 3. Recent productivity trends on bulk electrical work and ongoing efforts to add craft labor and non-manual field support resources in support of first-time quality and productivity. Construction completion for Unit 4 has averaged 1.4% per month since the start of the year. To achieve a second quarter 2023 in service date, we estimate that Unit 4 we'd need to average approximately 1%, construction completion per month through the end of 2022. From a cost perspective, Georgia Power share of the total project capital cost forecast, increased by $264 million, largely driven by our updated schedule, productivity consistent with recent trends, the cost of additional resources to complete the full score for remaining work with necessary focus on quality and the replenishment of contingency. As a result, Georgia Power recorded an after-tax charge of $197 million during the third quarter. We remain committed to the credit quality of Georgia Power and Southern Company, And we will continue to seek, to maintain strong credit metrics for both entities. Our priority is bringing Vogtle Units 3 and 4 safely online to provide Georgia with a reliable, carbon-free energy resource for the next 60 to 80 years. We're committed to taking the time to get it right. And we will not sacrifice safety or quality to meet schedule. At Unit 3, we are working to submit remaining ITAAC to support receipt of the 103 G letter prior to fuel load and commercial operations in 2022. For Unit 4, we remain focused on attracting and retaining necessary craft, labor, and support resources, as well as first-time quality as we work to increase productivity and progress towards the start of open vessel testing, which is now projected by the second quarter of 2022. Dan, I will turn the call over now to you for an update on the financial.\nDrew Evans: Thanks, Tom. And good afternoon, everyone. As you can see from the materials, we released this morning, all of our major subsidiaries had a solid quarter and our adjusted consolidated earnings are trending extremely well through the third quarter. For the third quarter of 2021, we reported earnings per share of a $1.23 on an adjusted basis, $0.01 higher than both our estimate for the quarter and our adjusted third quarter of 2020 earnings per share. For the 9 months ended September 30th, 2021, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.05 compared with adjusted earnings-per-share of $2.78 for the same period in 2020. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results is included in this morning's release and earnings package. Major drivers for our adjusted earnings results for the third quarter of 2021 included higher retail kilowatt hour sales at our state regulated utilities, as we continue to see recovery from the pandemic, strong customer growth and impacts of several constructive regulatory outcomes, partially offsetting these impacts, non-fuel O&M reflects the trend towards more normal operating conditions relative to 2020 milder than normal summer temperatures in the Southeast also negatively impacted earnings per share by $0.02 compared to our estimate and by $0.07 compared to the third quarter of 2020. Turning now to customer growth through September, we have added over 40,000 new residential electric customers and over 20,000 residential natural gas customers across our regulated utilities. This level of customer growth has exceeded our forecast year-to-date and puts us on track to surpass last year's customer growth levels, which were also above historical norms. Customer growth continues to be driven by a strong labor market recovery, which is on track to reach pre -pandemic levels of employment in our Southeast service territory next year. For the third quarter, weather-adjusted retail electric sales were up 3% compared to last year and were in line with our expectations. Residential sales remained higher than expected due to extended remote work practices and commercial sales showed continued improvement coming in slightly better than our forecast. Industrial electricity usage lagged other customer groups, primarily driven by production cuts from a single large customer in the chemical segment [Indiscernible] this customer specific event, industrial sales have been in line with our forecast for the quarter. We continue to analyze retail sales and an aggregate through the third quarter our retail sales have essentially recovered to 2019 pre -pandemic levels. We are encouraged by these positive signals while we also continue to monitor the potential impact of COVID-19 variant, supply chain constraints, and labor force participation. The economic development pipeline in Southeast remains robust. Job announcements and business investment in Georgia in the third quarter 2021 were higher than pre -pandemic levels for 2019 and the average of 5 years ending 2020. In Georgia alone, there are currently over 200 active projects with the potential to bring in nearly 40,000 jobs and $13 billion in capital investment in the coming years. Next, I'd like to provide you with an update on our outlook for the remainder of 2021 with adjusted earnings per share through September of $3.05, we expect to achieve adjusted full-year earnings above the top end of our guidance range of $3.35 per share. Our estimate for the fourth quarter is $0.35 per share, which implies an estimated full-year results of $3.40 on an adjusted basis. Before turning the call back over to Tom, I'd like to follow-up briefly on Tom's update on BOPIS 3 and 4. First, I want to reiterate our commitment to credit quality, which has been constant. In our last call, we reinforced that commitment by announcing we would turn on our dividend reinvestment plans in the near future. As we have done so well over the last several years, we also continue to evaluate opportunities for asset sales. Within a portfolio the size of Southern Company, we have several investments which warrant continuous review for whether or not a better owner exists. Whether such potential transactions serve to offset our near-term equity needs or ultimately fund our long-term capital investment plans, we will remain disciplined to the benefit of equity holders and bond holders alike, as we execute our financing plans. And finally, let me briefly highlight the Vogtle Units 3 rate adjustments, stipulation that was unanimously approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission on Tuesday. consistent with the framework the PSC established with our order for the 17th VCM Process. This most recent order allows $2.1 billion of investment in Vogtle Unit 3 and the Vogtle Units, 3 and 4 common facilities to be moved from the Nuclear Construction Cost Recovery tariff or NCCR, into retail rate base the month after Unit 3 goes into service, where it will learn Georgia Power 's full allowed rate of return. Additionally, Georgia Power will be allowed to recover the related operating expenses and depreciation on this portion of Unit 3, which is an important credit supportive aspect of the stipulation. The entire process which struck an appropriate balance for all stakeholders, was a great affirmation of the constructive Georgia regulatory environment. Tom, I'll now turn the call back over to you.\nTom Fanning: Thanks Dan. Let me wrap up with an update on the Southeastern Energy Exchange Market or SEEM and our fleet transition Subject to resolution of any rehearing request, SEEM is moving forward after clearing the approval process. SEEM is region-wide automated into our platform, consisting of nearly 20 entities across 11 states, with the goal of more efficient bilateral trading in the Southeast. It is not an energy imbalance market or an RTO Benefiting from robust integrated planning by the individual states, municipalities, and utilities, the region represented by SEEM members scores very favorably on all important metrics compared to the RTOs across the country. SEEM will improve electric service to customers in the Southeast, a reason that is already an industry leader for customer satisfaction and reliability. The members of SEEM electricity market also provide low retail prices for residential and business customers using a mix of carbon-free energy resources similar to the rest of the country. We believe SEEM is good for our customers, and we're excited to be a part of this new platform, which is expected to launch in mid 2022. Turning now to our fleet transition. In our most recent climate report named Implementation and Action Towards Net 0, we reaffirmed our long-term goal of achieving net 0 greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. As an important step in the transition of our fleet, earlier this month Alabama Power and Georgia Power filed plans with their respective state environmental authorities detailing how each would comply with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Effluent Limitation Guidelines. With these expected changes and the recent retirement announcement of two coal units at Mississippi Power's plant, Daniel, since 2007, Southern Company will have announced total decreases in its coal-generating capacity from more than 20,000 megawatts, across nearly 70 generating unit to less than 4,500 megawatts of coal capacity, remaining at 8 generating units. This equates to a reduction of nearly 80%. The final resolution for many of the actions outlined in the [Indiscernible] compliance filings, including the exact timing of retirements and any other actions we may recommend remains subject to the approval of our state public service commissions through the integrated resource planning processes or IRP. These proceedings are intended to comprehensively address transmission and generation resource needs over the long term, which could include additional decisions regarding the future of the remaining coal unit. As always, part of our planning process for transitioning these units will include placing a high priority on protecting the interest of our employees and the communities we are privileged to serve. The transition of our generating fleet and the important regulatory proceedings that will play out over the next 9 months, will significantly inform our capital investment opportunities. As we always do, we will update our capital investment plans during our fourth quarter earnings call early next year, which will include known fleet transition opportunities. It is likely that further transparency on our long-term capital plan will unfold through out 2022 and we will update our forecasts as appropriately. Importantly, our current 2024 earnings-per-share base of $4 to $4.30 is based upon our current 5-year capital plan with potential incremental investments, providing the opportunity to strengthen our position, both within that 2024 range and within our 5 to 7% long-term growth range. Now, before we move to the Q&A portion which we always love here, this just came across the wires. Next week is Veterans Day and a publication that I'm sure you all know well, Military Times, came out with their Best for Vets ranking of employers. And we've typically been on the list that shows the top 15 companies across America and it include well-known companies like Bank of America, Booz Allen Hamilton, The Hilton Group, Johnson & Johnson and others. They just have named Southern Company the number 1 Company in America that's best for vets. That included evaluations of recruiting practices, retention, and support programs and a higher emphasis on employers who provide assistance and flexibility for individuals and the guard and reserves. We certainly respect the contribution that these folks make. They are a significant part of our employment base, I think amounting to over 11% of employee today. We respect their service and we want to make sure that they have the best work environment that they could have. We are honored beyond belief to be named the number 1 Company in America, Best for Vets, as named by the Military Times. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. You will hear a 3-tone prompt to acknowledge your request. [Operator Instructions] One moment, please for our first question. Our first question comes from Shar Pourreza with, Guggenheim. Please, go ahead.\nShar Pourreza: Hey guys.\nDrew Evans: Hello Shar, thanks for joining.\nShar Pourreza: Excellent. Dan nice to hear your voice. But just a couple of quick questions here. Tom, a lot of investors are hoping to hear more about your [Indiscernible] capex opportunities at EEI next week, especially kind of with your Georgia and Alabama IRP next year. Can you remind us of some of the types and size of the incremental capex we could see when you roll the capex plans forward next February. Maybe offer some ballpark figures to help frame the opportunity set as you shut down coal, how you'll finance it, what the impact the rates could be, I mean I understand things will shift between now and then, but any comment would be great.\nTom Fanning: Yeah. Sure. I hate to disappoint you. We're not going to say very much next week. Suffice to say that beat plan and to approve by the public service commissions will have an impact on capex. We always provide that update in our call. I guess it will be the end of January or early February, about our fourth quarter results and total year results. So we will certainly do that then. I think as I said, to the extent there are impacts, the current capital forecast formulated our range in 2022, $4 to $4.30. To the extent there is an increase in capex, certainly that strengthens our place within that range and the longer term, 5% to 7% growth rate. The other thing that we should remember about rates is that as you retire coal, you free up a whole lot of O&M. We intend to use that O&M to basically, allow for cost recovery, account for the incremental revenue requirements associated with new generation that will replace that and keep rates as low as possible for our customers.\nDrew Evans: And so just a reminder what Tom such as prepared remarks is the $4 -- $4 to $4.30 on 2024 is predicated on our current capex plan. And I think the way to think about these incremental opportunities as it will potentially increase or intensify, overcome. I mean, you said postpone growth. I think that is the point in time when we really begin to see tangible long-term increases to that profile from $8 billion a year to something more.\nTom Fanning: And one last point there, one of the benefits of our integrated resource planning processes, is we get to optimize portfolios, not only on generation, but also transmission. So transmission could be a benefit there. The other one you should keep in mind is we currently -- we said this in other calls. We currently allow for about 500 million a year of cap allocation to things like Southern Power. None of those allocations are included in our forecast. And it would stand to reason that as the U.S. transitions its generating fleet, there will be more opportunities for Southern Power in that regard.\nDrew Evans: And just on the transmission Shar and the reason we're being a little hesitant to share too early, well, there's transmission opportunities associated with what we will retire. The other transmission opportunities come about with what we replaced that with and where, and that is simply a function of our integrated planning processes and we just need to let those play off.\nTom Fanning: But it's a good thing for us. Good thing for our customers we get to iterate around those choices. You don't get that opportunity in the organized markets.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. Thank you for that and I know lastly for me, I know there's a lot of focus on exactly which month in the three will be in service next year, but I'm a little bit more interested, on what happens once it's online. So once you get three comes online, how should we think about what that means for earnings and cash flows in light of the TSC proven that joint settlement with the staff this required I know there's a lot of moving parts with the NCCR AFDC. The penalty ROE, but just really at a high level, what are the immediate impacts to cash flows and earnings following Unit 3 reaching the service. Thanks guys.\nTom Fanning: Yes, absolutely. So let's just make the assumption for the sake of describing all this chart that the third quarter means September of 2022. So given the results at the Georgia Public Service Commission earlier this week, that will mean that rates will go into place for $2.1 billion of Unit 3 in the comm facilities, earning Georgia Power's full cost of capital. If you think about it, relative to what we're earning today, that's going to add about a third of a sense of EPS for every month, for October, November, and December relative to what you would have forecasted under current conditions it's about a third of a penny per month. The\nDrew Evans: Important thing is that $2.1 billion is not the full cost of Unit 3 and the common facilities, what remains will remain earning a return under NCCR, or will be deferred for future recovery with the Commission. And at the same time, we will be recovering currently, the operating costs of Unit 3 and the depreciation, at least the associated with a $2.1 billion.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. That was super helpful. Thanks, guys. I appreciate the great execution.\nDrew Evans: Thanks, Sir.\nTom Fanning: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nTom Fanning: Hey Julien, how are you?\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: A quite well thanks, Tom. Pleasure, clinical team congrats Dan to o. Let's just dive right in on the asset sale for the year. You obviously made some pretty interesting comments some moment ago. Just wanted to clarify there is you think about regulated versus perhaps some of the other assets you own that Southern Power or otherwise, what exactly are you thinking about there and then more importantly, what equity need are you kind of thinking about here? Obviously, it's not -- it doesn't seem as least as explicitly stated to substantive here. But can you talk about how you're thinking about equity needs, especially considering some of the prospective capex you alluded to. I expect that feeds into this commentary on asset sales to.\nTom Fanning: Yes, sure. As always, Dan speak to the equity needs. I'll go back to the litany on M&A that I always do. I think we've demonstrated in the past whether we're buying or selling, that we always seek to put assets with the best owner. Our formulation for that is the old rubric, value is a function of risk and return. And so we have ideas right now, we really don't want to front run in the public what those ideas are, about assets where there may be better owners. We'll see whether they come to fruition or not. Certainly as they do, we will keep you updated, but we are looking over our list of things and we'll see. Dan, you want to speak to the equity needs?\nDrew Evans: Yes absolutely. So Julien, essentially, what we're addressing is only the impact of the recent Vogtle cost increases. So to the extent that that has an impact on our credit profile, we're committed to mitigating that. Whether that's turning our drip on or finding opportunities with these asset sales. Beyond that, we still see a long-term plan, even in light of the incremental capex opportunities that we're alluding to where we don't need incremental equity. I think it's important to point towards a post Vogtle kind of forecast period. And our credit metrics out there are about 200 basis points for FFO to debt higher than they are today. And that's a position of strength for us and gives us a lot of flexibility as to how we finance our group. And I just want to clarify, just back on source question that I said 1/3 of a cent per month. It's 2/3 of a cent per month, I just want make sure that's clear.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: 2/3 a cent.\nDrew Evans: Yeah.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it.\nTom Fanning: Okay. Yeah. And to be very clear to o, I'm trying to be less elliptical on what we're looking at. But you should assume, as we have moved here to be, what is it, 95% of our earnings are integrated regulated kind of earnings that it would contribute to that profile. In other words, we're not going to buy ourselves things which make ourselves more risky. I think we love the idea of reasonable turn and low risk. And also as you have seen in the past years or since I've been here. As we have bought say for example, AGL Resources now Southern Company Gas, there had been things around the edges that have allowed us to simplify and de -risk our business. So think about those things and we'll see how it goes.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. And then just coming back to Unit floor, obviously, you made some comments a moment ago about some of the labor availability, etc. and remediation work. I mean, how do you get comfortable with the nine month time gap between those two units in service date. But I'm just calling out that staffing stated at to various points about sort of the concerns that they have, on the second unit and service.\nTom Fanning: Yeah. Julian. Yes. Thanks for that. It's an important point to raise as has the ties at both ebbs and flows here. Let me explain that a little bit. We believe that Bechtel has had the responsibility to attract skilled personnel, skilled craftwork, especially electrician engineers, to assess the work that's being done and field site personnel, supervisory personnel to oversee the work that's going on. We have not kept pace with the requirements to advance these units in terms of attracting the people, and you named the reason why we've had more attrition. I think certainly the amount of attrition is potentially associated with the COVID response and everything else. So we've had to do a couple of different things. We have said in the past that we were moving to de -link the progress at Unit 4 from Unit 3. And so therefore, this 12-month margin didn't matter. One of the way that we serve to continue to advance Unit 3, was again to borrow personnel from Unit 4. So we didn't really want to do that, but it was a necessary move to continue to advance the work at Unit 3. Now, as we finish that work, we will send those people back to Unit four. And once again, they will be de -linked. But for the period of time in which we have borrowed personnel from 4 to 3, a delay in 3 means a delay in 4. And so that has happened. The other thing that we have done is to augment back fills, sourcing efforts with our own efforts. We've had a very deep engineering and construction services group in Birmingham, our own resources that we could attract personnel and so we have significantly augmented Bechtel's efforts to increase the flow of people necessary to promote skilled labor, electricians and field supervisory personnel. All of those things are in progress. All of those things are consistent with the new schedules we've given you. And I will say one more thing. There was a lot of conversation about this. I can tell you, Chris Womack and I in particular, we're really watching the trends. If I just looked at current data, we still have margin 6 weeks or so to Unit 3, 3 months or so to Unit 4 on the existing not extended schedules. We looked at the trends, however, and the trends to me we're troubling. And so we all kind of step back and said, I would rather take the conservative posture of evaluating these trends and adding more time, because frankly we didn't believe that we had 6 months of scheduled margin left on 3, and 3 months of scheduled margin left on 4. And we could've quibble on adding a month or 2 months. We said, let's go ahead and add a quarter for both. And that's where we came out on this decision.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. So it's not so much the 9 months necessarily. It's that you're adding a quarter of both of those latitude with in both schedule. If I'm hearing you right.\nTom Fanning: Yeah. And this idea of there's got to be 12 months, they're in fact -- the only time they are linked is when we borrowed from 4 to 3. Therefore, a delay in 3 causes a delay in 4. Once we get 3 back into its place, then we are able to send the people back to 4 and again, they are de -linked. The 9 month difference between the 2 does not trouble us.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Okay. I'll leave it there. Thank you guys. Best of luck. Hear from me soon me.\nTom Fanning: Thanks. Appreciate you calling in.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteve Fleishman: Great. Good afternoon, Tom. Likewise. Dan, nice to have you CFO. So just first on the maybe Tom just on the Vogtle schedule. I know you don't want to speak for staff the commission, but just with this latest update in the way that you're giving schedules now, is there a better chance that, they'll match up closer to what you are saying when they come out in a few weeks on this or should we be prepared for something that's again different than what you're saying.\nTom Fanning: Yes. Steve, you kind of gave me the answer before I answered and that is I don't want to speak for staff. Dr. Jacob is a guy that I know well. He attends the same meetings we attend, he sees the same stuff we see. He's a really bright guy. I think if I had to highlight something that will come under some discussion and I think it's absolutely correct, you want to look at schedule variability at this point. We believe we see a pretty clear track to receiving the 103 G letter, which allows us to load nuclear fuel, allows us to go hot on the site. There is a certain amount of work that will occur between the receipt of the letter and the actual loading of nuclear fuel. In my opinion, that work that is from 103G receipt to loading the fuel is probably the remaining biggest risk to schedule that remains on Unit 3. Recall in the script, we talked about finding more remediation. And I know in some other media, we've talked about these items. None of them being deal killers and all and stuff, but there's no such thing as a little issue in nuclear. Everything we take seriously. Everything must be done effectively with perfection. And so it is that time that we're looking at right now that I would say to you is probably the shared view of Dr. Jacobs in particular and us, as the biggest risk to schedule that remain, right now, our assessment of that work, if we get the 103 g letter early let's say January, then I'm going to guess, and this is just a guess on my part, so don't hold me to it. But I'm going to guess there maybe six weeks of work left from receipt of the letter to the actual loading of the fuel. If the 103 G letter is delayed, then that 6 weeks reduces because this is work that can be done in parallel with, some of the other stuff that's required to get 103 G. Remember we've talked about 3 buckets of work that we identified post HFT. One bucket deals with the issues we identified during a hot functional test. The second deals with remediation that frankly has increased since we passed the 103 G letter and really was subsequent to the July call we had with you guys. The last bucket really dealt with human performance systems, HVAC, signage a variety of other things. That work margin is bigger, let me just say it again. If we get received a 103 G early let's say at January I mean who knows. It could be as much as 6 weeks. If we get 103 G later, that work time will shrink to 2 weeks or something. We'll see. See that's where I think you will see a lot of discussion between us and the commission.\nDrew Evans: Let me just add real quickly to Tom's comments. The nature of the risk for that work Coast 103G up to fuel load is really logistics. So once we receive 103G, the site becomes an operating nuclear site. So the logistics of getting people to ingress and egress a personnel to do the remaining work is just friction on productivity and that's really the nature of that risk.\nTom Fanning: That was helpful.\nSteve Fleishman: Clear that was very helpful. And Dan going back to the question before about trying to kind of size the potential equity needs or asset sale, target need. You said just look at the what's the cost increases have been is that it's a simple as that or are you targeting any different metrics as well? And then you had prior to that?\nDrew Evans: Yes. Look, Steve, if you want to make an assumption in your model that our opportunity to do that is the size of the after-tax write-offs, that's a reasonable assumption. That said, we're looking across multiple opportunities. We will see what that looks like. More importantly, from a long-term perspective, that uplift in the credit metrics that we talked about is really what is key. We always take a long-term view on this stuff and I'm very comfortable with how we're positioned long term and there's not a need for anything or significant than those near-term charges that we've taken to earn.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And you haven't --\nTom Fanning: Go ahead, Steve. Go ahead.\nSteve Fleishman: No, I'm just -- you haven't given a number on what the DRIP equity that you said you turn the DRIP on. Did you --\nDrew Evans: We have. Yes, we have. So we've not turned it on, we're holding that as an option to see what, if anything, becomes of any asset sale opportunities and we'll do one or the other. The DRIP on an annual basis equals about $400 million worth of equity.\nTom Fanning: And you're in a prior call you kind of said was we thought the drip and one year without the last issue. This is another roughly $200 million. So let's see what the review of our asset sales are, and we'll figure out where we go on the issuance of new shares under the drip. Please assure if we can find a better solution than issuing shares under the drip will do it.\nSteve Fleishman: Right. And I guess to degree that there might be some, incremental growth opportunities in the Capital plan as you go through IRP transition, etc., asset sales could help fund that part too.\nTom Fanning: Yes. I think good and as Dan indicated from -- if you look at the capex forecast, most likely the capex opportunity associated with the transition of the fleet will occur in the back part of that capex forecast.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. Where our credit metrics will be [Indiscernible] Okay. Thank you.\nTom Fanning: Thank you, Steve.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nTom Fanning: Hey Jeremy, how are you?\nJeremy Tonet: Good, Thanks for having me. Just wanted to come back to Vogtle. If I could here. Just wanted to see if you could provide some incremental color on labor market impacts here and just as I'm thinking, how much just costs go up per month delayed at this point, just this prior increased seems a bit larger then I would've thought.\nDrew Evans: Jeremy the way to think about it, this is really been what has occurred both in the Second quarter and this most recent announcement here in the third quarter, the cost increases has really been a function of two things. One is the schedule itself, and that's kind of that notion of hotel load that we talked about. And for Unit 3, that is $35 million a month I believe and for Unit 4, $25 million a month and $15 million a month for Unit 4. So for every month reaching if that's just the infrastructure that supports construction in the cost of that. With this most recent increase and again, much like the second quarter increase, it also came with new assumptions on the number of personnel necessary to complete the work, and so that's where that incremental cost is coming from both increases really represented about, half pure schedule or hotel costs. And then the other half, personnel and productivity assumptions to complete the work.\nTom Fanning: Yes. And I would be remiss if we didn't had the idea that in sourcing all of these personnel in the skilled labor. Sean McGarvey and his team at the building trades has been fabulous. The IBEW in particular has been great, they've given us tremendous ongoing support. And I think our relationship with them is really bearing fruit here as we augment that builds efforts.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it, that's helpful. Thank you for that. And maybe just shifting towards the DC for a minute here if I could. Obviously, things are fluid here, but just want to see as things stand right now, what are your biggest takeaways from the federal infrastructure legislation? And when thinking about minimum taxes, well, I guess how do you think some of the gives and takes as it relates to Southern?\nTom Fanning: Jeremy calling the situation in Washington, fluid is a bit like calling the Grand Canyon a crack. I will say this, that there's lots of good stuff in the infrastructure bill and in the reconciliation bill that help us. They are shaped mostly as incentives. And we think that incentives are the way to go. We're particularly interested in anything that as we go through this transition of the fleet and transmission to a net 0 future that we keep prices as low as possible, To help our energy resource in a worldwide competitive market to keep it -- to keep America in a very strong position to compete for new loads and manufacturing and a variety of other things, it is important for the nation. It is important for our customers to keep prices low and to provide incentives to do that, that's kind of thing 1. Thing 2, Dan can correct me here or whatever, but we've looked at this minimum tax proposal. And we think it doesn't have that much of an impact to us maybe it bounces around from a year-to-year as you would expect, but it kind of averages 1%.\nDrew Evans: That's right, Tom.\nTom Fanning: So don't have much of an impact us. I'm sure it would for others that rely on tax benefits to drive their earnings.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lapides: Hey guys. I just wanna say, A. Thank you for taking the question. B. Dan congratulations. Another kind of being talented person in the CFO seat and your large Company have always with lots going on and kudos well-deserved. Next year in Georgia, and I'm just trying to think about the regulatory calendar in the series of events and more, how they intertwine or if they intertwine. So you'll go through the IRP process. I forget if the IRP actually gets formal approval or not. But you've also -- I think still have a rate case. And then will you also file to get Unit 4 in service if it looks like similar to how you did with Unit 3 to go ahead and set what the revenue requirement would be.\nTom Fanning: So Michael, there is a laundry list of things going on next year. We're certainly taking all of that into account. If you look at history. The Georgia Power Company with its relationship with the PSC itself, and what the work load at the staff, I think we've always managed to find our way to get big things done. And we just look forward to that constructive relationship going forward, I think the recent settlement agreement we reached on the stuff we just mentioned in the script was evidenced of that continued good working relationships. There is a lot going on next year with VCM, with IRP, with Vogtle 3, with potential prudency earnings beginning on the fuel load of 4 with a rate case filing. So there's a lot to work through. Just to understand that as we have in the past, we'll work with the folks involved to do it in the right way.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. My other question and I saw a little news splash. For the past week or so about you're buying a plant from AI infrastructure private equity owner to serve. I think it was for Alabama Power. Just curious, when you look around do you see significant opportunities for kind of plant M&A to bring them into rate base versus going through the construction process?\nTom Fanning: Yes, we do. And we keep those things, just as we're talking about buying and selling and we want to kind of keep our kimono closed at this point, as we see those opportunities we'll certainly work on them. That's just another evidence of something. The other kind of good thing about buying used assets that way. As you think about transitioning the fleet, I think I've said this in the past, to get to 0 for us we're going to have a profile in the 2040 to 2050 that will look something like 50% renewables, maybe 20% nuclear, maybe 25% natural gas. A lot of that natural gas will have CCS on it. The tail end of that, the 5% remaining could be something different. It could be hydrogen, it could be a variety of other thing. Hydrogen doesn't appear to be all that viable until maybe in the 30s. You do know that the Plant Alabama is building has the capability to blend hydrogen into its fuel mix. So you may see hydrogen occur in an indirect sort of way prior to the 40s and 50. But anyway, my sense is that you're going to have a lot of opportunity to buy some natural gas. The good thing about buying used units is, they may have a remaining life of 10 to 15 years, that fits in with retirement schedules that are consistent with adding more renewables. So those assets look like bridging assets. and very attractive economically and important to our strategy of replacing it with renewables.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, Tom much appreciated.\nTom Fanning: You bet. Always good talking with you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Fremont with Mizuho, please go ahead.\nTom Fanning: Pleasure to have you with us.\nPaul Flemont: Thank you so much. You've talked a little bit about that you still have construction work remaining on the plant. Can you give us a time-frame that it's going to take for you to complete the construction and if you want to sort of separate out the third bucket that you think you can do, after you get the letter. You can do it either with or without that bucket.\nTom Fanning: Paul, maybe I'm not following your question. Could you, try that again?\nPaul Flemont: In terms of days or months, how much -- how much physical construction work do you have yet, remaining on Unit 3?\nTom Fanning: Okay. So in general, what I indicated was here we are in nearly the middle of November. Okay. So in order to hit January, 103G. So that's 2 months round numbers. Okay. And then I would say if we had 103G in hand in January. My best guess right now is there maybe another 6 weeks of construction. So let's just think about that, 2 months plus 6 weeks is 3.5 months. Okay. That's a broad estimate.\nPaul Flemont: Okay. But obviously --\nTom Fanning: Hey, excuse me, Paul. And we certainly have allowed more time than that in the revised schedule. Remember, we added 3 months to all of that.\nPaul Flemont: Okay. Right.\nTom Fanning: That's my answer to your question.\nPaul Flemont: Okay. So you believe you have 6 weeks of physical work still to go? And then --\nTom Fanning: Well, wait. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on, Paul. It's -- what I would say is 6 weeks of physical work to get to 103G. It may be that it takes 8 weeks. I mean, who knows? But that's just a reasonable guess. So middle of November, wait a minute, I said 2 months. Middle of November to middle of January as 2 months. And then you would say add-on some more time to get to fuel load, right? That was a response to, I think it was Fleishman. So between 103G and fuel load, there is more work to be done. And I estimated that at its maximum, say 6 weeks. And at it's minimum, that's assuming we have a delay on 103G of 2 weeks, something like that. So to say, what I say, 3 or 4 months. Am I am I answering your question there?\nDrew Evans: Paul, let me --\nPaul Flemont: 2 months plus another either 6 weeks or 3 weeks, depending on where you are.\nTom Fanning: if it were less than 6 weeks, but Paul, remember, as I said, was if it was less than 6 weeks, that presumes that there is a delay in getting 103G. The total amount of time is, let's just say 3 to 4 months\nDrew Evans: And Paul just stated a different way with our September assumption for in-service of third quarter. of 2022, then work could continue through April with a 103G receipt fuel load in May, and then in-servicing system.\nPaul Flemont: And then can you tell us where you are relative to turnover and testing? I think there were 159 systems for each of the plants that need to go through turnover and testing. I think the last update, you were roughly at 120 on Unit 3. But is there any update on where you are now on Unit 3 and Unit 4?\nTom Fanning: So let's think about it. We have now completed -- so there was 158 walk-through to go through. We've completed them all now. Let's start there. We think there's about, let's see, 100,000 hours or so direct construction. We have in terms of systems, I forget how many we started with, but around 17 left to go. In between the July call and now, we turned over 11. And so it's interesting to look at is the symmetry of that even though I think we're probably closer. If in 3 months we turned over 11, 17 to go I just said 3 to 4 months, that's a little inaccurate because all the systems are being worked on and we're getting closer to complete all the systems. So there's probably a little bit less than that. In order to get to 103G. We need the completion of eight system turnovers. We have 7 to get to fuel load. So that's the delta between 103G and fuel load. And I said, that can expand and contract, how we think about that. Those seven are being Don and parallel, with the 8 required to get 100 3G. So those are not sequential, they are parallel. And then even after a fuel load, there are some things that will continue to be worked on. I think there's like two systems that you can do even after fuel load. So let me just say that again. Of the 17 systems that remain to turnover, 8 are required to get 103G, 7 are required to get to fuel load, 2 can be continued to be worked on even after fuel load.\nPaul Flemont: So I'm gathering from what you're saying. In the past, I think you've needed to get all of your I-tax approved by the NRC before you get the 103G letter. I'm gathering here, are you guys asking for the NRC to give you different treatment where you would get the 103G letter before all of --\nTom Fanning: No. This is all consistent with everything we've ever done with the NRC and 103 G, everything is consistent.\nPaul Flemont: In other words, all the ITAAC s would need to be approved, but I would assume that not all, but you would still have systems that would be untested. So those are systems that don't require ITAAC approvals, I take it.\nTom Fanning: Yes. In order to get permission to load fuel, so the systems after permission to load fuel are not necessarily safety-related items. They could be somebody's signage issues or something like that. Anything that is required to get 103G is encapsulated in the eight systems I mentioned. Before, we load fuel, we still want to do 7, 2 of those -- not 2 of those in additional 2 can be done even after we load fuel. They're just not safety-related construction items.\nPaul Flemont: And then my last question, I'm sorry.\nDrew Evans: Just want to clarify, Paul. In our materials when it does relate to I-tax, we provided a schedule of an i-tech completion cadence that would support in April 103G, May fuel load, September end service. What you'll note is that there's nothing showing in November because nowhere to support that schedule, we don't need any November Our expectation is they're absolutely will be some in November. In fact, I believe we've already submitted 2 since the month has begun, so everyone in November that gets completed reduces the number that need to be completed between December and April to support of 103G.\nTom Fanning: I'm sure you guys know Aaron Abramovitz. He was Chief Financial Officer of the project. He was actually located on-site. Now he's the CFO with Georgia Tower. In order to give you the schedule that you saw in your package, effectively what he did, he started with September in service date. We believe we have margin to that. But he started with September in-service. And then he reverse engineered back in a conservative way to say, well this would be the ITAAC completion schedule consistent with September. We believe we have margin to that. As we get ITAAC s filed in November, I'll go ahead and say we expect to get about 20. Well this one the schedule we gave you indicates nothing in November and not much work in December. When we think we'll have that exceeded by a pretty good margin. And so we'll be ahead of the schedule. Well, that just suggests our belief that in fact there is margin to the schedule we're giving you now. And the other thing Greg was important in that, the reason why we went to all this trouble was we thought you guys would want to have a way to measure our progress. And hitting 103G and ultimately fuel load and we thought this was kind of a good way to measure our progress. So look and see how many I've tax we file in November and December and compared to the schedule and I think you'll see that. I think we'll beat the schedule pretty handily at least early on for sure.\nPaul Flemont: And then last question, where are you currently in the cost sharing, Dan, as it relates to you and your partners in the plant? Are you now at a point where you're picking up a 100% of the incremental project costs?\nDrew Evans: We believe we have not entered that We certainly have some discussion among us and the other co-owners about that. I think we've disclosed that and I'd rather not go too far into that and I just appreciate your patience with us there. Just as we don't front run regulatory process as we have a long track record of not doing that, it's best for us to have the resolution of those differences of opinion done in private.\nTom Fanning: But just very matter of fact, with Paul as we disclosed our calculation to just we're not even into the first end for sure.\nPaul Flemont: Great. That's it for me. Thank you so much\nTom Fanning: Paul your great. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nTom Fanning: Hello Sophie, how are you?\nSophie Karp: I'm good. Thank you for taking my questions. How are you?\nTom Fanning: You bet.\nSophie Karp: All right. Just a little quick one. Do you expect to have any kind of incremental labor issues as a result of the OSHA rule regarding the COVID vaccination mandate sort of kicks in. Fair to assume, I think and just any thoughts, I appreciate it given your way before this vaccination rates.\nTom Fanning: Yes, Ma'am. You know, we always have the health and safety of our employees foremost in our minds. And I think if you look at the way we've handled the site through the epidemic, I think it's been amazing. The accomplishments that those folks have done even under restricted protocols. We were just on a call here as we just gotten more granularity, I guess from OSHA, about what their expectations are. It's 400 pages long. We're kind of diving through it. We know there are legal challenges to come. It's really too early for us to say right now what we think the impacts will be. I know even EEI has requested a 90-day delay. Look, there's a lot to digest right now. Let's keep our eyes on that. And just as a final thought, you folks know that I've been leading the ESCC, electricity sub-sector coordinating counsel. And I know the deals are cyber and physical threats. It also deals with the industry's response to major storms. We call those national response events. And so I've kind of helped organize the national response to a hurricane or a snow storm, or what have you. Clearly as you introduce new operating requirements into those gigantic magnitude events, we got to make sure that we serve the interest of customers, and not only get the wires up and the plants running, but restore hope to the communities we're privileged to serve. We don't want to let any of these new requirements interfere with our ability to serve the American economy during those times. So all of those conversations are going on right now. And Sophie, I wish I could give you more granular stuff, but it's all just very timely conversation we're working through. I'm very confident by our next earnings call we'll have more to stay there.\nSophie Karp: Got it. Thank you for the comments, I appreciate it. That's all for me.\nTom Fanning: You bet. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.\nTom Fanning: Hey, Paul. Great to have you with us. Paul? We would still be great to have you with us. I don't know where he is.\nOperator: Mr. Patterson, your line is open. Please check your mute button or lift your handset. It appears we're unable to hear you. Please, you will register for your question. If you'd like to ask your question. And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks?\nTom Fanning: Just to say thank you. I'm I get frustrated at times. I know you guys may get frustrated also, this kind of scheduled stuff. But I think what we're doing right now is conservative imprudent. It gives us more margin. We're working very hard. We're making progress. We'll get there. And I want to thank the people at the site for working so hard and making the progress they're making with respect to the challenges of personnel, quality that always remains foremost. And this phrase we used, get it right, is so important to us, we will always work to get it right. So thank you for your for your understanding and all of that. As we move through these issues, we've had good progress. The regulatory constructs that we had on the first 2.1 billion at all, I think was more evidence that I think we do have a constructive working relationship. And that post Vogel, the numbers are essentially irrefutable I mean, I think that cash flow, earnings trajectory, overall financial integrity of the Company, is truly outstanding and we think warrants anyone's interest as an investment. So thank you for your time and we look forward to talking with you next week at EEI. Dan, any closing comments?\nDrew Evans: No, sir. See everyone at EEI.\nTom Fanning: All right. That's all, Operator. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Southern Company third quarter 2021 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Drew Evans",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom. And good afternoon, everyone. As you can see from the materials, we released this morning, all of our major subsidiaries had a solid quarter and our adjusted consolidated earnings are trending extremely well through the third quarter. For the third quarter of 2021, we reported earnings per share of a $1.23 on an adjusted basis, $0.01 higher than both our estimate for the quarter and our adjusted third quarter of 2020 earnings per share. For the 9 months ended September 30th, 2021, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.05 compared with adjusted earnings-per-share of $2.78 for the same period in 2020. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results is included in this morning's release and earnings package. Major drivers for our adjusted earnings results for the third quarter of 2021 included higher retail kilowatt hour sales at our state regulated utilities, as we continue to see recovery from the pandemic, strong customer growth and impacts of several constructive regulatory outcomes, partially offsetting these impacts, non-fuel O&M reflects the trend towards more normal operating conditions relative to 2020 milder than normal summer temperatures in the Southeast also negatively impacted earnings per share by $0.02 compared to our estimate and by $0.07 compared to the third quarter of 2020. Turning now to customer growth through September, we have added over 40,000 new residential electric customers and over 20,000 residential natural gas customers across our regulated utilities. This level of customer growth has exceeded our forecast year-to-date and puts us on track to surpass last year's customer growth levels, which were also above historical norms. Customer growth continues to be driven by a strong labor market recovery, which is on track to reach pre -pandemic levels of employment in our Southeast service territory next year. For the third quarter, weather-adjusted retail electric sales were up 3% compared to last year and were in line with our expectations. Residential sales remained higher than expected due to extended remote work practices and commercial sales showed continued improvement coming in slightly better than our forecast. Industrial electricity usage lagged other customer groups, primarily driven by production cuts from a single large customer in the chemical segment [Indiscernible] this customer specific event, industrial sales have been in line with our forecast for the quarter. We continue to analyze retail sales and an aggregate through the third quarter our retail sales have essentially recovered to 2019 pre -pandemic levels. We are encouraged by these positive signals while we also continue to monitor the potential impact of COVID-19 variant, supply chain constraints, and labor force participation. The economic development pipeline in Southeast remains robust. Job announcements and business investment in Georgia in the third quarter 2021 were higher than pre -pandemic levels for 2019 and the average of 5 years ending 2020. In Georgia alone, there are currently over 200 active projects with the potential to bring in nearly 40,000 jobs and $13 billion in capital investment in the coming years. Next, I'd like to provide you with an update on our outlook for the remainder of 2021 with adjusted earnings per share through September of $3.05, we expect to achieve adjusted full-year earnings above the top end of our guidance range of $3.35 per share. Our estimate for the fourth quarter is $0.35 per share, which implies an estimated full-year results of $3.40 on an adjusted basis. Before turning the call back over to Tom, I'd like to follow-up briefly on Tom's update on BOPIS 3 and 4. First, I want to reiterate our commitment to credit quality, which has been constant. In our last call, we reinforced that commitment by announcing we would turn on our dividend reinvestment plans in the near future. As we have done so well over the last several years, we also continue to evaluate opportunities for asset sales. Within a portfolio the size of Southern Company, we have several investments which warrant continuous review for whether or not a better owner exists. Whether such potential transactions serve to offset our near-term equity needs or ultimately fund our long-term capital investment plans, we will remain disciplined to the benefit of equity holders and bond holders alike, as we execute our financing plans. And finally, let me briefly highlight the Vogtle Units 3 rate adjustments, stipulation that was unanimously approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission on Tuesday. consistent with the framework the PSC established with our order for the 17th VCM Process. This most recent order allows $2.1 billion of investment in Vogtle Unit 3 and the Vogtle Units, 3 and 4 common facilities to be moved from the Nuclear Construction Cost Recovery tariff or NCCR, into retail rate base the month after Unit 3 goes into service, where it will learn Georgia Power 's full allowed rate of return. Additionally, Georgia Power will be allowed to recover the related operating expenses and depreciation on this portion of Unit 3, which is an important credit supportive aspect of the stipulation. The entire process which struck an appropriate balance for all stakeholders, was a great affirmation of the constructive Georgia regulatory environment. Tom, I'll now turn the call back over to you. Hello Shar, thanks for joining. And so just a reminder what Tom such as prepared remarks is the $4 -- $4 to $4.30 on 2024 is predicated on our current capex plan. And I think the way to think about these incremental opportunities as it will potentially increase or intensify, overcome. I mean, you said postpone growth. I think that is the point in time when we really begin to see tangible long-term increases to that profile from $8 billion a year to something more. And just on the transmission Shar and the reason we're being a little hesitant to share too early, well, there's transmission opportunities associated with what we will retire. The other transmission opportunities come about with what we replaced that with and where, and that is simply a function of our integrated planning processes and we just need to let those play off. Important thing is that $2.1 billion is not the full cost of Unit 3 and the common facilities, what remains will remain earning a return under NCCR, or will be deferred for future recovery with the Commission. And at the same time, we will be recovering currently, the operating costs of Unit 3 and the depreciation, at least the associated with a $2.1 billion. Thanks, Sir. Yes absolutely. So Julien, essentially, what we're addressing is only the impact of the recent Vogtle cost increases. So to the extent that that has an impact on our credit profile, we're committed to mitigating that. Whether that's turning our drip on or finding opportunities with these asset sales. Beyond that, we still see a long-term plan, even in light of the incremental capex opportunities that we're alluding to where we don't need incremental equity. I think it's important to point towards a post Vogtle kind of forecast period. And our credit metrics out there are about 200 basis points for FFO to debt higher than they are today. And that's a position of strength for us and gives us a lot of flexibility as to how we finance our group. And I just want to clarify, just back on source question that I said 1/3 of a cent per month. It's 2/3 of a cent per month, I just want make sure that's clear. Yeah. Let me just add real quickly to Tom's comments. The nature of the risk for that work Coast 103G up to fuel load is really logistics. So once we receive 103G, the site becomes an operating nuclear site. So the logistics of getting people to ingress and egress a personnel to do the remaining work is just friction on productivity and that's really the nature of that risk. Yes. Look, Steve, if you want to make an assumption in your model that our opportunity to do that is the size of the after-tax write-offs, that's a reasonable assumption. That said, we're looking across multiple opportunities. We will see what that looks like. More importantly, from a long-term perspective, that uplift in the credit metrics that we talked about is really what is key. We always take a long-term view on this stuff and I'm very comfortable with how we're positioned long term and there's not a need for anything or significant than those near-term charges that we've taken to earn. We have. Yes, we have. So we've not turned it on, we're holding that as an option to see what, if anything, becomes of any asset sale opportunities and we'll do one or the other. The DRIP on an annual basis equals about $400 million worth of equity. Jeremy the way to think about it, this is really been what has occurred both in the Second quarter and this most recent announcement here in the third quarter, the cost increases has really been a function of two things. One is the schedule itself, and that's kind of that notion of hotel load that we talked about. And for Unit 3, that is $35 million a month I believe and for Unit 4, $25 million a month and $15 million a month for Unit 4. So for every month reaching if that's just the infrastructure that supports construction in the cost of that. With this most recent increase and again, much like the second quarter increase, it also came with new assumptions on the number of personnel necessary to complete the work, and so that's where that incremental cost is coming from both increases really represented about, half pure schedule or hotel costs. And then the other half, personnel and productivity assumptions to complete the work. That's right, Tom. Paul, let me -- And Paul just stated a different way with our September assumption for in-service of third quarter. of 2022, then work could continue through April with a 103G receipt fuel load in May, and then in-servicing system. Just want to clarify, Paul. In our materials when it does relate to I-tax, we provided a schedule of an i-tech completion cadence that would support in April 103G, May fuel load, September end service. What you'll note is that there's nothing showing in November because nowhere to support that schedule, we don't need any November Our expectation is they're absolutely will be some in November. In fact, I believe we've already submitted 2 since the month has begun, so everyone in November that gets completed reduces the number that need to be completed between December and April to support of 103G. We believe we have not entered that We certainly have some discussion among us and the other co-owners about that. I think we've disclosed that and I'd rather not go too far into that and I just appreciate your patience with us there. Just as we don't front run regulatory process as we have a long track record of not doing that, it's best for us to have the resolution of those differences of opinion done in private. No, sir. See everyone at EEI."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Tom Fanning",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. As you can see from the materials released this morning, we reported strong adjusted results for the Third Quarter. The economies in our service territories continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. And in particular, customer growth continues to exceed our expectations. Given results through September, we expect full-year adjusted earnings per share to be above the top end of our guidance range. Dan will share more on this in a moment. So let's begin with an update on Vogtle Units 3 and 4. 2 weeks ago, we updated our expected completion timeline for both units, extending the in-service dates by 3 months. For Unit 3, following the completion of hot functional testing, we completed walk down of the 158 safety-related rooms within the nuclear island to assess the extent of remediation work required, consistent with the electrical installation quality issues we highlighted earlier this year, The number of instances of items needing remediation found during our full assessment process, however, exceeded our estimate from July. The change in the Unit 3 schedule into the third quarter of 2022 is primarily a function of the time needed to address the full scope of the remaining remediation work and to account for the impacts on productivity resulting from higher than expected attrition and slower than expected on-boarding of new electricians, field engineers, and supervisors. For Unit 4, recent progress has slowed. that's craft labor, and support resources have been temporarily shifted to support Unit 3's concert -- completion efforts. Considering this decrease in available resources over the next several months, plus recent productivity trends, we now expect Unit 4 in-service during the second quarter of 2023. Importantly, with the corrective actions beside is implemented after discovery of the Unit 3 quality issues, including reinforcement of the importance of first time quality with craft personnel, and improvements to the application of Bechtel's quality program. we believe that as we turn systems over on Unit 4, the amount of remediation work required will be less than what we experienced on Unit 3. During the third quarter, consistent with the surrounding areas, the site experienced a spike in COVID-19 cases that approached the peak of cases we experienced early in 2021. While the availability of vaccines and well-established protocols helped preclude the same degree of disruption experienced during the first wave of COVID-19, the pandemic was certainly a contributing factor to overall productivity and resource availability. For Unit 3, repairs to the spent fuel pool, system turnovers and ITAAC submittals continued throughout the third quarter. Repairs to the spent fuel pool are now complete. And the next major milestone for Unit 3 will be the receipt of the 103 G letter from the NRC. To-date, 242 ITAAC have been submitted to the NRC with 156 remaining. On Slide 7 of today's earnings call deck, we have included a forecast of the remaining ITAAC submittals required to support a projected May 2022 fuel load and third quarter 2022 projected in service date. Now, considering our recent volume of ITAAC of metals in October, and the expected completion and turnover of significant systems in the months ahead, the site is targeting ITAAC completion earlier than what is indicated in this forecast, which would provide margin to Unit 3's remaining schedule. We expect to use the time between ITAAC completion and fuel load to finalize the non-safety-related elements of the plant, and to complete any remaining pre -fuel load testing. Turning now to Unit 4, direct construction is now approximately 89% complete. A revised projected in service date of the second quarter 2023, reflects the temporary shift of services to Unit 3. Recent productivity trends on bulk electrical work and ongoing efforts to add craft labor and non-manual field support resources in support of first-time quality and productivity. Construction completion for Unit 4 has averaged 1.4% per month since the start of the year. To achieve a second quarter 2023 in service date, we estimate that Unit 4 we'd need to average approximately 1%, construction completion per month through the end of 2022. From a cost perspective, Georgia Power share of the total project capital cost forecast, increased by $264 million, largely driven by our updated schedule, productivity consistent with recent trends, the cost of additional resources to complete the full score for remaining work with necessary focus on quality and the replenishment of contingency. As a result, Georgia Power recorded an after-tax charge of $197 million during the third quarter. We remain committed to the credit quality of Georgia Power and Southern Company, And we will continue to seek, to maintain strong credit metrics for both entities. Our priority is bringing Vogtle Units 3 and 4 safely online to provide Georgia with a reliable, carbon-free energy resource for the next 60 to 80 years. We're committed to taking the time to get it right. And we will not sacrifice safety or quality to meet schedule. At Unit 3, we are working to submit remaining ITAAC to support receipt of the 103 G letter prior to fuel load and commercial operations in 2022. For Unit 4, we remain focused on attracting and retaining necessary craft, labor, and support resources, as well as first-time quality as we work to increase productivity and progress towards the start of open vessel testing, which is now projected by the second quarter of 2022. Dan, I will turn the call over now to you for an update on the financial. Thanks Dan. Let me wrap up with an update on the Southeastern Energy Exchange Market or SEEM and our fleet transition Subject to resolution of any rehearing request, SEEM is moving forward after clearing the approval process. SEEM is region-wide automated into our platform, consisting of nearly 20 entities across 11 states, with the goal of more efficient bilateral trading in the Southeast. It is not an energy imbalance market or an RTO Benefiting from robust integrated planning by the individual states, municipalities, and utilities, the region represented by SEEM members scores very favorably on all important metrics compared to the RTOs across the country. SEEM will improve electric service to customers in the Southeast, a reason that is already an industry leader for customer satisfaction and reliability. The members of SEEM electricity market also provide low retail prices for residential and business customers using a mix of carbon-free energy resources similar to the rest of the country. We believe SEEM is good for our customers, and we're excited to be a part of this new platform, which is expected to launch in mid 2022. Turning now to our fleet transition. In our most recent climate report named Implementation and Action Towards Net 0, we reaffirmed our long-term goal of achieving net 0 greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. As an important step in the transition of our fleet, earlier this month Alabama Power and Georgia Power filed plans with their respective state environmental authorities detailing how each would comply with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Effluent Limitation Guidelines. With these expected changes and the recent retirement announcement of two coal units at Mississippi Power's plant, Daniel, since 2007, Southern Company will have announced total decreases in its coal-generating capacity from more than 20,000 megawatts, across nearly 70 generating unit to less than 4,500 megawatts of coal capacity, remaining at 8 generating units. This equates to a reduction of nearly 80%. The final resolution for many of the actions outlined in the [Indiscernible] compliance filings, including the exact timing of retirements and any other actions we may recommend remains subject to the approval of our state public service commissions through the integrated resource planning processes or IRP. These proceedings are intended to comprehensively address transmission and generation resource needs over the long term, which could include additional decisions regarding the future of the remaining coal unit. As always, part of our planning process for transitioning these units will include placing a high priority on protecting the interest of our employees and the communities we are privileged to serve. The transition of our generating fleet and the important regulatory proceedings that will play out over the next 9 months, will significantly inform our capital investment opportunities. As we always do, we will update our capital investment plans during our fourth quarter earnings call early next year, which will include known fleet transition opportunities. It is likely that further transparency on our long-term capital plan will unfold through out 2022 and we will update our forecasts as appropriately. Importantly, our current 2024 earnings-per-share base of $4 to $4.30 is based upon our current 5-year capital plan with potential incremental investments, providing the opportunity to strengthen our position, both within that 2024 range and within our 5 to 7% long-term growth range. Now, before we move to the Q&A portion which we always love here, this just came across the wires. Next week is Veterans Day and a publication that I'm sure you all know well, Military Times, came out with their Best for Vets ranking of employers. And we've typically been on the list that shows the top 15 companies across America and it include well-known companies like Bank of America, Booz Allen Hamilton, The Hilton Group, Johnson & Johnson and others. They just have named Southern Company the number 1 Company in America that's best for vets. That included evaluations of recruiting practices, retention, and support programs and a higher emphasis on employers who provide assistance and flexibility for individuals and the guard and reserves. We certainly respect the contribution that these folks make. They are a significant part of our employment base, I think amounting to over 11% of employee today. We respect their service and we want to make sure that they have the best work environment that they could have. We are honored beyond belief to be named the number 1 Company in America, Best for Vets, as named by the Military Times. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Yeah. Sure. I hate to disappoint you. We're not going to say very much next week. Suffice to say that beat plan and to approve by the public service commissions will have an impact on capex. We always provide that update in our call. I guess it will be the end of January or early February, about our fourth quarter results and total year results. So we will certainly do that then. I think as I said, to the extent there are impacts, the current capital forecast formulated our range in 2022, $4 to $4.30. To the extent there is an increase in capex, certainly that strengthens our place within that range and the longer term, 5% to 7% growth rate. The other thing that we should remember about rates is that as you retire coal, you free up a whole lot of O&M. We intend to use that O&M to basically, allow for cost recovery, account for the incremental revenue requirements associated with new generation that will replace that and keep rates as low as possible for our customers. And one last point there, one of the benefits of our integrated resource planning processes, is we get to optimize portfolios, not only on generation, but also transmission. So transmission could be a benefit there. The other one you should keep in mind is we currently -- we said this in other calls. We currently allow for about 500 million a year of cap allocation to things like Southern Power. None of those allocations are included in our forecast. And it would stand to reason that as the U.S. transitions its generating fleet, there will be more opportunities for Southern Power in that regard. But it's a good thing for us. Good thing for our customers we get to iterate around those choices. You don't get that opportunity in the organized markets. Yes, absolutely. So let's just make the assumption for the sake of describing all this chart that the third quarter means September of 2022. So given the results at the Georgia Public Service Commission earlier this week, that will mean that rates will go into place for $2.1 billion of Unit 3 in the comm facilities, earning Georgia Power's full cost of capital. If you think about it, relative to what we're earning today, that's going to add about a third of a sense of EPS for every month, for October, November, and December relative to what you would have forecasted under current conditions it's about a third of a penny per month. The Thank you. Hey Julien, how are you? Yes, sure. As always, Dan speak to the equity needs. I'll go back to the litany on M&A that I always do. I think we've demonstrated in the past whether we're buying or selling, that we always seek to put assets with the best owner. Our formulation for that is the old rubric, value is a function of risk and return. And so we have ideas right now, we really don't want to front run in the public what those ideas are, about assets where there may be better owners. We'll see whether they come to fruition or not. Certainly as they do, we will keep you updated, but we are looking over our list of things and we'll see. Dan, you want to speak to the equity needs? Okay. Yeah. And to be very clear to o, I'm trying to be less elliptical on what we're looking at. But you should assume, as we have moved here to be, what is it, 95% of our earnings are integrated regulated kind of earnings that it would contribute to that profile. In other words, we're not going to buy ourselves things which make ourselves more risky. I think we love the idea of reasonable turn and low risk. And also as you have seen in the past years or since I've been here. As we have bought say for example, AGL Resources now Southern Company Gas, there had been things around the edges that have allowed us to simplify and de -risk our business. So think about those things and we'll see how it goes. Yeah. Julian. Yes. Thanks for that. It's an important point to raise as has the ties at both ebbs and flows here. Let me explain that a little bit. We believe that Bechtel has had the responsibility to attract skilled personnel, skilled craftwork, especially electrician engineers, to assess the work that's being done and field site personnel, supervisory personnel to oversee the work that's going on. We have not kept pace with the requirements to advance these units in terms of attracting the people, and you named the reason why we've had more attrition. I think certainly the amount of attrition is potentially associated with the COVID response and everything else. So we've had to do a couple of different things. We have said in the past that we were moving to de -link the progress at Unit 4 from Unit 3. And so therefore, this 12-month margin didn't matter. One of the way that we serve to continue to advance Unit 3, was again to borrow personnel from Unit 4. So we didn't really want to do that, but it was a necessary move to continue to advance the work at Unit 3. Now, as we finish that work, we will send those people back to Unit four. And once again, they will be de -linked. But for the period of time in which we have borrowed personnel from 4 to 3, a delay in 3 means a delay in 4. And so that has happened. The other thing that we have done is to augment back fills, sourcing efforts with our own efforts. We've had a very deep engineering and construction services group in Birmingham, our own resources that we could attract personnel and so we have significantly augmented Bechtel's efforts to increase the flow of people necessary to promote skilled labor, electricians and field supervisory personnel. All of those things are in progress. All of those things are consistent with the new schedules we've given you. And I will say one more thing. There was a lot of conversation about this. I can tell you, Chris Womack and I in particular, we're really watching the trends. If I just looked at current data, we still have margin 6 weeks or so to Unit 3, 3 months or so to Unit 4 on the existing not extended schedules. We looked at the trends, however, and the trends to me we're troubling. And so we all kind of step back and said, I would rather take the conservative posture of evaluating these trends and adding more time, because frankly we didn't believe that we had 6 months of scheduled margin left on 3, and 3 months of scheduled margin left on 4. And we could've quibble on adding a month or 2 months. We said, let's go ahead and add a quarter for both. And that's where we came out on this decision. Yeah. And this idea of there's got to be 12 months, they're in fact -- the only time they are linked is when we borrowed from 4 to 3. Therefore, a delay in 3 causes a delay in 4. Once we get 3 back into its place, then we are able to send the people back to 4 and again, they are de -linked. The 9 month difference between the 2 does not trouble us. Thanks. Appreciate you calling in. Yes. Steve, you kind of gave me the answer before I answered and that is I don't want to speak for staff. Dr. Jacob is a guy that I know well. He attends the same meetings we attend, he sees the same stuff we see. He's a really bright guy. I think if I had to highlight something that will come under some discussion and I think it's absolutely correct, you want to look at schedule variability at this point. We believe we see a pretty clear track to receiving the 103 G letter, which allows us to load nuclear fuel, allows us to go hot on the site. There is a certain amount of work that will occur between the receipt of the letter and the actual loading of nuclear fuel. In my opinion, that work that is from 103G receipt to loading the fuel is probably the remaining biggest risk to schedule that remains on Unit 3. Recall in the script, we talked about finding more remediation. And I know in some other media, we've talked about these items. None of them being deal killers and all and stuff, but there's no such thing as a little issue in nuclear. Everything we take seriously. Everything must be done effectively with perfection. And so it is that time that we're looking at right now that I would say to you is probably the shared view of Dr. Jacobs in particular and us, as the biggest risk to schedule that remain, right now, our assessment of that work, if we get the 103 g letter early let's say January, then I'm going to guess, and this is just a guess on my part, so don't hold me to it. But I'm going to guess there maybe six weeks of work left from receipt of the letter to the actual loading of the fuel. If the 103 G letter is delayed, then that 6 weeks reduces because this is work that can be done in parallel with, some of the other stuff that's required to get 103 G. Remember we've talked about 3 buckets of work that we identified post HFT. One bucket deals with the issues we identified during a hot functional test. The second deals with remediation that frankly has increased since we passed the 103 G letter and really was subsequent to the July call we had with you guys. The last bucket really dealt with human performance systems, HVAC, signage a variety of other things. That work margin is bigger, let me just say it again. If we get received a 103 G early let's say at January I mean who knows. It could be as much as 6 weeks. If we get 103 G later, that work time will shrink to 2 weeks or something. We'll see. See that's where I think you will see a lot of discussion between us and the commission. That was helpful. Go ahead, Steve. Go ahead. And you're in a prior call you kind of said was we thought the drip and one year without the last issue. This is another roughly $200 million. So let's see what the review of our asset sales are, and we'll figure out where we go on the issuance of new shares under the drip. Please assure if we can find a better solution than issuing shares under the drip will do it. Yes. I think good and as Dan indicated from -- if you look at the capex forecast, most likely the capex opportunity associated with the transition of the fleet will occur in the back part of that capex forecast. Thank you, Steve. Hey Jeremy, how are you? Yes. And I would be remiss if we didn't had the idea that in sourcing all of these personnel in the skilled labor. Sean McGarvey and his team at the building trades has been fabulous. The IBEW in particular has been great, they've given us tremendous ongoing support. And I think our relationship with them is really bearing fruit here as we augment that builds efforts. Jeremy calling the situation in Washington, fluid is a bit like calling the Grand Canyon a crack. I will say this, that there's lots of good stuff in the infrastructure bill and in the reconciliation bill that help us. They are shaped mostly as incentives. And we think that incentives are the way to go. We're particularly interested in anything that as we go through this transition of the fleet and transmission to a net 0 future that we keep prices as low as possible, To help our energy resource in a worldwide competitive market to keep it -- to keep America in a very strong position to compete for new loads and manufacturing and a variety of other things, it is important for the nation. It is important for our customers to keep prices low and to provide incentives to do that, that's kind of thing 1. Thing 2, Dan can correct me here or whatever, but we've looked at this minimum tax proposal. And we think it doesn't have that much of an impact to us maybe it bounces around from a year-to-year as you would expect, but it kind of averages 1%. So don't have much of an impact us. I'm sure it would for others that rely on tax benefits to drive their earnings. So Michael, there is a laundry list of things going on next year. We're certainly taking all of that into account. If you look at history. The Georgia Power Company with its relationship with the PSC itself, and what the work load at the staff, I think we've always managed to find our way to get big things done. And we just look forward to that constructive relationship going forward, I think the recent settlement agreement we reached on the stuff we just mentioned in the script was evidenced of that continued good working relationships. There is a lot going on next year with VCM, with IRP, with Vogtle 3, with potential prudency earnings beginning on the fuel load of 4 with a rate case filing. So there's a lot to work through. Just to understand that as we have in the past, we'll work with the folks involved to do it in the right way. Yes, we do. And we keep those things, just as we're talking about buying and selling and we want to kind of keep our kimono closed at this point, as we see those opportunities we'll certainly work on them. That's just another evidence of something. The other kind of good thing about buying used assets that way. As you think about transitioning the fleet, I think I've said this in the past, to get to 0 for us we're going to have a profile in the 2040 to 2050 that will look something like 50% renewables, maybe 20% nuclear, maybe 25% natural gas. A lot of that natural gas will have CCS on it. The tail end of that, the 5% remaining could be something different. It could be hydrogen, it could be a variety of other thing. Hydrogen doesn't appear to be all that viable until maybe in the 30s. You do know that the Plant Alabama is building has the capability to blend hydrogen into its fuel mix. So you may see hydrogen occur in an indirect sort of way prior to the 40s and 50. But anyway, my sense is that you're going to have a lot of opportunity to buy some natural gas. The good thing about buying used units is, they may have a remaining life of 10 to 15 years, that fits in with retirement schedules that are consistent with adding more renewables. So those assets look like bridging assets. and very attractive economically and important to our strategy of replacing it with renewables. You bet. Always good talking with you. Pleasure to have you with us. Paul, maybe I'm not following your question. Could you, try that again? Okay. So in general, what I indicated was here we are in nearly the middle of November. Okay. So in order to hit January, 103G. So that's 2 months round numbers. Okay. And then I would say if we had 103G in hand in January. My best guess right now is there maybe another 6 weeks of construction. So let's just think about that, 2 months plus 6 weeks is 3.5 months. Okay. That's a broad estimate. Hey, excuse me, Paul. And we certainly have allowed more time than that in the revised schedule. Remember, we added 3 months to all of that. That's my answer to your question. Well, wait. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on, Paul. It's -- what I would say is 6 weeks of physical work to get to 103G. It may be that it takes 8 weeks. I mean, who knows? But that's just a reasonable guess. So middle of November, wait a minute, I said 2 months. Middle of November to middle of January as 2 months. And then you would say add-on some more time to get to fuel load, right? That was a response to, I think it was Fleishman. So between 103G and fuel load, there is more work to be done. And I estimated that at its maximum, say 6 weeks. And at it's minimum, that's assuming we have a delay on 103G of 2 weeks, something like that. So to say, what I say, 3 or 4 months. Am I am I answering your question there? if it were less than 6 weeks, but Paul, remember, as I said, was if it was less than 6 weeks, that presumes that there is a delay in getting 103G. The total amount of time is, let's just say 3 to 4 months So let's think about it. We have now completed -- so there was 158 walk-through to go through. We've completed them all now. Let's start there. We think there's about, let's see, 100,000 hours or so direct construction. We have in terms of systems, I forget how many we started with, but around 17 left to go. In between the July call and now, we turned over 11. And so it's interesting to look at is the symmetry of that even though I think we're probably closer. If in 3 months we turned over 11, 17 to go I just said 3 to 4 months, that's a little inaccurate because all the systems are being worked on and we're getting closer to complete all the systems. So there's probably a little bit less than that. In order to get to 103G. We need the completion of eight system turnovers. We have 7 to get to fuel load. So that's the delta between 103G and fuel load. And I said, that can expand and contract, how we think about that. Those seven are being Don and parallel, with the 8 required to get 100 3G. So those are not sequential, they are parallel. And then even after a fuel load, there are some things that will continue to be worked on. I think there's like two systems that you can do even after fuel load. So let me just say that again. Of the 17 systems that remain to turnover, 8 are required to get 103G, 7 are required to get to fuel load, 2 can be continued to be worked on even after fuel load. No. This is all consistent with everything we've ever done with the NRC and 103 G, everything is consistent. Yes. In order to get permission to load fuel, so the systems after permission to load fuel are not necessarily safety-related items. They could be somebody's signage issues or something like that. Anything that is required to get 103G is encapsulated in the eight systems I mentioned. Before, we load fuel, we still want to do 7, 2 of those -- not 2 of those in additional 2 can be done even after we load fuel. They're just not safety-related construction items. I'm sure you guys know Aaron Abramovitz. He was Chief Financial Officer of the project. He was actually located on-site. Now he's the CFO with Georgia Tower. In order to give you the schedule that you saw in your package, effectively what he did, he started with September in service date. We believe we have margin to that. But he started with September in-service. And then he reverse engineered back in a conservative way to say, well this would be the ITAAC completion schedule consistent with September. We believe we have margin to that. As we get ITAAC s filed in November, I'll go ahead and say we expect to get about 20. Well this one the schedule we gave you indicates nothing in November and not much work in December. When we think we'll have that exceeded by a pretty good margin. And so we'll be ahead of the schedule. Well, that just suggests our belief that in fact there is margin to the schedule we're giving you now. And the other thing Greg was important in that, the reason why we went to all this trouble was we thought you guys would want to have a way to measure our progress. And hitting 103G and ultimately fuel load and we thought this was kind of a good way to measure our progress. So look and see how many I've tax we file in November and December and compared to the schedule and I think you'll see that. I think we'll beat the schedule pretty handily at least early on for sure. But just very matter of fact, with Paul as we disclosed our calculation to just we're not even into the first end for sure. Paul your great. Thank you for joining us. Hello Sophie, how are you? You bet. Yes, Ma'am. You know, we always have the health and safety of our employees foremost in our minds. And I think if you look at the way we've handled the site through the epidemic, I think it's been amazing. The accomplishments that those folks have done even under restricted protocols. We were just on a call here as we just gotten more granularity, I guess from OSHA, about what their expectations are. It's 400 pages long. We're kind of diving through it. We know there are legal challenges to come. It's really too early for us to say right now what we think the impacts will be. I know even EEI has requested a 90-day delay. Look, there's a lot to digest right now. Let's keep our eyes on that. And just as a final thought, you folks know that I've been leading the ESCC, electricity sub-sector coordinating counsel. And I know the deals are cyber and physical threats. It also deals with the industry's response to major storms. We call those national response events. And so I've kind of helped organize the national response to a hurricane or a snow storm, or what have you. Clearly as you introduce new operating requirements into those gigantic magnitude events, we got to make sure that we serve the interest of customers, and not only get the wires up and the plants running, but restore hope to the communities we're privileged to serve. We don't want to let any of these new requirements interfere with our ability to serve the American economy during those times. So all of those conversations are going on right now. And Sophie, I wish I could give you more granular stuff, but it's all just very timely conversation we're working through. I'm very confident by our next earnings call we'll have more to stay there. You bet. Thank you. Hey, Paul. Great to have you with us. Paul? We would still be great to have you with us. I don't know where he is. Just to say thank you. I'm I get frustrated at times. I know you guys may get frustrated also, this kind of scheduled stuff. But I think what we're doing right now is conservative imprudent. It gives us more margin. We're working very hard. We're making progress. We'll get there. And I want to thank the people at the site for working so hard and making the progress they're making with respect to the challenges of personnel, quality that always remains foremost. And this phrase we used, get it right, is so important to us, we will always work to get it right. So thank you for your for your understanding and all of that. As we move through these issues, we've had good progress. The regulatory constructs that we had on the first 2.1 billion at all, I think was more evidence that I think we do have a constructive working relationship. And that post Vogel, the numbers are essentially irrefutable I mean, I think that cash flow, earnings trajectory, overall financial integrity of the Company, is truly outstanding and we think warrants anyone's interest as an investment. So thank you for your time and we look forward to talking with you next week at EEI. Dan, any closing comments? All right. That's all, Operator. Thank you very much."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Southern Company Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday July, 29, 2021. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Investor Relations Director. Please go ahead, sir.\nScott Gammill: Thank you. Rita. Good afternoon and welcome to Southern Company's second quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Tom Fanning, Chairman and President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Drew Evans, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements today. In addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Qs and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.\nTom Fanning: Thank you, Scott. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us today. Drew and I will cover our usual business updates in a few moments, but first, let me provide an update on Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Unit 3 Hot Functional Testing is complete. Through the testing, we have validated the operation of critical primary and secondary systems at full temperature and pressure and demonstrated that the design basis is sound. The completion of Hot Functional testing marks the last major milestone before and represent a significant step towards placing Unit 3 in service. So, the duration of Hot Functional testing was longer than we originally anticipated, we remain committed to getting it right, for all aspects of the project. Taking into account the length of hot functional testing for Unit 3, the remaining activities for both units, and recent productivity trends, we now project placing Unit 3 in service during the second quarter of 2022 and Unit 4 in service during the first quarter of 2023. From a cost perspective, Georgia Power share of the total project capital cost forecast increased by $460 million, largely driven by our updated schedule, recent productivity trends and replenishment of contingency to fund expected future risks. As a result, Georgia Power recorded an after tax charge of $343 million during the second quarter. With Unit 3 Hot Functional testing complete, our next and final major milestone for Unit 3 is fuel load. We project fuel load to occur sometime near year-end 2021 or early in 2022. As we approach fuel load, our commitment to get it right remains our top priority. And as the operator of these units, safety is our paramount objective and we strive to meet first-time quality standards prior to significant testing and operations activity. We will not sacrifice those commitments to meet schedule or milestone dates. The scope and time required for the work remaining to prior to fuel load includes; one, completion of the nuclear fuel systems and the associated documentation, or paper, as I referred to it in the past; two, completion of remediation work and additional work identified during hot functional testing; three, completion of the work necessary to implement our plant support systems; and four, a reduction and productivity level consistent with recent site performance. Unit 3 ITAAC submittal and review process is ongoing and continues to follow our construction and testing activities on site. To-date, 208 ITAAC have been submitted to the NRC. We will submit the remaining 191 as we approach fuel load. Recently, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission conducted a special inspection of electrical quality issues that we had identified earlier this year, and the remediation efforts that are underway. The on-site inspection is complete and we expect the NRC's report to be published within a couple of months, though that exact timing will of course be determined by the NRC. Turning to Unit 4, direct construction is now approximately 84% complete and we achieved initial energization in May. Our revised construction productivity assumptions are consistent with recent trends. And as I mentioned, we now project an in-service date during the first quarter of 2023 for Unit 4. Our updated timeline for Unit 4 is reflective of several factors. First, Unit 4 experienced a slower than expected recovery from our COVID-19 related staffing reductions in early 2020. We call, at the time, the staffing reduction disproportionately impacted Unit 4 as we shifted our focus to Unit 3 critical path work fronts. We call, we reduced the density of personnel on the site and effectively move people from Unit 4 to Unit 3. Second, Unit 3 timeline, leading up to and during hot functional testing, delayed our plans to transition resources to Unit 4. More recently, we have staffed Unit 4 independently as work on Unit 3 continues. And third, over the past three months the growing economy and demand for skilled labor has impacted our ability to attract and retain electricians and, as a result, we experienced higher than expected attrition. Attaining the necessary levels of craft labor to meet construction milestones for Unit 4 has been more challenging than expected. In recent weeks, we have seen positive staffing trends, driven in part by offering the enhanced electrician compensation, which has helped to mitigate further schedule impact. Construction completion for Unit 4 has averaged 1.4% per month, since the start of this year. To achieve in November 2022 in service, we estimate Unit 4 would need to average 1.9% construction completion per month, and to support our first quarter 2023 in service, Unit 4 would need to average construction completion of approximately 1.3% per month for the rest of this year. Looking now at cost the $460 million pre-tax charge recorded during the second quarter reflects the schedule update for both units, including updated assumptions for construction activity and support resources, as well as replenishing the contingency for potential cost risks associated with completing both units. In conclusion, while the timing of Unit 3 Hot Functional Testing took longer than originally expected, I am encouraged by the success of the test. Even so, with completion of this enormous milestone, we still have a lot of important work ahead of us to get to fuel load. For Unit 4, we are focused on progressing through the next several milestones, while continuing to navigate through the COVID-19 pandemic and broader economic recovery efforts that have impacted productivity at both sites. As a company and a management team, we remain focused on bringing Vogtle Units 3 and 4 safely online to provide Georgia with a reliable, carbon free energy resource for the next 60 to 80 years. As always, I want to thank our employees, contractors, co-owners and community partners for their unwavering dedication to this important statewide project. Drew, I'll turn it over to you now for an update on the financial.\nDrew Evans: Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon everyone, I hope you all are well. First, I want to touch on the financial impacts of today's Vogtle update. We continue to be very committed to credit quality for both Georgia Power and Southern Company. Therefore, Southern Company will contribute capital down to Georgia Power to maintain its target capital structure and credit profile. We expect to fund the cash need at the parent company as it is incurred by reinstating new issuances under our internal equity plans, primarily the dividend reinvestment plan, which is expected to produce approximately $400 million over the next year. Importantly, with this financing strategy, we expect to maintain Southern Company's credit profile with consolidated credit metrics above current downgrade thresholds. This has a de minimis impact on earnings given our size, and we continue to see our long-term EPS growth rate in the 5% to 7% range and we are also reiterating our 2024 projected EPS range of $4 to $4.30. Turning now to earnings; we had strong performance in the second quarter of 2021 with adjusted earnings per share of $0.84, $0.06 higher than both last year's second quarter and our estimate. Recall in the second quarter of last year we were experiencing the peak impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our kilowatt-hour sales. This peak was primarily related to shelter and place mandates and working remote. And in response, we implemented significant cost savings initiatives. Therefore, it is no surprise that the primary drivers of our quarterly earnings this year, as compared to last year, we increased customer usage at our state regulated utilities, coupled with strong customer growth in the Southeast, as well as constructive state regulatory actions. As you would expect with rising kilowatt hour sales versus last year, our non-fuel O&M was higher due to increased maintenance and planned outages at our generating units. Weather impacts for the quarter were negligible year-over-year. When looking at adjusted EPS, as compared to our estimates for the quarter, the main drivers of the increased earnings were customer growth, that remains higher than our expectation, new connects are exceeding forecast by 25% and continued expense discipline. Year-to-date through June 2021, adjusted EPS is higher by $0.26 compared to the first six months of last year. Drivers are similar to those for the second quarter; increased usage, stronger customer growth, constructive state regulatory actions and are partially offset by higher non-fuel O&M. Year-to-date weather impacts were $0.08 favorable compared to the prior year and $0.05 unfavorable as compared to normal. A detailed reconciliation of these reported in adjusted quarterly and year-to-date results, as compared to 2020, are included in today's release and the earnings package. Turning to the economies in our service territory, we continue to see significant improvement from the lows we are experiencing at this time last year related to the pandemic. In the second quarter, weather normal retail sales in aggregate were up by 6% compared to last year, with commercial and industrial segments saw sharply and modest declines in residential sales. We have been analyzing retail sales compared to pre-COVID levels to assess recovery relative to historical norms. An early data indicate that in aggregate, our retail sales, have recovered to between 97% and 98% of 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Sales in the residential segment remained elevated due to continued hybrid working, while industrial and commercial sales remain slightly below the 2019 comparable; something like 97% of the 2019 level. In the Industrial segment, we are seeing strong momentum across nearly all sub-segments, commercial sales are also improving though sales may take longer to reach historical norms. As the COVID-19 delta variant becomes more widespread in the service territories, we will closely monitor for any signs of change, but have yet to see any material impacts. Underpinning these positive sales trends as a strong labor market evidenced by shrinking unemployment rates that are below 4% in both Georgia and Alabama. In addition, customer growth remains robust with new connects significantly outpacing our expectations across the electric utilities, reflecting construction new homes, as well as new commercial businesses and continued in net migration. Economic development continues to be very active in the Southeast. In Georgia alone there are over 200 active projects with the potential to bring over 30,000 jobs in the coming years. Capital investment and job announcements are far outpacing what we experienced even before the pandemic. These are positive signals for continued improvement of both customer growth and sales. With our solid adjusted results for the first half of the year, we are well positioned as we head into the peak electric load season. Our estimate for the third quarter of 2021 is $1.22 per share on an adjusted basis and consistent with historical practice, we will address earnings for the year relative to this EPS guidance after the third quarter. With that, Tom, I'll turn it back to you.\nTom Fanning: Thanks, Drew. We understand that global news often dominates our earnings calls, but I think it's important that we also focus on the terrific performance we see across our businesses. As Drew highlighted, our adjusted financial results of the first half are outstanding, and operationally, we are performing well. We have already endured a tropical storm in Georgia earlier this summer and our system has demonstrated resilience during the extreme temperatures experienced throughout this week in the Southeast. I would like to mention one more topic before we take your questions. Five years ago this month, we closed on our acquisition of AGL Resources, now known as Southern Company Gas. Our objective with the transaction was to deliver even greater customer shareholder value by continuing to invest in high quality predominantly state regulated utility assets, and we have done just that. We bolstered investment at the regulated gas utilities, continued to strengthen the position of our Retail Natural Gas franchise in Georgia, and divested non-regulated asset. Over the past five years. Southern Company Gas has; one, increased its JD Power customer satisfaction scores; two, increased its regulated business mix to 90%; three, increased its authorized equity ratios to 55%; four, increased our annual growth in rate base by 14% - by an average of 14% annually; Fifth, raised $3 billion from the sale of non-strategic assets, some at all-time high PE multiples and reduced risk by selling assets like the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Sequent Asset Management business; and then seventh, all while increasing opportunities for talented leaders to take on new and important roles across the Southern Company enterprise. A great example to that is sitting right next to me, Drew Evans, our Chief Financial Officer is doing a terrific job. And his breadth of experience and engaging thought process has helped us all. In summary, the acquisition has far exceeded our own expectations. The positive result of our gas business are indicative of the approach we take across all of our businesses and to the nine million customers and communities we are privileged to serve. This approach best positions our state regulated utility-centric business model for the future as we seek to maximize our return to shareholders on a risk adjusted basis. Once again, I want to thank everyone for being with us this afternoon. Operator, we'll go ahead and open the floor for question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nTom Fanning: Hey, Julien, how are you?\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, this is actually Cody Clark on for Julien. How are you?\nTom Fanning: Oh, okay. Great, fantastic.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: So, maybe first, if we can talk about Hot Functional testing. I'm wondering how you're thinking about the post-test analysis that you're kind of working through right now, you took temperature back down to [indiscernible]. And I'm wondering, this year, assuming that you have all the data now that you can kind of proceed, is there still the potential risk for additional remediation work there?\nTom Fanning: So, let me call a couple of things out that's interesting, I think. Number one is, everything is progressing right now as we said it would. In other words, now that we've completed HFT effectively, we take the car, and lift the hood, and look at the engine, and see what happened. The experience in China showed that there shouldn't be any big things happen. That's our experience in China. But certainly, that's an important part of work. The other thing I just want to point out because I know this has been a topic on prior calls, just want to raise this. If you recall, I want to say it was the first unit that went through HFT in China, actually had to re-perform their HFT. So they had significant operational issues concerning vibrations and a variety of other things. And that took over six months. We have passed through those issues, we learn from them, and for the issues they experienced, our plant worked great. So, we are as we thought we would be. And of course, between now and fuel load, as we called out in the script, there is certainly four big areas we do have to work on. I love page five, I think slide five, on the information we've given you guys this morning, you see Vogtle Unit 3, Cooling Tower actually has water vapor coming out of it. That was such a wonderful site to see. I was on site, frankly, when that was going on. But look, it was heated with affluent heat from the reactor coolant pumps, who performed beautifully during the test. Now we're going to heat it with nuclear fuel. So, we got to put all the systems necessary to get nuclear fuel in there and use that as the heat source. Secondly, as we went through the process of starting HFT, and then through HFT, we found some things we can do better to improve the long-term operation of the plant. We will do those things. And then, I called this out on the last call. We call them plant support systems, but this is essentially balance of plant activities HVAC portable water some signage, things like that that are necessary to support an operating workforce at the plant goes live. And then finally, we made an adjustment, we reduced actually our estimate of productivity of the workforce on site to more closely match our recent experience but that's what's left to get to fuel load. All of these things represent a significant effort, but I will say that the biggest risk was getting the HFT and completing HFT in an excellent manner, and we did that.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it, understood. Thank you for that.\nTom Fanning: And to be specific, one more thing, we have seen no data so far that gives us any concern, if that was part of your question.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. No, that's helpful. That's helpful. So, can you give us a little bit more color on attrition at the site, and I know that was brought up and some of the stat, in PCM testimony [ph]; what are you assuming in the new schedule and especially considering the enhanced pay that you mentioned?\nTom Fanning: Yes. So, we went through a period there. So we were really focused on getting HFT, getting into it, and going through it, and all that. And so, we weren't planning on doing a lot. Further, some of the quality issues we recognized - we want to make sure that we fully understood the scope of everything that we were finding so that we didn't repeat those mistakes on Unit 4, which I think we've done. At one point, during our meetings with co-owners, and the NRC, and the PSC staff, and Dr. Jacobs, and everybody that we deal with, we were seeing greater than expected attrition. And we really lay that out to, I think, the improving economy in the Southeast, but really big data centers that were attracting electricians. So, we exited two stages of compensation increases that really arrested that. So, I want to say, one week we hired 25 electricians and we lost like 72. And when we saw that, we were going, oh man, we've got to fix that. And I think now we have. Recent experience would say that since the adjustment in June - so, this would be, maybe four weeks of activity, we net added now, so these are net adds, 350 people. So, we have about a 1000 now and we'd like to get to 1200. So, there is still some hiring activity going forward for Unit 4 but we feel good about our ability to do that. And the other important point here is Unit 4 now is on an independent track from Unit 3. Okay? And we used to - and in fact, in prior earnings calls, we talked about, oh, an optimal relationship is nine months and 12 months. We have stopped the idea. It no longer is applicable to think about the track for Unit 3. Unit 4 is now on an independent path from Unit 3.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And then, just one more if I can.\nTom Fanning: Yes, sure.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Just wondering what the impact of the of the delta variant is on staff and if you're assuming any impacts from this in the current schedule?\nTom Fanning: Yes, absolutely. So, what we have been - we went through a period where there was just a handful of positive tests and they are up a little bit. Let's see, I guess our - we've had something like - since the start of the pandemic, something like 2600 people impacted. Right now, we have somewhere around 65. Okay? That would be our latest data. That's an increase. Probably a week or two ago, it was 25. About a week before that, it might have been 10. So yes, it is picking up. The other thing we're seeing is that, for those that are impacted, the severity of the illness associated with the virus, has been less significant. One other thing I do want to say, I don't think we have a slide here that shows the progression of HFT, It took us a while to get to full temperature, full pressure, but once we got there, the plant is running like a champion. It really has been stable. So, lots of little things along the way, we fixed them, and once we got there, it's been very stable.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay, that's great. Thank you for taking my questions. I'll jump back in the queue.\nTom Fanning: Thank you for joining us. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nTom Fanning: Hey, Jeremy. How are you?\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good afternoon. It's actually Ryan on for Jeremy.\nTom Fanning: Okay.\nJeremy Tonet: I guess, just wanted to ask one on any expectations that you kind of have heading into this kind of NRC kind of report. And then, they're very explicit about the Unit 4 timeline, but if there is any kind of - any kind of baked in there for Unit 4 regarding what might come out of that report, any kind of additional remediation or adjustments that might be required?\nTom Fanning: Yes. But I mean, this doesn't go necessary to the NRC report but rather it goes to - it really was involved and the time it took to get to HFT and the remediation plans we put in place to satisfy the quality issues we saw in the paper. And remember paper. It's shorthand for turning over from construction to system testing, to documentation necessary of the nuclear quality, necessary to submit an ITAC. Okay? So, when I say paper, it's actually a big deal. And I've said that in the past three or four call, what a big deal it was. And it has been a big deal. So, we put in processors in place to improve that effort. And our new schedule does include the effect of those processes, okay. The only other thing I want to say about the NRC is; this is their report, and it's in their hands. So, I certainly - as I wouldn't speak for a state regulator in any of our jurisdictions. I'm not going to speak to the NRC. I will say, as we have been completely transparent in all of our site meeting with all the co-owners, all, everybody there, the NRC is fully aware of what we found, and they are fully aware of our remediation practices. And that's about all I want to say about that. Let the NRC speak for themselves beyond that.\nJeremy Tonet: No, understood. Totally understand. And then, I guess, you guys mentioned the kind of the internal equity programs as a combination - I just kind of want to get a sense on the timing there. It sounds like, just over the next year - with the $40 million [ph] in trip or what kind of - maybe take longer, as kind of plan to potentially come online? Just got to make sure I have understood the message there.\nDrew Evans: Yes. Maybe I can give you a couple of sort of boundaries on this. Understand that what we'll experience or what we just reported in terms of increased costs, we won't actually experience until we start to move later into construction. So, these are incremental to budgets that really begin sometime next April. The sum total of those things, led to the write-down that we report today of $343 million. We are incredibly focused on credit and felt like there was a necessity to fulfill commitments that we've made to the rating agencies related to our coverage ratios in particular. And so the simplest thing for us to do is to turn on the DRIP plan, whether that's temporary or permanent, we'll just sort of monitors as we continue to monitor construction. The intent is for it to be quite temporary. But a single year of that program generates about $400 million, which I think, what we've just described to you as a debit it created by this expectation that's only three quarters of what we could issue under those plans in a particular year. But I would say that our single biggest purpose for this is that we have made commitments to rating agencies and to bondholders to maintain credit through construction and that is our singular intent.\nTom Fanning: And I think you said it in the script too, Drew, that we stick to the plan. The financial plans we put in place, the guidance that we did forward, the 5% to 10% range, 4 to 4.30. The impact of turning on for some time, the DRIP, is de minimis.\nJeremy Tonet: Understood. Appreciate the color. I'll leave it there.\nTom Fanning: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nTom Fanning: Hey, Mike. How are you?\nMichael Lapides: I'm well, Tom. Thank you, Tom and Drew, for taking my questions as always. One on Vogtle, and really one on Georgia. And specifically, in Georgia, how do you envision two regulatory processes playing from here? First of all, the timeline for kind of how you think about getting Vogtle 3 and the rates and kind of really the proceeding for that or the docket for that? And then, the second question is with Vogtle moving around in schedule a little bit, how you think about the rate case that you're supposed to file next year and whether you will just kind of push that off and trying and do all of this in one big docket?\nTom Fanning: Yes. So, to my admonition before, we certainly will not front run anything with the regulators or really kind of the plans that we have. I mean you, Michael, you know, you've been around forever and you follow us and do a great job with that. We've already laid out a framework to address cost recovery and prudence, and in fact, the Unit 3 rate proceeding right before the Commission is currently one of those early steps. So, let's leave it there. There is a whole lot of moving pieces in the constructive way, really, since I was involved in putting in place an accounting order methodology back in 1995, we've been able to manage really complex situations in a constructive way. And my sense is, with all the moving pieces here, we have a tough regulator, but I think they'll do a fair constructive job with it as we move forward.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. And then, a question about the jurisdiction no one ever talks about, no one ever asks, but obviously one of the better places to be a utility. How are you thinking about Alabama in terms of how continued change in the generation fleet may play out, as well as kind of how the pace of grid investment may change over the next three to five years?\nTom Fanning: So, great investments is an interesting question. And that's a much bigger than Alabama question, right? When we look at California and we look at URI, and we look at the dysfunction in the so-called operating - the so-called organized markets, it is very clear that all of our jurisdictions, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, have a very well founded and orderly way of evaluating a transition to a generating fleet and the integration, importantly, of transmission into the overall integrated resource plan. So, we have processes in place. All of our companies have embraced, to some degree, the idea of renewables. Recall in the past Georgia Power was cited as the investor-owned utility of the year by the solar industry. Recently, Alabama Power has embraced the idea of solar being part of their mix. Everybody has a different way to approach the problem. But I would say all of our utilities have a very constructive effective way of addressing the problem. And in a way where we're accountable, whether it's fuel procurement, generation, transmission, distribution, sales, we are accountable and we work with the commission to develop optimal answers for our customers. That is the best market structure and we've been able to do it for years; my sense will continue.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, Tom. Much appreciate it guys.\nTom Fanning: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.\nTom Fanning: Hey Paul, How are you?\nPaul Patterson: All right. How are you doing?\nTom Fanning: Fantastic. Thanks for being with us.\nPaul Patterson: Absolutely. So, just - this question just came up I think in - when I heard somebody else ask about COVID. I'm just curious, how many people - what percentage of your workforce is vaccinated? Do you have any number on that?\nTom Fanning: So, we don't know. But I would argue, it's somewhere between 35 and low '40s.\nDrew Evans: Probably not materially different than what we've seen in the general population in the Southeast.\nTom Fanning: Yes. We're not requiring people to disclose it, for example. We are requiring certain behaviors in the workforce, that if you're not vaccinated you wear a mask, you'll socially distance, etcetera.\nPaul Patterson: Okay, great. And then with respect to sales growth and COVID, I'm just wondering, as we've gotten further along, just sort of, if there is any change - what your outlook is post pandemic effects? When we're back to normal, is there a new normal in terms of what your expectations for total retail sales might be or how is that - what's your thought, I guess? Obviously, you've had a rebound and what have you. So, it's kind of noisy here. But just going forward, assuming, let's say, in 2021 - I mean, assuming at the end of 2021, we're back to normal, let's say, how would you think that the sales growth, is there any change, I guess, and what your sales growth expectations are for retail sales growth now, given the pandemic?\nTom Fanning: Yes. So Paul, let Drew and I double team this, because he brings a different perspective than me. But we've given you part of the chart package, I guess, page 11. It shows that to pre-pandemic residential is still up. So, here is one of the interesting things to consider; when we evaluate our workforce pre-pandemic, roughly 80% were kind of permanently in the office with about 20%, maybe 25%, mostly virtual, think call centers and things like that. When we tried to analyze what the new normal will be, the numbers are changing pretty significantly and it varies by local location, it varies by work function. But kind of wrap your head around this. I think we're going to be between 20% and 25% kind of permanently in the office with about round numbers 50% being a hybrids; sometimes they're in the office, sometimes they are working virtually. And then, we'll have that 20%-25%, completely virtually. If the rest of the world starts to follow this idea of a new normal, then I would expect residential sales to be up prior to 2019 levels. Industrial, appears to me to be racing back to Pre-COVID. So, we're kind of at 98% there. And the economic development activity that we see, especially - I mean, I'll give you one, Amazon - I think it's Amazon, is bringing a thousand jobs and investment of $250 million; that's one. I said if you guys watched Squawk Box this morning, I told them that in the economic development data, in forward-looking investment now. So, this hasn't happened but these are announced projects, versus 2020 are up 85%; and versus 2019, are up 65%. So, there is this burst of activity from investment. And jobs created is somewhere in the mid-20. So, what's happening? Residential may remain elevated, industrial is going to catch up, commercial is still a little bit of a question; we'll see. Drew, what would you say to all that?\nDrew Evans: I think you did a nice job of it. The only thing I might add would be around customer count itself. And so, we normally add something like 40,000 customers in a given year. This is largely residential. And we've probably added three quarters of that in just the first half of this year. So net in migration is a little bit difficult to separate from sort of use per customer, which is what we represent here. But residential is at 3% higher than what we would have expected pre-pandemic. And I think as you described that's probably here to stay. Industrial segments, we've had a couple of large industrial customers move in and out of more global productivity, or based on global economics, not a lot based on the region not being a good employer. And there are a couple of really strong sectors like automotive where there could be huge transitions that really benefit the Southeast and some. As with you, I'm very bullish on residential and industrial in particular. Commercial is going to take a little bit longer to normalize.\nTom Fanning: Yes, raw data, year-over-year. Manufacturing and Industrial was up 11.7%. The only one down there was chemicals. That was really an Olin plant that produced chlorine, caustic soda and stuff like that. And that's really, they just taken down their production, everybody else is up. We had three segments up over 30% year-over-year; primary metals, transportation and pipeline. So, [indiscernible] one last data point, which is full of this stuff. Georgia looks like it's going to be one of the first states to hit its pre-COVID level by the end of this year. And Alabama and Mississippi are expected to hit in '22. Those are some of the fastest recovering states in the United States.\nPaul Patterson: Okay, great. And then, just turning to Vogtle. The testimony by staff, I hope you guys filed a rebuttal testimony which is, I think, the normal course here. But luckily, Ben [ph] asked you to do rebuttal here or anything, but in terms of sort of this tension that they brought up about BD milestones and the quality of work and what have you, would you say with this hot functional testing that if they were to look at the situation now after that, given what you guys have found, how the plan performed with hot functional testing that perhaps those issues have - would probably be diminished? And my question, in other words, you mentioned that it performed very well. And I'm just wondering whether or not that may indicate that this quality of work issue that they were bringing up would be - would it be as significant an issue maybe as we move forward?\nTom Fanning: So, here is my view on that. I think there have been a number of interesting arguments that follow your question. One that has been a consistent difference we have had with the staff. For example, it has been our dogma in doing this project to fail quickly. And so, it was I think a big risk mitigated from our standpoint to test early, find problems and fix them before they became a bigger problem later. And also, the alternative to that would have been to completely construct the system and only test it kind of when everything is done. I think that would have exacerbated the bow wave of work. The criticism, well, the way you're doing it costs more money. Yes, we would agree, but I would also say, value is a function of risk and return. For the additional cost we have followed in testing early and failing earl, the risk mitigation characteristic overwhelmed the value. Remember, it is our posture [ph] to get it right, okay. We found a lot of issues going in, not deal-killer, not huge issues, but the issues we had to deal with going into HFT. We found more during HFT and we finished HFT. We don't think we will repeat those and in Unit 4. And so, we'll deal with that. We did go through a very rigorous argument on Unit 4 about whether we should estimate it being completed in the first quarter or the second quarter. And I remember, we came back and had another argument about it. And this is like in two hour, three hour-long argument with people on the site, everybody that is involved with the project. And we landed on the first quarter. Now, let's just go through the math. Ultimately, from where we are to in service, we're kind of projecting - no, I guess, we're projecting - no, in service, we're projecting 16 months. We've added four months. So, adding four months on top of 16 is in round numbers, something like 17%, 25% or more. And so, my sense is, that's a good place to be. If you were to add another quarter, holy smokes, now you're in the - you're getting near 50% contingency income made. And for the people who were on site that felt like too much. So, listen, we had good rigorous arguments. I think we've landed in a good spot. One of the things that we're particularly watching is - so, if you say, what is the riskiest thing you're thinking about right now? So, the work ahead of us, the big work is getting the nuclear fuel ready to go to be inserted into the reactor vessel. When we look at the testing of our spent fuel pool, we found greater than acceptable leaks in the pool. We tested Unit 4, and while this testing is still ongoing, we believe that Unit 4 is looking good. So, it is not a design problem. We think it is a welding problems - frankly on Unit 3. And so, we're undertaking a complete remake of the bad, of the spent fuel pool, in order to assure the floor of the pool, to assure that it will work when it's called upon. That kind of is the biggest thing in my mind right now that I know about. Okay? I feel very confident that what we've learned on three, through the end of HFT, and now it works, we'll apply that on four in a good way. And I will say this, nearly - and I'm sorry for going on here, but let me just finish with this. We completely respect the staff opinion. And we completely respect Dr. Jacobs. We respect our co-owners. Anybody that has an opinion on this, they all have a point of view that is valid. I'm giving you what we think is the best answer and the best outcome. And the thing that is so beautiful about this process, and anybody will talk about - everybody sees everything. There are no secrets. There is no smoking gun. Everybody knows everything as we build this plant. I think that transparency has worked so much to our advantage.\nPaul Patterson: Awesome, thanks so much.\nTom Fanning: You bet. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Kuczynski with Southern Company. Please proceed with your question.\nTom Fanning: No, he works for us. I don't think he - yes, that's a mistake. Go to your next question. Sorry about that everybody.\nOperator: Not a problem. And that will conclude today's question and answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks?\nTom Fanning: Yes, my question is what was Steve doing on the phone? For those of you who don't know, Steve is - he's terrific. He's the CEO of our nuclear business and he has direct management council oversight for the construction of Vogtle 3 and 4. And of course, there is a staff of people there. A guy named Glen Chick has been a hero of Southern, working so hard to make this thing a success. Here is the thing, I would leave you with, and I think the feedback we're getting from the analyst community is right on point. So, I think I'm telling you what you already know. But listen, me, personally, we all, sometimes we get frustrated with the tactics of hitting a milestone and a schedule. And the integration of the entire plant and making it work with a heat source that's not nuclear, but still making it work as it did. It was prolonged and frustrating at times, but you know what, once we got it solved, and once we got the plant at pressure, at temperature, it worked great. It was very stable. So, we fix those things. And we continue to work hard to make sure we don't repeat them on four. Still a good bit of work ahead between now and fuel load. I think we've outlined that carefully for you. And so, we look forward to getting the fuel load for Unit 3. Unit 4, for the kind of productivity that we have suggested to you, let's just deal with the percent completes per month. So, the 19 to 13, right, 1.9 to 1.3, we have done already at Unit 4, 1.4, and we have done kind of the 1.9 level on Unit 3 for seven and nine months at time. So, these are levels we have done in the past. In the estimate we have given you, we have estimated, however, lower productivity. That's to give ourselves a little more margin on cost and schedule. So, we're trying to be sensitive to really hit these numbers. Outside of Vogtle, we're very excited about the progress. But outside of Vogtle, this franchise, whether we're transitioning the fleet to a low carbon future, whether we're running the business to make it more resilient to extreme weather or attacks in the cyber and physical realm to preserve our national security, we are doing great. And we will continue to do great. And so, we're making progress on all of those functional front. Last thing, I'll just mention, when I think about our D&I efforts, when I think about diversity, and when I think about the improvements of culture - we mentioned to bringing Southern Company gas into the fold. I guess, bringing AGL in the fold now - Southern coming in - we have crossed populated Southern Company Gas now run by Kim Greene. Drew Evans is over here being CFO at Southern. The cross population, the learnings has strengthened our culture and increased, if you will, our cultural bandwidth. This company is better off in the long run for all of these efforts. And I think now when we've renewed our efforts on diversity and inclusion, we'll be even better. So, thank you, exciting day today, and look forward to talking with you in the future. Thanks everyone for listening.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Southern Company's second quarter 2021 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Drew Evans",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon everyone, I hope you all are well. First, I want to touch on the financial impacts of today's Vogtle update. We continue to be very committed to credit quality for both Georgia Power and Southern Company. Therefore, Southern Company will contribute capital down to Georgia Power to maintain its target capital structure and credit profile. We expect to fund the cash need at the parent company as it is incurred by reinstating new issuances under our internal equity plans, primarily the dividend reinvestment plan, which is expected to produce approximately $400 million over the next year. Importantly, with this financing strategy, we expect to maintain Southern Company's credit profile with consolidated credit metrics above current downgrade thresholds. This has a de minimis impact on earnings given our size, and we continue to see our long-term EPS growth rate in the 5% to 7% range and we are also reiterating our 2024 projected EPS range of $4 to $4.30. Turning now to earnings; we had strong performance in the second quarter of 2021 with adjusted earnings per share of $0.84, $0.06 higher than both last year's second quarter and our estimate. Recall in the second quarter of last year we were experiencing the peak impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our kilowatt-hour sales. This peak was primarily related to shelter and place mandates and working remote. And in response, we implemented significant cost savings initiatives. Therefore, it is no surprise that the primary drivers of our quarterly earnings this year, as compared to last year, we increased customer usage at our state regulated utilities, coupled with strong customer growth in the Southeast, as well as constructive state regulatory actions. As you would expect with rising kilowatt hour sales versus last year, our non-fuel O&M was higher due to increased maintenance and planned outages at our generating units. Weather impacts for the quarter were negligible year-over-year. When looking at adjusted EPS, as compared to our estimates for the quarter, the main drivers of the increased earnings were customer growth, that remains higher than our expectation, new connects are exceeding forecast by 25% and continued expense discipline. Year-to-date through June 2021, adjusted EPS is higher by $0.26 compared to the first six months of last year. Drivers are similar to those for the second quarter; increased usage, stronger customer growth, constructive state regulatory actions and are partially offset by higher non-fuel O&M. Year-to-date weather impacts were $0.08 favorable compared to the prior year and $0.05 unfavorable as compared to normal. A detailed reconciliation of these reported in adjusted quarterly and year-to-date results, as compared to 2020, are included in today's release and the earnings package. Turning to the economies in our service territory, we continue to see significant improvement from the lows we are experiencing at this time last year related to the pandemic. In the second quarter, weather normal retail sales in aggregate were up by 6% compared to last year, with commercial and industrial segments saw sharply and modest declines in residential sales. We have been analyzing retail sales compared to pre-COVID levels to assess recovery relative to historical norms. An early data indicate that in aggregate, our retail sales, have recovered to between 97% and 98% of 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Sales in the residential segment remained elevated due to continued hybrid working, while industrial and commercial sales remain slightly below the 2019 comparable; something like 97% of the 2019 level. In the Industrial segment, we are seeing strong momentum across nearly all sub-segments, commercial sales are also improving though sales may take longer to reach historical norms. As the COVID-19 delta variant becomes more widespread in the service territories, we will closely monitor for any signs of change, but have yet to see any material impacts. Underpinning these positive sales trends as a strong labor market evidenced by shrinking unemployment rates that are below 4% in both Georgia and Alabama. In addition, customer growth remains robust with new connects significantly outpacing our expectations across the electric utilities, reflecting construction new homes, as well as new commercial businesses and continued in net migration. Economic development continues to be very active in the Southeast. In Georgia alone there are over 200 active projects with the potential to bring over 30,000 jobs in the coming years. Capital investment and job announcements are far outpacing what we experienced even before the pandemic. These are positive signals for continued improvement of both customer growth and sales. With our solid adjusted results for the first half of the year, we are well positioned as we head into the peak electric load season. Our estimate for the third quarter of 2021 is $1.22 per share on an adjusted basis and consistent with historical practice, we will address earnings for the year relative to this EPS guidance after the third quarter. With that, Tom, I'll turn it back to you. Yes. Maybe I can give you a couple of sort of boundaries on this. Understand that what we'll experience or what we just reported in terms of increased costs, we won't actually experience until we start to move later into construction. So, these are incremental to budgets that really begin sometime next April. The sum total of those things, led to the write-down that we report today of $343 million. We are incredibly focused on credit and felt like there was a necessity to fulfill commitments that we've made to the rating agencies related to our coverage ratios in particular. And so the simplest thing for us to do is to turn on the DRIP plan, whether that's temporary or permanent, we'll just sort of monitors as we continue to monitor construction. The intent is for it to be quite temporary. But a single year of that program generates about $400 million, which I think, what we've just described to you as a debit it created by this expectation that's only three quarters of what we could issue under those plans in a particular year. But I would say that our single biggest purpose for this is that we have made commitments to rating agencies and to bondholders to maintain credit through construction and that is our singular intent. Probably not materially different than what we've seen in the general population in the Southeast. I think you did a nice job of it. The only thing I might add would be around customer count itself. And so, we normally add something like 40,000 customers in a given year. This is largely residential. And we've probably added three quarters of that in just the first half of this year. So net in migration is a little bit difficult to separate from sort of use per customer, which is what we represent here. But residential is at 3% higher than what we would have expected pre-pandemic. And I think as you described that's probably here to stay. Industrial segments, we've had a couple of large industrial customers move in and out of more global productivity, or based on global economics, not a lot based on the region not being a good employer. And there are a couple of really strong sectors like automotive where there could be huge transitions that really benefit the Southeast and some. As with you, I'm very bullish on residential and industrial in particular. Commercial is going to take a little bit longer to normalize."

            "name": "Tom Fanning",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us today. Drew and I will cover our usual business updates in a few moments, but first, let me provide an update on Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Unit 3 Hot Functional Testing is complete. Through the testing, we have validated the operation of critical primary and secondary systems at full temperature and pressure and demonstrated that the design basis is sound. The completion of Hot Functional testing marks the last major milestone before and represent a significant step towards placing Unit 3 in service. So, the duration of Hot Functional testing was longer than we originally anticipated, we remain committed to getting it right, for all aspects of the project. Taking into account the length of hot functional testing for Unit 3, the remaining activities for both units, and recent productivity trends, we now project placing Unit 3 in service during the second quarter of 2022 and Unit 4 in service during the first quarter of 2023. From a cost perspective, Georgia Power share of the total project capital cost forecast increased by $460 million, largely driven by our updated schedule, recent productivity trends and replenishment of contingency to fund expected future risks. As a result, Georgia Power recorded an after tax charge of $343 million during the second quarter. With Unit 3 Hot Functional testing complete, our next and final major milestone for Unit 3 is fuel load. We project fuel load to occur sometime near year-end 2021 or early in 2022. As we approach fuel load, our commitment to get it right remains our top priority. And as the operator of these units, safety is our paramount objective and we strive to meet first-time quality standards prior to significant testing and operations activity. We will not sacrifice those commitments to meet schedule or milestone dates. The scope and time required for the work remaining to prior to fuel load includes; one, completion of the nuclear fuel systems and the associated documentation, or paper, as I referred to it in the past; two, completion of remediation work and additional work identified during hot functional testing; three, completion of the work necessary to implement our plant support systems; and four, a reduction and productivity level consistent with recent site performance. Unit 3 ITAAC submittal and review process is ongoing and continues to follow our construction and testing activities on site. To-date, 208 ITAAC have been submitted to the NRC. We will submit the remaining 191 as we approach fuel load. Recently, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission conducted a special inspection of electrical quality issues that we had identified earlier this year, and the remediation efforts that are underway. The on-site inspection is complete and we expect the NRC's report to be published within a couple of months, though that exact timing will of course be determined by the NRC. Turning to Unit 4, direct construction is now approximately 84% complete and we achieved initial energization in May. Our revised construction productivity assumptions are consistent with recent trends. And as I mentioned, we now project an in-service date during the first quarter of 2023 for Unit 4. Our updated timeline for Unit 4 is reflective of several factors. First, Unit 4 experienced a slower than expected recovery from our COVID-19 related staffing reductions in early 2020. We call, at the time, the staffing reduction disproportionately impacted Unit 4 as we shifted our focus to Unit 3 critical path work fronts. We call, we reduced the density of personnel on the site and effectively move people from Unit 4 to Unit 3. Second, Unit 3 timeline, leading up to and during hot functional testing, delayed our plans to transition resources to Unit 4. More recently, we have staffed Unit 4 independently as work on Unit 3 continues. And third, over the past three months the growing economy and demand for skilled labor has impacted our ability to attract and retain electricians and, as a result, we experienced higher than expected attrition. Attaining the necessary levels of craft labor to meet construction milestones for Unit 4 has been more challenging than expected. In recent weeks, we have seen positive staffing trends, driven in part by offering the enhanced electrician compensation, which has helped to mitigate further schedule impact. Construction completion for Unit 4 has averaged 1.4% per month, since the start of this year. To achieve in November 2022 in service, we estimate Unit 4 would need to average 1.9% construction completion per month, and to support our first quarter 2023 in service, Unit 4 would need to average construction completion of approximately 1.3% per month for the rest of this year. Looking now at cost the $460 million pre-tax charge recorded during the second quarter reflects the schedule update for both units, including updated assumptions for construction activity and support resources, as well as replenishing the contingency for potential cost risks associated with completing both units. In conclusion, while the timing of Unit 3 Hot Functional Testing took longer than originally expected, I am encouraged by the success of the test. Even so, with completion of this enormous milestone, we still have a lot of important work ahead of us to get to fuel load. For Unit 4, we are focused on progressing through the next several milestones, while continuing to navigate through the COVID-19 pandemic and broader economic recovery efforts that have impacted productivity at both sites. As a company and a management team, we remain focused on bringing Vogtle Units 3 and 4 safely online to provide Georgia with a reliable, carbon free energy resource for the next 60 to 80 years. As always, I want to thank our employees, contractors, co-owners and community partners for their unwavering dedication to this important statewide project. Drew, I'll turn it over to you now for an update on the financial. Thanks, Drew. We understand that global news often dominates our earnings calls, but I think it's important that we also focus on the terrific performance we see across our businesses. As Drew highlighted, our adjusted financial results of the first half are outstanding, and operationally, we are performing well. We have already endured a tropical storm in Georgia earlier this summer and our system has demonstrated resilience during the extreme temperatures experienced throughout this week in the Southeast. I would like to mention one more topic before we take your questions. Five years ago this month, we closed on our acquisition of AGL Resources, now known as Southern Company Gas. Our objective with the transaction was to deliver even greater customer shareholder value by continuing to invest in high quality predominantly state regulated utility assets, and we have done just that. We bolstered investment at the regulated gas utilities, continued to strengthen the position of our Retail Natural Gas franchise in Georgia, and divested non-regulated asset. Over the past five years. Southern Company Gas has; one, increased its JD Power customer satisfaction scores; two, increased its regulated business mix to 90%; three, increased its authorized equity ratios to 55%; four, increased our annual growth in rate base by 14% - by an average of 14% annually; Fifth, raised $3 billion from the sale of non-strategic assets, some at all-time high PE multiples and reduced risk by selling assets like the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Sequent Asset Management business; and then seventh, all while increasing opportunities for talented leaders to take on new and important roles across the Southern Company enterprise. A great example to that is sitting right next to me, Drew Evans, our Chief Financial Officer is doing a terrific job. And his breadth of experience and engaging thought process has helped us all. In summary, the acquisition has far exceeded our own expectations. The positive result of our gas business are indicative of the approach we take across all of our businesses and to the nine million customers and communities we are privileged to serve. This approach best positions our state regulated utility-centric business model for the future as we seek to maximize our return to shareholders on a risk adjusted basis. Once again, I want to thank everyone for being with us this afternoon. Operator, we'll go ahead and open the floor for question. Hey, Julien, how are you? Oh, okay. Great, fantastic. So, let me call a couple of things out that's interesting, I think. Number one is, everything is progressing right now as we said it would. In other words, now that we've completed HFT effectively, we take the car, and lift the hood, and look at the engine, and see what happened. The experience in China showed that there shouldn't be any big things happen. That's our experience in China. But certainly, that's an important part of work. The other thing I just want to point out because I know this has been a topic on prior calls, just want to raise this. If you recall, I want to say it was the first unit that went through HFT in China, actually had to re-perform their HFT. So they had significant operational issues concerning vibrations and a variety of other things. And that took over six months. We have passed through those issues, we learn from them, and for the issues they experienced, our plant worked great. So, we are as we thought we would be. And of course, between now and fuel load, as we called out in the script, there is certainly four big areas we do have to work on. I love page five, I think slide five, on the information we've given you guys this morning, you see Vogtle Unit 3, Cooling Tower actually has water vapor coming out of it. That was such a wonderful site to see. I was on site, frankly, when that was going on. But look, it was heated with affluent heat from the reactor coolant pumps, who performed beautifully during the test. Now we're going to heat it with nuclear fuel. So, we got to put all the systems necessary to get nuclear fuel in there and use that as the heat source. Secondly, as we went through the process of starting HFT, and then through HFT, we found some things we can do better to improve the long-term operation of the plant. We will do those things. And then, I called this out on the last call. We call them plant support systems, but this is essentially balance of plant activities HVAC portable water some signage, things like that that are necessary to support an operating workforce at the plant goes live. And then finally, we made an adjustment, we reduced actually our estimate of productivity of the workforce on site to more closely match our recent experience but that's what's left to get to fuel load. All of these things represent a significant effort, but I will say that the biggest risk was getting the HFT and completing HFT in an excellent manner, and we did that. And to be specific, one more thing, we have seen no data so far that gives us any concern, if that was part of your question. Yes. So, we went through a period there. So we were really focused on getting HFT, getting into it, and going through it, and all that. And so, we weren't planning on doing a lot. Further, some of the quality issues we recognized - we want to make sure that we fully understood the scope of everything that we were finding so that we didn't repeat those mistakes on Unit 4, which I think we've done. At one point, during our meetings with co-owners, and the NRC, and the PSC staff, and Dr. Jacobs, and everybody that we deal with, we were seeing greater than expected attrition. And we really lay that out to, I think, the improving economy in the Southeast, but really big data centers that were attracting electricians. So, we exited two stages of compensation increases that really arrested that. So, I want to say, one week we hired 25 electricians and we lost like 72. And when we saw that, we were going, oh man, we've got to fix that. And I think now we have. Recent experience would say that since the adjustment in June - so, this would be, maybe four weeks of activity, we net added now, so these are net adds, 350 people. So, we have about a 1000 now and we'd like to get to 1200. So, there is still some hiring activity going forward for Unit 4 but we feel good about our ability to do that. And the other important point here is Unit 4 now is on an independent track from Unit 3. Okay? And we used to - and in fact, in prior earnings calls, we talked about, oh, an optimal relationship is nine months and 12 months. We have stopped the idea. It no longer is applicable to think about the track for Unit 3. Unit 4 is now on an independent path from Unit 3. Yes, sure. Yes, absolutely. So, what we have been - we went through a period where there was just a handful of positive tests and they are up a little bit. Let's see, I guess our - we've had something like - since the start of the pandemic, something like 2600 people impacted. Right now, we have somewhere around 65. Okay? That would be our latest data. That's an increase. Probably a week or two ago, it was 25. About a week before that, it might have been 10. So yes, it is picking up. The other thing we're seeing is that, for those that are impacted, the severity of the illness associated with the virus, has been less significant. One other thing I do want to say, I don't think we have a slide here that shows the progression of HFT, It took us a while to get to full temperature, full pressure, but once we got there, the plant is running like a champion. It really has been stable. So, lots of little things along the way, we fixed them, and once we got there, it's been very stable. Thank you for joining us. Appreciate it. Hey, Jeremy. How are you? Okay. Yes. But I mean, this doesn't go necessary to the NRC report but rather it goes to - it really was involved and the time it took to get to HFT and the remediation plans we put in place to satisfy the quality issues we saw in the paper. And remember paper. It's shorthand for turning over from construction to system testing, to documentation necessary of the nuclear quality, necessary to submit an ITAC. Okay? So, when I say paper, it's actually a big deal. And I've said that in the past three or four call, what a big deal it was. And it has been a big deal. So, we put in processors in place to improve that effort. And our new schedule does include the effect of those processes, okay. The only other thing I want to say about the NRC is; this is their report, and it's in their hands. So, I certainly - as I wouldn't speak for a state regulator in any of our jurisdictions. I'm not going to speak to the NRC. I will say, as we have been completely transparent in all of our site meeting with all the co-owners, all, everybody there, the NRC is fully aware of what we found, and they are fully aware of our remediation practices. And that's about all I want to say about that. Let the NRC speak for themselves beyond that. And I think you said it in the script too, Drew, that we stick to the plan. The financial plans we put in place, the guidance that we did forward, the 5% to 10% range, 4 to 4.30. The impact of turning on for some time, the DRIP, is de minimis. Thank you. Hey, Mike. How are you? Yes. So, to my admonition before, we certainly will not front run anything with the regulators or really kind of the plans that we have. I mean you, Michael, you know, you've been around forever and you follow us and do a great job with that. We've already laid out a framework to address cost recovery and prudence, and in fact, the Unit 3 rate proceeding right before the Commission is currently one of those early steps. So, let's leave it there. There is a whole lot of moving pieces in the constructive way, really, since I was involved in putting in place an accounting order methodology back in 1995, we've been able to manage really complex situations in a constructive way. And my sense is, with all the moving pieces here, we have a tough regulator, but I think they'll do a fair constructive job with it as we move forward. So, great investments is an interesting question. And that's a much bigger than Alabama question, right? When we look at California and we look at URI, and we look at the dysfunction in the so-called operating - the so-called organized markets, it is very clear that all of our jurisdictions, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, have a very well founded and orderly way of evaluating a transition to a generating fleet and the integration, importantly, of transmission into the overall integrated resource plan. So, we have processes in place. All of our companies have embraced, to some degree, the idea of renewables. Recall in the past Georgia Power was cited as the investor-owned utility of the year by the solar industry. Recently, Alabama Power has embraced the idea of solar being part of their mix. Everybody has a different way to approach the problem. But I would say all of our utilities have a very constructive effective way of addressing the problem. And in a way where we're accountable, whether it's fuel procurement, generation, transmission, distribution, sales, we are accountable and we work with the commission to develop optimal answers for our customers. That is the best market structure and we've been able to do it for years; my sense will continue. Thank you. Hey Paul, How are you? Fantastic. Thanks for being with us. So, we don't know. But I would argue, it's somewhere between 35 and low '40s. Yes. We're not requiring people to disclose it, for example. We are requiring certain behaviors in the workforce, that if you're not vaccinated you wear a mask, you'll socially distance, etcetera. Yes. So Paul, let Drew and I double team this, because he brings a different perspective than me. But we've given you part of the chart package, I guess, page 11. It shows that to pre-pandemic residential is still up. So, here is one of the interesting things to consider; when we evaluate our workforce pre-pandemic, roughly 80% were kind of permanently in the office with about 20%, maybe 25%, mostly virtual, think call centers and things like that. When we tried to analyze what the new normal will be, the numbers are changing pretty significantly and it varies by local location, it varies by work function. But kind of wrap your head around this. I think we're going to be between 20% and 25% kind of permanently in the office with about round numbers 50% being a hybrids; sometimes they're in the office, sometimes they are working virtually. And then, we'll have that 20%-25%, completely virtually. If the rest of the world starts to follow this idea of a new normal, then I would expect residential sales to be up prior to 2019 levels. Industrial, appears to me to be racing back to Pre-COVID. So, we're kind of at 98% there. And the economic development activity that we see, especially - I mean, I'll give you one, Amazon - I think it's Amazon, is bringing a thousand jobs and investment of $250 million; that's one. I said if you guys watched Squawk Box this morning, I told them that in the economic development data, in forward-looking investment now. So, this hasn't happened but these are announced projects, versus 2020 are up 85%; and versus 2019, are up 65%. So, there is this burst of activity from investment. And jobs created is somewhere in the mid-20. So, what's happening? Residential may remain elevated, industrial is going to catch up, commercial is still a little bit of a question; we'll see. Drew, what would you say to all that? Yes, raw data, year-over-year. Manufacturing and Industrial was up 11.7%. The only one down there was chemicals. That was really an Olin plant that produced chlorine, caustic soda and stuff like that. And that's really, they just taken down their production, everybody else is up. We had three segments up over 30% year-over-year; primary metals, transportation and pipeline. So, [indiscernible] one last data point, which is full of this stuff. Georgia looks like it's going to be one of the first states to hit its pre-COVID level by the end of this year. And Alabama and Mississippi are expected to hit in '22. Those are some of the fastest recovering states in the United States. So, here is my view on that. I think there have been a number of interesting arguments that follow your question. One that has been a consistent difference we have had with the staff. For example, it has been our dogma in doing this project to fail quickly. And so, it was I think a big risk mitigated from our standpoint to test early, find problems and fix them before they became a bigger problem later. And also, the alternative to that would have been to completely construct the system and only test it kind of when everything is done. I think that would have exacerbated the bow wave of work. The criticism, well, the way you're doing it costs more money. Yes, we would agree, but I would also say, value is a function of risk and return. For the additional cost we have followed in testing early and failing earl, the risk mitigation characteristic overwhelmed the value. Remember, it is our posture [ph] to get it right, okay. We found a lot of issues going in, not deal-killer, not huge issues, but the issues we had to deal with going into HFT. We found more during HFT and we finished HFT. We don't think we will repeat those and in Unit 4. And so, we'll deal with that. We did go through a very rigorous argument on Unit 4 about whether we should estimate it being completed in the first quarter or the second quarter. And I remember, we came back and had another argument about it. And this is like in two hour, three hour-long argument with people on the site, everybody that is involved with the project. And we landed on the first quarter. Now, let's just go through the math. Ultimately, from where we are to in service, we're kind of projecting - no, I guess, we're projecting - no, in service, we're projecting 16 months. We've added four months. So, adding four months on top of 16 is in round numbers, something like 17%, 25% or more. And so, my sense is, that's a good place to be. If you were to add another quarter, holy smokes, now you're in the - you're getting near 50% contingency income made. And for the people who were on site that felt like too much. So, listen, we had good rigorous arguments. I think we've landed in a good spot. One of the things that we're particularly watching is - so, if you say, what is the riskiest thing you're thinking about right now? So, the work ahead of us, the big work is getting the nuclear fuel ready to go to be inserted into the reactor vessel. When we look at the testing of our spent fuel pool, we found greater than acceptable leaks in the pool. We tested Unit 4, and while this testing is still ongoing, we believe that Unit 4 is looking good. So, it is not a design problem. We think it is a welding problems - frankly on Unit 3. And so, we're undertaking a complete remake of the bad, of the spent fuel pool, in order to assure the floor of the pool, to assure that it will work when it's called upon. That kind of is the biggest thing in my mind right now that I know about. Okay? I feel very confident that what we've learned on three, through the end of HFT, and now it works, we'll apply that on four in a good way. And I will say this, nearly - and I'm sorry for going on here, but let me just finish with this. We completely respect the staff opinion. And we completely respect Dr. Jacobs. We respect our co-owners. Anybody that has an opinion on this, they all have a point of view that is valid. I'm giving you what we think is the best answer and the best outcome. And the thing that is so beautiful about this process, and anybody will talk about - everybody sees everything. There are no secrets. There is no smoking gun. Everybody knows everything as we build this plant. I think that transparency has worked so much to our advantage. You bet. Thank you. No, he works for us. I don't think he - yes, that's a mistake. Go to your next question. Sorry about that everybody. Yes, my question is what was Steve doing on the phone? For those of you who don't know, Steve is - he's terrific. He's the CEO of our nuclear business and he has direct management council oversight for the construction of Vogtle 3 and 4. And of course, there is a staff of people there. A guy named Glen Chick has been a hero of Southern, working so hard to make this thing a success. Here is the thing, I would leave you with, and I think the feedback we're getting from the analyst community is right on point. So, I think I'm telling you what you already know. But listen, me, personally, we all, sometimes we get frustrated with the tactics of hitting a milestone and a schedule. And the integration of the entire plant and making it work with a heat source that's not nuclear, but still making it work as it did. It was prolonged and frustrating at times, but you know what, once we got it solved, and once we got the plant at pressure, at temperature, it worked great. It was very stable. So, we fix those things. And we continue to work hard to make sure we don't repeat them on four. Still a good bit of work ahead between now and fuel load. I think we've outlined that carefully for you. And so, we look forward to getting the fuel load for Unit 3. Unit 4, for the kind of productivity that we have suggested to you, let's just deal with the percent completes per month. So, the 19 to 13, right, 1.9 to 1.3, we have done already at Unit 4, 1.4, and we have done kind of the 1.9 level on Unit 3 for seven and nine months at time. So, these are levels we have done in the past. In the estimate we have given you, we have estimated, however, lower productivity. That's to give ourselves a little more margin on cost and schedule. So, we're trying to be sensitive to really hit these numbers. Outside of Vogtle, we're very excited about the progress. But outside of Vogtle, this franchise, whether we're transitioning the fleet to a low carbon future, whether we're running the business to make it more resilient to extreme weather or attacks in the cyber and physical realm to preserve our national security, we are doing great. And we will continue to do great. And so, we're making progress on all of those functional front. Last thing, I'll just mention, when I think about our D&I efforts, when I think about diversity, and when I think about the improvements of culture - we mentioned to bringing Southern Company gas into the fold. I guess, bringing AGL in the fold now - Southern coming in - we have crossed populated Southern Company Gas now run by Kim Greene. Drew Evans is over here being CFO at Southern. The cross population, the learnings has strengthened our culture and increased, if you will, our cultural bandwidth. This company is better off in the long run for all of these efforts. And I think now when we've renewed our efforts on diversity and inclusion, we'll be even better. So, thank you, exciting day today, and look forward to talking with you in the future. Thanks everyone for listening."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Southern Company First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today’s conference is being recorded Thursday, April 29, 2021. I would now like to turn the conference over to Scott Gammill, Investor Relations Director. Please, go ahead, sir.\nScott Gammill: Thank you, Dimitra. Good afternoon, and welcome to Southern Company’s first quarter 2021 earnings call. Joining me today are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Drew Evans, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you, we’ll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measures are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I’ll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.\nTom Fanning: Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we reported a strong start to the year with adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2021 ahead of our estimate. The economies in our service territories are starting to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and the customer demand remains mildly lower than pre-pandemic levels during the first quarter, it exceeded our expectation. Importantly, many of the programs we implemented to keep customers connected during the pandemic have proven to be very effective. We have reliably provided energy to our customers and facilitated alternative payment arrangements for those in need. I continue to be proud of our employees and the ways we have partnered with our communities throughout this pandemic. This past February parts of our nation were contending with the effects of devastating winter weather that crippled generating units and power grids in Texas and beyond. At Southern Company, each of our businesses, including those with operations in Texas and the Southwest region performed well during this event. Our regulated electric and gas utilities did not experience any operational issues or related service disruptions. Southern Power was minimally impacted due to its highly contracted business model. Our wholesale gas services subsidiary Sequent Energy effectively served customers in need utilizing in large part, natural gas held in storage. And micro grids provided by power secure had a 98 runtime reliability producing over 2,260 megawatt hours of reliable energy for customers during the storm. The winter seasons atypical temperatures have also caused utilities across the country to evaluate their own system resilience under similar conditions. For Southern Company are vertically integrated structure and integrated resource planning process as we utilize across our Southeast electric utilities have beneficial for years in allowing us along with our regulators to carefully consider, plan for, and invest in infrastructure needed to address a range of extreme circumstances and improve resilience. We will continue to leverage the rigorous analysis and stakeholder input provided by these proceedings as we evaluate the potential for additional system enhancements across our footprint. Let’s turn now to an update on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Unit 3 Hot Functional Testing started on April 25 marking the last milestone in a series of major tests. Hot Functional Testing is conducted to verify the successful operation of reactor components and systems together and to confirm that the reactor is ready for fuel load. As part of the testing, the site team will run Unit 3 plant systems without nuclear fuel and advanced through the testing process to reach normal operating pressure and temperature. Starting Hot Functional Testing represents a significant step towards the operation of Unit 3 and ultimately providing customers with a reliable carbon-free energy source for the next 60 years to 80 years. The site work plan now targets fuel load in the third quarter and late December, 2021 in-service date for Unit 3, of course, any delays could result in a first quarter 2022 Unit 3 in-service date. Now, as we have stated in prior calls and important step in the system turnover process is to assure that the as built state of the plant aligns with the design basis and to resolve any differences. Before we close systems, declare them ready for testing and submit ITAAC. We are committed to the notion of getting it right. In recent months, Southern Nuclear identified certain construction remediation work, primarily electrical in nature that was necessary to ensure the quality and design standards were met prior to the start of Hot Functional Testing. We reviewed the project construction quality programs prior to Hot Functional Testing, we implemented improvement plans and we believe Southern Nuclear’s construction quality program is effective. Furthermore, the improvement plans we are implementing are designed to help drive successful completion of Unit 3 and improve performance for Unit 4. As the operator of these units, we are committed to getting it right, striving to ensure our safety and quality standards are met prior to significant testing and operations activities. We will not sacrifice that commitment to meet schedule or milestone dates. With Unit 3 direct construction nearing completion, and Hot Functional Testing in progress, our primary system focus include going forward one, successful completion of Hot Functional Testing, two, completion of the remaining construction system turnovers and testing leading to fuel load, and three, an orderly transition from fuel load to an efficient start-up of the unit. The ITAAC submittal and review process is expected to accelerate as we move into and beyond the hot functional test sequence. To date 188 ITAAC had been submitted to the NRC. We will submit the remaining 211 during Hot Functional Testing as we approach fuel load. Turning the Unit 4, direct construction is now approximately 80% complete. And the current site work plan targets completion in the third quarter of 2022, which would provide margin to the regulatory approve November 22 in service date. Earlier this week, the site came placed the water tank on top of the Unit 4 containment vessel and shield building roof representing the last major crane lift at the project site. Integrated flush is in progress and initial energization is expected in the coming weeks. The site is focused on increasing craft, labor resources and electrical productivity. We will continue adding incremental resources while also shifting resources from Unit 3 to Unit 4, which is expected to increase our current pace of construction completion. Construction completion has averaged 1.5% per month since the start of the year. In order to achieve November 22 regulatory and approved and service date, we estimate we would need to average construction completion of approximately 2% per month through the end of this year. And as a reference point, Unit 3 averaged approximately 2% during the second half of 2019 and through the first half of 2020, which did include periods heavily impacted by COVID-19. Looking now at cost during the first quarter Georgia Power allocated $84 million of contingency into the base capital forecast related to extending the schedule for Unit 3, performing construction remediation work and increasing support resources across both units. As a result, Georgia Power replenished its contingency by $48 million reporting an after-tax charge of $36 million at the end of the first quarter. While there was contingency remaining prior to this increase, we believe providing this additional amount of contingency is appropriate when considering the extended time necessary to reach the start of Unit 3 Hot Functional Testing and the potential cost risk remaining as we complete both units. The major risks that remain to our cost estimate are similar to those for schedule namely, one, our ability to increase earned hours and improve productivity or CPI at Unit 4, successful completion of the Unit 3 Hot Functional Testing, and three, completion of the system turnovers and subsequent testing lead it to the Unit 3 fuel load. Notably at this time last year, the onset of COVID-19 led to many uncertainties at the project site. The site team has responded in exemplary fashion, maintaining safety and progress toward completion of both units during what has been an unprecedented year. With effective COVID protocols in place and now the broader availability of vaccines, the impact on the site has decreased in recent months as active cases and isolation rates are trending significantly lower. We are very pleased that Unit 3 Hot Functional Testing is underway. We’ve consistently said that both the commencement and successful completion of this testing sequence will reduce risk for the project. And as always, I want to thank our employees, contractors, co-owners and community partners for their unwavering dedication to this important project. Drew, I’ll turn it over to you now for an update on the financial.\nDrew Evans: Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon everyone. I hope you’re all safe and well. As Tom mentioned, we had a very strong start to the year. Our adjusted EPS for the first quarter of 2021 was $0.98, $0.20 higher than last year and $0.14 above our estimate. The primary drivers compared to last year was strong performance at our state-regulated utilities, despite a comparative quarter that had very limited COVID-19 impacts. The lessons we learned during COVID-19 allowed us to maintain a relatively static cost structure as we saw a withdrawal of COVID-19 impacts from their peak. We saw year-over-year benefit of $0.06 from weather due to the extremely mild first quarter we experienced in 2020. Further, retail electric revenues increased in aggregate due to strong customer growth in the Southeast and constructive state regulatory actions. When looking at an adjusted EPS as compared to our estimate for the quarter, the main drivers of the positive variance were continued expense discipline, retail sales impacts from COVID-19 that were nearly 60% better than our forecast across all customer classes and significantly lower than their peak and residential customer growth that has continued to exceed our expectation by almost 50%, we added nearly 60,000 customers last year. A detailed reconciliation of our report and adjusted quarterly results as compared to 2020 is included in today’s release and the earnings package. Looking more closely at sales in the first quarter, weather-normal retail sales were only approximately 1.5% lower than last year’s largely unaffected quarter. This decrease was driven by the continued trends of higher residential sales offset by lower commercial and industrial sales compared to normal times. While residential sales remained elevated, commercial and industrial sales continue to be depressed by about 3%. As you would expect, the commercial sub-sectors most impacted by the pandemic continue to be office, restaurant and education. These are meaningful declines and we expect recovery to be very gradual, even with improving economic conditions. For industrial sales during the quarter, supply chain constraints appear to be affecting the automotive sector with primary metals and chemicals also down, but construction and lumber in particular are demonstrating early strength. In general, all industrial segments have moved stronger since the COVID-19 peak. The economies in our service territory are showing strong signs of recovery with retail sales exceeding our expectations in the first quarter by roughly 3 percentage points. A recent analysis produced by IHS Markit estimates that most Southeastern states, including Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi are predicted to return to their pre-pandemic peak employment levels by 2022, while other states may not return to these levels until 2025 and beyond. We have certainly learned that the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts are unpredictable, but the potential for more near-term recovery is encouraging. We mentioned on our last call that economic development trends are strong in our region, particularly in Georgia. And in fact, in the first quarter of 2021 alone, economic development announcements in Southern Company’s retail electric service territory, included the addition of over 3,600 new jobs and investments of more than $2.2 billion. We saw strong activity in both non-manufacturing and manufacturing segments with new project announcements across a variety of industries, including warehousing, distribution, scientific and transportation equipment among others. For the second quarter of 2021, our estimated EPS – our adjusted EPS estimate is $0.78. I would also like to call your attention to our recent dividend increase. At its last meeting, the Southern Company board of directors approved an $0.08 per share increase in our common dividend, raising our annualized rate to $2.64 per share. This action marks our 20th consecutive annual increase and for 73 years, dating back to 1948, Southern Company has paid a dividend that was equal to or greater than that of the previous year. The Board’s decision to increase the dividend reinforces the strength and sustainability of Southern Company’s business. This dedication to continuing our dividend increases combined with our projected long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7%, supports our objective of providing superior risk adjusted total shareholder return to investors over the long-term. Before I turn the call back to Tom, I’d like to spend a few minutes providing an update on some of our strategic priorities. On our ESG efforts, recall in January, Southern Company became the first major U.S. utility to publish a sustainable financing framework. Our first issuance was a green bond related to Southern Power’s renewable investments, further solidifying Southern Power is one of the largest green bond issuers in the United States. In February, we issued our inaugural sustainable bond at Georgia Power with net proceeds to be used for sustainable projects, such as our spending with diverse and small business suppliers and our investment in renewable energy projects. The Georgia Power issuance aligns with our ongoing commitments to the community and the continued growth of Georgia Power solar portfolio. We look forward to leveraging our sustainable financing framework for future financings by all of our issuers as appropriate. Also I’d mentioned that Southern Power has been very active over the last few years, establishing itself as one of the nation’s largest renewable generation owners with a total renewable portfolio of nearly 5,000 megawatts in operation are under construction. Within the last month, Southern Power announced the acquisition of the 300-megawatt Deuel Harvest wind facility located in South Dakota and the 118-megawatt Glass Sands wind facility located in Oklahoma. With these acquisitions, Southern Power now owns 15 wind projects and approximately 2,500 megawatts of solar across the U.S. along with approximately 160 megawatts of battery storage. The existing generation fleet comprised of both renewables and natural gas is over 90% contracted for the next 10 years. Finally, over the past three years, we have strategically simplified our business in order to focus our time and investments in our core operations. As another example of that commitment, yesterday, we entered into an agreement to sell our wholesale gas trading and services business comprised of Sequent Energy Management and Sequent Energy Canada and we expect to complete the transaction in the third quarter of 2021. We do not expect a material gain or loss on the sale of the business, there we’ll provide a return of the associated working capital and the elimination of certain credit supports of approximately $1 billion. As a reminder, we have always excluded Sequent’s earnings from our adjusted results due to its quarterly variability. So the sale of this business both reduces risk and has no impact on our adjusted EPS expectations for the remainder of the year. I’d like to personally thank the team at Sequent for their years of dedication and service to the company. I can tell you that it’s been my pleasure working with all of those individuals at Sequent for more than 20 years. And I really look forward to their continued success. Tom, with that, I’ll turn it back over to you.\nTom Fanning: Thanks, Drew. As I noted last quarter, we achieved a 50% reduction in GHG emissions in 2020, beating our 2030 goal by a decade. Earlier this month, we filed an integrated resource plan in Mississippi that includes the retirement of Mississippi’s last coal unit in 2027. Both Alabama Power and Georgia Power will work with their respective regulators over the next year and responding to the effluent limitation guideline rules, which they will reflect in their next integrated resource plan. We will also continue to work with all stakeholders in developing these strategies. Another note, we have historically worked in partnership with municipalities and co-ops in our region. We work hard on mutual respect and constructive collaboration. As an example of the wisdom of this approach, Alabama Power recently signed a long-term agreement with Power South of valued customer in Alabama, which is expected to create energy savings and enhance system reliability from coordinated planning and operations. As a part of this agreement, Alabama Power has the right to participate in a portion of power SaaS future incremental load growth. In closing, our strong first quarter positions us well to deliver on the financial objectives for the year, with the summer months and storm season ahead, our operating companies are well prepared to support the needs of our customers. And of course, all eyes remain on progress at Vogtle and we look forward to providing continued updates as we approach fuel load and in service for Unit 3. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we’re now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nTom Fanning: Julien, how are you?\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Good afternoon team. Hey, good to chat. Absolutely. So if I can – if we can chat here, you pointed out several factors that contributed to the progress of the project, right. But clearly, productivity is your focus area, it seems like from your prepared comments here. Can you talk about your plans there to turn around productivity? It sounds like it’s more so Unit 4 and Unit 3, but just all together, where do we stand more specifically numerically on productivity, we’re in the effective of – and what do you think you can do to improve that specifically?\nTom Fanning: You bet. Yes. Well, look, number one, we’re basically modeling forward experience on three for four. So let’s think about it. Do you remember last year? It really started about the last six months of 2019 through the first six months of 2020. Remembering when we were staffing up, effectively that’s what we’re doing now on four. We’ve delayed that and we’ve accounted for all this and revised estimate to complete and everything else. Because we didn’t want to release all these people to four until effectively, we finished three. So what we have done is just estimated that we can hit November with experienced similar to last year. We’ll get CPI up to, I don’t know, about 165 for the remainder of the project. We’ll be completing at least 2%. Now here’s where I think we have room for improvement. Remember, the period I just told you last six months of 2019, first six months of 2020. Included in that, we’re three waves of COVID, who knows what’s going to happen with COVID. But we have some reason for optimism given that we’ve expanded vaccines. It appears that the way they’ve gotten smaller, certainly our experience right now, it is way less than it has been. And so our view is productivity should rise. And so we have some level of optimism, obviously we can guarantee it that we’ll at least meet or beat what we did on Unit 3 with Unit 4, one last thing. There are always lessons learned on Unit 3 and some of the quality measures we just talked about going into hot functional tests. We’re applying all of those lessons to Unit 4 so that we won’t have to repeat them there. In fact, our good friends from Vogtle came to our last board meeting and reiterated the notion that we should see better performance on 4 than 3. All we’re saying is right now, Julien, that even if we did just what we did on Unit 3, we can hit November. We frankly believe and expect will do better.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. But we won’t see that uptick and replacing personnel until after fuel load.\nTom Fanning: I would say – so let’s go through the big risk factors going forward on three. I guess the predicate is you’ve got to have a successful HFT, right. I think the biggest risk factor, however, going forward is after HFT to fuel load, there’s two segments of work left that we still have to do and do well. One is, completing the work that really is related to nuclear fuel, right. HFT means that we’re going to use the effluent heat off the reactor coolant pumps to heat up the project. So it would be things related to nuclear fuel, like, the system’s required to remove the fuel from the fuel pool and move it over to the reactor core. It would include systems like finishing up the Radwaste facility. The second segment would relate to, what I would call broadly support systems, recall that we’re going to have about 800 permanent employees at the site. So support systems for those folks. So let’s think about HVAC communications, out of the water, things like that. That will support the people that are going to be working at the plant. And just to give you one more frame of reference, it’s taken a lot to get to HFT something like the latest work we’ve been doing, 60% of those systems are what we would call safety related. And by that you should hear complexity. The amount of work to be done in between HFT completion and fuel load is significantly less, maybe 60% of that work. And only about 10% or less of those systems are safety-related. So I will say this to you. I believe that’s the next riskiest thing we have to do, but it’s not as big a deal as it has been getting to HFT. And then the third final thing is having a successful run from fuel load in service. We feel pretty confident about that. Hey, last point, so I think, Julien, you are starting to see people move now, frankly, from Unit 3 to Unit 4. Certainly, that’ll get accelerated into the summer. Probably, it’ll start to max out around June, and then we’ll hit our numbers at Unit 4.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. Got it. Excellent. Thank you so much for the details, right. Best of luck. Appreciate it.\nTom Fanning: Thank you. Appreciate you joining us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nTom Fanning: Hey Steve, how are you?\nSteve Fleishman: Hey, Tom and Drew. Good afternoon. So just first on the – I guess one question on Vogtle, just the quality issues that you – quality control issues you identified on the, I guess, the release during March. I assume you feel like those have been remediated and maybe just give some color on kind of what was done to make sure you’re kind of on the right track there.\nTom Fanning: You bet. So let’s back up for several calls. And I use this vernacular, but I always caution you it’s just vernacular paper. But effectively that involved assuring that there was in the evaluation of the as-built site – as-built condition of the plan as compared to the design basis of the plant. That was harmonized. And where there were differences that we made adjustments. Some of that was work that needed to be remediated. When we saw this starting to delay beyond what we thought, recall that we were calling for last two weeks in March, kind of start of HFT. We decided to really stop and take a good look at the system. It appears that while there were some issues elsewhere in the plant, the concentration of issues really dealt with the electrical systems. And then when you think about what it takes to turn over a system. Effectively, when we saw these problems start to manifest itself, we caught it ultimately with our quality control program. And so in effect, we had to – we sat back and looked at it and said, no. Our quality control program does work. We have identified the system. We have remediated them, in order to start HFT. There are some things that we did catch that will continue to be remediated from the finish of HFT to fuel load. But we’ve sketched all that out and we’re pretty confident that everything that we know we’re dealing with. All of this is a part of our current cost and schedule estimates. I would say to that and Bechtel would agree with this. We talked about this with our Board that for what we have found, we think we are making adjustments to Unit 4. So that we will not, we should not repeat these issues going forward. That gives us more confidence in schedule and cost.\nSteve Fleishman: Great. Different topic, just the Sequent transaction and sale, did you name who the buyer was and just can better understand. So effectively, are you freeing up $1 billion of effective balance sheet through the sale, even if there is not a direct payment. Is that how to think about it.\nTom Fanning: Steve, it is – we have not announced the buyer because it’s something that they will likely announce on their earnings call that will come in future days. It is somebody very credible and respected in this space. And so we just think we’ve found a better owner for sequent than ourselves. We probably tie up something on average, like $200 million worth of working capital. So we have to provision for that within our credit facilities. And then because of the gross revenue or gross sales associated with that business in four positions, probably something like another $800 million worth of parental support. And so these things will be freed up after some transition, we don’t expect the transaction to close until the beginning of the third quarter, but we’ll alert you as things progress. I always want to say value is a function of risk and return. And when you look at it, we’ve never included any earnings from Sequent in our return. We’ve always asked them out as extraordinary items. They’re just too variable and it’s fascinating. I just have some quick data to show how variable we are. If you look at Sequent, even prior to when Southern made the acquisition, say from 2010 forward. They’ve averaged about $40 million in net income. They had two years, one was $260 million, and one was $163 million where they really blew out earnings. Other than that, the earnings were near zero. If you exclude those big years, so over nine years, they averaged about $4 million of net income. And since we’ve owned sequence, there’s been one big year, the 163 in 2019, and then this year. And then otherwise the earnings were around $23 million in net income. And so if you step back and look at it, number one, we x any earnings number two, because of the balance sheet, we are freeing up $1 billion that reduces our risk profile. So net-net to corporation values, we think this is a clear winner. I think one more thing I just thought to point out, Sequent had a really good earnings year in the first quarter. Thankfully, they had gas in storage, which supported the needs of the state of Texas primarily. You remember, there were constrained gas flows. Sequent was able to step into the breach and sell a lot of gas in storage and made a lot of – made some profits off of the volume that they were able to provide. Thank goodness to Texas’ customers that produce net income of around $200 million. In recognition of our commitment to communities, we took $75 million or so of that $200 million and put it into our foundation that is going to get cloud back into communities. So you’ll see net income per Sequent in the first quarter of around 133 or so. So look, we had a good year. I do think that the buyer is, as Drew said, a better owner. And know I’ve said that for years, a lot of M&A is all about who’s the best owner of any particular asset. And I think for what we bought and what we’ve sold, I think we’ve demonstrated our ability to bring value to shareholders every time.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And then last question is just on the renewables acquisitions and the wind. I’m just curious kind of what returns are you seeing there? Because I recall there was a period of time, where you had been saying that returns didn’t really look good for these transactions and then you’ve been ramping them up more recently. So I assume maybe that you started to see them improve again. Could you just give some color on that?\nDrew Evans: Yes. We think it’s really a tough business. We continue to believe that. And Steve, I’ve talked about that in the dimensions of the duration of the contracts, the terms and conditions of the contracts. And so it’s just been harder. There’s a lot of deals out there. I would say that our share of new deals has just been lower than historical, because there’s too much money chasing too many deals. We keep the same thresholds in place. And rather than comment on any specific deal. In general, what we look for is significant contract coverage. So in this case, 90% over 10 years, we look for those things and we generally get profits that are, say, ROE is plus 150 over our regulated business. That would be our general threshold rather than commenting on particular deals. But these deals that we just mentioned that drew just mentioned fit that profile.\nSteve Fleishman: Great. Great. Thank you.\nTom Fanning: You bet.\nOperator: All right. Next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nTom Fanning: Hey Michael. How are you?\nMichael Weinstein: All right. Doing good. Hopefully, you’re doing good too. Hey, just to follow up on that last discussion. Could you comment on your commitment to a business like power secure, also providing services out there? Is that – how is that different than sequence? What ways are you seeing more value there? Oh\nTom Fanning: It’s completely different. So we’ve talked in fact about a Venn diagram in the past, the three circles of a Venn diagram in this case would have been Southern Power, PowerSecure and Sequent. Now let’s think about that for a minute. Sequent, now let’s start with PowerSecure. PowerSecure has really been focused on kind of mostly the retail side of the business, particularly commercial and industrial customers, where resilient is particularly important. And in keeping with this 100 year old model of central station, make move and sell, projects at scale. PowerSecure essentially represents the idea of miniaturizing that century old business model and putting the make move and sell premise at the customer premises. So when you think about some of our major customers who do value resilience at an exceptional level, we can put a micro grid. We are by far the largest share of micro grids in the United States through PowerSecure. We can put distributed generation there. We can put proprietary switch gear and storage. And so this has been a wonderful kind of window on the world. Add to the Venn diagram what we’ve seen lately at Southern Power. Southern power grew up selling to other utilities or other co-ops or other munis and lately a great kind of a target zone for Southern Power has been companies, desiring green attributes. So general mills, general motors, carnival cruise lines, people like that that want to have renewables as part of their generation portfolio so to speak. The union of what we’re seeing at Southern Power in respect of that business, that market with the market that is served primarily by PowerSecure, there’s great overlap and great mutual synergy. Now we used to have Sequent as part of that Venn diagram, where we would in fact take over fuel management for some of the distributed generation at all serviced by our customers. We feel we can do that ourselves now. And selling Sequent does an impact to a significant degree, our ability to serve that need of our customers. And if we can’t do it, we’ll find somebody that can. So, and look at that – and one last thing I just want to leave you with, look at the data over the past few earnings calls we’ve done, through hurricanes, a winter storm URI and others. Sequent, I mean, PowerSecure is able to provide reliability in excess of 98% in general terms across these very devastating storms. This idea does work, I will say. PowerSecure remain kind of a peanut to our earnings. We don’t talk about PowerSecure in terms of being a contributor to earnings, even though it is earning a little bit of money. I think the bigger value we see is as an option to what maybe happening in the future. And that is because of technology, because of changing customer requirements, it gives us a window on the world that allows us not only to learn about this new market, but also to influence how it emerges and to position our franchise businesses optimally.\nDrew Evans: I just add, you describe it as window on the world, it’s sort of antenna into what the needs of the customer basis. It really looks like people are focused on an extra nine of reliability, but the assets can be used either to meet that reliability or it can be dispatched. I think our best example most recently is that we’ll do constructions at the Atlanta Airport to produce the kind of reliability that’s required there. But in terms of distributed generation, I think it demonstrates that folks are not really all that interested in prime power, but more interested in the kinds of backup and assurity that you can get out of the PowerSecure product line.\nTom Fanning: And the phrase I would use is distributed infrastructure, which includes beyond generation micro grid storage, it’s switch gear, et cetera. I think it’s a small thing, but it really helps us.\nMichael Weinstein: Right. More of a future look or keeping your finger on the pulse of where the technology is going.\nTom Fanning: That’s right.\nMichael Weinstein: Hey, along those lines, one more question on this subject and that’s battery storage. You have in the deck a couple of big battery storage projects standalone, I believe, is that something that you see more standalone battery projects like that getting built maybe as much as we’re currently seeing in our renewable projects. Is that an up and comer? Is that something with higher returns than wind and solar, something that may be replaced?\nTom Fanning: I don’t know about – it’ll be interesting to see whether the returns are higher. I think it’s an absolute requirement. We’ll build a couple hundred megawatts of battery, if you include what’s in the Tranquillity and Garland packages, but also what we’ll be doing within the state of Georgia. We’re building the two facilities we named as part of – as compliments to our existing solar facilities in California. But storage itself is probably the single biggest complication with the transition to renewables over the next couple of decades, whether it is going to be lithium-ion, which is relatively short duration if you think about how our system operates today or something more complex like compressed air energy or liquid air, liquid metal, pump hydro is probably another great example. We’re going to have to find ways for long duration storage to compliment the kinds of assets that we’re talking about on the renewable side. And one of the nice arrangements that we have within Alabama Power with a PowerSource is that they actually operate today a case facility that can deliver battery power for 26 hours. It’s been operating for almost 20 years. These are great experiments and understandings things for us to learn. I do think that battery will be an increasing area of investment for us. We just have to figure out what technology is most pertinent for the circumstances.\nDrew Evans: And I’ll just add, gosh, I think somebody is going to probably ask this later, so I’ll just do it now. But when we think about CapEx going forward, we think about transitioning the fleet going forward, it’s very clear to us that storage in some point, whether it’s short duration, intermediate, seasonal, that’s going to become important to support the intermittent profile of renewables. Gosh, I think to achieve net zero for us, we’re going to need about a 50% penetration, mostly of solar. And so on that cold winter peak day, you’re going to need a whole lot more megawatts to be able to meet those needs some storage, some CTs, some CTs with CCS, you name it. So hydrogen is important in that regard. So these are important projects too. That’s helping us understand better how to meet the aspirations of this administration. And just little more land out there, so we’re – supporters of the bipartisan policy center and I’m a member of the net zero business alliance, we’ve had a session already with some other CEOs from Tyson Foods, Occidental Petroleum, United Airlines, Weyerhaeuser and ConocoPhillips. We’re meeting again Tuesday with Gina McCarthy. And so part of our whole premise here is engaging constructively with the administration, with the concept of, yes, I am. That is we’re going to need the support, we’re going to need the administration in the boat with us to achieve that aspiration, assuming we have a supply chain availability. So we have labor available. The big issue for us to hit these kinds of numbers is that over the next 15 years, we will triple the amount of generation we will put on the ground as compared to any other 15-year period in our corporate history. It is a big lift. Assuming we get the support, can we do it? Yes, I think so. There are lots of policy choices along the way that make this a very complex decision.\nMichael Weinstein: Okay. Thanks a lot guys.\nTom Fanning: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.\nTom Fanning: Hey, Angie, great to have you with us.\nAngie Storozynski: Thank you. So I’m just wondering, I look I never heard about Sequent before, I’m going to be honest. I’ve never heard about pivotal either. So do you guys have any other like businesses we’ve never heard of that can either bring a lot of money or the purchase – or the sale price or like release some balance sheet capacity?\nTom Fanning: Not really. We’re working very hard to clean those things up. I mean, we do have cats and dogs around the place, but Southern investments, right.\nDrew Evans: Southern Holdings, I think we’ve divested of a number of assets over the last couple of years, but this is – Angie, I think our focus is just reduce business complexity focus investment on the things that we think we’re rewarded around. And this is just sort of evidence of it. Are there large pockets of these things? Not a lot. But equally, probably is a little bit less.\nTom Fanning: The less stuff that we’ve talked about in the past had been legacy stuff from mirror going way back there. We had – they had a leasing business. They didn’t have the tax appetite. So that came over with us. We’ve been dealing with that. Choctaw has been a part of that, we talked about that in the past.\nDrew Evans: Sold all the gas-fired assets outside of our general service territory, but really just trying to focus on our core infrastructure best.\nAngie Storozynski: But the 200 million, you mentioned that the business made in the first quarter that stays with you guys, right. So I understand that adjustments, okay, cool. And then on…\nTom Fanning: Angie, wait a minute, 200 million, we put 75 of that in a charitable foundation to help communities. So it kind of net it out at 133 or so, but that was a decision we made.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. And then on Vogtle, and I’m sorry for simplifying it this way, but I always thought about how to functional testing as the end of the construction stage of Vogtle 3. Now the past posts have functional seems to include a lot of construction and things. So is it that you guys have delayed a portion of that construction that it was still needed to be done before the fuel load, in order to – in a sense start of hot functional? You know what I’m saying is just, again, it feels to me that there’s still more construction to come, even though I saw hot functional the thought of it is the end of the construction cycle.\nTom Fanning: Yes. We adjust the construction schedule all the time to optimize cost and schedule. We try to do that. Heck, we do it every week, to be honest with you. In 2020, we did, this goes back to 2020. We did make an adjustment to push some of the nuclear related construction. Like I mentioned, Radwaste facility, like I mentioned, the equipment necessary to move the fuel from the storage pool over to the reactor. That was moved past HFT. The systems related to support the personnel beside had kind of always been there, I think. That was the last move, but that was kind of a year ago. And, and like I say, for the amount of construction left only, I don’t know, it’s 10% or less, we got into an argument about what’s complex and safety related, but it’s a smallish amount of that work that is in that vein left to do. So it was nothing that was tactically decided in my view to do anything with HFT. This is a decision we made back mostly in 2020, except that we make adjustments every week.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. And so just one follow-up. So is it fair to say that what’s left to be done and granted that is probably somewhat depends on what the hot functional testing and covers. But is it fair to say at this point, you think what’s left to began on the construction side is something pretty straightforward. And so it shouldn’t be prone to delays that we’ve seen in the past.\nTom Fanning: Yes. I wish, I mean, Angie, you’ve lived with us for a number of years here. I mean, there’s nothing that the EV every day I’ve described out there as a dog fight, but it certainly is less complex than what we’ve been doing to get to HFT.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. Thank you.\nTom Fanning: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nTom Fanning: Hi, Jeremy.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Ryan on for Jeremy.\nTom Fanning: Hey, Ryan.\nUnidentified Analyst: Just wanted to start kind of some of what you’re hearing at the federal level out of kind of the infrastructure plan. Maybe just regarding nuclear and kind of general federal support you’re seeing at the moment just a nuclear generation in general.\nTom Fanning: So this is an excellent question. Here’s my view. And let me speak broadly. The administration, if they’re going to hit their aspiration of 80% removal by 2030 and 100% net zero by 2035, and then move the whole economy to net zero by 2050. This is an important and awfully complex and difficult undertaking. And we are ready to support them however we can. And this is part of the conversations we’ve been having on an ongoing basis with this administration. As I mentioned, we’ve talked with Gina McCarthy before on a different level, I’ll be talking with her again next Tuesday. I think the administration gets it, that there needs to be a whole different level of public, private cooperation and collaboration, carrots and sticks, in order to get this done, I will say, talk in the book of nuclear that it’s important for the United States to keep nuclear as a priority. And so anything they can do to help to keep the nuclear assets alive really helps the United States broadly with their long-term goal. And that not only includes, projects like ours, current nuclear assets in operation that are at risk because of an imperfect market design, but also providing R&D support for the so-called Gen 4 reactors that may appear in the 2030 timeframe. All of this is an important part to achieving net zero for the economy by 2050.\nUnidentified Analyst: And then maybe just one more coming out of the federal level just high level thoughts, I mean we’ve seen I think some companies the early stages talking about kind of carbon sequestration, some focus on maybe improving some of the tax credits on that side. I don’t know if there’s anything that’s on your radar or kind of how far away you see that technology at this point.\nTom Fanning: Let me just say this. I think the wide build that’s kind of floating around right now is pretty supportive to kind of a long-term objective. So I would take a look at that piece of proposed legislation and see what it has. That’s a pretty good start. There could be lots of other things. It’s interesting. I did some media this morning and people were asking me kind of specific ideas. At this point there is more ideas than there are solutions, but we’re going to need to work together carrots and sticks. And you know what, at the end of the day, the objective function is not just carbon. For the American economy, it goes back to my work at the fed. It is so important to the fabric of our economic health as a nation. We got to get this right and then getting it right. We’ve got to balance the notions of clean, safe, reliable, and affordable. So all of these must work in balance to achieve a good result for this nation.\nUnidentified Analyst: I appreciate it. Thanks for taking my questions.\nTom Fanning: You bet. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotia Capital. Please go ahead.\nTom Fanning: Thanks for joining us.\nAndrew Weisel: Hey, thanks for having me. I’ve got a quick one on the balance sheet. It looks like you’ve dropped the expected debt financing plan for the next few years by over $2 billion. I imagine a bulk of that is the billion dollars of freed up working capital and pairing credit support related to Sequent. Does that also include cash proceeds from the sale and are there noteworthy factors there?\nTom Fanning: Wait a minute. I’m going to turn this over to Drew. The broad conclusion of your question is no. None of this has anything to do with Sequent at this point.\nDrew Evans: Andrew, I’d just say, the reason it dropped is because we did the long-term debt issuance of $2 billion. Sequent really only changes what we would provision for short-term working capital, so that would come out of bank revolvers and the like. But I would say if you aggregate what we actually issued in the first half, you’d come up with a number that’s almost exactly the same as what we had projected when we met with you last, but we can – we’re happy to walk you through the table, I think it’s Page 19 or something like that in the earnings packet.\nAndrew Weisel: Okay. My mistake, I think I just misread that table then. Sorry about that. But the $2 billion from Sequent would be incremental or no.\nDrew Evans: No. So we will – the sale will occur at or around book value plus or minus that’s a relatively small number, won’t have major implications for cash generation. We’ll then be able to reduce revolvers, because we’re getting a return of working capital. These numbers are an order of magnitude smaller than what you’re looking at on Slide 19. The other $800 million generally takes the form of parent guarantees or assurances for the underlying transactions that Sequent has entered into. Those aren’t the nominated on the balance sheet. They’re sort of off balance sheet assurances from parents. And so we’ll leave at that, yes.\nAndrew Weisel: Okay, understood. Thanks for explaining that. Then just one quick one on COVID, are you able to provide some numbers around active cases of COVID and absenteeism on the construction site? Tom, I think you said they’re trending lower, but are you able to quantify that and without getting into sensitive information, do you have any sense of vaccination rates among workers on the site?\nTom Fanning: I don’t on vaccination rates. I know they’re up. I saw a report recently that another 500 got vaccinated. I do know that. I can’t tell you what percent of the workforce is vaccinated that may violate HIPAA rules and all sorts of things. But right now, I mean I’ll just tell you the current report card only 20 people are tested positive for COVID on the site. At other times, we’ve had hundreds in that vein. The total positives since the project has begun at 25,000, we’ve had nearly 10,000 people tested. We only have 75 people in isolation right now. And that number, I think in one reporting period has been 500.\nAndrew Weisel: Yes.\nTom Fanning: So it’s way down, but you know that ebbs and flows and – yes, it is great to hear. I just don’t know what’s going to happen with these new variants and everything else. We are hopeful that the worst is behind us.\nAndrew Weisel: Agreed, fingers crossed. All right. Thank you.\nTom Fanning: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lapides: Hey guys, thank you for taking…\nTom Fanning: Hey Michael, how about those yellow jackets, man?\nMichael Lapides: You know what [indiscernible] super nice guy.\nTom Fanning: Yes, yes.\nMichael Lapides: Easy question for you. It’s been a while, but you all had previously I think disclosed what your potential coal ash remediation liabilities were. I think it’s been a couple of years. Can you talk about what that number is in dollar billions and the timeline you think you have to meet those requirements for the planes that are still operating. And to be honest, how material is – are the coal ash and CCR regs to not just your coal fleet, but the entire regions coal fleet.\nTom Fanning: I’ll turn this over to Drew. It’s $10 billion over 10 years.\nDrew Evans: Yes. And Michael, I think you can probably find all of that. We do a pretty decent detail of it in the 10-K every year. And so you can take a look at how that, that has modulated. As Tom said, it’s about $10 billion over 10 years. If I think about what’s in our five-year plan, probably 30%, maybe at most 40% of it is contained within that five-year period and then the balance hangs out over the end of that.\nMichael Lapides: But for operating – I’m just trying to get my arms around, how important of a factor this is in the retire, not retire decision for existing plant – for operating plants.\nTom Fanning: It’s not important at all. I don’t think, I made it, I came out one annual meeting and said we were going to get – we’re going to retire all our ash columns. And we did that before there was any legislation and all that other stuff. We were really ahead of the game there. I really think the more important issues going forward are things like the effluent limitation guideline. It’s going to be a big deal. What is that? We’ve got to declare by around October. So for sure, we are working with our regulators and the staff to get our arms around that issue, because you kind of have to make a declaration. And then as we said, I think in the script that those conclusions would be a central part of our filings in Alabama and in Georgia with respect to the integration – integrated resource plan.\nDrew Evans: The only thing I’d also point you to maybe is that we will have to make filings against the ELG requirements that’s effluent limitation guidelines in October, that will require us to specify for each facility that we operate, whether we intend to make investment, to continue its operation, whether we expect to close that facility or whether we will make some investment to put that facility into a condition that will allow it to operate something like 10% of the year. But I would say that coal, we are not producing generally wet ash and is not part of our investment or closing decisions on those facilities. Almost everything is based on economics and then the other constraint that we might face perhaps at the federal level.\nTom Fanning: Hey, and I’m going to reach back to other earnings calls, when I remember I raised myself skepticism about our CapEx that we show. I still think it’s thin. And we talked about transmission as a component of it’s been this. I believe that as you take all these issues going forward, when you start retiring coal plants, the generation has to come from somewhere. And when you think about renewables being so important, we need to think about reevaluating our long-term transmission plan in order to hit those kinds of objectives. And it may be that retired coal plants could be prime areas to locate some of those resources and built by our host company. But look this is going to evolve over the next, I don’t know, 10 months to 12 months. We’ll have a lot more information for you later. I do think the Mississippi signal is pretty important.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, Tom. Thank you, Drew.\nTom Fanning: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nTom Fanning: Durgesh, great to have you with us.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey, good afternoon, Tom. Thanks for taking my question.\nTom Fanning: You bet.\nDurgesh Chopra: Maybe I’ll start with Drew and then my Vogtle question for you, come back to you. Just Drew, on the quarter, the weather was looks like a bad guy versus normal. I’m trying to reconcile to the $0.98 to the $0.84 guy. Is that predominantly just better COVID trends?\nDrew Evans: It is. So if you think about what we experienced, we were expecting kind of a sideways COVID relative to what we experienced in fourth quarter and what we actually saw was something that was really just about a 1.5% reduction in total retail sales. If you think about where we were for the year, last year, we were down in aggregate kind of 3% on average in almost 7.5% on peak. And we’re just projecting forward as we think about second quarter assuming that we don’t really see much improvement from where we are today. So a little bit of sideways until we get a better understanding of what’s coming down the pike in terms of COVID.\nTom Fanning: And Drew, our COVID estimates were of the vintage of last October, somewhere around there.\nDrew Evans: Sure, for budgeting purposes.\nTom Fanning: And I think it stands we could reevaluate what the effect may be going forward.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. Okay. I mean I guess this is just the first quarter and you sort of the balance three quarters to go. So you’ll reevaluate guidance as we move along, but clearly you had a very strong start and look like on COVID terms, which early better than expectations.\nDrew Evans: That’s right. We always evaluate our guidance in October after we’ve gotten through the summer season. If you think about the major factors that influence outcome there – weather is always a dominant one, that’s difficult to predict COVID for sure is difficult to predict. We want to make sure that we’re making the proper investments and making the right expenditures in each of our states. And so we’ve got a provision for that in the second quarter. And then just know that in terms of total earnings, we would be disappointed if we’re not towards the top end of the range this year, but certainly we have limitations as it relates to earned ROEs and commitments back to customers. And so those adjustments typically hit in the fourth quarter that tend to modulate earnings into a much tighter range with the primary goal being very little variability in what we report relative to expectations.\nTom Fanning: With respect to those modulating effects, those are the above the top of the range.\nDrew Evans: Above the top, right.\nDurgesh Chopra: Understood. Very helpful guys. Maybe just Tom, on the – for the next six to eight weeks, as you are sort of doing this Hot Functional Testing, can you just maybe elaborate on the specific risks and what remediation actions could you take in responding to those risks?\nTom Fanning: You mean within the test?\nDurgesh Chopra: Yes.\nTom Fanning: Okay, sure. So we’re off to a good start with a test, although it is so early. But for whatever it is, three or four days of getting started here, it’s gone well. Recall the 45-day test is essentially, 30 days of ramping up pressure and temperature, and then 15 days of ramping down pressure and temperature. Don’t get excited if we’re different than 45 days. We actually did some work in advance of declaring in service, but I would assume that you’re going to be 45 days, if it’s 50 days, it’s no big deal. Okay. But that’s kind of the plan 45 days. Then we open the hood up just like you bought a car and drove it for a month. Now you’re going to look at it and see, did everything work like it was posted. So there are stages along the way as you think about, I don’t have it with me right here, but there is a detailed path of different checkpoints along the way. I think in fact, it’s eminent. We’re going to raise temperature to 175 degrees. I mean that might happen tonight. It might happen Friday. I mean but that’s the first level. And then every incremental rise they start checking system. I think the real thing I’m looking for that goes to risk is really the integration of everything like for example. We have tested all of our RCPs, reactor coolant pumps. We’ve tested them briefly all four of them running together. Now we’re going to run together for some period of time. Do all of the support systems work. So not only do we have primary power in the integration of the plant, we have external backup sources that have to work. So this is the final cruise, if you will, before fuel load that make sure that the integration of all of the pieces we’ve checked so far do work. The culmination of all this is we’re going to raise temperatures up to about 560 degrees and we will create steam and we will send it to the turbine and we will spin the turbine. Okay. So this is kind of big stuff. The only thing that will remain then finish the construction on some of the support systems and then load fuel.\nDurgesh Chopra: Very helpful. Thank you, Tom. Appreciate the time.\nTom Fanning: You bet. You bet. Thank you. Thanks for joining us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nTom Fanning: Hey Paul, how are you?\nPaul Fremont: Doing great, Tom. Thanks a lot. And congratulations on this startup hot functional. I want to start off with maybe a follow-up to Angie’s question. You talked about a change of schedule, I think June of last year, I think you added 500,000 construction hours. Can you just tell us in layman’s terms roughly how many days or weeks that 500,000 hours represents?\nTom Fanning: So that kind of – that’s an interesting question, because I guess if you’re talking about the history of Unit 3, it feels like maybe two months, but obviously you got to think about when you’re spending that. When I say two months, I’m looking over the whole period. There are some months where there was a boatload of hours. And right now, for example, construction is just about done. I think going back to Angie’s question. I mean there’s a tiny bit of what I would call construction left following a HFT, and it’s for the support systems and a little bit associated with nuclear fuel. So it depends kind of where you are, but these all fit into – I would think of them distributed over the whole curve of construction. So hard to say my best guess is two months, well, we’ll see.\nPaul Fremont: Okay. And then there’s obviously remediation work that is now going to be added to that. So instead of 500,000 hours, what would the total amount of construction hours look like including all of the remediation that you need to do after Hot Functional Testing?\nTom Fanning: So is the question how many hours remain after hot functional test, a fuel load?\nPaul Fremont: Correct?\nTom Fanning: Is that your question?\nPaul Fremont: Construction. Yes, construction hours.\nTom Fanning: Maybe 200,000, something like that. We’ll finish most of that in June, yes, about that.\nPaul Fremont: The 5,000 hours that were budgeted last year is no longer the case that it’s not 500,000 hours anymore.\nTom Fanning: It’s already been accounted for, the way I would say it. All of that, you may remember at one time Paul, we were talking about, gosh, I mean I can remember back when we reset the schedule, we thought we might get fuel load by the end of the year. And then the latest update we gave you all before the 8-K as we thought HFT would begin at the end of March, the last two weeks in March. And then when we saw that we had to remediate some of these issues, we pushed into April that gave rise to the 8-K. And now we’ve given you a new schedule, new costs, that account for HFT as of April 25. We say that according to the schedule with 20 days of margin, but according to the schedule that would give you a very late December and service. Remember if it was March, it was November. If it’s April, it must be December. And April 25 gives you late December. And as we said, if there’s any more delays, it could push you into the first quarter. But I’m – I hope I’m answering your right question, because the 500,000 hours has already been incorporated into schedule. It’s been incorporated into costs. It’s already accounted for with 200,000 hours left between kind of now and beginning of fuel load. I hope I’m hitting the right answer. I hope I’m hitting what you’re asking.\nPaul Fremont: Okay. And then it looks like you have – you’ve got about 53 turnovers remaining out of 159. Is that a fair characterization? And then it also looks like you’ve averaged about 10.5 turnovers per month from October through April. Is that fair?\nTom Fanning: I wouldn’t use that logic. Turnovers are all determined by wind systems clear to major tests. So we have about 50 left. I wouldn’t think about them as, oh, well, you do x per month that they really are determined by here, the presence of HFT. We had to pass a lot of systems to get the HFT. We have 50 more to go, less than 10% of those are what I would call safety related. The rest are support, et cetera, as I’ve described. So don’t think about it on per month. Think about it on time to systems and what remains. And we feel that we can do this before fuel load. I mean we’ve given you the schedule. If you try to, I’m afraid, I’m afraid from your question. If you’re trying to say, oh, well, you’ve done 4.5 per month and you got 50 left that says another 10 months. That’s not the right logic. If that was your question, it’s not ratable analysis.\nPaul Fremont: Okay, fair enough. So basically I think what you’re saying is you’ve got an estimated 200,000 construction hours from the time you come out of Hot Functional Testing until fuel load. Is that reasonable in terms of…\nTom Fanning: Yes.\nPaul Fremont: Of a conclusion, okay.\nDrew Evans: Paul, we’d think about this is that – we expected a certain reduction in intensity between hot functional test and fuel load and we’ll just have to maintain intensity for a little bit longer to make sure we meet fuel load on a timely basis.\nTom Fanning: Hey Paul, one more piece of logic. We get these reports all the time in our big meetings. Remember I’ve described these meetings where our process are effectively, completely transparent. In other words, system independent monitors in there, represents in the Georgia Public Service Commission staff, co-owners, NRC, DOE, everybody’s in there. Okay. We do an evaluation. There’s this gigantic long chart that maps out all of the systems that need to be complete over time. One of the things I probably haven’t said it clearly to you as I will now. When you think about the remaining systems between say, hot functional and fuel load, every one of those remaining 50 systems are over 90% complete. So it’s not like we’re starting from ground zero. So you’re really finishing up, what is effectively almost complete construction. Maybe that’s helpful.\nPaul Fremont: Yes, actually it is. And then my last question is, I guess when you did a root cause analysis on the need for remediation, you concluded that a motivation to credit construction hours as earned drove supervisors to turnover work to Southern Nuclear for testing without first correcting deficiencies in the work. Is it possible that the level of earned hours then would also have been inflated by the fact that they were turning over work before it was actually adequately tact?\nTom Fanning: Yes, that may have been true. I mean it’s possible. But that’s all a little bit of bayoneting the dead. In other words, we are where we are right now. And I think that probably did cause the recognition of what was effectively complete as opposed to work that remained that needed to be remediated was not as clear as it could have been. So what we’re giving you right now is a completely transparent view as to where we are and what needs to be done in order to complete. I think that analysis was kind of backward looking.\nPaul Fremont: Can you maybe the last question, I think – I’m sorry. Go ahead.\nTom Fanning: No, the only thing I would just say they should reappear in Unit 4, because we’ve taken into account those issues.\nPaul Fremont: And then I think on this third quarter call, you were talked about 45 days, I think for a hot functional and then another 55 days between the end of hot functional and fuel load. Is that still the schedule that that we should be thinking about?\nTom Fanning: Yes, we’ve added about, I don’t know, nearly two weeks internet schedule. You remember Paul from prior calls, we had gosh, I want to say a little over a month in a startup from fuel load to in-service. And we took – we said this some time ago, we took about two weeks and added it into the Hot Functional Test to fuel load. So you should think now that total period is kind of, well, I don’t know, 70 days. Okay. We just added contingency in there. We added more margin. And we did that at the same time to, I think this was Angie, we did that at the same time that we push some work that was around 2020, I want to say somewhere around there where we push some work beyond HFT and a fuel load and also some last quarter.\nPaul Fremont: Okay, great. Thank you very much.\nTom Fanning: Hey, and thank you for raising all these questions. They’re all very important. So Paul, we sure appreciate your clarification here.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Levi with HITE Hedge. Please go ahead.\nTom Fanning: Andrew, how you’re doing?\nAndrew Levi: I’m all right. Hey, could do this to everybody 2.5 hours…\nTom Fanning: Which mean this stuff is right.\nAndrew Levi: My brain hurts from the last one, from all the questions, but this is of Nuclear. So I just kind of have a thought about you guys and about where the industry is going. And Tom, you and I go way back as far as the industry and back in the 1990s, when deregulation was starting, it was caused by very, very high electric rates. And there was something called the Super Southeast and those stocks traded at a premium. And then you’ve got companies like Kentucky Utilities and other companies with lower rates that traded at a premium. So fast forward to now, and fast forward to what the Biden administration is proposing and where the industry is headed. Now you have very high rates in the Northeast, mainly TND companies that really don’t have any levers to reduce their rates or to keep rates flat. So then I look at like Southern Company again, we got to get through this nuclear plant build. But once that is done, can you maybe talk about and you have at a very high level, but the opportunity to transform your key and obviously you’ve talked about that, but maybe the cost savings around that and the opportunity there and what will happen to your electric rates longer-term relative to other parts of the country. And also basically, what that will do longer-term again, I’m thinking the longer-term for your growth opportunities.\nTom Fanning: Yes. Andy, it’s a very interesting question, but here’s the thing. I think the wisdom of the integrated regulated model will bear fruit significantly as we consider some of these issues. In the so-called organized markets, there is very little control as to constructing an optimal portfolio, number one. Number two, when you think about the portfolio, we should consider that it includes transmission. Number three, I think the fact that part of the secret sauce here is reconfiguring the portfolio, absent coal, coal carries with it a whole lot of O&M. And so not only is there optionality in terms of the generation and transmission, we will provide. I think by our planning processes, we can do that in a way that’s much more orderly and effective and efficient, then the organized market. And then finally, when you consider the O&M, that could be freed up by closing down some of these O&M intensive facilities like coal plants. We have the ability to use that O&M to keep rates lower then you’ll find elsewhere in the country. Certainly, even compared to those companies that are just wires only. Their ability to deliver the kind of price, shock absorbers, doesn’t exist, because they will be takers of costs from the market. So I can assure you that we’ve already been talking about these issues with our regulators, with our stockholders. I mean our stakeholders and I can think that we – as my earnings call, but I think we’re better positioned in this kind of model in this region then elsewhere in the United States.\nAndrew Levi: Great. Thank you very much.\nTom Fanning: You bet. Thank you.\nOperator: And that will conclude today’s question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks?\nTom Fanning: Yes. I just want to maybe end with Andy’s comment there. This is a very exciting time for us all. We’re making great progress on Vogtle. I think we resolve the delays and we think we have a clearer path. Every month that goes by, we reduce remaining risk in the project. And so I think we continue to progress this thing. And boy, I can tell you the site for all the work they’re putting in is really starting to see the dividends of all their efforts. And so I can tell you, we can see the light at the end of the tunnel, and we are imbued with enthusiasm. When I think about the days ahead, in terms of transitioning the fleet Southern Company is committed to constructive collaboration, not just cooperation, collaboration with the United States government to achieve their aspirations. And so we will work together. I love our cards in this regard. I know a lot of people give you a lot of rhetoric about where they say they are and what they have done. I would rather have our cards and almost anybody else’s going forward as we address the future. Thanks everybody for your attendance today. I know it went a little long, but I always enjoy interactions. And I know I always get a lot out of the questions you ask. Thanks again. Have a great next quarter and we’ll see you again in July.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes The Southern Company first quarter 2021 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Drew Evans",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon everyone. I hope you're all safe and well. As Tom mentioned, we had a very strong start to the year. Our adjusted EPS for the first quarter of 2021 was $0.98, $0.20 higher than last year and $0.14 above our estimate. The primary drivers compared to last year was strong performance at our state-regulated utilities, despite a comparative quarter that had very limited COVID-19 impacts. The lessons we learned during COVID-19 allowed us to maintain a relatively static cost structure as we saw a withdrawal of COVID-19 impacts from their peak. We saw year-over-year benefit of $0.06 from weather due to the extremely mild first quarter we experienced in 2020. Further, retail electric revenues increased in aggregate due to strong customer growth in the Southeast and constructive state regulatory actions. When looking at an adjusted EPS as compared to our estimate for the quarter, the main drivers of the positive variance were continued expense discipline, retail sales impacts from COVID-19 that were nearly 60% better than our forecast across all customer classes and significantly lower than their peak and residential customer growth that has continued to exceed our expectation by almost 50%, we added nearly 60,000 customers last year. A detailed reconciliation of our report and adjusted quarterly results as compared to 2020 is included in today's release and the earnings package. Looking more closely at sales in the first quarter, weather-normal retail sales were only approximately 1.5% lower than last year's largely unaffected quarter. This decrease was driven by the continued trends of higher residential sales offset by lower commercial and industrial sales compared to normal times. While residential sales remained elevated, commercial and industrial sales continue to be depressed by about 3%. As you would expect, the commercial sub-sectors most impacted by the pandemic continue to be office, restaurant and education. These are meaningful declines and we expect recovery to be very gradual, even with improving economic conditions. For industrial sales during the quarter, supply chain constraints appear to be affecting the automotive sector with primary metals and chemicals also down, but construction and lumber in particular are demonstrating early strength. In general, all industrial segments have moved stronger since the COVID-19 peak. The economies in our service territory are showing strong signs of recovery with retail sales exceeding our expectations in the first quarter by roughly 3 percentage points. A recent analysis produced by IHS Markit estimates that most Southeastern states, including Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi are predicted to return to their pre-pandemic peak employment levels by 2022, while other states may not return to these levels until 2025 and beyond. We have certainly learned that the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts are unpredictable, but the potential for more near-term recovery is encouraging. We mentioned on our last call that economic development trends are strong in our region, particularly in Georgia. And in fact, in the first quarter of 2021 alone, economic development announcements in Southern Company's retail electric service territory, included the addition of over 3,600 new jobs and investments of more than $2.2 billion. We saw strong activity in both non-manufacturing and manufacturing segments with new project announcements across a variety of industries, including warehousing, distribution, scientific and transportation equipment among others. For the second quarter of 2021, our estimated EPS – our adjusted EPS estimate is $0.78. I would also like to call your attention to our recent dividend increase. At its last meeting, the Southern Company board of directors approved an $0.08 per share increase in our common dividend, raising our annualized rate to $2.64 per share. This action marks our 20th consecutive annual increase and for 73 years, dating back to 1948, Southern Company has paid a dividend that was equal to or greater than that of the previous year. The Board's decision to increase the dividend reinforces the strength and sustainability of Southern Company's business. This dedication to continuing our dividend increases combined with our projected long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7%, supports our objective of providing superior risk adjusted total shareholder return to investors over the long-term. Before I turn the call back to Tom, I'd like to spend a few minutes providing an update on some of our strategic priorities. On our ESG efforts, recall in January, Southern Company became the first major U.S. utility to publish a sustainable financing framework. Our first issuance was a green bond related to Southern Power's renewable investments, further solidifying Southern Power is one of the largest green bond issuers in the United States. In February, we issued our inaugural sustainable bond at Georgia Power with net proceeds to be used for sustainable projects, such as our spending with diverse and small business suppliers and our investment in renewable energy projects. The Georgia Power issuance aligns with our ongoing commitments to the community and the continued growth of Georgia Power solar portfolio. We look forward to leveraging our sustainable financing framework for future financings by all of our issuers as appropriate. Also I'd mentioned that Southern Power has been very active over the last few years, establishing itself as one of the nation's largest renewable generation owners with a total renewable portfolio of nearly 5,000 megawatts in operation are under construction. Within the last month, Southern Power announced the acquisition of the 300-megawatt Deuel Harvest wind facility located in South Dakota and the 118-megawatt Glass Sands wind facility located in Oklahoma. With these acquisitions, Southern Power now owns 15 wind projects and approximately 2,500 megawatts of solar across the U.S. along with approximately 160 megawatts of battery storage. The existing generation fleet comprised of both renewables and natural gas is over 90% contracted for the next 10 years. Finally, over the past three years, we have strategically simplified our business in order to focus our time and investments in our core operations. As another example of that commitment, yesterday, we entered into an agreement to sell our wholesale gas trading and services business comprised of Sequent Energy Management and Sequent Energy Canada and we expect to complete the transaction in the third quarter of 2021. We do not expect a material gain or loss on the sale of the business, there we'll provide a return of the associated working capital and the elimination of certain credit supports of approximately $1 billion. As a reminder, we have always excluded Sequent's earnings from our adjusted results due to its quarterly variability. So the sale of this business both reduces risk and has no impact on our adjusted EPS expectations for the remainder of the year. I'd like to personally thank the team at Sequent for their years of dedication and service to the company. I can tell you that it's been my pleasure working with all of those individuals at Sequent for more than 20 years. And I really look forward to their continued success. Tom, with that, I'll turn it back over to you. Yes. We think it's really a tough business. We continue to believe that. And Steve, I've talked about that in the dimensions of the duration of the contracts, the terms and conditions of the contracts. And so it's just been harder. There's a lot of deals out there. I would say that our share of new deals has just been lower than historical, because there's too much money chasing too many deals. We keep the same thresholds in place. And rather than comment on any specific deal. In general, what we look for is significant contract coverage. So in this case, 90% over 10 years, we look for those things and we generally get profits that are, say, ROE is plus 150 over our regulated business. That would be our general threshold rather than commenting on particular deals. But these deals that we just mentioned that drew just mentioned fit that profile. I just add, you describe it as window on the world, it's sort of antenna into what the needs of the customer basis. It really looks like people are focused on an extra nine of reliability, but the assets can be used either to meet that reliability or it can be dispatched. I think our best example most recently is that we'll do constructions at the Atlanta Airport to produce the kind of reliability that's required there. But in terms of distributed generation, I think it demonstrates that folks are not really all that interested in prime power, but more interested in the kinds of backup and assurity that you can get out of the PowerSecure product line. And I'll just add, gosh, I think somebody is going to probably ask this later, so I'll just do it now. But when we think about CapEx going forward, we think about transitioning the fleet going forward, it's very clear to us that storage in some point, whether it's short duration, intermediate, seasonal, that's going to become important to support the intermittent profile of renewables. Gosh, I think to achieve net zero for us, we're going to need about a 50% penetration, mostly of solar. And so on that cold winter peak day, you're going to need a whole lot more megawatts to be able to meet those needs some storage, some CTs, some CTs with CCS, you name it. So hydrogen is important in that regard. So these are important projects too. That's helping us understand better how to meet the aspirations of this administration. And just little more land out there, so we're – supporters of the bipartisan policy center and I'm a member of the net zero business alliance, we've had a session already with some other CEOs from Tyson Foods, Occidental Petroleum, United Airlines, Weyerhaeuser and ConocoPhillips. We're meeting again Tuesday with Gina McCarthy. And so part of our whole premise here is engaging constructively with the administration, with the concept of, yes, I am. That is we're going to need the support, we're going to need the administration in the boat with us to achieve that aspiration, assuming we have a supply chain availability. So we have labor available. The big issue for us to hit these kinds of numbers is that over the next 15 years, we will triple the amount of generation we will put on the ground as compared to any other 15-year period in our corporate history. It is a big lift. Assuming we get the support, can we do it? Yes, I think so. There are lots of policy choices along the way that make this a very complex decision. Southern Holdings, I think we've divested of a number of assets over the last couple of years, but this is – Angie, I think our focus is just reduce business complexity focus investment on the things that we think we're rewarded around. And this is just sort of evidence of it. Are there large pockets of these things? Not a lot. But equally, probably is a little bit less. Sold all the gas-fired assets outside of our general service territory, but really just trying to focus on our core infrastructure best. Andrew, I'd just say, the reason it dropped is because we did the long-term debt issuance of $2 billion. Sequent really only changes what we would provision for short-term working capital, so that would come out of bank revolvers and the like. But I would say if you aggregate what we actually issued in the first half, you'd come up with a number that's almost exactly the same as what we had projected when we met with you last, but we can – we're happy to walk you through the table, I think it's Page 19 or something like that in the earnings packet. No. So we will – the sale will occur at or around book value plus or minus that's a relatively small number, won't have major implications for cash generation. We'll then be able to reduce revolvers, because we're getting a return of working capital. These numbers are an order of magnitude smaller than what you're looking at on Slide 19. The other $800 million generally takes the form of parent guarantees or assurances for the underlying transactions that Sequent has entered into. Those aren't the nominated on the balance sheet. They're sort of off balance sheet assurances from parents. And so we'll leave at that, yes. Yes. And Michael, I think you can probably find all of that. We do a pretty decent detail of it in the 10-K every year. And so you can take a look at how that, that has modulated. As Tom said, it's about $10 billion over 10 years. If I think about what's in our five-year plan, probably 30%, maybe at most 40% of it is contained within that five-year period and then the balance hangs out over the end of that. The only thing I'd also point you to maybe is that we will have to make filings against the ELG requirements that's effluent limitation guidelines in October, that will require us to specify for each facility that we operate, whether we intend to make investment, to continue its operation, whether we expect to close that facility or whether we will make some investment to put that facility into a condition that will allow it to operate something like 10% of the year. But I would say that coal, we are not producing generally wet ash and is not part of our investment or closing decisions on those facilities. Almost everything is based on economics and then the other constraint that we might face perhaps at the federal level. It is. So if you think about what we experienced, we were expecting kind of a sideways COVID relative to what we experienced in fourth quarter and what we actually saw was something that was really just about a 1.5% reduction in total retail sales. If you think about where we were for the year, last year, we were down in aggregate kind of 3% on average in almost 7.5% on peak. And we're just projecting forward as we think about second quarter assuming that we don't really see much improvement from where we are today. So a little bit of sideways until we get a better understanding of what's coming down the pike in terms of COVID. Sure, for budgeting purposes. That's right. We always evaluate our guidance in October after we've gotten through the summer season. If you think about the major factors that influence outcome there – weather is always a dominant one, that's difficult to predict COVID for sure is difficult to predict. We want to make sure that we're making the proper investments and making the right expenditures in each of our states. And so we've got a provision for that in the second quarter. And then just know that in terms of total earnings, we would be disappointed if we're not towards the top end of the range this year, but certainly we have limitations as it relates to earned ROEs and commitments back to customers. And so those adjustments typically hit in the fourth quarter that tend to modulate earnings into a much tighter range with the primary goal being very little variability in what we report relative to expectations. Above the top, right. Paul, we'd think about this is that – we expected a certain reduction in intensity between hot functional test and fuel load and we'll just have to maintain intensity for a little bit longer to make sure we meet fuel load on a timely basis."

            "name": "Tom Fanning",
            "content": "Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we reported a strong start to the year with adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2021 ahead of our estimate. The economies in our service territories are starting to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and the customer demand remains mildly lower than pre-pandemic levels during the first quarter, it exceeded our expectation. Importantly, many of the programs we implemented to keep customers connected during the pandemic have proven to be very effective. We have reliably provided energy to our customers and facilitated alternative payment arrangements for those in need. I continue to be proud of our employees and the ways we have partnered with our communities throughout this pandemic. This past February parts of our nation were contending with the effects of devastating winter weather that crippled generating units and power grids in Texas and beyond. At Southern Company, each of our businesses, including those with operations in Texas and the Southwest region performed well during this event. Our regulated electric and gas utilities did not experience any operational issues or related service disruptions. Southern Power was minimally impacted due to its highly contracted business model. Our wholesale gas services subsidiary Sequent Energy effectively served customers in need utilizing in large part, natural gas held in storage. And micro grids provided by power secure had a 98 runtime reliability producing over 2,260 megawatt hours of reliable energy for customers during the storm. The winter seasons atypical temperatures have also caused utilities across the country to evaluate their own system resilience under similar conditions. For Southern Company are vertically integrated structure and integrated resource planning process as we utilize across our Southeast electric utilities have beneficial for years in allowing us along with our regulators to carefully consider, plan for, and invest in infrastructure needed to address a range of extreme circumstances and improve resilience. We will continue to leverage the rigorous analysis and stakeholder input provided by these proceedings as we evaluate the potential for additional system enhancements across our footprint. Let's turn now to an update on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Unit 3 Hot Functional Testing started on April 25 marking the last milestone in a series of major tests. Hot Functional Testing is conducted to verify the successful operation of reactor components and systems together and to confirm that the reactor is ready for fuel load. As part of the testing, the site team will run Unit 3 plant systems without nuclear fuel and advanced through the testing process to reach normal operating pressure and temperature. Starting Hot Functional Testing represents a significant step towards the operation of Unit 3 and ultimately providing customers with a reliable carbon-free energy source for the next 60 years to 80 years. The site work plan now targets fuel load in the third quarter and late December, 2021 in-service date for Unit 3, of course, any delays could result in a first quarter 2022 Unit 3 in-service date. Now, as we have stated in prior calls and important step in the system turnover process is to assure that the as built state of the plant aligns with the design basis and to resolve any differences. Before we close systems, declare them ready for testing and submit ITAAC. We are committed to the notion of getting it right. In recent months, Southern Nuclear identified certain construction remediation work, primarily electrical in nature that was necessary to ensure the quality and design standards were met prior to the start of Hot Functional Testing. We reviewed the project construction quality programs prior to Hot Functional Testing, we implemented improvement plans and we believe Southern Nuclear's construction quality program is effective. Furthermore, the improvement plans we are implementing are designed to help drive successful completion of Unit 3 and improve performance for Unit 4. As the operator of these units, we are committed to getting it right, striving to ensure our safety and quality standards are met prior to significant testing and operations activities. We will not sacrifice that commitment to meet schedule or milestone dates. With Unit 3 direct construction nearing completion, and Hot Functional Testing in progress, our primary system focus include going forward one, successful completion of Hot Functional Testing, two, completion of the remaining construction system turnovers and testing leading to fuel load, and three, an orderly transition from fuel load to an efficient start-up of the unit. The ITAAC submittal and review process is expected to accelerate as we move into and beyond the hot functional test sequence. To date 188 ITAAC had been submitted to the NRC. We will submit the remaining 211 during Hot Functional Testing as we approach fuel load. Turning the Unit 4, direct construction is now approximately 80% complete. And the current site work plan targets completion in the third quarter of 2022, which would provide margin to the regulatory approve November 22 in service date. Earlier this week, the site came placed the water tank on top of the Unit 4 containment vessel and shield building roof representing the last major crane lift at the project site. Integrated flush is in progress and initial energization is expected in the coming weeks. The site is focused on increasing craft, labor resources and electrical productivity. We will continue adding incremental resources while also shifting resources from Unit 3 to Unit 4, which is expected to increase our current pace of construction completion. Construction completion has averaged 1.5% per month since the start of the year. In order to achieve November 22 regulatory and approved and service date, we estimate we would need to average construction completion of approximately 2% per month through the end of this year. And as a reference point, Unit 3 averaged approximately 2% during the second half of 2019 and through the first half of 2020, which did include periods heavily impacted by COVID-19. Looking now at cost during the first quarter Georgia Power allocated $84 million of contingency into the base capital forecast related to extending the schedule for Unit 3, performing construction remediation work and increasing support resources across both units. As a result, Georgia Power replenished its contingency by $48 million reporting an after-tax charge of $36 million at the end of the first quarter. While there was contingency remaining prior to this increase, we believe providing this additional amount of contingency is appropriate when considering the extended time necessary to reach the start of Unit 3 Hot Functional Testing and the potential cost risk remaining as we complete both units. The major risks that remain to our cost estimate are similar to those for schedule namely, one, our ability to increase earned hours and improve productivity or CPI at Unit 4, successful completion of the Unit 3 Hot Functional Testing, and three, completion of the system turnovers and subsequent testing lead it to the Unit 3 fuel load. Notably at this time last year, the onset of COVID-19 led to many uncertainties at the project site. The site team has responded in exemplary fashion, maintaining safety and progress toward completion of both units during what has been an unprecedented year. With effective COVID protocols in place and now the broader availability of vaccines, the impact on the site has decreased in recent months as active cases and isolation rates are trending significantly lower. We are very pleased that Unit 3 Hot Functional Testing is underway. We've consistently said that both the commencement and successful completion of this testing sequence will reduce risk for the project. And as always, I want to thank our employees, contractors, co-owners and community partners for their unwavering dedication to this important project. Drew, I'll turn it over to you now for an update on the financial. Thanks, Drew. As I noted last quarter, we achieved a 50% reduction in GHG emissions in 2020, beating our 2030 goal by a decade. Earlier this month, we filed an integrated resource plan in Mississippi that includes the retirement of Mississippi's last coal unit in 2027. Both Alabama Power and Georgia Power will work with their respective regulators over the next year and responding to the effluent limitation guideline rules, which they will reflect in their next integrated resource plan. We will also continue to work with all stakeholders in developing these strategies. Another note, we have historically worked in partnership with municipalities and co-ops in our region. We work hard on mutual respect and constructive collaboration. As an example of the wisdom of this approach, Alabama Power recently signed a long-term agreement with Power South of valued customer in Alabama, which is expected to create energy savings and enhance system reliability from coordinated planning and operations. As a part of this agreement, Alabama Power has the right to participate in a portion of power SaaS future incremental load growth. In closing, our strong first quarter positions us well to deliver on the financial objectives for the year, with the summer months and storm season ahead, our operating companies are well prepared to support the needs of our customers. And of course, all eyes remain on progress at Vogtle and we look forward to providing continued updates as we approach fuel load and in service for Unit 3. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we're now ready to take questions. Julien, how are you? You bet. Yes. Well, look, number one, we're basically modeling forward experience on three for four. So let's think about it. Do you remember last year? It really started about the last six months of 2019 through the first six months of 2020. Remembering when we were staffing up, effectively that's what we're doing now on four. We've delayed that and we've accounted for all this and revised estimate to complete and everything else. Because we didn't want to release all these people to four until effectively, we finished three. So what we have done is just estimated that we can hit November with experienced similar to last year. We'll get CPI up to, I don't know, about 165 for the remainder of the project. We'll be completing at least 2%. Now here's where I think we have room for improvement. Remember, the period I just told you last six months of 2019, first six months of 2020. Included in that, we're three waves of COVID, who knows what's going to happen with COVID. But we have some reason for optimism given that we've expanded vaccines. It appears that the way they've gotten smaller, certainly our experience right now, it is way less than it has been. And so our view is productivity should rise. And so we have some level of optimism, obviously we can guarantee it that we'll at least meet or beat what we did on Unit 3 with Unit 4, one last thing. There are always lessons learned on Unit 3 and some of the quality measures we just talked about going into hot functional tests. We're applying all of those lessons to Unit 4 so that we won't have to repeat them there. In fact, our good friends from Vogtle came to our last board meeting and reiterated the notion that we should see better performance on 4 than 3. All we're saying is right now, Julien, that even if we did just what we did on Unit 3, we can hit November. We frankly believe and expect will do better. I would say – so let's go through the big risk factors going forward on three. I guess the predicate is you've got to have a successful HFT, right. I think the biggest risk factor, however, going forward is after HFT to fuel load, there's two segments of work left that we still have to do and do well. One is, completing the work that really is related to nuclear fuel, right. HFT means that we're going to use the effluent heat off the reactor coolant pumps to heat up the project. So it would be things related to nuclear fuel, like, the system's required to remove the fuel from the fuel pool and move it over to the reactor core. It would include systems like finishing up the Radwaste facility. The second segment would relate to, what I would call broadly support systems, recall that we're going to have about 800 permanent employees at the site. So support systems for those folks. So let's think about HVAC communications, out of the water, things like that. That will support the people that are going to be working at the plant. And just to give you one more frame of reference, it's taken a lot to get to HFT something like the latest work we've been doing, 60% of those systems are what we would call safety related. And by that you should hear complexity. The amount of work to be done in between HFT completion and fuel load is significantly less, maybe 60% of that work. And only about 10% or less of those systems are safety-related. So I will say this to you. I believe that's the next riskiest thing we have to do, but it's not as big a deal as it has been getting to HFT. And then the third final thing is having a successful run from fuel load in service. We feel pretty confident about that. Hey, last point, so I think, Julien, you are starting to see people move now, frankly, from Unit 3 to Unit 4. Certainly, that'll get accelerated into the summer. Probably, it'll start to max out around June, and then we'll hit our numbers at Unit 4. Thank you. Appreciate you joining us. Hey Steve, how are you? You bet. So let's back up for several calls. And I use this vernacular, but I always caution you it's just vernacular paper. But effectively that involved assuring that there was in the evaluation of the as-built site – as-built condition of the plan as compared to the design basis of the plant. That was harmonized. And where there were differences that we made adjustments. Some of that was work that needed to be remediated. When we saw this starting to delay beyond what we thought, recall that we were calling for last two weeks in March, kind of start of HFT. We decided to really stop and take a good look at the system. It appears that while there were some issues elsewhere in the plant, the concentration of issues really dealt with the electrical systems. And then when you think about what it takes to turn over a system. Effectively, when we saw these problems start to manifest itself, we caught it ultimately with our quality control program. And so in effect, we had to – we sat back and looked at it and said, no. Our quality control program does work. We have identified the system. We have remediated them, in order to start HFT. There are some things that we did catch that will continue to be remediated from the finish of HFT to fuel load. But we've sketched all that out and we're pretty confident that everything that we know we're dealing with. All of this is a part of our current cost and schedule estimates. I would say to that and Bechtel would agree with this. We talked about this with our Board that for what we have found, we think we are making adjustments to Unit 4. So that we will not, we should not repeat these issues going forward. That gives us more confidence in schedule and cost. Steve, it is – we have not announced the buyer because it's something that they will likely announce on their earnings call that will come in future days. It is somebody very credible and respected in this space. And so we just think we've found a better owner for sequent than ourselves. We probably tie up something on average, like $200 million worth of working capital. So we have to provision for that within our credit facilities. And then because of the gross revenue or gross sales associated with that business in four positions, probably something like another $800 million worth of parental support. And so these things will be freed up after some transition, we don't expect the transaction to close until the beginning of the third quarter, but we'll alert you as things progress. I always want to say value is a function of risk and return. And when you look at it, we've never included any earnings from Sequent in our return. We've always asked them out as extraordinary items. They're just too variable and it's fascinating. I just have some quick data to show how variable we are. If you look at Sequent, even prior to when Southern made the acquisition, say from 2010 forward. They've averaged about $40 million in net income. They had two years, one was $260 million, and one was $163 million where they really blew out earnings. Other than that, the earnings were near zero. If you exclude those big years, so over nine years, they averaged about $4 million of net income. And since we've owned sequence, there's been one big year, the 163 in 2019, and then this year. And then otherwise the earnings were around $23 million in net income. And so if you step back and look at it, number one, we x any earnings number two, because of the balance sheet, we are freeing up $1 billion that reduces our risk profile. So net-net to corporation values, we think this is a clear winner. I think one more thing I just thought to point out, Sequent had a really good earnings year in the first quarter. Thankfully, they had gas in storage, which supported the needs of the state of Texas primarily. You remember, there were constrained gas flows. Sequent was able to step into the breach and sell a lot of gas in storage and made a lot of – made some profits off of the volume that they were able to provide. Thank goodness to Texas' customers that produce net income of around $200 million. In recognition of our commitment to communities, we took $75 million or so of that $200 million and put it into our foundation that is going to get cloud back into communities. So you'll see net income per Sequent in the first quarter of around 133 or so. So look, we had a good year. I do think that the buyer is, as Drew said, a better owner. And know I've said that for years, a lot of M&A is all about who's the best owner of any particular asset. And I think for what we bought and what we've sold, I think we've demonstrated our ability to bring value to shareholders every time. You bet. Hey Michael. How are you? It's completely different. So we've talked in fact about a Venn diagram in the past, the three circles of a Venn diagram in this case would have been Southern Power, PowerSecure and Sequent. Now let's think about that for a minute. Sequent, now let's start with PowerSecure. PowerSecure has really been focused on kind of mostly the retail side of the business, particularly commercial and industrial customers, where resilient is particularly important. And in keeping with this 100 year old model of central station, make move and sell, projects at scale. PowerSecure essentially represents the idea of miniaturizing that century old business model and putting the make move and sell premise at the customer premises. So when you think about some of our major customers who do value resilience at an exceptional level, we can put a micro grid. We are by far the largest share of micro grids in the United States through PowerSecure. We can put distributed generation there. We can put proprietary switch gear and storage. And so this has been a wonderful kind of window on the world. Add to the Venn diagram what we've seen lately at Southern Power. Southern power grew up selling to other utilities or other co-ops or other munis and lately a great kind of a target zone for Southern Power has been companies, desiring green attributes. So general mills, general motors, carnival cruise lines, people like that that want to have renewables as part of their generation portfolio so to speak. The union of what we're seeing at Southern Power in respect of that business, that market with the market that is served primarily by PowerSecure, there's great overlap and great mutual synergy. Now we used to have Sequent as part of that Venn diagram, where we would in fact take over fuel management for some of the distributed generation at all serviced by our customers. We feel we can do that ourselves now. And selling Sequent does an impact to a significant degree, our ability to serve that need of our customers. And if we can't do it, we'll find somebody that can. So, and look at that – and one last thing I just want to leave you with, look at the data over the past few earnings calls we've done, through hurricanes, a winter storm URI and others. Sequent, I mean, PowerSecure is able to provide reliability in excess of 98% in general terms across these very devastating storms. This idea does work, I will say. PowerSecure remain kind of a peanut to our earnings. We don't talk about PowerSecure in terms of being a contributor to earnings, even though it is earning a little bit of money. I think the bigger value we see is as an option to what maybe happening in the future. And that is because of technology, because of changing customer requirements, it gives us a window on the world that allows us not only to learn about this new market, but also to influence how it emerges and to position our franchise businesses optimally. And the phrase I would use is distributed infrastructure, which includes beyond generation micro grid storage, it's switch gear, et cetera. I think it's a small thing, but it really helps us. That's right. I don't know about – it'll be interesting to see whether the returns are higher. I think it's an absolute requirement. We'll build a couple hundred megawatts of battery, if you include what's in the Tranquillity and Garland packages, but also what we'll be doing within the state of Georgia. We're building the two facilities we named as part of – as compliments to our existing solar facilities in California. But storage itself is probably the single biggest complication with the transition to renewables over the next couple of decades, whether it is going to be lithium-ion, which is relatively short duration if you think about how our system operates today or something more complex like compressed air energy or liquid air, liquid metal, pump hydro is probably another great example. We're going to have to find ways for long duration storage to compliment the kinds of assets that we're talking about on the renewable side. And one of the nice arrangements that we have within Alabama Power with a PowerSource is that they actually operate today a case facility that can deliver battery power for 26 hours. It's been operating for almost 20 years. These are great experiments and understandings things for us to learn. I do think that battery will be an increasing area of investment for us. We just have to figure out what technology is most pertinent for the circumstances. Thank you. Hey, Angie, great to have you with us. Not really. We're working very hard to clean those things up. I mean, we do have cats and dogs around the place, but Southern investments, right. The less stuff that we've talked about in the past had been legacy stuff from mirror going way back there. We had – they had a leasing business. They didn't have the tax appetite. So that came over with us. We've been dealing with that. Choctaw has been a part of that, we talked about that in the past. Angie, wait a minute, 200 million, we put 75 of that in a charitable foundation to help communities. So it kind of net it out at 133 or so, but that was a decision we made. Yes. We adjust the construction schedule all the time to optimize cost and schedule. We try to do that. Heck, we do it every week, to be honest with you. In 2020, we did, this goes back to 2020. We did make an adjustment to push some of the nuclear related construction. Like I mentioned, Radwaste facility, like I mentioned, the equipment necessary to move the fuel from the storage pool over to the reactor. That was moved past HFT. The systems related to support the personnel beside had kind of always been there, I think. That was the last move, but that was kind of a year ago. And, and like I say, for the amount of construction left only, I don't know, it's 10% or less, we got into an argument about what's complex and safety related, but it's a smallish amount of that work that is in that vein left to do. So it was nothing that was tactically decided in my view to do anything with HFT. This is a decision we made back mostly in 2020, except that we make adjustments every week. Yes. I wish, I mean, Angie, you've lived with us for a number of years here. I mean, there's nothing that the EV every day I've described out there as a dog fight, but it certainly is less complex than what we've been doing to get to HFT. Thank you. Hi, Jeremy. Hey, Ryan. So this is an excellent question. Here's my view. And let me speak broadly. The administration, if they're going to hit their aspiration of 80% removal by 2030 and 100% net zero by 2035, and then move the whole economy to net zero by 2050. This is an important and awfully complex and difficult undertaking. And we are ready to support them however we can. And this is part of the conversations we've been having on an ongoing basis with this administration. As I mentioned, we've talked with Gina McCarthy before on a different level, I'll be talking with her again next Tuesday. I think the administration gets it, that there needs to be a whole different level of public, private cooperation and collaboration, carrots and sticks, in order to get this done, I will say, talk in the book of nuclear that it's important for the United States to keep nuclear as a priority. And so anything they can do to help to keep the nuclear assets alive really helps the United States broadly with their long-term goal. And that not only includes, projects like ours, current nuclear assets in operation that are at risk because of an imperfect market design, but also providing R&D support for the so-called Gen 4 reactors that may appear in the 2030 timeframe. All of this is an important part to achieving net zero for the economy by 2050. Let me just say this. I think the wide build that's kind of floating around right now is pretty supportive to kind of a long-term objective. So I would take a look at that piece of proposed legislation and see what it has. That's a pretty good start. There could be lots of other things. It's interesting. I did some media this morning and people were asking me kind of specific ideas. At this point there is more ideas than there are solutions, but we're going to need to work together carrots and sticks. And you know what, at the end of the day, the objective function is not just carbon. For the American economy, it goes back to my work at the fed. It is so important to the fabric of our economic health as a nation. We got to get this right and then getting it right. We've got to balance the notions of clean, safe, reliable, and affordable. So all of these must work in balance to achieve a good result for this nation. You bet. Thank you. Thanks for joining us. Wait a minute. I'm going to turn this over to Drew. The broad conclusion of your question is no. None of this has anything to do with Sequent at this point. I don't on vaccination rates. I know they're up. I saw a report recently that another 500 got vaccinated. I do know that. I can't tell you what percent of the workforce is vaccinated that may violate HIPAA rules and all sorts of things. But right now, I mean I'll just tell you the current report card only 20 people are tested positive for COVID on the site. At other times, we've had hundreds in that vein. The total positives since the project has begun at 25,000, we've had nearly 10,000 people tested. We only have 75 people in isolation right now. And that number, I think in one reporting period has been 500. So it's way down, but you know that ebbs and flows and – yes, it is great to hear. I just don't know what's going to happen with these new variants and everything else. We are hopeful that the worst is behind us. Yes. Hey Michael, how about those yellow jackets, man? Yes, yes. I'll turn this over to Drew. It's $10 billion over 10 years. It's not important at all. I don't think, I made it, I came out one annual meeting and said we were going to get – we're going to retire all our ash columns. And we did that before there was any legislation and all that other stuff. We were really ahead of the game there. I really think the more important issues going forward are things like the effluent limitation guideline. It's going to be a big deal. What is that? We've got to declare by around October. So for sure, we are working with our regulators and the staff to get our arms around that issue, because you kind of have to make a declaration. And then as we said, I think in the script that those conclusions would be a central part of our filings in Alabama and in Georgia with respect to the integration – integrated resource plan. Hey, and I'm going to reach back to other earnings calls, when I remember I raised myself skepticism about our CapEx that we show. I still think it's thin. And we talked about transmission as a component of it's been this. I believe that as you take all these issues going forward, when you start retiring coal plants, the generation has to come from somewhere. And when you think about renewables being so important, we need to think about reevaluating our long-term transmission plan in order to hit those kinds of objectives. And it may be that retired coal plants could be prime areas to locate some of those resources and built by our host company. But look this is going to evolve over the next, I don't know, 10 months to 12 months. We'll have a lot more information for you later. I do think the Mississippi signal is pretty important. Thank you. Durgesh, great to have you with us. You bet. And Drew, our COVID estimates were of the vintage of last October, somewhere around there. And I think it stands we could reevaluate what the effect may be going forward. With respect to those modulating effects, those are the above the top of the range. You mean within the test? Okay, sure. So we're off to a good start with a test, although it is so early. But for whatever it is, three or four days of getting started here, it's gone well. Recall the 45-day test is essentially, 30 days of ramping up pressure and temperature, and then 15 days of ramping down pressure and temperature. Don't get excited if we're different than 45 days. We actually did some work in advance of declaring in service, but I would assume that you're going to be 45 days, if it's 50 days, it's no big deal. Okay. But that's kind of the plan 45 days. Then we open the hood up just like you bought a car and drove it for a month. Now you're going to look at it and see, did everything work like it was posted. So there are stages along the way as you think about, I don't have it with me right here, but there is a detailed path of different checkpoints along the way. I think in fact, it's eminent. We're going to raise temperature to 175 degrees. I mean that might happen tonight. It might happen Friday. I mean but that's the first level. And then every incremental rise they start checking system. I think the real thing I'm looking for that goes to risk is really the integration of everything like for example. We have tested all of our RCPs, reactor coolant pumps. We've tested them briefly all four of them running together. Now we're going to run together for some period of time. Do all of the support systems work. So not only do we have primary power in the integration of the plant, we have external backup sources that have to work. So this is the final cruise, if you will, before fuel load that make sure that the integration of all of the pieces we've checked so far do work. The culmination of all this is we're going to raise temperatures up to about 560 degrees and we will create steam and we will send it to the turbine and we will spin the turbine. Okay. So this is kind of big stuff. The only thing that will remain then finish the construction on some of the support systems and then load fuel. You bet. You bet. Thank you. Thanks for joining us. Hey Paul, how are you? So that kind of – that's an interesting question, because I guess if you're talking about the history of Unit 3, it feels like maybe two months, but obviously you got to think about when you're spending that. When I say two months, I'm looking over the whole period. There are some months where there was a boatload of hours. And right now, for example, construction is just about done. I think going back to Angie's question. I mean there's a tiny bit of what I would call construction left following a HFT, and it's for the support systems and a little bit associated with nuclear fuel. So it depends kind of where you are, but these all fit into – I would think of them distributed over the whole curve of construction. So hard to say my best guess is two months, well, we'll see. So is the question how many hours remain after hot functional test, a fuel load? Is that your question? Maybe 200,000, something like that. We'll finish most of that in June, yes, about that. It's already been accounted for, the way I would say it. All of that, you may remember at one time Paul, we were talking about, gosh, I mean I can remember back when we reset the schedule, we thought we might get fuel load by the end of the year. And then the latest update we gave you all before the 8-K as we thought HFT would begin at the end of March, the last two weeks in March. And then when we saw that we had to remediate some of these issues, we pushed into April that gave rise to the 8-K. And now we've given you a new schedule, new costs, that account for HFT as of April 25. We say that according to the schedule with 20 days of margin, but according to the schedule that would give you a very late December and service. Remember if it was March, it was November. If it's April, it must be December. And April 25 gives you late December. And as we said, if there's any more delays, it could push you into the first quarter. But I'm – I hope I'm answering your right question, because the 500,000 hours has already been incorporated into schedule. It's been incorporated into costs. It's already accounted for with 200,000 hours left between kind of now and beginning of fuel load. I hope I'm hitting the right answer. I hope I'm hitting what you're asking. I wouldn't use that logic. Turnovers are all determined by wind systems clear to major tests. So we have about 50 left. I wouldn't think about them as, oh, well, you do x per month that they really are determined by here, the presence of HFT. We had to pass a lot of systems to get the HFT. We have 50 more to go, less than 10% of those are what I would call safety related. The rest are support, et cetera, as I've described. So don't think about it on per month. Think about it on time to systems and what remains. And we feel that we can do this before fuel load. I mean we've given you the schedule. If you try to, I'm afraid, I'm afraid from your question. If you're trying to say, oh, well, you've done 4.5 per month and you got 50 left that says another 10 months. That's not the right logic. If that was your question, it's not ratable analysis. Yes. Hey Paul, one more piece of logic. We get these reports all the time in our big meetings. Remember I've described these meetings where our process are effectively, completely transparent. In other words, system independent monitors in there, represents in the Georgia Public Service Commission staff, co-owners, NRC, DOE, everybody's in there. Okay. We do an evaluation. There's this gigantic long chart that maps out all of the systems that need to be complete over time. One of the things I probably haven't said it clearly to you as I will now. When you think about the remaining systems between say, hot functional and fuel load, every one of those remaining 50 systems are over 90% complete. So it's not like we're starting from ground zero. So you're really finishing up, what is effectively almost complete construction. Maybe that's helpful. Yes, that may have been true. I mean it's possible. But that's all a little bit of bayoneting the dead. In other words, we are where we are right now. And I think that probably did cause the recognition of what was effectively complete as opposed to work that remained that needed to be remediated was not as clear as it could have been. So what we're giving you right now is a completely transparent view as to where we are and what needs to be done in order to complete. I think that analysis was kind of backward looking. No, the only thing I would just say they should reappear in Unit 4, because we've taken into account those issues. Yes, we've added about, I don't know, nearly two weeks internet schedule. You remember Paul from prior calls, we had gosh, I want to say a little over a month in a startup from fuel load to in-service. And we took – we said this some time ago, we took about two weeks and added it into the Hot Functional Test to fuel load. So you should think now that total period is kind of, well, I don't know, 70 days. Okay. We just added contingency in there. We added more margin. And we did that at the same time to, I think this was Angie, we did that at the same time that we push some work that was around 2020, I want to say somewhere around there where we push some work beyond HFT and a fuel load and also some last quarter. Hey, and thank you for raising all these questions. They're all very important. So Paul, we sure appreciate your clarification here. Andrew, how you're doing? Which mean this stuff is right. Yes. Andy, it's a very interesting question, but here's the thing. I think the wisdom of the integrated regulated model will bear fruit significantly as we consider some of these issues. In the so-called organized markets, there is very little control as to constructing an optimal portfolio, number one. Number two, when you think about the portfolio, we should consider that it includes transmission. Number three, I think the fact that part of the secret sauce here is reconfiguring the portfolio, absent coal, coal carries with it a whole lot of O&M. And so not only is there optionality in terms of the generation and transmission, we will provide. I think by our planning processes, we can do that in a way that's much more orderly and effective and efficient, then the organized market. And then finally, when you consider the O&M, that could be freed up by closing down some of these O&M intensive facilities like coal plants. We have the ability to use that O&M to keep rates lower then you'll find elsewhere in the country. Certainly, even compared to those companies that are just wires only. Their ability to deliver the kind of price, shock absorbers, doesn't exist, because they will be takers of costs from the market. So I can assure you that we've already been talking about these issues with our regulators, with our stockholders. I mean our stakeholders and I can think that we – as my earnings call, but I think we're better positioned in this kind of model in this region then elsewhere in the United States. You bet. Thank you. Yes. I just want to maybe end with Andy's comment there. This is a very exciting time for us all. We're making great progress on Vogtle. I think we resolve the delays and we think we have a clearer path. Every month that goes by, we reduce remaining risk in the project. And so I think we continue to progress this thing. And boy, I can tell you the site for all the work they're putting in is really starting to see the dividends of all their efforts. And so I can tell you, we can see the light at the end of the tunnel, and we are imbued with enthusiasm. When I think about the days ahead, in terms of transitioning the fleet Southern Company is committed to constructive collaboration, not just cooperation, collaboration with the United States government to achieve their aspirations. And so we will work together. I love our cards in this regard. I know a lot of people give you a lot of rhetoric about where they say they are and what they have done. I would rather have our cards and almost anybody else's going forward as we address the future. Thanks everybody for your attendance today. I know it went a little long, but I always enjoy interactions. And I know I always get a lot out of the questions you ask. Thanks again. Have a great next quarter and we'll see you again in July."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Scott, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Southern Company Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.\nScott Gammill: Thank you, Scott. Good afternoon, and welcome to Southern Company's year-end 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Dan Tucker, Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Georgia Power's CEO, Chris Womack, who will be succeeding Tom as President and CEO in the coming months is also joining us. Let me remind you, we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Qs and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.\nTom Fanning: Thank you, Scott. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Southern Company had another exceptional year in 2022. As you can see from the materials that we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted earnings per share consistent with the very top of our guidance range. These results were due in no small part to the culmination of the hard work of thousands of people throughout our company to put in day in and day out to provide customers with clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy. Our operations team, generation fleet and power delivery system worked exceedingly well in 2022 which included meeting an all-time peak load of over 41,000 megawatts in June and navigating well in extreme winter cold event over the Christmas weekend that pushed electric demand to a system peak load of nearly 38,000 megawatts, a December record. Our success with these events is a testament to the value of our vertically integrated state regulated business model delivers to our customers and the communities we are privileged to serve. A great example of the benefits which come from our state's long-term integrated planning processes is the 26% winter reserve margin factored into the capacity planning process. This winter reserve margin, which is significantly higher than typical summer reserve margin inherently recognizes that peak demand in the winter occurs during the dark early morning hours when solar resources are diminished and cold temperatures can have unintended adverse effects on generation and fuel supply equipment. Such thoughtful planning assumptions, along with robust winterization programs and a continuous focus on resilience investments are top of mind across all of our state-regulated utilities. Let's turn now to an update on Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Since our last call, the site team at Unit 3 has turned to testing and start-up process in support of the unit's next major milestone, initial criticality. During this process, as disclosed in January, we identified vibrations associated with certain piping within the passive cooling system, which required additional time to remediate. The site team cooled down the unit and successfully remediated the vibrations, allowing them to resume the testing, which precedes initial criticality. During this work, we identified a few additional issues to address, consistent with our focus on optimal long-term performance and getting it right. We've added some additional time to the Unit 3 schedule to address these items and to reduce the risks associated with other potential issues emerging. We now project placing Unit 3 in service in May or June of 2023. Turning now to Unit 4. Substantial progress continued throughout the last quarter. We successfully completed cold hydro testing in early December. Electrical production and terminations through year-end were sustained at levels supportive of our year-end 2023 in-service objective. All required systems necessary to start hot functional testing on Unit 4 have been completed and turned over to the initial test program. Component and system testing activities are steadily increasing and are now critical path in support of the next major milestones for Unit 4, hot functional testing and fuel load. We have seen a marked improvement in testing results for Unit 4 compared to the Unit 3 process, which reflects the increased focus on first-time construction quality and timely documentation. Even with the improved results, somewhat slower than planned testing productivity has consumed margin in our schedule. The sites working Vogtle continues to reflect a couple of months of remaining margin for a 2023 in-service date. After careful consideration and given our experience on Unit 3 and the degree of critical work ahead of us, we are further risk adjusting our Unit 4 schedule to reflect a range of the projected in-service date between late 4th quarter of 2023 and the end of the first quarter of 2024. Turning now to cost. Georgia Power's share of the total project capital cost forecast reflects a projected increase of $201 million to fund the extension of Unit 3 and Unit 4 projected in-service dates to the end of the second quarter 2023 and to the end of the first quarter 2024, respectively, plus modest increases in the projected cost of resources to complete the remaining work and testing on Unit 4. As a result, Georgia Power recorded an after-tax charge of $150 million during the quarter. We've included project schedules for the next major milestones for each unit, including initial criticality for Unit 3 and and the start of hot functional testing for Unit 4 in the materials provided for this call. Our priority remains bringing Vogtle Units 3 and 4 online to provide Georgia with a reliable, carbon-free resource for the next 60 to 80 years. We will continue to take the time needed to get it right and will not sacrifice safety or quality to meet schedule. Dan, I'll turn the call over to you.\nDan Tucker: Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom mentioned, we had strong financial results for the year with adjusted earnings of $3.60 per share, $0.19 higher than 2021. The primary drivers for the year-over-year increase are higher revenues associated with retail pricing, warmer weather, primarily in the second quarter of 2022, customer growth, increased usage and investment on our regulated utilities. These revenue effects were partially offset by higher non-fuel O&M expenses and higher interest expenses. The increase in non-fuel O&M reflects long-term commitments to our regulated utilities to reliability and resiliency, along with efforts to advance maintenance activities in light of emerging cost pressures. Additional shares from the mandatory conversion of our equity units in August '22 are also reflected in 2022 EPS results. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and 2022 and back above pre-pandemic levels, we continue to see robust residential growth with the addition of nearly 50,000 residential electric customers and over 30,000 residential gas customers throughout the year. Residential customer usage also continued to outpace our expectations, reflecting sustained hybrid work practices across our service territories. Additionally, commercial sales for 2022 beat our forecast by nearly 2%, reflecting a reversion to pre-pandemic trends as the economy shifts from consuming goods to services. Industrial sales for 2022 were lower than forecast by 1.5%, driven by a chemical facility closure and weakening industrial sales momentum during the second half of the year. With interest rates rising, we have seen slowing in construction and housing-related sectors, such as lumber, stone, clay and glass and textiles. In the fourth quarter of 2022, eight of our top 10 industrial segments experienced slower sales growth as compared to the prior quarter. Included in our 2023 guidance is an assumption of retail electric sales growth of 0% to 1%. And as in prior quarters, we continue to monitor the potential implications of supply chain constraints, labor force participation and inflationary pressures on our outlook. The economic development pipeline in our service territories remains robust. 2022 economic development announcements in our Southeast service territories saw an increase in expected job creation and capital investment of 135% and 257%, respectively, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The pipeline of potential projects grew significantly compared to recent years with new corporate announcements and expansions representing a broad cross-section of industries, including automotive, technology, e-fulfillment and distribution, health care and bioscience. In addition to the traditional factors that have historically drawn businesses to our service territory like transportation networks, lower cost of living and business-friendly state and local policies. Another emerging trend that continues to drive momentum in both economic development wins and the size of the potential pipeline is the diversified workforce, especially technology workers and the diverse university systems in our territories, which prominently feature several HBCUs. We're proud to have been on the forefront of helping develop this workforce through our significant investment along with Apple in the Propel Center in Atlanta. More and more, as other companies strive to have their workforce reflect the diverse global customers they serve, our Southeast service territories have become a top choice for relocation or expansion. We are proud of the significant role that our subsidiaries play in attracting new businesses to our service territories. And in 2022, Site Selection Magazine named Alabama Power and Georgia Power, Top U.S. utilities for economic development for the fourth consecutive year and recognize the state of Georgia as the second best business climate in the country. Strong economic development activity continues to differentiate our Southeast service territories from other areas of the country. Turning now to our expectations for 2023. Our adjusted earnings guidance range for the year is $3.55 to $3.65 per share. Expected drivers for 2023 versus 2022, our continued growth in our state-regulated subsidiaries, including the contribution related to Vogtle Unit 3 going into service, offset by higher parent company interest expense including financing costs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 with costs in excess of $7.3 billion seemed reasonable by the Georgia PSC and share dilution, reflecting the full year impact of the mandatory conversion of our equity units in August 2022. We estimate adjusted earnings of $0.70 per share for the first quarter. Additionally, we are narrowing our 2024 adjusted guidance range of $4 to $4.30 which was established in early 2021. In order to acknowledge the uncertainty inherent in providing guidance three years in advance, the original 2024 range was wider than our typical annual EPS guidance ranges. Since this range was introduced in February 2021, our state-regulated outcomes have been largely consistent with our assumptions. Several upside opportunities inherent in the top end of our original range, like renewable and storage investment opportunities at both our state-regulated electric companies and Southern Power have been deferred to later years largely due to adverse market conditions, including more challenging, contracting requirements and global supply chain constraints. Financing costs, particularly parent company interest rates are a significant headwind relative to our forecast in early 2021. Rates on variable and short-term debt are significantly higher than expected, and as securities in our low-cost debt portfolio mature, new issuances, no matter the tenor, are significantly more expensive. Compounding these negative parent company interest rate effects are the growth in our state-regulated capital plans relative to early 2021 and the increased cost for Georgia Power share of Vogtle 3 and 4 which has grown by nearly $1.9 billion since early 2021. Collectively, these factors would narrow our $4 to $4.30 range, adjusted for 2024 to $4.10. Adding the potential for Vogtle 4 to be completed at the end of the first quarter of 2024 which would have a negative $0.05 per share impact solely in 2024, we are providing an adjusted 2024 earnings guidance range of $3.95 to $4.10 per share. We plan to further narrow this range during our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call early next year. We continue to see our long-term adjusted EPS growth rate in the 5% to 7% range, consistent with our updated 2024 adjusted EPS guidance range. This projected growth is supported by a $43 billion capital plan with 97% of total projected capital deployment over the next five years at our state-regulated utilities. Additionally, our history of constructive regulation, strong credit ratings and disciplined O&M spending served to strengthen our outlook. Our robust capital investment program continues to be driven by significant investment in our state-regulated utility businesses, our total base capital investment plan of approximately $43 billion which excludes the capital required to complete Vogtle Units 3 and 4 reflects a $2 billion increase in state-regulated utility investments relative to our previous five-year forecast. These increases in our forecast are the result of greater visibility into infrastructure required to serve major customer additions and expansions, further improve our grid and protect our technology infrastructure, as well as investments related to the transformation of our generation fleet. We have continued to maintain our disciplined approach to capital forecasting within our state regulated utility businesses. Consistent with past practice, we don't include placeholders, and we don't include capital that isn't expected to earn or allowed regulated returns. The result of this approach is that our capital expenditure forecasts tend to grow especially in the later years as our visibility into customer growth increases as regulatory processes unfold as compliance obligations evolved and as our long-term system planning is refined. We fully expect this trend to continue. Additionally, we continue to believe Southern Power has a significant opportunity to continue growing through investments that facilitate fleet transitions and the growth of clean energy infrastructure across the United States. Southern Power's business model has been distinctive since its beginnings in the early 2000s, focusing on long-term contracts with creditworthy counterparties and a risk-adjusted return profile that aligns well with our overall value proposition. We've allocated up to $3.5 billion over the five-year plan with approximately $500 million in 2023 and $750 million annually for the remainder of the forecast period. These allocations of capital are not included in our base capital forecast. Our financial plan is anchored to our base capital forecast of $43 billion. As I have already suggested, we believe upside potential exists in our state-regulated subsidiary forecast and our Southern Power allocation, which, if realized, would result in total spend of over $46 billion. We also continue to believe many of the same drivers for additional potential investment over the next five years could translate to investment opportunities beyond 2027, as we continue our journey to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions. We've included a three year financing plan in the appendix to today's slide deck. This plan, which is consistent with our updated capital investment plan and the potential capital investment opportunities that we have highlighted continues to assume no equity need over our five-year planning horizon. As always, we will maintain our discipline and the flexibility to use all the financing tools at our disposal to drive value for shareholders. Credit quality and strong investment-grade credit ratings remain a top priority and we continue to believe that to be a high-quality equity investment, a company must maintain a strong credit profile. As we complete Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, we believe the expected reduction in construction risk and the projected improvement in FFO to debt metrics further position us to support our credit quality objectives. Tom, I will now turn the call back over to you.\nTom Fanning: Thank you, Dan. Southern Company strives to deliver superior risk-adjusted total shareholder returns, and I believe the plan we've laid out will support that objective. Our customer and community-focused business model, our growing investment in our state-regulated utility franchises, the priority we place on credit quality and our action towards achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions all contribute to making Southern Company a premier sustainable investment. Our remarkable dividend track record remains a vital component to our value proposition. For three quarters of a century, we have paid a quarterly dividend that is equal to or greater than the previous quarter, including sustained dividend increases for more than 20 years. In closing, I'm sure that most of you are well aware of the recent announcement of Chris Womack to succeed me as President and Chief Executive Officer in the coming months. I will remain as Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors. In conjunction with this announcement, where a number of other senior leadership changes, which highlighted the depth of talent we've worked hard to develop at Southern Company. I expect each of these leaders will flourish in their new roles, further strengthen the Company's deep bench and bring a fresh perspective to each of our businesses. With Chris Womack and his team leading us, the future of Southern Company is in great hands as we continue to strive to make the communities that we have the privilege to serve better off because we're there. And as we continue our relentless pursuit to provide customers with clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy. With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris Womack for a few brief remarks before we get to Q&A.\nChris Womack: Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. I cannot be more excited to have the privilege to lead Southern Company in the months and years ahead. It is an important time in our industry as the energy landscape continues to evolve and customers' needs continue to change. Southern Company is at the forefront of that evolution, and we are building the future of energy. It is an honor to lead teams that are dedicated to innovating and delivering world-class customer service and reliability to customers while also moving boldly forward in our journey to continuously represent our values and improve the communities we serve. Tom and his predecessors along with the thousands of team members across the enterprise Tom mentioned earlier have built a solid foundation for Southern Company. And we've got a lot of important work ahead of us to continue to build upon their legacy. Thank you all again for joining us this afternoon. I look forward to getting the opportunity to get out and interact more closely with each of you in the investment community during the weeks and months ahead. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We do have a question from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.\nTom Fanning: Shar, how are you?\nJames Ward: Tom, Shar is actually on the road traveling at West. It's James Ward here on for him. Thank you. Very much appreciated. Glad to be here. I just wanted to first congratulate Chris, on your new role and Tom, on your planned transition and the evolution of your role in the Company. So congrats to you both. So I have a few questions here. Quick one off the bat. I just had a few inbound questions from people. To clarify, the 5 to 7 base remains the 2024 midpoint, but now it's the midpoint of $3.95 to $4.10, is that correct? Or is there another way to think about the base for that 5 to 7 going forward post-Vogtle?\nDan Tucker: Yes. James, this is Dan. So look, we were very intentional in choosing the words consistent with our adjusted guidance range. Those words were really acknowledging of two things. Thing one is just like we did with the $4 to $4.30, will further narrow this range as we get line of sight on Unit 4 and have our fourth quarter earnings call next year. Thing two, that it acknowledges is that the $0.05 impact for Vogtle 4 potentially going into the first quarter of 2024 is a one-year effect and so the growth rate will be off of that narrowed range when we get to 2024.\nTom Fanning: The other thing is the $0.05 reflects a full charge, assuming you go in at the end of the quarter. I'm really I would be a little disappointed if that's where we end up. Right now, as we stand, adding that extra quarter, we got five months of margin on Unit 4. Hopefully, we can do better than that.\nJames Ward: That's very clear and that's great. Okay. So it'd be a higher base than what some people might have been reading it out. That's good to hear. Looking at your new capital plan and then assuming that some or all of the CapEx beyond the base plans are able to be added. Could you give us a bit more color on how much of that $3 billion could potentially end up at the regulated utilities versus Southern Power? And then as a follow-up, in the slides, you show the 11 different categories there, the examples of where that incremental investment could be renewables, transmission, et cetera. In your view, which of these categories are most likely to end up in the plan? What's kind of low-hanging fruit, if there is such a thing or just what is most probable and in sort of what years if we were to be building kind of an upside scenario versus a base scenario that we're trying to look at what would make the most sense to kind of prioritize there?\nTom Fanning: Yes. If it was me, do you include the graphs you've done in the past about how the CapEx shows? We have yes, there you go. Was that Page 21 is what I'm looking at. I do know what you guys see. We have a history of always undershooting, especially our outward year forecast. And on the average, I would say that taken over the five years, we undershoot another $3 billion, just round numbers. So if you look over the entire five-year period and an upside case, may include $3 billion of additional franchise related rate base looking CapEx investments. Whether Southern Power hits its $3 billion or not, remains to be seen about market conditions, supply chain constraints and a variety of other things. We've been very clear in past calls to call out what I think have been challenging market conditions. Shorter terms, we like bilateral contracts, no fuel risk, creditworthy counterparties, et cetera. The contract conditions have gotten tougher. And we're very disciplined. We generally expect about 150 basis points premium for us to go down the bilateral contract out via Southern Power as compared to our franchise utilities. Now whether we're able to duplicate that or not, we'll see. If they don't show up, we won't invest. If you want to include more upside, I would include some portion of that $3-plus billion for Southern Power over the five-year period. I would also kind of tilt those investments towards the back end. One last comment I will make, we said it in the script, but I think it's important. When you look at additional CapEx available outside the five-year period, I think you really do start picking up some of the generation transition kind of capital that may be available. Recall, we will have a high bias towards more gas, more renewables, particularly solar in our region. Dan, do you want to add to that?\nDan Tucker: Look, I think you covered it really well. The other thing I'd just reinforce, James, is that the 5% to 7% growth rate is based on our $43 billion capital plan opportunity to deploy more than that simply strengthens our position in that regard or potentially lengthens our position in that regard. And just going back to what Tom said about the longer term. Just recall, a lot of our coal retirement plans happen at the very end or the year after our five-year plan, and that really is where a lot of incremental opportunities also get unlocked.\nTom Fanning: I mean, for example, a big slug of retirements are in '29. So as Dan said, that's outside the fact.\nJames Ward: Got you. That's extremely helpful and especially the color on upside there. Very much appreciated. Yes, that helps a lot. The final question for us is in the slides, you mentioned that you expect robust customer growth across your service territories will then also, of course, only expecting flat to slightly increasing retail electric sales, building on the details that you shared in the prepared remarks. Could you give us just a bit more granularity given that these are broad rather than just regionally focused on one particular area? On these broad trends, what's driving the divergence there? Or are you just taking a more conservative approach going forward to help us understand a bit more how to look at it?\nTom Fanning: Yes. It is kind of a conservative approach. But here's the thing. We have in front of us kind of data that supports a couple of different scenarios. On CNBC this morning, I talked about the potential for a soft or no landing. In other words, when you look at growth year-over-year, we have kind of a negative mixed bag of things going on in industrial. They're not all negative. There are some positives. But when you look at the momentum statistics, that is the first derivative of growth, they're all negative. In other words, even if you grew year-over-year, the growth rate was smaller. So that would seem to indicate that at least within the industrial sector, that things are slowing a bit. Now they have been way better than what they thought we would be, but still slowing, okay? On the other hand, what we're seeing out of our economic development statistics, increase in job announcements of 130% increase in capital investment a little over 250%. That says that economic development projects generally show up in the two to three to perhaps more time frame. So what it says is we may see a wee bit of a downturn of slowing in the economy in -- in 2023, but we don't see this thing dipping into recession levels, and we see recovery. Certainly, I think the Southeast is demonstrated that capability in the past. A couple more economic data that's important. We tend to grow about 1% a year projected for the next, I don't know, five years. Everybody is able to get jobs for the most part right now. We have historically low unemployment levels. So you add the kind of steady drumbeat of population growth to the Southeast as Dan said before, a business-friendly climate. I think we can see maybe some slowing in '23, but recovering in '24.\nDan Tucker: And then James, just connect that back to your previous question. Look, this growth is certainly exceeding our expectations in terms of the economic development activity, and that could very well translate to the need to invest more to serve that load that was not anticipated. So we think over the next three to five years, that will all begin to be very transparent to the market.\nTom Fanning: One last point. The -- it looks like the work environment on employees, we call it hybrid now, but it looks like it's settling down. So we're seeing residential higher than what we thought commercial is certainly higher than what we thought. We'll see how that works out in the future. There's probably still some variance there.\nJames Ward: Very helpful all around, especially in framing potential upside scenarios there, which it looks like you guys might be very well positioned to head into depending on how the macro environment works out. Either way, looking forward to having Vogtle done this year, as I'm sure you and everyone else are and being able to move on to everything you've just been talking about. So it looks like great things ahead. Thanks again for taking the question. Appreciate it.\nOperator: We have a question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTom Fanning: Steve, thanks for joining us.\nSteven Fleishman: Yes, so just on -- and by the way, congrats to both Tom and Chris and Tim and team. So -- the -- on the Vogtle 3, could you please elaborate on the few additional issues that are comment of reducing risk of other issues? Can we get color on all that?\nTom Fanning: Yes, sure. There were kind of three things. There were many other tests in the three things we identified. So -- you should know that we successfully evaluated a lot of things going up to criticality. So the three though that we point to that caused delays, at least the first two on their own weren't big, but they required us as we started to heat the plant up and pressurize it, we saw the vibrations. There was some conversation about whether we should start the critical test and fix it later and we said, no, let's do it right. So we brought the plant down. We inserted a couple of metal plates, to be honest with you. It's to some trucks that connect to the pipe and fix the vibration. I mean it was pretty straightforward, it just took time to heat up, pressurize, take heat down, depressurized. The second thing we saw was a valve that was connected to some pipes that effectively had two DRIPs per minute. We wanted to eliminate all DRIPs. And we identified that there was a repositioning of a flange associated with this valve that we ultimately are -- I think we're just about fixed with it today, but I got a report from Pete Sena, our President of Nuclear. And I think that's done today. That's completed. The last issue is not completed, but it has to do with flow through the reactor coolant pumps. And we're just now making sure that we know what the issue is. It could be a physical issue, it could be a calibration issue. In fact, the flow may be good, but we need to recalibrate the measurements around it. So we're all about kind of looking at that today.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay. And then in terms of the comment about doing these to reduce the risk of other issues, is that -- are you saying there that kind of by doing these things? Do you think the chance of other things coming up at this point is going to be lower or something after you started up or the opposite?\nTom Fanning: I would think so. Yes, Steve, I would think so. I mean, that's -- when we go in to fix the vibration on the pipe, we saw this other set we said, yes, let's not push it, let's fix it. All of that takes time. It's just phrase we use, but we really do act on it and get it right. We'd rather have this thing, get into criticality. Once you go nuclear and go critical, things become much tougher. So anything we know about let's deal with it now. And you should know that anything we find now we go over to Unit 4 and check that, for example, and we think the issue on pipe vibrations is spoken for now on Unit 4. We won't see that. So anyway, that really is the answer. We're trying to get as much as we can. Once you get go critical, it's a much more challenging environment than it is before you go critical. Just trying to get everything we can see right now.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay. And I guess is the fact that you found these things kind of a concern that you're going to find more? Or is it really more the opposite that you found these things, this is just part of a big plant starting up, and hopefully, there's less of a risk from here?\nTom Fanning: Yes. But that is why we test, right? I mean you should view the power ascension once you go critical as a series of tests that involve a whole variety of different conditions of the plant, taking it up, bringing it down, throwing emergency stops in there, all kinds of things. The purpose of the initial voyage, if they will, the test voyage is to find problems. And we allow for that within the schedule. And now, in fact, we have more time to allow the schedule calls for, I guess, on the original schedule, something like two months of testing, the prescribed start-up in is two months. And there's roughly a month of slack time to fix things, okay? We now have, I think, another month that we've added into our projection into the second quarter. But for sure, Steve, we'll find some…\nOperator: Our next question is from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDavid Arcaro: Extend my congratulations as well. I was just wondering, a follow-up on that question. Is NRC approval? Has that been needed for any of the remediation work on these couple of issues that you found at Unit 3?\nTom Fanning: We've been in constant contact with the NRC. And we did have, I think, with connection of the vibration two license amendments, but we got those in a matter of days. This was not a protracted process. And like I say, I think that we continue to work hand in glove with those guys. They were also aware of the valve leak and they're happy, I think, with the process that we're following there. You should understand that the working relationship with all of the external parties, whether it's the NRC or whether it's the state commission or DOE, anybody. We all sit in the same meetings. We all see the same stuff. We have and complete transparency and everything we do on that side.\nDavid Arcaro: That makes sense. Understood. And are these issues that at this point now, you could potentially avoid for Unit 4 bring learnings from the start-up process on Unit 3 and potentially make Unit 4 smoother such that it's not a kind of a one-for-one delay here equals a delay later?\nTom Fanning: Amen, brother. That's exactly what we're trying to do. And in fact, the process, I think it's been noted by many have shown that Unit 4 is going a lot smoother than Unit 3 just because of learnings of Unit 3. I think the process we went through in Unit 3 at times was somewhat painful, but I think it was certainly instructive. If you may remember, as we started, we went into HFT for Unit 3, we were turning over systems like the day before we went to HFT. For example, all systems necessary to undertake HFT have been completed. The long pole in the 10 on HFT at Unit 4 is our ITP, our integrated test plan.\nDavid Arcaro: Yes. Got you. Got you. And then a separate topic, but the decline in natural gas prices is a nice tailwind for customer builds. I was wondering when would customers -- could you just remind us when they might see lower prices flow through into rates? And how does that interact this year with your plans for the deferred fuel collections?\nDan Tucker: David, this is Dan. So certainly, lower prices are going to benefit customers. And Georgia Power, in particular, who has the largest unrecovered balance ended the year at about $2.1 billion. They'll file at the end of February for those rates. So I certainly don't want to front-run that process. But if to the extent forecast continue to look the way they do today or further come down, the impact on customer bills will be greatly mitigated. The -- our other electric jurisdictions have already initially addressed the under recovery that was happening. And so these lower prices are simply going to accelerate that recovery.\nOperator: And we have a question from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nTom Fanning: Thanks for joining us.\nDurgesh Chopra: Thanks, Tom. Appreciate it. I think, Dan, this is in your view house. Maybe just -- I apologize if I missed this, but can you give us your sort of your CFO to debt or FFO to debt as of year-end 2022? And where that is tracking versus the -- your targeted credit metrics? And then when in your planning horizon, do you expect to get to your targeted credit metrics?\nDan Tucker: Yes, Durgesh, thanks for the question, and happy to share that. And as you know, all the agencies calculate those metrics at a slightly different way. But I think there's certainly a lot of focus on Moody's and S&P. So I'll hit on those, in particular. Moody's, we were about 12% for 2022 and S&P about 15%. And as you'd expect, those were pretty significantly impacted by the under-recovered fuel dynamics, particularly the Moody's metric in the way that they calculate that. A portion of it is the debt and a portion of it for us is also the impact that under recovering that fuel had on our tax appetite and our ability to monetize tax benefits, you combine those factors overall, really about a 400 basis point impact to the Moody's metric in 2022. As we look ahead, and we've talked about this a lot in the past, Vogtle certainly on its own, has a significant impact on improving the overall financial profile of the Company as we begin to recover our investment on that in the future. As we get out to 2024, once it's in service, our metrics are closer to 17%, 18%, which are well above our targets and provide us that kind of buffer against adversity that we prefer to have in our profile.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. That's super helpful then. So just to be clear, like you would be outside of the fuel balance, you would be close to like 16% on Moody's basis as of the end of 2022, if you exclude the fuel balance that's on the balance sheet?\nDan Tucker: That's right. And as I give you that 17% to 18% projection in the future, that includes an assumption that we might still have an unrecovered balance that we continue to collect, but that it's certainly been worked down and Vogtle has kind of overlaid that to improve the overall profile.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. Got it. And just one hopefully, a quick one. In 2023 EPS guidance range, can you just remind us like what is your assumption for earnings from the Unit 3?\nDan Tucker: So, it's about $0.04 or so that it contributes in 2023 relative to 2022. So that's essentially the assumption of a little more than half the year in service and then there's -- that's offset slightly by the fact that there's some of the rate base that won't actually earn its full return until Unit 4 is also in service.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. And congratulations, Chris and Tom, I much appreciate the time today.\nOperator: Our next question is from Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTom Fanning: Angie, how are you?\nAgnie Storozynski: Good, good. But I will star it up a little bit. So can we talk about management succession? So, we're really glad to see the updates and congratulations to you and Chris, but I'm just wondering how the Chris' appointment reconciles with the the age policy that Southern used to have at least? That's one. And then two is, we've had some negative headlines around Alabama Power. There's been a change in CEO. And I'm just basically asking if there's any link in those management changes at that subsidiary and those media headlines?\nTom Fanning: Yes, sure. The 65 thing is it's kind of a policy. It's not a rule, I don't guess. The Board and I had lots of discussions about staying on beyond 65. One of my personal interest has been to help see Vogtle through. And I'm still young physically and young at heart, I guess, and when we kind of cross that threshold, we looked at people like, Wow, Mac, who is, I guess, you're what, a year younger than me. And if you've been around Chris at all, you would know that he still acts like a 25-year-old. So it was very easy to see him continue in the role, and he has fire in his belly and he's done a great job wherever he's been most notably at Georgia Power, successfully working with our constituents on the three-year triennial rate case that we do. So it was easy for us to kind of say, look, 65 is just a number, so long as we're able to contribute in a robust way, that's great. And that's how we did that. There really wasn't any connection with Mark Crossley, to be honest with you. He had -- I don't know, I want to go into all that, but he had some issues he wanted to deal with. It was reasonably clear that he wasn't a contender as a successor here, and I think he decided to retire. That was kind of his choice at the end of the day.\nAgnie Storozynski: Okay. So just one follow-up on Chris. So we should expect that Chris is going to stay in the current spot for the next couple of years, even crosses that 65-year old threshold?\nTom Fanning: Yes. I'll go ahead with. Chris was asked directly. He's committed to 70.\nAgnie Storozynski: Okay. Good for you. Okay. So moving on to Southern Power. So I hear your comments and I see, obviously, the reduction and growth CapEx of that subsidiary. But is it -- I mean, are you trying to conserve in a sense of financing? Is that the constraint? I mean, I obviously hear issues with profitability of additional contract-based renewables and some constraints about equipment availability. But I'm just wondering if the -- if you were just trying to plan your spending for Southern Power within the capital structure that you currently have?\nTom Fanning: No, Angie. It has nothing to do with that. It really is two things. So Dan is a conservative soul and he likes to build his plan without considering upside. So as we've done for years, the way before Dan got here, we don't put in place holders. We think about them and think about what effect they could have. Further, we don't add anything from Southern Power. And you should think about contributions from Southern Power as upside to the base case. It really isn't a constraint of capital structure or balance sheet.\nOperator: We have a question from Nick Campanella with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nNick Campanella: Congrats to all management changes. I guess just hot functional for Unit 4. You have this nice slide here, Slide 8, looks like end of March to, call it, late June on HFT. Just going back to kind of the conservatism comments like where do you kind of see yourself tracking towards now with the system turnovers and the line of sight?\nTom Fanning: The site working plan has HFT in March. We know that things can happen between now and then, but that's what it shows.\nNick Campanella: Okay. And then can you just update us on the time line for the prudency review just with the latest kind of update to the COD data?\nTom Fanning: It's fuel load on Unit 4. Chris, do you want to say anything more?\nChris Womack: We're scheduled to end a prudence on fuel load of 4 -- so that's the schedule and that's the path we'll take, and that's the agreement arrangement we have with the Georgia Public Service Commission.\nNick Campanella: Okay. So mid-summer here. All right. Thank you so much.\nOperator: We have a question from [Paul Fremont] with Ladenburg. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTom Fanning: Hello, Paul, I always glad to have you with us.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you so much. Going back to -- going back to Unit 3. The flow-through on the reactor or cooling comps, is that a valve issue as well? Or is that something else?\nTom Fanning: Still kind of running it down. It could be a calibration issue. It could just be the way we measure the flow going through. So we're trying to guess what it is at this point. It is really not practical. They're doing all the work necessary to get to the bottom of that.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And the valve issue that you talked about with the DRIP, that's completely resolved?\nTom Fanning: Thanks. Yes, I talked to Pete Sena, gosh, 11:30 today and he thought it was taken care of. We'll see.\nUnidentified Analyst: And then how many ITAAC approvals do you think you need to move forward and actually do hot functional testing?\nTom Fanning: Zero. We're good.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, because I thought on Unit 3, there were a certain number of ITAACs that you thought were nuclear-related where you didn't feel comfortable doing the hot functional testing without having those in hand.\nTom Fanning: No. I think you're remembering fuel load there, we're in awfully good shape. And if you look at where we are on four as compared to three in relation to HFT, we are light years better. Mean we're ready to go. All we got to do is finish the required tests before we get the heat going and run the plant. That really is the critical path at this point.\nUnidentified Analyst: And then last question for me. If you were to do the additional CapEx beyond the base, does that also not require equity? Or does equity come with that?\nDan Tucker: Based on our current projections, we would still not project any equity. And that's where when I talked about having that cushion in our credit metrics, that plays a big part of that.\nOperator: And we have a question from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTom Fanning: Anthony, how are you?\nAnthony Crowdell: Not bad, Tom, how are you doing?\nTom Fanning: Fantastic, my friend.\nAnthony Crowdell: Congrats to all and I just have one quick follow-up from Durgesh's question on the credit side of the world. Just with the units going in service, do you think the credit agencies lower the downgrade threshold because of the, I guess, reduced business risk?\nDan Tucker: Yes. Look, Anthony, I never want to speak for the agencies. I would look like us that aren't currently building nuclear units, many of them have lower thresholds. So I think there's certainly a strong argument for that to potentially take place. I won't speak for, but they should.\nOperator: And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks?\nTom Fanning: Yes. Really appreciate you guys joining us. It's an exciting year 2023 is going to be an exciting year. John, we have our annual meeting where I turn over President and CEO, I guess I've already turned over President, but CEO to Chris. Wouldn't it be great Chris to have Unit 3 under our belt by then. You guys are going to love Womack funny story I tell everybody when I first got this job, I have always been friends of his but admired his wisdom, intelligence, his work ethic, his can-do attitude. And the very first thing I did when I got the job was move his office from down the hall right next to mine. And I can tell you that Chris has been a thought leader and a partner of mine throughout my tenure. He'll be ready to go day one to carry this company forward, and when you look at people like Kim Greene and Stan Connally and Jim Carr and all the -- and Jeff people and all the other people that are in these positions. I think it's an awfully strong team. It's the envy of our industry an embarrassment of riches in some respects. And I think Southern, especially post-Vogtle, is going to be a bit like a rocket ship, if I could say that. We're going to be doing great. So thank you all. It's been a pleasure knowing you all and working with you, and we'll see you soon. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the Southern Company Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Tom Fanning",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Southern Company had another exceptional year in 2022. As you can see from the materials that we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted earnings per share consistent with the very top of our guidance range. These results were due in no small part to the culmination of the hard work of thousands of people throughout our company to put in day in and day out to provide customers with clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy. Our operations team, generation fleet and power delivery system worked exceedingly well in 2022 which included meeting an all-time peak load of over 41,000 megawatts in June and navigating well in extreme winter cold event over the Christmas weekend that pushed electric demand to a system peak load of nearly 38,000 megawatts, a December record. Our success with these events is a testament to the value of our vertically integrated state regulated business model delivers to our customers and the communities we are privileged to serve. A great example of the benefits which come from our state's long-term integrated planning processes is the 26% winter reserve margin factored into the capacity planning process. This winter reserve margin, which is significantly higher than typical summer reserve margin inherently recognizes that peak demand in the winter occurs during the dark early morning hours when solar resources are diminished and cold temperatures can have unintended adverse effects on generation and fuel supply equipment. Such thoughtful planning assumptions, along with robust winterization programs and a continuous focus on resilience investments are top of mind across all of our state-regulated utilities. Let's turn now to an update on Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Since our last call, the site team at Unit 3 has turned to testing and start-up process in support of the unit's next major milestone, initial criticality. During this process, as disclosed in January, we identified vibrations associated with certain piping within the passive cooling system, which required additional time to remediate. The site team cooled down the unit and successfully remediated the vibrations, allowing them to resume the testing, which precedes initial criticality. During this work, we identified a few additional issues to address, consistent with our focus on optimal long-term performance and getting it right. We've added some additional time to the Unit 3 schedule to address these items and to reduce the risks associated with other potential issues emerging. We now project placing Unit 3 in service in May or June of 2023. Turning now to Unit 4. Substantial progress continued throughout the last quarter. We successfully completed cold hydro testing in early December. Electrical production and terminations through year-end were sustained at levels supportive of our year-end 2023 in-service objective. All required systems necessary to start hot functional testing on Unit 4 have been completed and turned over to the initial test program. Component and system testing activities are steadily increasing and are now critical path in support of the next major milestones for Unit 4, hot functional testing and fuel load. We have seen a marked improvement in testing results for Unit 4 compared to the Unit 3 process, which reflects the increased focus on first-time construction quality and timely documentation. Even with the improved results, somewhat slower than planned testing productivity has consumed margin in our schedule. The sites working Vogtle continues to reflect a couple of months of remaining margin for a 2023 in-service date. After careful consideration and given our experience on Unit 3 and the degree of critical work ahead of us, we are further risk adjusting our Unit 4 schedule to reflect a range of the projected in-service date between late 4th quarter of 2023 and the end of the first quarter of 2024. Turning now to cost. Georgia Power's share of the total project capital cost forecast reflects a projected increase of $201 million to fund the extension of Unit 3 and Unit 4 projected in-service dates to the end of the second quarter 2023 and to the end of the first quarter 2024, respectively, plus modest increases in the projected cost of resources to complete the remaining work and testing on Unit 4. As a result, Georgia Power recorded an after-tax charge of $150 million during the quarter. We've included project schedules for the next major milestones for each unit, including initial criticality for Unit 3 and and the start of hot functional testing for Unit 4 in the materials provided for this call. Our priority remains bringing Vogtle Units 3 and 4 online to provide Georgia with a reliable, carbon-free resource for the next 60 to 80 years. We will continue to take the time needed to get it right and will not sacrifice safety or quality to meet schedule. Dan, I'll turn the call over to you. Thank you, Dan. Southern Company strives to deliver superior risk-adjusted total shareholder returns, and I believe the plan we've laid out will support that objective. Our customer and community-focused business model, our growing investment in our state-regulated utility franchises, the priority we place on credit quality and our action towards achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions all contribute to making Southern Company a premier sustainable investment. Our remarkable dividend track record remains a vital component to our value proposition. For three quarters of a century, we have paid a quarterly dividend that is equal to or greater than the previous quarter, including sustained dividend increases for more than 20 years. In closing, I'm sure that most of you are well aware of the recent announcement of Chris Womack to succeed me as President and Chief Executive Officer in the coming months. I will remain as Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors. In conjunction with this announcement, where a number of other senior leadership changes, which highlighted the depth of talent we've worked hard to develop at Southern Company. I expect each of these leaders will flourish in their new roles, further strengthen the Company's deep bench and bring a fresh perspective to each of our businesses. With Chris Womack and his team leading us, the future of Southern Company is in great hands as we continue to strive to make the communities that we have the privilege to serve better off because we're there. And as we continue our relentless pursuit to provide customers with clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy. With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris Womack for a few brief remarks before we get to Q&A. Shar, how are you? The other thing is the $0.05 reflects a full charge, assuming you go in at the end of the quarter. I'm really I would be a little disappointed if that's where we end up. Right now, as we stand, adding that extra quarter, we got five months of margin on Unit 4. Hopefully, we can do better than that. Yes. If it was me, do you include the graphs you've done in the past about how the CapEx shows? We have yes, there you go. Was that Page 21 is what I'm looking at. I do know what you guys see. We have a history of always undershooting, especially our outward year forecast. And on the average, I would say that taken over the five years, we undershoot another $3 billion, just round numbers. So if you look over the entire five-year period and an upside case, may include $3 billion of additional franchise related rate base looking CapEx investments. Whether Southern Power hits its $3 billion or not, remains to be seen about market conditions, supply chain constraints and a variety of other things. We've been very clear in past calls to call out what I think have been challenging market conditions. Shorter terms, we like bilateral contracts, no fuel risk, creditworthy counterparties, et cetera. The contract conditions have gotten tougher. And we're very disciplined. We generally expect about 150 basis points premium for us to go down the bilateral contract out via Southern Power as compared to our franchise utilities. Now whether we're able to duplicate that or not, we'll see. If they don't show up, we won't invest. If you want to include more upside, I would include some portion of that $3-plus billion for Southern Power over the five-year period. I would also kind of tilt those investments towards the back end. One last comment I will make, we said it in the script, but I think it's important. When you look at additional CapEx available outside the five-year period, I think you really do start picking up some of the generation transition kind of capital that may be available. Recall, we will have a high bias towards more gas, more renewables, particularly solar in our region. Dan, do you want to add to that? I mean, for example, a big slug of retirements are in '29. So as Dan said, that's outside the fact. Yes. It is kind of a conservative approach. But here's the thing. We have in front of us kind of data that supports a couple of different scenarios. On CNBC this morning, I talked about the potential for a soft or no landing. In other words, when you look at growth year-over-year, we have kind of a negative mixed bag of things going on in industrial. They're not all negative. There are some positives. But when you look at the momentum statistics, that is the first derivative of growth, they're all negative. In other words, even if you grew year-over-year, the growth rate was smaller. So that would seem to indicate that at least within the industrial sector, that things are slowing a bit. Now they have been way better than what they thought we would be, but still slowing, okay? On the other hand, what we're seeing out of our economic development statistics, increase in job announcements of 130% increase in capital investment a little over 250%. That says that economic development projects generally show up in the two to three to perhaps more time frame. So what it says is we may see a wee bit of a downturn of slowing in the economy in -- in 2023, but we don't see this thing dipping into recession levels, and we see recovery. Certainly, I think the Southeast is demonstrated that capability in the past. A couple more economic data that's important. We tend to grow about 1% a year projected for the next, I don't know, five years. Everybody is able to get jobs for the most part right now. We have historically low unemployment levels. So you add the kind of steady drumbeat of population growth to the Southeast as Dan said before, a business-friendly climate. I think we can see maybe some slowing in '23, but recovering in '24. One last point. The -- it looks like the work environment on employees, we call it hybrid now, but it looks like it's settling down. So we're seeing residential higher than what we thought commercial is certainly higher than what we thought. We'll see how that works out in the future. There's probably still some variance there. Steve, thanks for joining us. Yes, sure. There were kind of three things. There were many other tests in the three things we identified. So -- you should know that we successfully evaluated a lot of things going up to criticality. So the three though that we point to that caused delays, at least the first two on their own weren't big, but they required us as we started to heat the plant up and pressurize it, we saw the vibrations. There was some conversation about whether we should start the critical test and fix it later and we said, no, let's do it right. So we brought the plant down. We inserted a couple of metal plates, to be honest with you. It's to some trucks that connect to the pipe and fix the vibration. I mean it was pretty straightforward, it just took time to heat up, pressurize, take heat down, depressurized. The second thing we saw was a valve that was connected to some pipes that effectively had two DRIPs per minute. We wanted to eliminate all DRIPs. And we identified that there was a repositioning of a flange associated with this valve that we ultimately are -- I think we're just about fixed with it today, but I got a report from Pete Sena, our President of Nuclear. And I think that's done today. That's completed. The last issue is not completed, but it has to do with flow through the reactor coolant pumps. And we're just now making sure that we know what the issue is. It could be a physical issue, it could be a calibration issue. In fact, the flow may be good, but we need to recalibrate the measurements around it. So we're all about kind of looking at that today. I would think so. Yes, Steve, I would think so. I mean, that's -- when we go in to fix the vibration on the pipe, we saw this other set we said, yes, let's not push it, let's fix it. All of that takes time. It's just phrase we use, but we really do act on it and get it right. We'd rather have this thing, get into criticality. Once you go nuclear and go critical, things become much tougher. So anything we know about let's deal with it now. And you should know that anything we find now we go over to Unit 4 and check that, for example, and we think the issue on pipe vibrations is spoken for now on Unit 4. We won't see that. So anyway, that really is the answer. We're trying to get as much as we can. Once you get go critical, it's a much more challenging environment than it is before you go critical. Just trying to get everything we can see right now. Yes. But that is why we test, right? I mean you should view the power ascension once you go critical as a series of tests that involve a whole variety of different conditions of the plant, taking it up, bringing it down, throwing emergency stops in there, all kinds of things. The purpose of the initial voyage, if they will, the test voyage is to find problems. And we allow for that within the schedule. And now, in fact, we have more time to allow the schedule calls for, I guess, on the original schedule, something like two months of testing, the prescribed start-up in is two months. And there's roughly a month of slack time to fix things, okay? We now have, I think, another month that we've added into our projection into the second quarter. But for sure, Steve, we'll find some... We've been in constant contact with the NRC. And we did have, I think, with connection of the vibration two license amendments, but we got those in a matter of days. This was not a protracted process. And like I say, I think that we continue to work hand in glove with those guys. They were also aware of the valve leak and they're happy, I think, with the process that we're following there. You should understand that the working relationship with all of the external parties, whether it's the NRC or whether it's the state commission or DOE, anybody. We all sit in the same meetings. We all see the same stuff. We have and complete transparency and everything we do on that side. Amen, brother. That's exactly what we're trying to do. And in fact, the process, I think it's been noted by many have shown that Unit 4 is going a lot smoother than Unit 3 just because of learnings of Unit 3. I think the process we went through in Unit 3 at times was somewhat painful, but I think it was certainly instructive. If you may remember, as we started, we went into HFT for Unit 3, we were turning over systems like the day before we went to HFT. For example, all systems necessary to undertake HFT have been completed. The long pole in the 10 on HFT at Unit 4 is our ITP, our integrated test plan. Thanks for joining us. Angie, how are you? Yes, sure. The 65 thing is it's kind of a policy. It's not a rule, I don't guess. The Board and I had lots of discussions about staying on beyond 65. One of my personal interest has been to help see Vogtle through. And I'm still young physically and young at heart, I guess, and when we kind of cross that threshold, we looked at people like, Wow, Mac, who is, I guess, you're what, a year younger than me. And if you've been around Chris at all, you would know that he still acts like a 25-year-old. So it was very easy to see him continue in the role, and he has fire in his belly and he's done a great job wherever he's been most notably at Georgia Power, successfully working with our constituents on the three-year triennial rate case that we do. So it was easy for us to kind of say, look, 65 is just a number, so long as we're able to contribute in a robust way, that's great. And that's how we did that. There really wasn't any connection with Mark Crossley, to be honest with you. He had -- I don't know, I want to go into all that, but he had some issues he wanted to deal with. It was reasonably clear that he wasn't a contender as a successor here, and I think he decided to retire. That was kind of his choice at the end of the day. Yes. I'll go ahead with. Chris was asked directly. He's committed to 70. No, Angie. It has nothing to do with that. It really is two things. So Dan is a conservative soul and he likes to build his plan without considering upside. So as we've done for years, the way before Dan got here, we don't put in place holders. We think about them and think about what effect they could have. Further, we don't add anything from Southern Power. And you should think about contributions from Southern Power as upside to the base case. It really isn't a constraint of capital structure or balance sheet. The site working plan has HFT in March. We know that things can happen between now and then, but that's what it shows. It's fuel load on Unit 4. Chris, do you want to say anything more? Hello, Paul, I always glad to have you with us. Still kind of running it down. It could be a calibration issue. It could just be the way we measure the flow going through. So we're trying to guess what it is at this point. It is really not practical. They're doing all the work necessary to get to the bottom of that. Thanks. Yes, I talked to Pete Sena, gosh, 11:30 today and he thought it was taken care of. We'll see. Zero. We're good. No. I think you're remembering fuel load there, we're in awfully good shape. And if you look at where we are on four as compared to three in relation to HFT, we are light years better. Mean we're ready to go. All we got to do is finish the required tests before we get the heat going and run the plant. That really is the critical path at this point. Anthony, how are you? Fantastic, my friend. Yes. Really appreciate you guys joining us. It's an exciting year 2023 is going to be an exciting year. John, we have our annual meeting where I turn over President and CEO, I guess I've already turned over President, but CEO to Chris. Wouldn't it be great Chris to have Unit 3 under our belt by then. You guys are going to love Womack funny story I tell everybody when I first got this job, I have always been friends of his but admired his wisdom, intelligence, his work ethic, his can-do attitude. And the very first thing I did when I got the job was move his office from down the hall right next to mine. And I can tell you that Chris has been a thought leader and a partner of mine throughout my tenure. He'll be ready to go day one to carry this company forward, and when you look at people like Kim Greene and Stan Connally and Jim Carr and all the -- and Jeff people and all the other people that are in these positions. I think it's an awfully strong team. It's the envy of our industry an embarrassment of riches in some respects. And I think Southern, especially post-Vogtle, is going to be a bit like a rocket ship, if I could say that. We're going to be doing great. So thank you all. It's been a pleasure knowing you all and working with you, and we'll see you soon. Thank you."

            "name": "Dan Tucker",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom mentioned, we had strong financial results for the year with adjusted earnings of $3.60 per share, $0.19 higher than 2021. The primary drivers for the year-over-year increase are higher revenues associated with retail pricing, warmer weather, primarily in the second quarter of 2022, customer growth, increased usage and investment on our regulated utilities. These revenue effects were partially offset by higher non-fuel O&M expenses and higher interest expenses. The increase in non-fuel O&M reflects long-term commitments to our regulated utilities to reliability and resiliency, along with efforts to advance maintenance activities in light of emerging cost pressures. Additional shares from the mandatory conversion of our equity units in August '22 are also reflected in 2022 EPS results. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and 2022 and back above pre-pandemic levels, we continue to see robust residential growth with the addition of nearly 50,000 residential electric customers and over 30,000 residential gas customers throughout the year. Residential customer usage also continued to outpace our expectations, reflecting sustained hybrid work practices across our service territories. Additionally, commercial sales for 2022 beat our forecast by nearly 2%, reflecting a reversion to pre-pandemic trends as the economy shifts from consuming goods to services. Industrial sales for 2022 were lower than forecast by 1.5%, driven by a chemical facility closure and weakening industrial sales momentum during the second half of the year. With interest rates rising, we have seen slowing in construction and housing-related sectors, such as lumber, stone, clay and glass and textiles. In the fourth quarter of 2022, eight of our top 10 industrial segments experienced slower sales growth as compared to the prior quarter. Included in our 2023 guidance is an assumption of retail electric sales growth of 0% to 1%. And as in prior quarters, we continue to monitor the potential implications of supply chain constraints, labor force participation and inflationary pressures on our outlook. The economic development pipeline in our service territories remains robust. 2022 economic development announcements in our Southeast service territories saw an increase in expected job creation and capital investment of 135% and 257%, respectively, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The pipeline of potential projects grew significantly compared to recent years with new corporate announcements and expansions representing a broad cross-section of industries, including automotive, technology, e-fulfillment and distribution, health care and bioscience. In addition to the traditional factors that have historically drawn businesses to our service territory like transportation networks, lower cost of living and business-friendly state and local policies. Another emerging trend that continues to drive momentum in both economic development wins and the size of the potential pipeline is the diversified workforce, especially technology workers and the diverse university systems in our territories, which prominently feature several HBCUs. We're proud to have been on the forefront of helping develop this workforce through our significant investment along with Apple in the Propel Center in Atlanta. More and more, as other companies strive to have their workforce reflect the diverse global customers they serve, our Southeast service territories have become a top choice for relocation or expansion. We are proud of the significant role that our subsidiaries play in attracting new businesses to our service territories. And in 2022, Site Selection Magazine named Alabama Power and Georgia Power, Top U.S. utilities for economic development for the fourth consecutive year and recognize the state of Georgia as the second best business climate in the country. Strong economic development activity continues to differentiate our Southeast service territories from other areas of the country. Turning now to our expectations for 2023. Our adjusted earnings guidance range for the year is $3.55 to $3.65 per share. Expected drivers for 2023 versus 2022, our continued growth in our state-regulated subsidiaries, including the contribution related to Vogtle Unit 3 going into service, offset by higher parent company interest expense including financing costs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 with costs in excess of $7.3 billion seemed reasonable by the Georgia PSC and share dilution, reflecting the full year impact of the mandatory conversion of our equity units in August 2022. We estimate adjusted earnings of $0.70 per share for the first quarter. Additionally, we are narrowing our 2024 adjusted guidance range of $4 to $4.30 which was established in early 2021. In order to acknowledge the uncertainty inherent in providing guidance three years in advance, the original 2024 range was wider than our typical annual EPS guidance ranges. Since this range was introduced in February 2021, our state-regulated outcomes have been largely consistent with our assumptions. Several upside opportunities inherent in the top end of our original range, like renewable and storage investment opportunities at both our state-regulated electric companies and Southern Power have been deferred to later years largely due to adverse market conditions, including more challenging, contracting requirements and global supply chain constraints. Financing costs, particularly parent company interest rates are a significant headwind relative to our forecast in early 2021. Rates on variable and short-term debt are significantly higher than expected, and as securities in our low-cost debt portfolio mature, new issuances, no matter the tenor, are significantly more expensive. Compounding these negative parent company interest rate effects are the growth in our state-regulated capital plans relative to early 2021 and the increased cost for Georgia Power share of Vogtle 3 and 4 which has grown by nearly $1.9 billion since early 2021. Collectively, these factors would narrow our $4 to $4.30 range, adjusted for 2024 to $4.10. Adding the potential for Vogtle 4 to be completed at the end of the first quarter of 2024 which would have a negative $0.05 per share impact solely in 2024, we are providing an adjusted 2024 earnings guidance range of $3.95 to $4.10 per share. We plan to further narrow this range during our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call early next year. We continue to see our long-term adjusted EPS growth rate in the 5% to 7% range, consistent with our updated 2024 adjusted EPS guidance range. This projected growth is supported by a $43 billion capital plan with 97% of total projected capital deployment over the next five years at our state-regulated utilities. Additionally, our history of constructive regulation, strong credit ratings and disciplined O&M spending served to strengthen our outlook. Our robust capital investment program continues to be driven by significant investment in our state-regulated utility businesses, our total base capital investment plan of approximately $43 billion which excludes the capital required to complete Vogtle Units 3 and 4 reflects a $2 billion increase in state-regulated utility investments relative to our previous five-year forecast. These increases in our forecast are the result of greater visibility into infrastructure required to serve major customer additions and expansions, further improve our grid and protect our technology infrastructure, as well as investments related to the transformation of our generation fleet. We have continued to maintain our disciplined approach to capital forecasting within our state regulated utility businesses. Consistent with past practice, we don't include placeholders, and we don't include capital that isn't expected to earn or allowed regulated returns. The result of this approach is that our capital expenditure forecasts tend to grow especially in the later years as our visibility into customer growth increases as regulatory processes unfold as compliance obligations evolved and as our long-term system planning is refined. We fully expect this trend to continue. Additionally, we continue to believe Southern Power has a significant opportunity to continue growing through investments that facilitate fleet transitions and the growth of clean energy infrastructure across the United States. Southern Power's business model has been distinctive since its beginnings in the early 2000s, focusing on long-term contracts with creditworthy counterparties and a risk-adjusted return profile that aligns well with our overall value proposition. We've allocated up to $3.5 billion over the five-year plan with approximately $500 million in 2023 and $750 million annually for the remainder of the forecast period. These allocations of capital are not included in our base capital forecast. Our financial plan is anchored to our base capital forecast of $43 billion. As I have already suggested, we believe upside potential exists in our state-regulated subsidiary forecast and our Southern Power allocation, which, if realized, would result in total spend of over $46 billion. We also continue to believe many of the same drivers for additional potential investment over the next five years could translate to investment opportunities beyond 2027, as we continue our journey to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions. We've included a three year financing plan in the appendix to today's slide deck. This plan, which is consistent with our updated capital investment plan and the potential capital investment opportunities that we have highlighted continues to assume no equity need over our five-year planning horizon. As always, we will maintain our discipline and the flexibility to use all the financing tools at our disposal to drive value for shareholders. Credit quality and strong investment-grade credit ratings remain a top priority and we continue to believe that to be a high-quality equity investment, a company must maintain a strong credit profile. As we complete Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, we believe the expected reduction in construction risk and the projected improvement in FFO to debt metrics further position us to support our credit quality objectives. Tom, I will now turn the call back over to you. Yes. James, this is Dan. So look, we were very intentional in choosing the words consistent with our adjusted guidance range. Those words were really acknowledging of two things. Thing one is just like we did with the $4 to $4.30, will further narrow this range as we get line of sight on Unit 4 and have our fourth quarter earnings call next year. Thing two, that it acknowledges is that the $0.05 impact for Vogtle 4 potentially going into the first quarter of 2024 is a one-year effect and so the growth rate will be off of that narrowed range when we get to 2024. Look, I think you covered it really well. The other thing I'd just reinforce, James, is that the 5% to 7% growth rate is based on our $43 billion capital plan opportunity to deploy more than that simply strengthens our position in that regard or potentially lengthens our position in that regard. And just going back to what Tom said about the longer term. Just recall, a lot of our coal retirement plans happen at the very end or the year after our five-year plan, and that really is where a lot of incremental opportunities also get unlocked. And then James, just connect that back to your previous question. Look, this growth is certainly exceeding our expectations in terms of the economic development activity, and that could very well translate to the need to invest more to serve that load that was not anticipated. So we think over the next three to five years, that will all begin to be very transparent to the market. David, this is Dan. So certainly, lower prices are going to benefit customers. And Georgia Power, in particular, who has the largest unrecovered balance ended the year at about $2.1 billion. They'll file at the end of February for those rates. So I certainly don't want to front-run that process. But if to the extent forecast continue to look the way they do today or further come down, the impact on customer bills will be greatly mitigated. The -- our other electric jurisdictions have already initially addressed the under recovery that was happening. And so these lower prices are simply going to accelerate that recovery. Yes, Durgesh, thanks for the question, and happy to share that. And as you know, all the agencies calculate those metrics at a slightly different way. But I think there's certainly a lot of focus on Moody's and S&P. So I'll hit on those, in particular. Moody's, we were about 12% for 2022 and S&P about 15%. And as you'd expect, those were pretty significantly impacted by the under-recovered fuel dynamics, particularly the Moody's metric in the way that they calculate that. A portion of it is the debt and a portion of it for us is also the impact that under recovering that fuel had on our tax appetite and our ability to monetize tax benefits, you combine those factors overall, really about a 400 basis point impact to the Moody's metric in 2022. As we look ahead, and we've talked about this a lot in the past, Vogtle certainly on its own, has a significant impact on improving the overall financial profile of the Company as we begin to recover our investment on that in the future. As we get out to 2024, once it's in service, our metrics are closer to 17%, 18%, which are well above our targets and provide us that kind of buffer against adversity that we prefer to have in our profile. That's right. And as I give you that 17% to 18% projection in the future, that includes an assumption that we might still have an unrecovered balance that we continue to collect, but that it's certainly been worked down and Vogtle has kind of overlaid that to improve the overall profile. So, it's about $0.04 or so that it contributes in 2023 relative to 2022. So that's essentially the assumption of a little more than half the year in service and then there's -- that's offset slightly by the fact that there's some of the rate base that won't actually earn its full return until Unit 4 is also in service. Based on our current projections, we would still not project any equity. And that's where when I talked about having that cushion in our credit metrics, that plays a big part of that. Yes. Look, Anthony, I never want to speak for the agencies. I would look like us that aren't currently building nuclear units, many of them have lower thresholds. So I think there's certainly a strong argument for that to potentially take place. I won't speak for, but they should."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Southern Company's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please, go ahead, sir.\nScott Gammill: Thank you, Scott. Good afternoon, and welcome to Southern Company's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Dan Tucker, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you, we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Qs and subsequent filings. In addition, we'll provide non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.\nTom Fanning: Thank you, Scott. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Our third quarter financial results continue to support our full year earnings objectives. And the economies within our service territories remain strong, including customer growth and economic activity that has outpaced our expectations. Given our financial performance through the third quarter, we expect full year adjusted earnings per share near the top of our earnings guidance range. Before turning the call over to Dan for a more detailed look at our financial performance, I'd first like to provide an update on the recent progress at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Importantly, the projected completion timeline and capital cost forecast for both units remain consistent with what we outlined last quarter. Since our last call, the site team has continued to make substantial progress on Unit 3, highlighted by the successful achievement of several major milestones, including submitting the all ITAAC complete letter, receiving the 103(g) finding from the NRC, which signifies that license acceptance criteria for Unit 3 have been met, and successfully completing the safe transfer of all 157 fuel assemblies from Unit 3 spent fuel pool to the reactor core early last week. Fuel load marked another historic and pivotal milestone towards startup and commercial operations. The focus over the next couple of months turns to final preparations and testing of systems primarily associated with the electric power production side of the plant and achieving the pristine conditions in the nuclear island necessary for start-up activities. The next major milestone for Unit 3 is initial criticality or the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction, which is projected in January. Once this important milestone is achieved, plant operators can begin the prescribed testing sequence, which includes a series of power ascensions and reductions, various sustained power output plateaus and multiple forced trips to test the unit's safety systems. This rigorous process is intended to demonstrate the performance of the unit under a variety of conditions and its readiness to be included in reliable dispatch and to be placed in service for the benefit of customers. We continue to project Unit 3 will be placed in service by the end of the first quarter of 2023. Turning to Unit 4. Open vessel testing was completed in August and direct construction is now approximately 97% complete. Electrical production, in particular, electrical terminations remains a key area of focus. To support our projected December 2023 in-service date, recent electrical production levels must be sustained for several more weeks. Testing is expected to become the critical path as the project team progresses towards future milestones of cold hydro testing and the start of hot functional testing, which is projected by the end of the first quarter 2023. Dan, I'll now turn the call over to you.\nDan Tucker: Thanks, Tom and good afternoon everyone. As Tom mentioned, we had a strong quarter with adjusted earnings of $1.31 per share, $0.08 higher than the third quarter of 2021. The primary drivers for the year-over-year increase are higher revenues associated with increased usage and retail pricing at our regulated utilities. These revenue effects were partially offset by higher nonfuel O&M expenses consistent with the rising cost environment and our long-term commitments to reliability and resiliency, along with higher interest and share dilution from the mandatory conversion of our equity units. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results as compared to 2021 is included in today's release and earnings package. Turning now to retail electricity sales in the economy. In the third quarter 2022 weather-normal retail sales were 1.8% higher than in the third quarter of 2021. This increase reflects stronger sales across all three customer classes, as we've continued to see expansion across our Southeast electric service territories. We also continue to see robust customer growth with the addition of 11,000 residential electric customers and 8,000 residential gas customers during the quarter. We are encouraged by these trends and continue to monitor the potential impacts of supply chain constraints, labor force participation and inflation pressures on our outlook. The economic development pipeline in our service territories remains robust. Within our electric service territories, economic development announcements through the first nine months of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, reflect a 170% increase in job additions and a 237% increase in business investment. Next, I'd like to provide you with an update on our outlook for the remainder of 2022. With adjusted earnings per share through September of $3.35, we expect to achieve adjusted full year earnings near the top end of our guidance range of $3.50 to $3.60 per share. Our adjusted earnings estimate for the fourth quarter is $0.23 per share. Tom, I'll turn the call back over to you.\nTom Fanning: Thanks Dan. We remain encouraged by the sustained level of economic development activity within our service territories as we continue a long legacy of partnering with each of our states to attract new business. In recognition of these efforts, Alabama Power and Georgia Power were once again named to Site Selection Magazine's top 20 utilities in economic development out of approximately 3,330 utilities across the United States based on capital investment and job creation activity. We are honored by this recognition and look forward to continuing our commitment to helping our states and communities attract and grow businesses to further strengthen the economies within our service territories for years to come. In closing, I would like to take a moment to highlight a significant safety milestone at the Vogtle project achieved this month, when the site successfully completed its 68 millionth job hour lost -- I mean, without a lost time incident, but 68 millionth job hour without a lost time incident. At Southern Company, safety represents a key tenet of our uncompromising values and this milestone is a testament to the project team's focus on creating a safety-first culture. I'd like to recognize Sean McGarvey from the North American Building Trades and Lonnie Stephenson from the IBEW, along with all of the thousands of individuals that they represent for their tremendous ongoing support at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. These groups have been terrific business partners for us, and the recent achievement of several major milestones is a tribute to the dedication of thousands of men and women committed to bringing Vogtle Units 3 and 4 safely online to provide Georgia with a reliable, carbon-free resource for the next 60 to 80 years. Thank you all for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have a question from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nShar Pourreza: Hey, guys.\nTom Fanning: Hey, Shar.\nShar Pourreza: Tom, I think you just got the fastest reward for the quickest prepared remarks. So that was good.\nTom Fanning: Just got made by Vice President, give him all the credit.\nShar Pourreza: There you go. Just quickly on the Georgia GRC, I guess, how are discussions going with intervenors? I mean, so the staff recommending both the 9.45% ROE as well as a reduction in the equity layer when Vogtle is fully in service seems somewhat counter to what we're seeing with capital market conditions and kind of the risks that are out there. I guess, what are your thoughts around a settlement and narrowing that bid ask, or do you think this case will likely go to litigated route?\nTom Fanning: Well, you do know that this is an accounting order, is what it's been since 1995, which means it's not technically kind of a litigated kind of thing. You know that this process has been in place since 1995 and that it really is, I think, a process that has been proven, tried and true, to let every party have their say and have a constructive outcome. And I think we've proven that time and time again. Us commenting on any particular part of anybody's testimony at this point really isn't constructive. Let the process run and I'm sure we'll be treated in a constructive way at the end of it.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. Perfect. Thanks. And then just on Vogtle, where do things now stand with the other co-owners in terms of resolving any sort of outstanding cost cap or contribution concerns? And I guess, what that ultimately means for your ownership of the projects and so on?\nTom Fanning: I'll turn this over to Dan here in just some more details. But effectively, among and between Oglethorpe and Dalton and MEAG, we have reached an agreement, a settlement with MEAG. My sense is, Dan, you're not going to know anything else about the rest of these likely until the end of next year.\nDan Tucker: Yes, that's right. And so the settlement with MEAG, you might see in the materials a slight cost revision for Georgia Power's ownership. And that's really reflective of that settlement. Our assumptions previously assumed, as many of you know, this notion of a tender or a put of ownership from any of the co-owners. And since that was not part of the resolution, we reached the kind of our estimate of the impact of the settlement is less than our previous estimate.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. Thanks for that. And then just lastly, I know you guys have previously talked about Georgia Power just not really being super competitive against third-party developers in terms of winning the solar RFPs. Sort of with the tax credit changes with transferability, solar PTCs, et cetera, that came with the IRA, could Georgia Power now potentially be able to compete and win a portion of the solar RFPs we're looking at that Georgia is going to be running? And then how do we sort of think about that versus what you assume in the current guide? Thanks.\nTom Fanning: Credit to your question, is exactly right. Any differences we had were related to tax treatment flow through versus some sort of normalized treatment on the part of Georgia Power. It's interesting. I think during one of the early rounds in other years, we had developers take positions and then Southern Power actually came in and took them out of those positions. So, we could compete another way. My sense is the IRA is really going to be helpful to all regulated utilities that otherwise use normalized accounting. And it does put us much closer on an equal footing to those folks. The other thing that we always have to take into account, particularly with renewables that have distributed sites across our service territory is that Southern is reasonably well known for thinking about our expansion plan on a portfolio basis. Of course, each company reaches its own conclusion within that portfolio. But those kinds of considerations have to be met, especially when you consider wrapping into that, the closure of certain coal plants over time. So, we'll see how it goes. But I think overall, the IRA is really helpful. Dan, do you want to add?\nDan Tucker: Yes. Shar it's important to think about this in terms of the planning horizon, right? So this is a longer-term dynamic. So, you're not going to see very much on the front end of the five-year plan. Those decisions have already been made. Those RFPs have already been executed for resources. So, you're really talking about the back half or even the last couple of years of our five-year forecast where this opportunity may manifest itself as potentially rate base assets. The other thing that is a new dynamic that's entering into the equation, certainly, affordability of kind of a low-cost profile is what this -- these tax benefits change. Other considerations will begin to factor in to some of these resources, location, how much the controllability of them and so, it's kind of the difference between the notion of lease cost versus best costs, where there's locational dynamics and other things at play.\nTom Fanning: And every bit of the IRA to us, just serves to reduce the transition cost of our current position to a Net Zero future, all for the benefit of our customers. We don't make money off tax benefits. We typically flow them through for the benefit of customers.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. Terrific, guys. Thanks so much and see you in a couple of weeks. Appreciate it.\nTom Fanning: You bet. Look forward to it.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ross Fowler with UBS. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nTom Fanning: Hey, Rob. How are you? \nRoss Fowler: Good. How are you? So just a couple of questions. One, election day is two weeks away, but we're not going to have a Georgia Commission election on that day. So can you just remind us what the process is from here around redistricting and how that actually works, whether it's a statewide or district election and how that would sort of proceed?\nTom Fanning: Not figured it out yet. This is work ahead for the legislature to undertake, most likely through next year. Our sense is, this is not going to be something that's going to reach a conclusion anytime quickly. There's going to be a lot of debate and a lot of thoughtful consideration about how to put this into play. So really can't guess on it right now, and I really don't have an estimate on any time frame. Except my sense is, it's going to take some time. I don't think we're going to get a result anytime soon.\nDan Tucker: And some of that time, maybe, because it becomes a bit of an iterative process between the legislature and the court.\nRoss Fowler: All right. Thanks, Dan. And then -- so the current commission would sit until that process was complete. Is that a correct a understanding?\nTom Fanning: That's right.\nRoss Fowler: Okay. And then just maybe remind us as we're -- and congratulations on the fuel load, that's a big step. As we get to putting Unit 3, Unit 4 into service, how does the ROE penalties roll off over time and sort of, if Unit 4 is done on December 2023, then they're all -- there are no more penalties in 2024, if I'm thinking about it correct?\nDan Tucker: Sure, Ross. So, again, as a reminder, all of our outlook assumes a total cost for Vogtle that goes into rates of $7.3 billion. And so the way that will break down in terms of rolling into base rates and thus, earnings or to power full allowed ROE, there's $2.1 billion that will go into rate base, the month after Unit 3 goes into service. And then the remainder, following prudence proceeding next year, would go into rates the month after Unit 4 goes into service. And so based on the current schedule, you'd be at Georgia Power's full allowed ROE on $7.3 billion for the full year 2024.\nRoss Fowler: And Dan, the penalties now pretty much put you into cost of debt, right, with the timing of how it's worked, right?\nDan Tucker: The passage of time and increase in the cost of debt, we're essentially there.\nRoss Fowler: Okay. And then, the prudency process you mentioned, that starts on fuel loaded Unit 4?\nDan Tucker: Correct. Fuel load.\nTom Fanning: Summer of 2020.\nRoss Fowler: Of 2023 in the current schedule. All right. Thanks, Tom. Thanks, Dan.\nTom Fanning: Always good having you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nTom Fanning: Hey Jeremy, how are you?\nJeremy Tonet: Good. Good afternoon. Thanks for having me. You touched a bit on it before, but as it relates to IRA, just wondering, are there any other aspects to the bill that impact Southern that you could share with us at this point that you've determined. Clearly, benefits for the customer is very important here for other types of tax cuts beyond renewables. Would that impact Southern or minimum tax? Just wondering if you could share thoughts on the bill more broadly and its impact on Southern.\nTom Fanning: The minimum tax thing really ended up not making much of a difference, particularly with the latest change they made. That doesn't impact us, hardly at all. This sounds like a policy response, but look, longer term, helping with 45Q and research and development and hydrogen, those are all good things that help us get from say we've already hit our 50% reduction goal. We put it in place in 2030. We hit it a decade early in 2020. Getting from 50% to 80%, we think we know how to do that, too. Getting from 80% to 100% is where these things that relate to innovation and research and development will be helpful. Obviously, those expenditures will happen before they're put into place. In particular, some of the things that we're interested in are this trade you make in the 30s and 40s between nuclear and combined cycle with carbon capture and sequestration. And certainly, in respect of the cost of adding more renewables is something we're focused on. All of those provisions as they're addressed in the build are helpful.\nDan Tucker: Yes. And Jeremy, I'd say the other things that we're kind of exploring and trying to better understand and certainly waiting for IRS guidance is the normalization opt out for storage. That's something we're certainly evaluating how that impacts customer rates the transferability of these tax credits is particularly interesting, especially within Southern Power, where historically, we might have used tax equity. This creates a new, perhaps better dynamic in that regard. There's been a lot of discussion about the nuclear PTC. But we -- right now, as we sit here, based on our interpretation, I don't see that having any meaningful impact for us. But again, we'll wait for guidance on that and see how that turns out.\nTom Fanning: Yes. And in general, what we really like about the idea of this bill is the structure that the credits are effectively technology neutral. And therefore, let the market work to show what is best in place for our customers over time.\nDan Tucker: And the certainty that these are there for the next 10 years provides a lot of flexibility and planning and the way we think about our business.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's all very helpful. I just want to pick up with the part that you talked about nuclear there and saw during the quarter, there was a key milestone with Southern Company and Terra Power as it relates to their molten chloride pass reactor. And I was just wondering if you could provide us your thoughts as far as when you think that type of technology could come into play for utility scale proven up? What type of timeframe there and having the ability to ramp up and down quickly there, I guess, the benefits that could provide as part of the generation of fact?\nTom Fanning: Yes. Yes. I would argue that the new nuclear future of America will likely start with SMRs. We hear a lot about people discussing putting small modular reactors into effect. I mean, that could happen last half of this decade certainly. The larger Gen 4 reactors that you're referencing to me are kind of mid-30s and beyond.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. I’ll leave it there. Thanks.\nTom Fanning: Thank you.\nOperator: We have a question from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDavid Arcaro: Hey, thanks so much for the time. I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color around just the updates on Unit 4. The time frame didn't shift. Just wondering for additional color around how productivity has been relative to recent targets based on just eyeballing the green line and the red line. It looks like maybe even a little bit ahead over the last two months. And has there been increasing clarity with the progress that you've made on Unit 3 also as you look to Unit 4?\nTom Fanning: Well, Dan, you and I should tag team this one as well. I'll start. We're gratified with the progress on electrical terminations. We've always called that one out as a risk factor. And so long as we sustain our recent performance on the site, through, say, November, then we're on track on that issue. So we're watching it very closely. We're gratified with the progress we've made. We just need to continue that progress. Obviously, as you've seen with Unit 3, our performance on these tests are particularly important. We believe that we've learned a lot from the test on Unit 3. And where we had some delays due to equipment issues or system issues, we think we've learned a lot, and we don't expect to repeat some of the issues that we saw in Unit 3 on Unit 4. So our schedule reflects that as well. Dan?\nDan Tucker: Look, I think you hit the big issues. The testing will become critical path here for Unit 4 in the near term. And it is certainly predicated on those lessons learned and being a smooth process. And right now, the focus is getting the right people focused on Unit 4 in that regard where they've been tied up on Unit 3 completing that work.\nTom Fanning: And all these discussions that Dan and I are referencing occur in a completely open and transparent environment. We have our co-owners with us. We have representives from DOE, NRC, the public commission staff, et cetera. I mean, everybody gets to hear all this information the same way. And I just think we're gratified with the progress we've made, and we see our way through to remaining comfortable with the time frames we're laying out.\nDavid Arcaro: Okay. Great. Thanks for that. And then a separate topic. I was just wondering if you could touch on how you're managing interest rate headwinds right now with debt issuances coming next year, any ways to hedge against that proactively or other ways that you're looking to manage potential EPS headwinds there?\nTom Fanning: Well, I will say this, old dog doesn't learn new tricks. Maybe that's not the right line here. But I'm an old finance guy, and I really like this stuff. I like liability management. And I can remember back when Drew Evans was CFO and we were in the low interest rate environment. We were very intentional about reducing, what I call, our level of risk capital. That's short-term debt, debt within one year, putable debt, all that sort of thing. So we shortened our risk capital. We lengthened the duration of our assets. And I would argue if we do this plot, I think it's in your package, but Southern Company debt portfolio when you look at kind of total enterprise value of a corporation is a really valuable asset. It's 18 years long on the average and has a really cheap coupon rate, 3.5% or whatever. These guys have done a really nice job managing it. Dan?\nDan Tucker: Yes. So to Tom's point, we're starting from a great place in that regard. We've done things this year to take risk off the table, accelerating or upsizing some of our issuances, taking some of the variability out of the portfolio here in the short-term. We'll continue to do those things. And then look, already in 2022, interest rates certainly are having an impact on our results, and we've been able to offset that. We've got levers within the business to do that, and we'll continue to focus on those as we move forward. Like with anyone, I mean, we were fairly conservative about our assumptions over the long term. And like everyone, I'm sure our assumptions in the short-term were pretty far off, but we're managing through that.\nTom Fanning: It's just another issue that we deal with.\nDavid Arcaro: Yeah. Great. No, that’s helpful. Thanks so much.\nDan Tucker: You bet.\nTom Fanning: Thank you. \nOperator: We have a question from Nick Campanella with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nDan Tucker: Hey, Nick. Hope you are doing great?\nNick Campanella: I am. Thank you and hope everyone else doing good as well. Thanks for taking the question. I guess just to follow-up on the interest rate kind of commentary and I'm really just kind of thinking about through next year and the drivers of 2023. Not to get ahead of it, but could you just give us any kind of comments on how you're thinking about the growth rate into 2023? I know you've had this 4.15% marker out there for 2024. I think on previous calls, you kind of talked about bridging the gap to that 4.15, but you have the ROE penalty, maybe some potential higher financing costs. Your sales commentary seems pretty strong, and you also have new rates at Georgia Power. So just any other considerations to be thinking of?\nTom Fanning: Yes. And not to pick at your question, but all we've ever said about 2024 is $4 to $4.30. I think you were just picking the midpoint. Our range has always been $4 to $4. 30. We put that in place some years ago. Dan?\nDan Tucker: Yes. And Nick, we're not going to change course here. We always provide our annual guidance on our fourth quarter call. So we'll do that again here in February and put our 2023 number out there for the first time. And what we are also likely to do in February is we will narrow that $4 to $4.30 based on what we see at the time. One of the important factors and uncertainties that existed three years ago when we put that in place, was knowing we'd have another Georgia Power rate case, and then, of course, everything else that has transpired in those three years. So once we get past that, we'll be positioned to narrow that down.\nNick Campanella: That's helpful. And yes, I was just picking the midpoint, but understood for the $4.30. I guess just on the sales growth, your kind of commentary on the economy and your current footprint was notable and just we've seen some of your peers starting to revise longer-term sales load higher. Just how are you kind of thinking about that as we prepare for more of a longer-term update in the fourth quarter call?\nTom Fanning: Yes. I don't know whether you saw my saying on CNBC this morning on Squad Box. But it is a consistent refrain, and we're actually surprised that a we bit. Our growth so far has been much higher than what we thought. And it's pretty comprehensive. A summary, though, is kind of notable. I was looking through all of our material, we are essentially back to pre-COVID levels on commercial and industrial sales. Our residential sales number is a little over 5% improved. I think that's probably a reflection of a number of things, but including kind of workforce America's reaction to this new hybrid work environment we're finding. The other thing Dan mentioned is the economic development data, which continues to be strong. We don't see much of a reduction a slowing in those numbers. I have a background with the Fed. And so I always get into the nerdy economic details. But one of the things that our head economist here, kind of Shiver does is look at particular industrial segment. So we take our top 10 industrial segments, which represent, I think, about 80% of our sales for the industrial segment. And we do look at not only kind of period-over-period results, which still show really positive growth, everything looking pretty good. We go to the trouble of going to the first derivative, and I would call that a momentum statistic. That would show that even though we still show really good growth, that the amount of growth is moderating. And we just need to kind of think about that as we look going forward. I know a lot of my peers around the country and the economists and the Fed and all the pundits are talking about potentially a mild recession sometime first, second, third quarters of 2023. We see no data for the Southeast that indicates that would be here. So when you hear recession data, just know that, generally speaking, it is national broad brush kind of statistic. The Southeast region is – appears to be, by the data we have, much more resilient and much less prone to such a downturn.\nNick Campanella: Helpful commentary, really appreciate it. We will see you soon.\nTom Fanning: You bet.\nOperator: We have a question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTom Fanning: Julien, great to….\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, thanks for taking the time. I appreciate it. Good to see you off late Buzzer chat [ph]. Hey, listen, Tom, I wanted to ask you a question specifically. I mean, we saw some headlines in the quarter here about perhaps your eventual retirement here. Can you talk a little bit about succession planning? And just where we stand in that process? And Tom, specifically, how long are you thinking about staying vis-à-vis the in-service of the units here, just to prep the street around your thought process?\nTom Fanning: Yeah. There's been a lot of written about that. I'm feeling like for mathusalem for heaven's sakes. Look, I am 65.5. So that's a fact. Somebody saw it fit to read an article about that. The fact is Southern Company's Board has made no assessment of that one way or the other. There is no timetable for me leaving. I certainly have an interest in progressing the Vogtle units. That's for sure. You should know also one of my comments to that reporter, I think, got misconstrued or I don't know. He asked me, are you looking for a successor. And I said, look, it's every CEO's job, first day they get there to have a succession plan in place. That got turned into, I'm actively looking for a successor. Here's the truth of it. And you all know this, I think, when you look at our brothers and sisters around the United States, Southern Company has been a terrific place to grow talent. We have several subsidiaries where we can give people experiential opportunities beyond just growing within a silo of functions within their experience at the company. And it is our intention to do that. Somebody is successful in a certain area, we put them into a place where maybe they don't know as much, maybe they're not as comfortable and they've got to build new constituents in order to succeed.  We have a very rigorous process. We have had a rigorous process for 20, 25 years of growing talent and moving them around. The latest example, Robin Boren, who has been Treasurer at Southern Company is now, I guess, effective November 1, going to become CEO of Southern Power. This is just another example of how we move people around that show us that they have the capability to grow into senior, senior positions inside the company. So we'll continue with that. The great news is that there's good talent all over this industry. There's exceptional talent inside Southern. And I'm very, very happy with the bench, the Southern Company management council and beyond.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Thank you for providing that -- clearing the air as you say, on some of the articles out there. If I can just follow up on Nick's last question a little bit. You all have a track record, especially through COVID of finding offsets and reductions and just dealing with difficult context. To the extent in which that we're dealing with inflation today, whether that manifests itself in the form of liability management and interest expense or just generally elevated labor costs at Vogtle and elsewhere, how are you thinking about providing a comprehensive update on that front as well? I know that you talked about narrowing 2024 here. But can you talk a little bit more specifically about your efforts to manage inflation and offsets on that front as well?\nDan Tucker: As with just about anything, Julien, it's all of the above approach, right? So -- and it always has been for us. So we have managed both in the short term and more importantly, in the long term, around all of these kind of issues, and we'll continue to do that. So to a degree that will be changing the way we operate, becoming more efficient. It will be looking for ways to deploy capital that thus reduces O&M. It will be looking for ways to grow the business more to help offset what might otherwise be headwinds elsewhere. And then importantly, along the way, while we're focused on all of that, we'll also, as we always are, be focused on clean, safe, reliable and importantly, affordable energy as we navigate this with our regulators and strike the right balance there.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. All right. Fair enough. It will be embedded in whatever you guys update on 2024 at the end of the day, I take it.\nDan Tucker: Yes, sir.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Good luck and I will speak to you then.\nTom Fanning: Thank you my friend.\nOperator: We have a question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nMichael Lapides: Hi. Thank you, guys. Hi, Tom, thank you and Dan for taking my questions. First one, a number of your peers have built up pretty sizable deferred fuel balances that may take a couple of years to recover, just given the spike in power and gas prices. Just curious whether you're seeing the same thing across your larger subsidiaries. And in your conversations with stakeholders, how you're thinking about the time line to recover those different fuel balances?\nDan Tucker: Yeah, Michael, this is Dan. So we are certainly having discussions with our regulators. We've been very transparent and proactive about making sure that they understand and appreciate this macro dynamic that has occurred, particularly with natural gas costs and to an extent, coal prices as well. And so yeah, we, like you mentioned, Michael, like many peers, have accumulated a pretty sizable under recovered balance as of the end of the third quarter in total, it's about $2.2 billion. The vast majority of that is at Georgia Power, which is about $1.7 billion. So with each of our jurisdictions, the process is a little different. Some are a little more regular in their cadence. Some are a little more discretionary. I think the plan for that largest balance in Georgia will be addressed that early next year. And again, we'll work very closely with the regulators to make sure that's done in a way that is the least impactful for customers as possible.\nTom Fanning: And Michael, I could just add as a comment on dogma. As apart from the so-called organized markets, the integrated regulated markets provide us a mechanism to pass-through fuel costs. So there is no profit incentive for us. In other words, it's always incentive for us to keep prices as low as possible. And so we have done that. We've had programs in place that have helped us keep those costs low. This year, we've hedged 34% of our fuel prices, gas prices at about $3 and 22%, next year, 32% at $4.73. Certainly, those are below the spot prices for natural gas right now. Nobody can predict the future. But certainly, those programs, which have been put in place with the conjunction of the public service commissions have been awfully helpful to reduce the pressure on that issue.\nDan Tucker: And one last thing. So just in addition to that continuous proactive dialogue with regulators, we've been having similar conversations with the rating agencies, making sure that they're keenly aware of us likely having to carry a little incremental debt to see this through. But all of our subsidiaries, George Power, in particular, Alabama Power, Mississippi Power, have the financial strength to be able to weather that.\nTom Fanning: One last comment I just wanted to do it. But on a going-forward basis, once Vogtle 3 and 4 go in service, the equivalent energy price coming out of that plant is going to be effectively about $1 per million BTU. It's going to be an awfully attractive asset that will run 24/7, 365.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. And then a follow-up question, a little bit unrelated. I mean, Vogele CapEx should step down materially next year, and then done in 2024, except for maintenance. And there's -- Dan, you made the comment of if there's new generation additions coming in the capital plan, it's in the back end of the plan. How are you thinking about the potential for incremental capital allocation, not necessarily in 2023, because you're still spending on Vogtle, but in 2024, 2025 timeframe?\nDan Tucker: Yeah. Look, it's not unchanged from where we were early this year. I mean, our capital plan is designed to support our growth rate of 5% to 7%. I think we highlighted in the fourth quarter call the history of our planning process and how opportunities emerge further out in the forecast you get as we roll the forecast forward. The numbers continue to increase as we get clarity on things, as we bet things with regulators, as new regulations emerge, as new technologies emerge. And I think that will continue to happen. And then, we've got an allocation that we set aside for Southern Power, that's been a little quiet here in recent days, because of the uncertainty that existed before IRA passed, I think you'll see that continue to ramp up. We've got a plan today, Michael, that doesn't require us to issue any equity to finance it. And to the extent we find more opportunities that are able to earn either our regulated returns, or the returns that we require out of the projects in Southern Power, we'll adjust our financing plan, but I'm happy to turn our equity plans on to finance more regulated growth.\nMichael Lapides: Yeah. And Dan, please correct me, if I misstate this. But I think you guys have done, you and your team, have done a great job illustrating to the investment community how we develop a CapEx estimate. And I'm being more direct than you were. The outer years are always underestimated. When you go through time, we end up spending more money than we estimate in the outer years. And if I had to estimate that in the current five-year plan, aren't we estimating something like $41 billion over five years. And if we kind of adjust it for what may happen, a more reasonable number maybe as much as $45 billion.\nDan Tucker: Yeah, I don't think that's unfair. And importantly, the $41 billion, the starting point is what supports our 5% to 7% growth rate. And so as more opportunities to invest are identified, it simply increases the durability of that growth rate either in the short term or over the long-term.\nTom Fanning: And you should know, all of you on the phone should know that some companies put a bunch of plug estimates in there. We don't. We do sensitivities to indicate what may happen with higher CapEx, assuming we get appropriate recovery, which we think we would, but that's the way we are. We have a conservative plan.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciate it.\nTom Fanning: Thank you.\nOperator: We have a question from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTom Fanning: Hey Durgesh. Great to have you with us.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey Tom. Thanks for giving me the time. Just one -- I have one housekeeping question and then just a follow-up. In terms of the -- and forgive me if I missed this, and I think you discussed this as part of the last Q&A, but the 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth target, is that -- is that still sort of where you are projecting long-term earnings growth?\nTom Fanning: Yeah, we establish that once a year. And we'll come back to you with a new five-year plan. I guess it's in February, but yeah, that's us.\nDurgesh Chopra: Okay. Got it. Thanks. And then maybe just can you comment on -- there was some discussion of it, just bill increases, what should we expect here in the near-term, excuse me, given the fuel price increases, what are what are we looking at over the next few months in terms of customer bill increases? And how could you potentially offset some of that?\nTom Fanning: Yeah. Hey Durgesh, we have a policy. You followed us for some time never front-running a regulatory process. We're not going to start now. So that's going to be a question, I let alone for now. When we see results, then we'll be able to speak to this specifically.\nDurgesh Chopra: Understood. Thank you, again.\nTom Fanning: You bet. Thank you.\nOperator: We have a question from Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTom Fanning: Angie, how are you?\nAngie Storozynski: Great. Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. So just a couple of questions about the Vogtle 4. So is there an agreement between the co-owners as to the in-service date and how the companies are showing it, I almost feel like -- I think I'm referring here to Oglethorpe. It seems like they're showing first quarter 24 as a COD for Vogtle 4 and I'm just wondering if this is basically what the whisper date is or is that it's up to them to actually make a call on the start of commercial operations?\nTom Fanning: Angie, it's a wonderful question. Look, our performance to date indicates that we are in the reasonable expectation of achieving a year-end '23 in-service date. You'll have to ask Ogtlethorpe why they may depart from that.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. And then secondly, just tracking the ITAAC for that unit. And I remember that they were very lumpy with Unit 3. So it's again, I mean, it seems like you need very many of them to start fuel load. So again, is there any pattern in those ITAAC that we should be worried about, or again, they're just as lumpy as they were with Unit 3?\nDan Tucker: Yes, there's about 240 or a little above that remaining on Unit 4, Angie. And yes, there's not a normal cadence, if you will and there's also a lot of things that are tied to particular milestone tests. So hot functional testing as an example. There will be a lot that either come as a result of that or after that and that's where we really started focusing on them for Unit 3 and kind of laying out the remaining schedule. But I would not expect any sort of linear progression there, it will be lumpy.\nTom Fanning: Well, in fact, your memory is absolutely spot on. It is lumpy and the reason it's lumpy is when we finish systems, then we are able to submit the ITAAC. And recall a problem we had, I guess it was earlier this year, right around the end of the year into January, finishing up all of the paper. We think we put in place controls, processes, which will speak to that. We should not repeat that problem. So as we finish system completions associated with the big milestone, so ultimately, hot functional test you'll see a big ramp up, a lumpy look in ramp-up of submittal of ITAAC.\nAngie Storozynski: Great. And just one follow-up, and I appreciate that you have limited visibility as to the way the elections are going to be run for the GRC – for the commission. Now when I think about the prudence review and the elections that may happen between now and then, how many of the commissioners will have been replaced? Again, I know that it depends when the elections actually happen, but just theoretically?\nTom Fanning: I couldn't even hazard a guess at that. It really depends on when they come up -- when the legislature comes up with this new process. I have no idea when that will be or what the outcome will be and therefore, it's hard to answer your question. I'm sorry.\nDan Tucker: But based on the current terms, Angie, there were only 2 appropriations this year, and there were none scheduled for next year. And so just Again, if this gets resolved quickly, it will be the election, there's another commissioner of reelection in 2024.\nAngie Storozynski: Very good. Okay. That’s all I need. Thank you.\nTom Fanning: Election, yeah.\nOperator: Our next question is from Paul Fremont with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTom Fanning: Hello, Paul.\nPaul Fremont: Hey. How is it going? Congratulations on good quarter.\nTom Fanning: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nPaul Fremont: Can you update us on the construction work that's left on Unit 3? I think you had indicated that you were doing construction after you got the 103G letter up until fuel load. Is all of that construction completed or how many hours of construction are remaining there?\nTom Fanning: Tiny amount. And I wouldn't almost refer to it as construction at this point. It's really finishing the finest tuning, if you can imagine, in order to go critical. For example, we've loaded the fuel. We have to put the top on the reactor vessel and ratchet down the enormous bolt structures that will tighten that top down. We have to finish what they call coating. So this would be areas like walls that just need to be painted, that weren't required on a safety-related basis. It is finally -- so in the reactor vessel in order for us to load fuel, it had to be pristine, cleanliness and actually putting the top on the reactor vessel preserves that condition. We want to finish all of the minute cleaning procedures that will be necessary for us to run that plant. It's stuff like that.\nPaul Fremont: And is this -- I mean, is it days, weeks, months?\nTom Fanning: Well, what I would say, Paul is the next milestone we're guiding you to is,\nPaul Fremont: Criticality?\nTom Fanning: It's criticality and that's January.\nPaul Fremont: So you would finish then the construction between now and then or whatever additional work there is between now and January?\nTom Fanning: Yes, right. I'm not sure, I would call that construction, but yes. That's right.\nPaul Fremont: And then, can you discuss the secondary steam systems in the plant? Do we need to wait until after criticality when you go through that testing phase to make sure that, that system is working the way that you wanted to work or can you address that earlier?\nTom Fanning: So here's the thing. There is a prescribed process and it's a great graph, but nobody let me put it out there. But it's a really interesting looking graph that shows a prescribed process of taking the plant up in power and then taking it down. For example, within, I think, the first week or so, 10 days, we'll get to 25% power, then they take it down. And then we'll go to 50% and take it down. Then we'll go to 75% and take it down, then 90% and then 100%. They do all sorts of trips and bells and whistles along the way. And what they're trying to do is what may be a condition that could exist once the plant goes in service, to make sure that everything works as it is supposed to. If you want more details on that, we filed the VCM here recently. And there's a good bit of background in that VCM report that we filed that can give you more here if you want to see it.\nPaul Fremont: Great. And then, last question for me. I'll take a shot at what somebody asked is an earlier question, but do you -- would you expect to settle the general rate case, or do you think the parties are too far apart?\nTom Fanning: No, it's not -- whether we settle or not has no bearing on too far apart or, at least, hasn't in the years past. Paul, I mean, you've followed us forever, it seems like. And we have had this process in place since 1995. And every three years, we go through this. And typically, we reach an agreement just before the holidays. I would expect that to occur again. There's a lot of value. It's almost therapeutic, if you will, to let everybody's views come out in the open and have a good fair debate. We've been treated fairly every other time, my sense is, we'll be treated fairly again.\nPaul Fremont: Great. That’s it for me. Thanks.\nTom Fanning: Always appreciate you joining us.\nOperator: And we have a question from Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please, go ahead. Your line is open. \nTravis Miller: Hello. Thanks for taking my question. The customer growth, to the extent that, that continues above the forecast, what does that mean for mix of CapEx spending in terms of distribution versus potentially even transmission, but certainly, distribution versus generation, where does that stand?\nTom Fanning: If I remember correctly, Dan, again, correct me if I'm wrong. In the old days, we spent about $1 billion a year on T&D kind of every year. I would argue that maybe amped up a little in recent years, because of, what I would call, hardening or resilience expenditures. You remember Hurricane Yuri. Hurricane, gee, it was Winter Storm Uri that went through Texas. One of the things we did in a proactive way was to look at our kind of planning margin system average temperature, and we reduced that temperature to give us more margin on extreme weather. Those are the kinds of things that we are spending more money on T&D for, I would argue. As well, there is some T&D expenditures that will be intertwined with ultimately our generation location decisions. And I think we've been over this a lot with you guys, but if you look at North Georgia, what's the final disposition and when at plant Bowen. Whether we locate more generation in the north, or let more generation be located in the South and add the transmission necessary to get that generation to the load center. Those are the kind of decisions that we'll cover in the next, I don't know, three to five years.\nTravis Miller: Okay. That's helpful. And then, real quick back on the capital allocation, I know you can't talk about what the Board is going to do, but what are general thoughts on the dividend to the extent that you get to that post Vogtle $4 to $4.30. Obviously, that suggests a significant jump. What are your thoughts on that side?\nDan Tucker: Yes, Travis, this is Dan. So we've talked about this in an earlier call. There is -- if you look in our slide deck, slide 21 kind of represents the uplift from the completion of Vogtle from a cash flow perspective. We're really thinking about that uplift supporting three things. One is an improvement in our overall financial profile, in particular, our credit profile. Then two is, it continues to fund our growth. And then thing three is the dividend. We have increased the dividend every year for over two decades now, going back 75 years. We've never cut the dividend. It's an incredibly important part of our overall value proposition. As we get to 2024, given the improvement in our profile and given a durable growth rate, we think the Board will certainly have the opportunity to reevaluate the pace of growth and perhaps better align the growth in the dividend with growth in earnings.\nTravis Miller: Okay. That’s great. I understand. Thanks so much.\nScott Gammill: Thank you.\nOperator: And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any other closing remarks?\nEnd of Q&A:\nTom Fanning: No, I'm just reminded, maybe age is getting to me, but I can remember one time, I don't know, five, six years ago, where somebody was pleading with me to have a boring earnings call. The old mantra of regular, predictable, sustainable starts to reenter our dialogue now, as we finish these major milestones on Vogtle and we look towards the future. I wouldn't say this was a boring call at all, but it certainly has less volatility in it, given the performance that this company has been able to achieve. Here's hoping for the future. We feel confident, and we look forward to finishing the year strong and looking forward to a new year next year. Thank you all for joining us, and we appreciate it. See you soon.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes The Southern Company's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tom Fanning",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Our third quarter financial results continue to support our full year earnings objectives. And the economies within our service territories remain strong, including customer growth and economic activity that has outpaced our expectations. Given our financial performance through the third quarter, we expect full year adjusted earnings per share near the top of our earnings guidance range. Before turning the call over to Dan for a more detailed look at our financial performance, I'd first like to provide an update on the recent progress at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Importantly, the projected completion timeline and capital cost forecast for both units remain consistent with what we outlined last quarter. Since our last call, the site team has continued to make substantial progress on Unit 3, highlighted by the successful achievement of several major milestones, including submitting the all ITAAC complete letter, receiving the 103(g) finding from the NRC, which signifies that license acceptance criteria for Unit 3 have been met, and successfully completing the safe transfer of all 157 fuel assemblies from Unit 3 spent fuel pool to the reactor core early last week. Fuel load marked another historic and pivotal milestone towards startup and commercial operations. The focus over the next couple of months turns to final preparations and testing of systems primarily associated with the electric power production side of the plant and achieving the pristine conditions in the nuclear island necessary for start-up activities. The next major milestone for Unit 3 is initial criticality or the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction, which is projected in January. Once this important milestone is achieved, plant operators can begin the prescribed testing sequence, which includes a series of power ascensions and reductions, various sustained power output plateaus and multiple forced trips to test the unit's safety systems. This rigorous process is intended to demonstrate the performance of the unit under a variety of conditions and its readiness to be included in reliable dispatch and to be placed in service for the benefit of customers. We continue to project Unit 3 will be placed in service by the end of the first quarter of 2023. Turning to Unit 4. Open vessel testing was completed in August and direct construction is now approximately 97% complete. Electrical production, in particular, electrical terminations remains a key area of focus. To support our projected December 2023 in-service date, recent electrical production levels must be sustained for several more weeks. Testing is expected to become the critical path as the project team progresses towards future milestones of cold hydro testing and the start of hot functional testing, which is projected by the end of the first quarter 2023. Dan, I'll now turn the call over to you. Thanks Dan. We remain encouraged by the sustained level of economic development activity within our service territories as we continue a long legacy of partnering with each of our states to attract new business. In recognition of these efforts, Alabama Power and Georgia Power were once again named to Site Selection Magazine's top 20 utilities in economic development out of approximately 3,330 utilities across the United States based on capital investment and job creation activity. We are honored by this recognition and look forward to continuing our commitment to helping our states and communities attract and grow businesses to further strengthen the economies within our service territories for years to come. In closing, I would like to take a moment to highlight a significant safety milestone at the Vogtle project achieved this month, when the site successfully completed its 68 millionth job hour lost -- I mean, without a lost time incident, but 68 millionth job hour without a lost time incident. At Southern Company, safety represents a key tenet of our uncompromising values and this milestone is a testament to the project team's focus on creating a safety-first culture. I'd like to recognize Sean McGarvey from the North American Building Trades and Lonnie Stephenson from the IBEW, along with all of the thousands of individuals that they represent for their tremendous ongoing support at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. These groups have been terrific business partners for us, and the recent achievement of several major milestones is a tribute to the dedication of thousands of men and women committed to bringing Vogtle Units 3 and 4 safely online to provide Georgia with a reliable, carbon-free resource for the next 60 to 80 years. Thank you all for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Hey, Shar. Just got made by Vice President, give him all the credit. Well, you do know that this is an accounting order, is what it's been since 1995, which means it's not technically kind of a litigated kind of thing. You know that this process has been in place since 1995 and that it really is, I think, a process that has been proven, tried and true, to let every party have their say and have a constructive outcome. And I think we've proven that time and time again. Us commenting on any particular part of anybody's testimony at this point really isn't constructive. Let the process run and I'm sure we'll be treated in a constructive way at the end of it. I'll turn this over to Dan here in just some more details. But effectively, among and between Oglethorpe and Dalton and MEAG, we have reached an agreement, a settlement with MEAG. My sense is, Dan, you're not going to know anything else about the rest of these likely until the end of next year. Credit to your question, is exactly right. Any differences we had were related to tax treatment flow through versus some sort of normalized treatment on the part of Georgia Power. It's interesting. I think during one of the early rounds in other years, we had developers take positions and then Southern Power actually came in and took them out of those positions. So, we could compete another way. My sense is the IRA is really going to be helpful to all regulated utilities that otherwise use normalized accounting. And it does put us much closer on an equal footing to those folks. The other thing that we always have to take into account, particularly with renewables that have distributed sites across our service territory is that Southern is reasonably well known for thinking about our expansion plan on a portfolio basis. Of course, each company reaches its own conclusion within that portfolio. But those kinds of considerations have to be met, especially when you consider wrapping into that, the closure of certain coal plants over time. So, we'll see how it goes. But I think overall, the IRA is really helpful. Dan, do you want to add? And every bit of the IRA to us, just serves to reduce the transition cost of our current position to a Net Zero future, all for the benefit of our customers. We don't make money off tax benefits. We typically flow them through for the benefit of customers. You bet. Look forward to it. Hey, Rob. How are you? Not figured it out yet. This is work ahead for the legislature to undertake, most likely through next year. Our sense is, this is not going to be something that's going to reach a conclusion anytime quickly. There's going to be a lot of debate and a lot of thoughtful consideration about how to put this into play. So really can't guess on it right now, and I really don't have an estimate on any time frame. Except my sense is, it's going to take some time. I don't think we're going to get a result anytime soon. That's right. Summer of 2020. Always good having you. Hey Jeremy, how are you? The minimum tax thing really ended up not making much of a difference, particularly with the latest change they made. That doesn't impact us, hardly at all. This sounds like a policy response, but look, longer term, helping with 45Q and research and development and hydrogen, those are all good things that help us get from say we've already hit our 50% reduction goal. We put it in place in 2030. We hit it a decade early in 2020. Getting from 50% to 80%, we think we know how to do that, too. Getting from 80% to 100% is where these things that relate to innovation and research and development will be helpful. Obviously, those expenditures will happen before they're put into place. In particular, some of the things that we're interested in are this trade you make in the 30s and 40s between nuclear and combined cycle with carbon capture and sequestration. And certainly, in respect of the cost of adding more renewables is something we're focused on. All of those provisions as they're addressed in the build are helpful. Yes. And in general, what we really like about the idea of this bill is the structure that the credits are effectively technology neutral. And therefore, let the market work to show what is best in place for our customers over time. Yes. Yes. I would argue that the new nuclear future of America will likely start with SMRs. We hear a lot about people discussing putting small modular reactors into effect. I mean, that could happen last half of this decade certainly. The larger Gen 4 reactors that you're referencing to me are kind of mid-30s and beyond. Thank you. Well, Dan, you and I should tag team this one as well. I'll start. We're gratified with the progress on electrical terminations. We've always called that one out as a risk factor. And so long as we sustain our recent performance on the site, through, say, November, then we're on track on that issue. So we're watching it very closely. We're gratified with the progress we've made. We just need to continue that progress. Obviously, as you've seen with Unit 3, our performance on these tests are particularly important. We believe that we've learned a lot from the test on Unit 3. And where we had some delays due to equipment issues or system issues, we think we've learned a lot, and we don't expect to repeat some of the issues that we saw in Unit 3 on Unit 4. So our schedule reflects that as well. Dan? And all these discussions that Dan and I are referencing occur in a completely open and transparent environment. We have our co-owners with us. We have representives from DOE, NRC, the public commission staff, et cetera. I mean, everybody gets to hear all this information the same way. And I just think we're gratified with the progress we've made, and we see our way through to remaining comfortable with the time frames we're laying out. Well, I will say this, old dog doesn't learn new tricks. Maybe that's not the right line here. But I'm an old finance guy, and I really like this stuff. I like liability management. And I can remember back when Drew Evans was CFO and we were in the low interest rate environment. We were very intentional about reducing, what I call, our level of risk capital. That's short-term debt, debt within one year, putable debt, all that sort of thing. So we shortened our risk capital. We lengthened the duration of our assets. And I would argue if we do this plot, I think it's in your package, but Southern Company debt portfolio when you look at kind of total enterprise value of a corporation is a really valuable asset. It's 18 years long on the average and has a really cheap coupon rate, 3.5% or whatever. These guys have done a really nice job managing it. Dan? It's just another issue that we deal with. Thank you. Yes. And not to pick at your question, but all we've ever said about 2024 is $4 to $4.30. I think you were just picking the midpoint. Our range has always been $4 to $4. 30. We put that in place some years ago. Dan? Yes. I don't know whether you saw my saying on CNBC this morning on Squad Box. But it is a consistent refrain, and we're actually surprised that a we bit. Our growth so far has been much higher than what we thought. And it's pretty comprehensive. A summary, though, is kind of notable. I was looking through all of our material, we are essentially back to pre-COVID levels on commercial and industrial sales. Our residential sales number is a little over 5% improved. I think that's probably a reflection of a number of things, but including kind of workforce America's reaction to this new hybrid work environment we're finding. The other thing Dan mentioned is the economic development data, which continues to be strong. We don't see much of a reduction a slowing in those numbers. I have a background with the Fed. And so I always get into the nerdy economic details. But one of the things that our head economist here, kind of Shiver does is look at particular industrial segment. So we take our top 10 industrial segments, which represent, I think, about 80% of our sales for the industrial segment. And we do look at not only kind of period-over-period results, which still show really positive growth, everything looking pretty good. We go to the trouble of going to the first derivative, and I would call that a momentum statistic. That would show that even though we still show really good growth, that the amount of growth is moderating. And we just need to kind of think about that as we look going forward. I know a lot of my peers around the country and the economists and the Fed and all the pundits are talking about potentially a mild recession sometime first, second, third quarters of 2023. We see no data for the Southeast that indicates that would be here. So when you hear recession data, just know that, generally speaking, it is national broad brush kind of statistic. The Southeast region is – appears to be, by the data we have, much more resilient and much less prone to such a downturn. You bet. Julien, great to.... Yeah. There's been a lot of written about that. I'm feeling like for mathusalem for heaven's sakes. Look, I am 65.5. So that's a fact. Somebody saw it fit to read an article about that. The fact is Southern Company's Board has made no assessment of that one way or the other. There is no timetable for me leaving. I certainly have an interest in progressing the Vogtle units. That's for sure. You should know also one of my comments to that reporter, I think, got misconstrued or I don't know. He asked me, are you looking for a successor. And I said, look, it's every CEO's job, first day they get there to have a succession plan in place. That got turned into, I'm actively looking for a successor. Here's the truth of it. And you all know this, I think, when you look at our brothers and sisters around the United States, Southern Company has been a terrific place to grow talent. We have several subsidiaries where we can give people experiential opportunities beyond just growing within a silo of functions within their experience at the company. And it is our intention to do that. Somebody is successful in a certain area, we put them into a place where maybe they don't know as much, maybe they're not as comfortable and they've got to build new constituents in order to succeed.  We have a very rigorous process. We have had a rigorous process for 20, 25 years of growing talent and moving them around. The latest example, Robin Boren, who has been Treasurer at Southern Company is now, I guess, effective November 1, going to become CEO of Southern Power. This is just another example of how we move people around that show us that they have the capability to grow into senior, senior positions inside the company. So we'll continue with that. The great news is that there's good talent all over this industry. There's exceptional talent inside Southern. And I'm very, very happy with the bench, the Southern Company management council and beyond. Thank you my friend. And Michael, I could just add as a comment on dogma. As apart from the so-called organized markets, the integrated regulated markets provide us a mechanism to pass-through fuel costs. So there is no profit incentive for us. In other words, it's always incentive for us to keep prices as low as possible. And so we have done that. We've had programs in place that have helped us keep those costs low. This year, we've hedged 34% of our fuel prices, gas prices at about $3 and 22%, next year, 32% at $4.73. Certainly, those are below the spot prices for natural gas right now. Nobody can predict the future. But certainly, those programs, which have been put in place with the conjunction of the public service commissions have been awfully helpful to reduce the pressure on that issue. One last comment I just wanted to do it. But on a going-forward basis, once Vogtle 3 and 4 go in service, the equivalent energy price coming out of that plant is going to be effectively about $1 per million BTU. It's going to be an awfully attractive asset that will run 24/7, 365. And you should know, all of you on the phone should know that some companies put a bunch of plug estimates in there. We don't. We do sensitivities to indicate what may happen with higher CapEx, assuming we get appropriate recovery, which we think we would, but that's the way we are. We have a conservative plan. Thank you. Hey Durgesh. Great to have you with us. Yeah, we establish that once a year. And we'll come back to you with a new five-year plan. I guess it's in February, but yeah, that's us. Yeah. Hey Durgesh, we have a policy. You followed us for some time never front-running a regulatory process. We're not going to start now. So that's going to be a question, I let alone for now. When we see results, then we'll be able to speak to this specifically. You bet. Thank you. Angie, how are you? Angie, it's a wonderful question. Look, our performance to date indicates that we are in the reasonable expectation of achieving a year-end '23 in-service date. You'll have to ask Ogtlethorpe why they may depart from that. Well, in fact, your memory is absolutely spot on. It is lumpy and the reason it's lumpy is when we finish systems, then we are able to submit the ITAAC. And recall a problem we had, I guess it was earlier this year, right around the end of the year into January, finishing up all of the paper. We think we put in place controls, processes, which will speak to that. We should not repeat that problem. So as we finish system completions associated with the big milestone, so ultimately, hot functional test you'll see a big ramp up, a lumpy look in ramp-up of submittal of ITAAC. I couldn't even hazard a guess at that. It really depends on when they come up -- when the legislature comes up with this new process. I have no idea when that will be or what the outcome will be and therefore, it's hard to answer your question. I'm sorry. Election, yeah. Hello, Paul. Thank you. Appreciate it. Tiny amount. And I wouldn't almost refer to it as construction at this point. It's really finishing the finest tuning, if you can imagine, in order to go critical. For example, we've loaded the fuel. We have to put the top on the reactor vessel and ratchet down the enormous bolt structures that will tighten that top down. We have to finish what they call coating. So this would be areas like walls that just need to be painted, that weren't required on a safety-related basis. It is finally -- so in the reactor vessel in order for us to load fuel, it had to be pristine, cleanliness and actually putting the top on the reactor vessel preserves that condition. We want to finish all of the minute cleaning procedures that will be necessary for us to run that plant. It's stuff like that. Well, what I would say, Paul is the next milestone we're guiding you to is, It's criticality and that's January. Yes, right. I'm not sure, I would call that construction, but yes. That's right. So here's the thing. There is a prescribed process and it's a great graph, but nobody let me put it out there. But it's a really interesting looking graph that shows a prescribed process of taking the plant up in power and then taking it down. For example, within, I think, the first week or so, 10 days, we'll get to 25% power, then they take it down. And then we'll go to 50% and take it down. Then we'll go to 75% and take it down, then 90% and then 100%. They do all sorts of trips and bells and whistles along the way. And what they're trying to do is what may be a condition that could exist once the plant goes in service, to make sure that everything works as it is supposed to. If you want more details on that, we filed the VCM here recently. And there's a good bit of background in that VCM report that we filed that can give you more here if you want to see it. No, it's not -- whether we settle or not has no bearing on too far apart or, at least, hasn't in the years past. Paul, I mean, you've followed us forever, it seems like. And we have had this process in place since 1995. And every three years, we go through this. And typically, we reach an agreement just before the holidays. I would expect that to occur again. There's a lot of value. It's almost therapeutic, if you will, to let everybody's views come out in the open and have a good fair debate. We've been treated fairly every other time, my sense is, we'll be treated fairly again. Always appreciate you joining us. If I remember correctly, Dan, again, correct me if I'm wrong. In the old days, we spent about $1 billion a year on T&D kind of every year. I would argue that maybe amped up a little in recent years, because of, what I would call, hardening or resilience expenditures. You remember Hurricane Yuri. Hurricane, gee, it was Winter Storm Uri that went through Texas. One of the things we did in a proactive way was to look at our kind of planning margin system average temperature, and we reduced that temperature to give us more margin on extreme weather. Those are the kinds of things that we are spending more money on T&D for, I would argue. As well, there is some T&D expenditures that will be intertwined with ultimately our generation location decisions. And I think we've been over this a lot with you guys, but if you look at North Georgia, what's the final disposition and when at plant Bowen. Whether we locate more generation in the north, or let more generation be located in the South and add the transmission necessary to get that generation to the load center. Those are the kind of decisions that we'll cover in the next, I don't know, three to five years."

            "name": "Dan Tucker",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom and good afternoon everyone. As Tom mentioned, we had a strong quarter with adjusted earnings of $1.31 per share, $0.08 higher than the third quarter of 2021. The primary drivers for the year-over-year increase are higher revenues associated with increased usage and retail pricing at our regulated utilities. These revenue effects were partially offset by higher nonfuel O&M expenses consistent with the rising cost environment and our long-term commitments to reliability and resiliency, along with higher interest and share dilution from the mandatory conversion of our equity units. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results as compared to 2021 is included in today's release and earnings package. Turning now to retail electricity sales in the economy. In the third quarter 2022 weather-normal retail sales were 1.8% higher than in the third quarter of 2021. This increase reflects stronger sales across all three customer classes, as we've continued to see expansion across our Southeast electric service territories. We also continue to see robust customer growth with the addition of 11,000 residential electric customers and 8,000 residential gas customers during the quarter. We are encouraged by these trends and continue to monitor the potential impacts of supply chain constraints, labor force participation and inflation pressures on our outlook. The economic development pipeline in our service territories remains robust. Within our electric service territories, economic development announcements through the first nine months of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, reflect a 170% increase in job additions and a 237% increase in business investment. Next, I'd like to provide you with an update on our outlook for the remainder of 2022. With adjusted earnings per share through September of $3.35, we expect to achieve adjusted full year earnings near the top end of our guidance range of $3.50 to $3.60 per share. Our adjusted earnings estimate for the fourth quarter is $0.23 per share. Tom, I'll turn the call back over to you. Yes, that's right. And so the settlement with MEAG, you might see in the materials a slight cost revision for Georgia Power's ownership. And that's really reflective of that settlement. Our assumptions previously assumed, as many of you know, this notion of a tender or a put of ownership from any of the co-owners. And since that was not part of the resolution, we reached the kind of our estimate of the impact of the settlement is less than our previous estimate. Yes. Shar it's important to think about this in terms of the planning horizon, right? So this is a longer-term dynamic. So, you're not going to see very much on the front end of the five-year plan. Those decisions have already been made. Those RFPs have already been executed for resources. So, you're really talking about the back half or even the last couple of years of our five-year forecast where this opportunity may manifest itself as potentially rate base assets. The other thing that is a new dynamic that's entering into the equation, certainly, affordability of kind of a low-cost profile is what this -- these tax benefits change. Other considerations will begin to factor in to some of these resources, location, how much the controllability of them and so, it's kind of the difference between the notion of lease cost versus best costs, where there's locational dynamics and other things at play. And some of that time, maybe, because it becomes a bit of an iterative process between the legislature and the court. Sure, Ross. So, again, as a reminder, all of our outlook assumes a total cost for Vogtle that goes into rates of $7.3 billion. And so the way that will break down in terms of rolling into base rates and thus, earnings or to power full allowed ROE, there's $2.1 billion that will go into rate base, the month after Unit 3 goes into service. And then the remainder, following prudence proceeding next year, would go into rates the month after Unit 4 goes into service. And so based on the current schedule, you'd be at Georgia Power's full allowed ROE on $7.3 billion for the full year 2024. The passage of time and increase in the cost of debt, we're essentially there. Correct. Fuel load. Yes. And Jeremy, I'd say the other things that we're kind of exploring and trying to better understand and certainly waiting for IRS guidance is the normalization opt out for storage. That's something we're certainly evaluating how that impacts customer rates the transferability of these tax credits is particularly interesting, especially within Southern Power, where historically, we might have used tax equity. This creates a new, perhaps better dynamic in that regard. There's been a lot of discussion about the nuclear PTC. But we -- right now, as we sit here, based on our interpretation, I don't see that having any meaningful impact for us. But again, we'll wait for guidance on that and see how that turns out. And the certainty that these are there for the next 10 years provides a lot of flexibility and planning and the way we think about our business. Look, I think you hit the big issues. The testing will become critical path here for Unit 4 in the near term. And it is certainly predicated on those lessons learned and being a smooth process. And right now, the focus is getting the right people focused on Unit 4 in that regard where they've been tied up on Unit 3 completing that work. Yes. So to Tom's point, we're starting from a great place in that regard. We've done things this year to take risk off the table, accelerating or upsizing some of our issuances, taking some of the variability out of the portfolio here in the short-term. We'll continue to do those things. And then look, already in 2022, interest rates certainly are having an impact on our results, and we've been able to offset that. We've got levers within the business to do that, and we'll continue to focus on those as we move forward. Like with anyone, I mean, we were fairly conservative about our assumptions over the long term. And like everyone, I'm sure our assumptions in the short-term were pretty far off, but we're managing through that. You bet. Hey, Nick. Hope you are doing great? Yes. And Nick, we're not going to change course here. We always provide our annual guidance on our fourth quarter call. So we'll do that again here in February and put our 2023 number out there for the first time. And what we are also likely to do in February is we will narrow that $4 to $4.30 based on what we see at the time. One of the important factors and uncertainties that existed three years ago when we put that in place, was knowing we'd have another Georgia Power rate case, and then, of course, everything else that has transpired in those three years. So once we get past that, we'll be positioned to narrow that down. As with just about anything, Julien, it's all of the above approach, right? So -- and it always has been for us. So we have managed both in the short term and more importantly, in the long term, around all of these kind of issues, and we'll continue to do that. So to a degree that will be changing the way we operate, becoming more efficient. It will be looking for ways to deploy capital that thus reduces O&M. It will be looking for ways to grow the business more to help offset what might otherwise be headwinds elsewhere. And then importantly, along the way, while we're focused on all of that, we'll also, as we always are, be focused on clean, safe, reliable and importantly, affordable energy as we navigate this with our regulators and strike the right balance there. Yes, sir. Yeah, Michael, this is Dan. So we are certainly having discussions with our regulators. We've been very transparent and proactive about making sure that they understand and appreciate this macro dynamic that has occurred, particularly with natural gas costs and to an extent, coal prices as well. And so yeah, we, like you mentioned, Michael, like many peers, have accumulated a pretty sizable under recovered balance as of the end of the third quarter in total, it's about $2.2 billion. The vast majority of that is at Georgia Power, which is about $1.7 billion. So with each of our jurisdictions, the process is a little different. Some are a little more regular in their cadence. Some are a little more discretionary. I think the plan for that largest balance in Georgia will be addressed that early next year. And again, we'll work very closely with the regulators to make sure that's done in a way that is the least impactful for customers as possible. And one last thing. So just in addition to that continuous proactive dialogue with regulators, we've been having similar conversations with the rating agencies, making sure that they're keenly aware of us likely having to carry a little incremental debt to see this through. But all of our subsidiaries, George Power, in particular, Alabama Power, Mississippi Power, have the financial strength to be able to weather that. Yeah. Look, it's not unchanged from where we were early this year. I mean, our capital plan is designed to support our growth rate of 5% to 7%. I think we highlighted in the fourth quarter call the history of our planning process and how opportunities emerge further out in the forecast you get as we roll the forecast forward. The numbers continue to increase as we get clarity on things, as we bet things with regulators, as new regulations emerge, as new technologies emerge. And I think that will continue to happen. And then, we've got an allocation that we set aside for Southern Power, that's been a little quiet here in recent days, because of the uncertainty that existed before IRA passed, I think you'll see that continue to ramp up. We've got a plan today, Michael, that doesn't require us to issue any equity to finance it. And to the extent we find more opportunities that are able to earn either our regulated returns, or the returns that we require out of the projects in Southern Power, we'll adjust our financing plan, but I'm happy to turn our equity plans on to finance more regulated growth. Yeah, I don't think that's unfair. And importantly, the $41 billion, the starting point is what supports our 5% to 7% growth rate. And so as more opportunities to invest are identified, it simply increases the durability of that growth rate either in the short term or over the long-term. Yes, there's about 240 or a little above that remaining on Unit 4, Angie. And yes, there's not a normal cadence, if you will and there's also a lot of things that are tied to particular milestone tests. So hot functional testing as an example. There will be a lot that either come as a result of that or after that and that's where we really started focusing on them for Unit 3 and kind of laying out the remaining schedule. But I would not expect any sort of linear progression there, it will be lumpy. But based on the current terms, Angie, there were only 2 appropriations this year, and there were none scheduled for next year. And so just Again, if this gets resolved quickly, it will be the election, there's another commissioner of reelection in 2024. Yes, Travis, this is Dan. So we've talked about this in an earlier call. There is -- if you look in our slide deck, slide 21 kind of represents the uplift from the completion of Vogtle from a cash flow perspective. We're really thinking about that uplift supporting three things. One is an improvement in our overall financial profile, in particular, our credit profile. Then two is, it continues to fund our growth. And then thing three is the dividend. We have increased the dividend every year for over two decades now, going back 75 years. We've never cut the dividend. It's an incredibly important part of our overall value proposition. As we get to 2024, given the improvement in our profile and given a durable growth rate, we think the Board will certainly have the opportunity to reevaluate the pace of growth and perhaps better align the growth in the dividend with growth in earnings."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Southern Company Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Investor Relations Director. Please go ahead, sir.\nScott Gammill: Thank you, Tommy. Good afternoon, and welcome to Southern Company's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Dan Tucker, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you, we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in the Form 10-K, Form 10-Qs and subsequent filings.  In addition, we'll present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com.  At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.\nThomas Fanning: Thank you, Scott. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted earnings results for the second quarter, meaningfully ahead of the estimate provided last quarter. The economies within our Southeast service territories remain strong, and we believe we are well positioned to achieve our financial objectives for 2022.  Before turning the call over to Dan for a more detailed look at our financial performance, I'd first like to provide an update on the recent progress at Plant Vogtle units 3 and 4. The projected completion timeline forecast for both units remains within the ranges we provided the last 2 quarters, although at the end of those ranges. At Unit 3, we continue to progress with all necessary systems turned over from construction to testing, all inspection records related to ITAACs complete and then submittal of 51 ITAACs since our last earnings call, including 2, which were just filed this morning. 2 ITAACs remain outstanding.  Concurrent with our final ITAACs submittals, we plan to submit the all ITAAC complete letter to the NRC for Unit 3. This submittal should position us for receipt of the historic 103G finding from the NRC a few weeks later, documenting that license acceptance criteria for Unit 3 have been met. Upon receipt of the 103G finding from the NRC, no further NRC findings are necessary for Southern Nuclear to load fuel or begin the startup up sequence.  Receiving the 13G letter is an important milestone, but there's still more work to do before we load fuel. In the weeks ahead, we will be focusing on testing and surveillance, demobilization, finishing work and documentation. To support an in-service date at the end of the first quarter of 2023, we will need to complete this work and load fuel by the end of October.  Turning to Unit 4. Direct construction is now approximately 96% complete and progress continues in advance of cold hydro testing and hot functional testing. Electrical production, in particular, electrical terminations continues to be a key area of focus. We continue to add resources on site for this work, and we have a plan for transitioning electrical field engineers from Unit 3 as we continue our focus on increasing productivity and ensuring first quality first times to support the upcoming testing and long-term operations.  Timely Unit 3 fuel load and start-up, along with a sustained improvement in Unit 4 electrical production over the next several months is necessary to support our December 2023 in-service objective.  Moving now to cost. At the end of the second quarter, Georgia Power recorded an after-tax charge of $39 million, including replenishment of contingency and estimated incremental co-owner sharing impacts. Contingency allocated during the quarter is primarily related to procurement activities for remediation and a revised resource plan for Unit 4 that reflects updated productivity assumptions and the planned increase in craft and support resources.  We're excited about the progress that we've seen at the site over the last several months and look forward to the transition of Unit 3 from construction to operations in the weeks ahead.  Dan, I'll turn the call over to you.\nDaniel Tucker: Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom mentioned, we had a very strong quarter, with adjusted earnings of $1.07 per share, $0.23 higher than last year and $0.27 above our estimate. The primary drivers for the increases compared to last year and our estimate are higher revenues associated with higher usage, changes in rates and pricing and warmer-than-normal weather at our regulated electric utilities.  These revenue effects were partially offset by higher interest expense and depreciation, along with higher nonfuel O&M, consistent with the rising cost environment and our long-term commitments to reliability and resilience. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results as compared to 2021 is included in today's release and earnings package.  Turning now to retail electricity sales in the economy. In the second quarter 2022, weather-normal retail sales were 2.3% higher than the second quarter of 2021. This increase reflects stronger sales across all 3 customer classes, as we continue to see expansion across our Southeast electric service territories. We also continue to see robust customer growth with the addition of 12,000 residential electric customers and 7,000 residential gas customers during the quarter. We remain encouraged by these trends and are continuing to monitor the potential impacts of supply chain constraints, labor force participation and inflation pressures on our outlook.  Economic development within our service territories remains robust, with Alabama seeing a 10-year high in jobs and capital investment announcements during the quarter, led by announcements from Hyundai, Novelis and Airbus. Additionally, recent electric vehicle plant announcements in Georgia from Hyundai and Rivian represent the largest economic development projects in the state's history. These 2 projects alone are expected to create nearly 16,000 jobs and over $10 billion of capital investment across the state.  As we highlighted last quarter, the Port of Savannah continues to show strength, with the container volume growth seen during the first quarter accelerating in the second quarter as a result of U.S. consumer demand and the diversion of vessels from other ports driving record cargo levels in June. We remain encouraged by the level of economic development within our service territories, and we continue to partner with each of our states to attract new businesses.  With our solid adjusted results through the first half of the year, we are well positioned as we head into the peak electric-load season. Our estimate for the third quarter of 2022 is $1.32 per share on an adjusted basis. And consistent with historical practice, we will address earnings for the year relative to our EPS guidance after the third quarter.  Before turning the call back over to Tom, I would like to briefly highlight Georgia Power's 2022 Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP, which was unanimously approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission last week. Recall, Georgia Power files an IRP every 3 years, outlining the company's plan to continue delivering clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to its 2.7 million customers over the next several decades. The approved plan includes the addition of 2,300 megawatts of new renewable resources as part of Georgia Power's long-term plan to double its renewable generation by adding an additional 6,000 megawatts by 2035. The plan also approves the addition of over 750 megawatts of battery energy storage projects, the retirement of over 1,500 megawatts of coal by 2028, and the continuation of existing grid investment in ash pond closure programs.  Additionally, the approved IRP continues Georgia Power's hydro modernization program and authorizes initiating a license renewal application for Plant Hatch, each of which will extend the lives of these important carbon-free energy resources for the benefit of customers. The expected capital expenditures associated with approval of the IRP are consistent with the capital plan that we laid out on the fourth quarter earnings call in February.  Tom, I'll now turn the call back to you.\nThomas Fanning: Thanks, Dan. For more than 5 decades, Southern Company's world-class research and development organization has remained at the forefront of innovation to build the future of energy today. I'd like to take a moment to highlight a couple of recent R&D announcements. Last month, Georgia Power and Mitsubishi Power, along with the Electric Power Research Institute, successfully blended 20% hydrogen fuel at Georgia Power's Plant, McDonagh, representing the world's largest hydrogen fuel blending demonstration project to date on an advanced-class gas turbine. This demonstration project helped pave the way for long-term clean and carbon-free use for existing natural gas-generating infrastructure.  Additionally, in Alabama, Southern Company continues to manage the National Carbon Capture Center for the Department of Energy, which recently surpassed 128,000 hours of testing, and has expanded its focus on advancing carbon capture for natural gas-powered generation, carbon utilization and technology-enhanced solutions such as direct air capture. In fact, a low-carbon concrete technology developed by Carbon XPRIZE winner, UCLA and CarbonBuilt, recently achieved its first commercialization deal bolstered by successful testing at the center. We are proud of the legacy created by our R&D group over the last 50 years and look forward to continuing this important work for many years to come.  In closing, I'd like to take a moment to highlight Southern Company's generating fleet and power delivery system, which performed exceedingly well through June's extremely hot weather. During what was the second hottest June in 50 years, we were able to maintain sufficient generating capacity reserves across daily peaks, including 6 days, which peaked over 40,000 megawatts, and an all-time peak load of 41,376 megawatts on June 15.  Delivering these results requires effective long-term planning that is best facilitated in a vertically integrated, state-regulated markets, coupled with real-time coordination between our plants and our system operators. And I'd be remiss if I didn't recognize the performance of our covered workers who, once again, performed during these times of duress in an exemplary manner. I'm proud of our team's continued outstanding performance during times when our customers need us the most.  Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we're now ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And we'll get to our first question on the line is from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.\nShahriar Pourreza: So just got two quick ones for you, Tom. Just on the IRP, obviously, a decision on the Bowen plant was pushed out to $25 million do you sort of think is kind of the most viable pathway forward there at 1,800 megawatts, it's sizable. Can you convert it to gas? Can you get firm transmission on the pipe -- or if you went with more renewables, can you just maybe remind us of the amount of transmission you've said you would be needed and the time it would take to build it to make solar an option there just given that the plants in the northern location?\nThomas Fanning: Shar, you hit the nail on the head. My overarching comment here is that our long-term strategy as a system remains robust and strong commitment to net-zero by 2050 is in place. I think the beauty of how we work with the commission and the staff and, frankly, all of our stakeholders is something that allows us to respond to the kind of exogenous factors that really impact us from a tactical standpoint. Obviously, fuel markets have changed, inflation has changed, supply chains have changed. And so I think the wisdom of the commission in this case is perfectly warranted in pushing that decision forward.  I don't want to certainly prejudge what we don't know at this point. But I will say the 2 options you outlined are very reasonable. One, is to think about keeping generation in the northern part of our state. You know that our big load sync is Atlanta. And so the Bowen unit historically have played a really important part in kind of balancing the load between North and South.  Were we to continue to shut down those units, you would need to think about replacement. Obviously, gas is an option North. More renewables North could play a role. As you know, our big answer on renewables across the system is most likely solar, not wind, just we don't have the climate to do widespread wind. And maybe these tall turbines will come to fruition or not, who knows.  So failing that, putting more solar in the south part of the state with a much better terrain does make sense. In order to locate more generation in the state in order to balance the needs in the North, we'll need to build significant transmission. The beauty of our market structure here is we are allowed to iterate among and between generation and transmission as an optimal portfolio solution. The so-called organized markets have difficulty doing that. So this is a topic of conversation. I think we'll handle it in the future.\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. Got it. And then just lastly, on Vogtle with sort of 8 months left to hit your Unit 3 target, you have 4 ITAACs, the NRC letter, likely doesn't seem like it's a major hindrance and then you have fuel load expected in November. Can you just elaborate sort of on those interim steps that you think could be more complex post fuel load, which still gives you about a 4- or 5-month cushion to hit your Q1 target date? I mean, I hate to say this, but can the plant actually be ahead of schedule here?\nThomas Fanning: Yes. I would hate to say that. You would love to say that.\nShahriar Pourreza: I don't want to get everyone excited.\nThomas Fanning: Yes, right, right. If we don't either. We're guiding you all to say that we feel comfortable within the range that we've laid out, I guess, 2 calls ago. Let's say the schedule calls for completion by end of March 23. Here's kind of where we are. We have 2 ITAACs remaining, not 4. And I believe we'll finish those in days, not weeks. I think these things are reasonably imminent. Then we'll file concurrently for the letter requesting the 103G, letter to be issued by the NRC. We think the NRC has plenty of capability to handle that within their time frame, which I think is we've laid out at a max of 17 days.  Really, I think the greater pacing factor to fuel load is now not ITAACs, it is the rest of the work we need to finish on our own to begin fuel load and then begin the initial operation of the plant. As I mentioned before, and Dan can help me here, too, there are 4 kind of big categories we're thinking about in terms of the scope of that work. One is demobilization. The second is testing and surveillance. The third is just finishing the work that we already have in place. And then the final one we've talked to you about is documentation, getting the paper right.  Simple examples of some of those things, demobilization is taking down things like scaffolding, and taking any of the spare parts that we have laying around the site and moving those off so that, at the end of the day, the work rooms and everything within Unit 3 will meet nuclear standards in terms of operations.  Dan, do you want to add anything else there?\nDaniel Tucker: Yes. I think that's a great example of demobilization and scaffolding, temporary lighting is a similar example. Testing and surveillance activities and documentation, I think those are pretty obvious part of the finishing work, really gets to what Tom alluded to, but it's doing coatings, it is getting particularly containment to this pristine condition to get ready for fuel load. So it's those activities that, frankly, have a logical sequence to them, and it just takes time to work through.\nThomas Fanning: And now is the time to do that work. There's nothing unusual about the work ahead, we needed to finish the safety-related ITAAC, and now we finish that stuff. Look, the whole exciting transition we have here is moving this plant from transition to operations, and we have line of sight to that now.\nOperator: Our next question on the line from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Fleishman: Tom, good to hear you. So just kind of a last second question here just since we just got this potential new inflation reduction bill. Any thoughts on you've been very right about this not happening, and now certainly, there's a chance that it might. Just do you think this now can happen that Manchin is on board? And then just implications for Southern across different ways that would impact you or your customers good or bad?\nThomas Fanning: Yes, sure. You bet. Let me give you the -- it's all good. Let me go back to what I said before. I never say it wouldn't happen. I said the deal physics were hard. And let's just kind of replay the cards as we've worked relentlessly on the hill, whether it's Congress or in the administration and, frankly, our stakeholder groups, environmental, et cetera, the deal physics were getting tough because we were entering this period of inflation. And I won't say senator Manchin had his eye on inflation a long time before a lot of other people did.  And so the idea of spending more money in light of inflation pressures, and I guess the latest announcement was 9% or so, is really something that is concerning. And so the way that you get to promote this kind of bill is to include within it, pay-fors that will offset whatever inflationary pressures may arise from the increased spending. And as you can see from the proposal right now, and let's leave it as a proposal, there's an additional, I don't know, $300 billion of pay-fors. So hopefully, it speaks to the need to not make this an additional log on the inflationary fire.  The second kind of interesting exogenous variable is a specter of a recession. And I think what has been concerning many people is that adding taxes at this time may be another domino to fall that may increase your likelihood of entering into a recession. Now we've just heard this morning that the United States is in technical recession that is 2 GDP quarters negative in growth. But if you look at our numbers, and I leave this to Dan or whatever, who kind of did a nice summary in the script, we're not seeing any indicators of recession right now. But certainly, the historic numbers that bring us up to date for the quarter are way better than what we expected.  Further, when you look at the data Dan referenced with respect to our headlights, if you will, our economic development activity, you're talking over 300% of job growth in the backlog, and you're talking nearly 700% of capital investment. And you're talking about things like Rivian and you're talking about more EV development, and you're talking about data centers. We don't see the specter of a recession right now.  Now I'd like for Dan to comment a little bit. He does his economic roundtable, just got through with it. Other people are seeing some reasons to be cautious. And maybe that's cautious in the first part of 2023, Dan, why don't you give us a burst on the roundtable.\nDaniel Tucker: Yes. So just as a reminder for folks, we've done this for over a decade. And what we do a couple of times a year is bring in folks from regional universities, large financial institutions and then, frankly, a lot of representation from a cross sector -- or a cross-sector representation from our customer base. So we had railroads in the room. We had manufacturing companies, ones that get involved with housing. We had consumer goods across the board.  And to Tom's point, there was this backdrop of, yes, a recession is looming, but a very clear acknowledgment that what you may find yourself in is a place where there's very clear geographic or regional differences as you enter into that period and endure it. So Tom is right. Everything we're seeing provides a lot of tailwinds for us. We're in terrific shape. Things could certainly change. But everything we see now every indication, and if you look at Slide 10 of our deck and how sales manifested during the quarter relative to what we expected. We're in terrific shape.\nThomas Fanning: And even those industrial results, Dan, included 2 pretty big plant closures, one Olin Chemical and the other one was...\nDaniel Tucker: Resolute, a newspaper manufacturer that was in Georgia.\nThomas Fanning: And so absent those guys, [indiscernible], I mean, it would have been certainly higher than 3.7%. The momentum numbers look good. So we just don't -- the data doesn't support a recession, all right? Now we raised the issue on the last call in light of the recession that there may be the likelihood of a national recession where the Southeast remains robust and growing. So we just don't see that right now.  Now, I will say, we do see inflation and particularly in the food and energy markets, and that hurts our customers. So this is not an environment without duress? And it's those factors, I would say, inflation and potential for recession and what the other exogenous variables may be? I mean, what is the future of Ukraine? And what is the unwinding of the supply chain from and how will that visit the United States in the future are all key variables.  What has changed a bit has been this narrative of, are we really in a technical recession? Does that really reflect the strength of the economy? There's pretty good arguments on each side. I would argue that the Southeast, given our strong foundation, is going to be better able to weather this than many places else in the United States.  I think the conclusion of the people that have come up with this legislation is also that this is an inflationary by its structure and the tax increases, which don't impact us very much, and I'll speak to some of the pieces of this legislation and how in respect Southern, probably aren't going to be enough to tip very further into recessionary territory. They tend to believe more of the qualitative not the quantitative story.  With respect to Southern, good having -- this looks really good. When you look at the energy security and climate change pieces of the legislation, the $369 billion or so, it's very helpful to us. You know that the move from investment tax credit or production tax credits is very favorable. To us, our favorite kind of renewable over the years, we call it one time, we were the largest owner of solar in the United States. We've recycled some capital. I never particularly like having to live off the ITC characteristics. So moving to PTC is really a good thing.  And when you look at the Georgia IRP, solar plays an important part in our future. So that's really good start. Recall also our R&D for storage. We've already mentioned our importance of carbon capture science. So the 45Q credits are great.  Here's the big thing, though. If I had to write a headline on all of those benefits, I would say that this is really beneficial to our customers and should reduce the cost of the transition from the fleet today to the net-zero long-term strategy in the future. There are some other things in there that are kind of attractive. The tax credits in there for purchase of electric vehicles, whether they're used or new. There're some other things in there for hydrogen, a variety of other things.  So what about the negatives? What about the pay-fors? If you look at kind of the list of that leading the charts is this 15% corporate minimum book tax. I'll probably leave this for the guys in the boiler room after the call, but I am prepared, Steve, with examples that will show you that the difference between tax taxes and book taxes to us is almost nothing.  A company as big as ours with $23 billion of revenue and all that other stuff, the difference is in taxes paid is just really small like 0.5% kind of as an estimate. It's almost you can't see it, $5 million, $10 million. It's almost nothing. Now of course, as that travels over time depends on a host of factors. But to us, this alternative book tax just doesn't have a material impact to the company, okay?  It will be interesting to see what happens on the prescription drug pricing reform and some of these other things. I just don't have enough there. And everything I should say should be underscored with the admonition that we really haven't been through the 700-page document as thoroughly as we will. What we're giving you are our first thoughts on what it appears to be to us. Dan, do you want to say anything there?\nDaniel Tucker: No, I think we just see if Steve has any follow-ups.\nSteven Fleishman: Yes. I guess my one follow-up on this question would be, again, is your judgment, but you need every Democrat to support it to pass reconciliation just the likelihood that, I guess, particularly Sinema or the risk of someone falls off in terms of it getting done?\nThomas Fanning: I think Sinema becomes a really important person now. I don't know how involved she has been so far on the creation of this agreement, frankly, between Manchin and Schumer. So her sense of this is going to be extremely important. And I know she's been very hawkish on raising taxes. So we'll see.  In the house, let's not even put that in the wind column just yet because I know that a lot of the House Democrats have had a lot of, I don't know, requests, desires for a change in tax policy, including things like a surtax on the wealthy, including SALT relief, the state and local tax relief. There's no additional taxes on small businesses. So there's a lot on the Democrat side in the house that's not in this bill, that still has to be negotiated. So we'll see how that goes.\nOperator: And we'll get to our next question on the line from Julien Dumoulin-Smith, Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: So if we can, just where the negotiations stand, the lawsuit filed by the co-owners playing into the timing of resolution here? I mean just you're previously pointing to the summer time broadly. I guess we're still in summer for resolution. But what's your expectation on that being extended, if you will, just to come back very squarely on this and sort of the parameters at this point?\nThomas Fanning: Yes. Julian, I don't think we expect anything in the near term there. I think, as this plays out, I wouldn't be surprised to move to business court in Georgia, and the resolution could be second half of '23. I don't think we'll know anything in the near term.\nDaniel Tucker: Yes. The one near-term data point, Julian, is there is an August 27 date by which we'll know whether MEAG plans to tender their portion is what we've heard from [indiscernible] and MEAG still needs to work through their process and let us send one way or the other.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Okay. That's more perfunctory. I understood. All right. Excellent. And then actually, -- let me ask you this. I mean, just how do you think about addressing the opportunity about owning renewables, whether through these RFP processes or just kind of stepping in at some point after RFPs have been awarded here to expand your ownership? And again, I get that you've got a certain allocation already in Southern Power, but is there any regulatory solution when you think about Georgia here that you could address or talk to a little bit? I think Shar was kind of alluding to it a moment ago.\nThomas Fanning: Yes, man, certainly, going to the PTC, certainly makes it more competitive, more attractive for our operating companies to own this stuff. So that's really helpful. We're all in. And of course, Southern Power can compete for the new megawatts of particularly solar in the state. So on the margin, everything that we see in this potential settlement looks good for us. We're very happy with it.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. So perhaps the shift to really -- Go for it.\nThomas Fanning: I would also say that we have been engaged in conversations in this. Like I say, I mean, with the administration, with any stakeholder, with Congress for months. So to the extent they arrived at a resolution, is it surprising? I don't know. I think it depends on how you view this inflation versus recession pressure issue. The pay fors certainly speak to the inflation. And I think the judgment on the ability of the United States economy to withstand the tax increases is really what's going to get us over the line. I just think, on the margin, this is good stuff for us.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. And to be extra clear about this, the solar PTC sort of opens up the window of eligibility, especially given how punchy ITCs can be, not just for Southern Power, but more specifically here for Georgia Power.\nThomas Fanning: It sure does.\nDaniel Tucker: Yes. For all of our regulated utilities, they're always going to make the economic choice for customers and what the PTC does is make cell phone that much more economic. So I think our competitiveness has definitely improved if this goes through.\nOperator: We turn the next question on the line is from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Arcaro: I was wondering, just back on Vogtle, could you just talk a little bit about the labor backdrop maybe specifically on Unit 4? And if you're facing any labor tightness, any kind of turnover or churn issues there as you start to maybe ramp up and bring people back to that site and accelerate the work there?\nThomas Fanning: In general, a lot of that goes to compensation. I think we're top decile. We measure ourselves all the time. And so the compensation issues are pretty well spoken for. I think you always have kind of a worry that as you finish conclusion of work that people will start leaving and go to other more sustained work. We're keeping our eye on that, and we think we have that spoken for. We measure our churn statistics virtually every day, report every week, and they're within our expectations right now. We are adding people to the site with relative ease.  I think the interesting issue there will be, you may remember us talking a lot about attracting electricians. We're able to do that now. I think the more important point for us is as we wrap up work on 3, it frees people from 3 to move to 4.  And it's not just folks that will do particularly these electrical termination. We're ramping that up in a big way. It's engineering and supervisory people that will make the increase in people on Unit 4 more efficient. Those are necessary to achieve the ramp-up schedule that we expect to see, oh, I don't know, over the next 10 to 12 weeks or so.  So that really is it. I think it's this idea of advancing on 3, freeing people up, moving those resources to 4 and increasing our productivity.\nDavid Arcaro: Got it. That's helpful. And I guess maybe any latest thoughts on a potential for a settlement around prudency or the time frame for when you might be able to start those discussions with other parties and intervenors here? Is getting closer to fuel load on Unit 3 is still the focus before that becomes maybe closer in time to being mixed up?\nThomas Fanning: Settlement is always an option, but, boy, we don't want to get in front of that horse. We'll just let it go. As you may remember, the official schedule calls for prudence to begin on fuel load for Unit 4. And we kind of expect that in what summer next year.  So that's the official date to have a prudence hearing or begin that process. Yes, we could settle in advance of that, but I'm not going to front-run that issue here.\nOperator: And we'll get our next question on the line is from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Good afternoon -- thanks for joining.\nJeremy Tonet: Just wanted to touch on the guidance a little bit here, if I could. And just wanted to see any updated thoughts you have? I mean, just being so far ahead this past quarter, how do you see yourself positioned? Could the guidance raise be in the cards if things continue -- current trends continue?\nDaniel Tucker: Jeremy, this is Dan. So look, as we always do, we'll narrow down our year-end expectations during the third quarter call. It is clear that our year-to-date performance has positioned us really well to deliver strong results. But what it also does is position us really well to mitigate our operational and financial risk in future years.  So we're going to take every opportunity we have to fix the roof while the sun is shining, if you will. And if you look at our history of O&M spending in the electric business, there's almost never such a thing as a normal year. We build flexibility into our programs so that we can accelerate maintenance activities when we have higher-than-expected revenues from weather or customer growth or strong economic activity.  And then conversely, in those years, that inevitably happen where weather or economic activity are below our expectations or even recently a pandemic, we have the flexibility to curtail in those years knowing what we've done in years prior to get ready. Over time, this all balances out. And the system remains in great shape to serve customers, and our financial results are a lot less volatile than they might have otherwise been.  Additionally, and very importantly, many of our regulatory frameworks have backstops whereby better-than-expected results accrue to the benefits of our customers through the various rate or rebate mechanisms. So I would just say, stay tuned to the third quarter, but know that we're doing everything we can to improve and derisk future years.\nJeremy Tonet: Yes. Got it. Sorry.\nThomas Fanning: No, I mean just a little bit of clarity to that, too. It's inescapable. We're way ahead of where we thought we would be. I mean we, what, $0.37 up on the first 6 months. We're not going to be $0.37 over at the end of the year, right? That's what Dan is trying to say. I mean, I'd be disappointed if we weren't improved in the range or whatever. But we're just sticking with our practice of really giving you the firm guidance on our range in the next earnings call.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it.\nThomas Fanning: But the performance so far -- Yes, we're doing great.\nJeremy Tonet: And then just one last one, if I could. And I realize that everything is new here. As you talk about the news last night out of D.C., but any thoughts with regards to regulated nuclear eligibility for PTC here that you might be willing to share with us?\nThomas Fanning: Yes, it's slim. I think that language was designed to help plants under duress. Ours haven't been under duress. So I don't think it's a big deal. And recall that we already have production tax credits in place for Vogtle 3 and 4. So really, the application of Vogtle 1 and 2 fairly are hatch slim to none. That's our view right now.\nOperator: And our next question on the line from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Lapides: Tom, Dan, a question for you. The McDonough discussion early in the call about blending hydrogen, Tom, can you just talk about both for hydrogen and your gas power plants, but also for RNG for your gas utilities, how should we think about what kind of the steps that have to happen, the big broad steps that have to happen for those to become decent-sized investment opportunities for the Southern family of companies?\nThomas Fanning: Yes. You know what, but, I think that while some people have been breathlessly optimistic about hydrogen and I would argue we're doing the most research and the most kind of real money behind our words. We think hydrogen has a great place, particularly in blending with kind of methane fuels as we're demonstrating here in McIntosh. And then as we're looking at with the new plant that we may be building in Alabama to blend hydrogen, those are great applications, and we like them, okay? But I think the real issue in terms of near-term impact is going to be the classic chicken or the egg. Who's going to generate the hydrogen, and how do we move it?  Now we are doing also a lot of research on the gas side. So we're looking at, as we add safety-related pipeline replacement programs in Southern Gas, is it suitable to think about moving hydrogen through those facilities. We're certainly thinking about that.\nMichael Lapides: Got it.\nDaniel Tucker: Yes, I was going to say, Michael, just along the same lines as what we've been talking about on the call around renewables and what this agreement with Manchin and Schumer may -- how that may benefit renewables something similar may be needed for RNG since you asked about that, to make it equally affordable for customers.\nMichael Lapides: Yes. I was under the impression that there is an RNG ITC in this bill and -- but was just kind of curious for your thoughts about if there is some kind of tax credit for RNG, whether that's enough to make RNG really a material opportunity for the Southern Gas utility?\nThomas Fanning: Dan, I don't know. We need to dive through the material. We're kind of looking at each other, going I don't know.\nDaniel Tucker: Yes. I mean when you said material, it's hard to see it being material in the near term.\nThomas Fanning: Yes. I really think hydrogen is a good idea, but it's probably in the 30s.\nOperator: We can get to the next question on the line from Nick Campanella with Credit Suisse.\nNicholas Campanella: A lot of them been answered. I appreciate the updates. I guess just what's different about this quarter is you guys kind of moved off the ranges to target kind of specific quarters for in-service dates. So is that just kind of like the cadence of how you plan to kind of communicate ISD at this point? Or are you going to eventually kind of move back to a range on Unit 4? I think it's currently Q4 '23, if I'm not mistaken, for Unit 4 today?\nThomas Fanning: We gave a lot of thought to that. We provided the guidance plus 3 months, plus 6 months. And as we look at the progress on 3, that has a lot to say about 4, okay? And let me give you an example. So as we begin fuel load and start-up of 3, the same kind of personnel that will be devoted to that activity will also be devoted to HFT in Unit 4. There can be overlap there, particularly, say, in the second half of start-up, maybe the last 25% of start-up. So let's just take a calendar. We've suggested that we could have fuel load before October. So that's -- and that would permit by March.  If the same personnel are starting to get freed up in the second half by February, by January, somewhere in there, that would suggest you could accelerate hot functional test on 4 from the calendar that we're showing you on Page 6. So all we're trying to say is the timing of 3 has a lot to do with the timing of 4.  And to the extent we're successful on accelerating 3 prior to March, or have the people available at the end of startup of 3 prior to March, we can start hot functional testing sooner than the critical path we indicate on Page 6. That really is, I think, what is mostly behind our comments on schedule right now.\nNicholas Campanella: Okay. Great. Yes. I just I wasn't sure if you just had like enough line of sight where you were kind of comfortable in like nailing down a quarter here. So...\nThomas Fanning: Well, I mean I almost describe it this way. I think we got line of sight on 3. I think we have reasonable expectations on 4. We admit that there's lots of variables on 4. We'll certainly keep you abreast of those developments as they occur. Right now, we believe we're reasonably comfortable within the ranges. We are expecting an improvement in productivity on 4. So we'll be watching that in the very near term. We'll have more to say about that certainly next quarter.\nNicholas Campanella: Okay. Got it. And then I guess when you gave these in-service date ranges, you also kind of talked about like $4 to $4.30 of EPS in 2024. Now that we're kind of at the end, does that guidance still hold here today?\nDaniel Tucker: Yes. Look, we are where we were, but the reason we put out a range, Nick, is because there's -- it was 3 years away, and there's a lot of moving parts. So, look, you see what's happening around inflation and interest rates. You see that we've got a significant regulatory calendar ahead of us. We recognized that there was a lot of uncertainty. And as those things get buttoned up, and we get closer to 2024, we'll narrow in on exactly where within that range we are.\nThomas Fanning: Yes. But I think we're still within the range. The biggest change, I guess, Dan, that we see of interest rates, particularly cost of -- interest costs at the parent. But we'll certainly update that at our year-end earnings call. But I would say that it is a range, and Dan mentioned, we'll tell you where we are within the range. I don't see any reason to change it now. But within that expectation as a result of the Georgia rate case, anything to do with the economy, a recession, a host of variables. But everything we know right now, we're still within the range.\nOperator: And we'll get to our next question on the line is from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.\nDurgesh Chopra: I wanted to go pick a brain just for a little bit more on the clean energy bill. So obviously, I mean, there's a lot to like here for utilities, generally speaking. But sort of when I compare this to sort of the build back better version of the plan, there's no direct pay for utilities, doesn't look like utilities are eligible for that. There's also no transmission investment tax credit as far as I can sort of see through the bill.  And then obviously, you have the 15% minimum tax, which you guys talked to is not a material impact for you, but EEI has visually kind of oppose that, if you will. So I'm just wondering that is there a chance for the industry or EEI broadly here to kind of influence certain piece of this legislation? Or is the process moving too quickly?\nThomas Fanning: I think -- I'm giving you a complete judgment here, not fact, all right? My judgment would say that it's been so hard to get to this place. And there are still uncertainties out there, as I mentioned in response to Steven Fleishman's question. You don't have SALT relief in here. You don't have a surtax on the wealthy individuals in America.  There are things here that so many people wanted this thing -- and [indiscernible], there are still many unknowns as to whether we can get this across the finish line. This is a great thing for us, and I broadly would say for the industry. Adding something else at this point, I think, is a bridge too far, in my opinion.  And I think, the inside the beltway people are kind of talking to each other with the frame of mind that don't let the perfect get in the way of the good. This is pretty good, and we hope it crosses the finish line.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. And then just really quickly, can you just update us on the Georgia rate case filing? Just the milestones there, still expecting a final decision by year-end and kind of the key issues that investors now should be watching for?\nDaniel Tucker: Yes, Durgesh, again, we don't want to get ahead of any of the process. There is a calendar in the slide deck, Slide 25. So really, the process will start in earnest in mid-September with hearings. And yes, we still expect a decision by the September. I think the only other thing I would say is just as a reminder, this rate case is largely a continuation of all the elements of the 2019 rate case. It is carrying a lot of those same capital initiatives forward. It's not Vogtle. It's 2019, 3 years later.\nThomas Fanning: What I'd add, reference the NERC report that warned the industry that half of the United States would be under duress with our energy future. And then you're stressed further by this unusual weather we're having, whether that's part of climate change, et cetera, the tails appear to be flatter, our system has performed beautifully. And I think, given our relative price position in the United States, given the resilience of our system, I think the decisions of the commission in the past and the company had been excellent in respect to benefiting customers long term here in the Southeast.  And it's no secret why a lot of data centers in some of these big economic development projects, Rivian and others, are coming because of the price, because of the resilience, because of the long-term stability. Having this kind of constructive regulatory environment benefits long term the economic growth of the Southeast and that continues to look very robust. I don't see any reason why it would change at this point.\nOperator: And we'll get to our next question on the line from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.\nPaul Patterson: And I'm afraid I'm going to be following sort of Durgesh and Steve's approach here, just if possible. You made some comments about the new PTC and how you think it was -- it's designed for troubled nuclear plants? Did I -- could you elaborate a little bit on that? I mean I am unable to read all the legislative tech, but it looked to me like it was a little bit broader than that. And what you're saying makes logical sense. I just wanted to sort of get a better feeling to what you actually see happening there.\nDaniel Tucker: Yes. Again, so qualifying this, Paul, this is Dan. As it's 700 pages to get through and understand the details, and this is based on our high-level review of similar provisions in BBB. The legislation essentially sets an economic floor for nuclear plants. And so when you have a regulated nuclear plant that operates in a constructive jurisdiction and is recovering its costs on a regular basis, it's unlikely to truly benefit from something that's intended for troubled financially nuclear units.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. That makes logical sense. I just wanted to get a better idea. And then also just in terms of the mechanics, the 15%, I assume that, that applies to all corporations within that large category or what have you. And I'm just wondering, when did that be -- or am I missing something -- could that be a political problem for the legislation, or am I missing something there? I mean, you mentioned the SALT and all those other things that people -- I am sorry, go ahead.\nThomas Fanning: No, I mean, I think you're absolutely making a good point. I'm telling you it's good for us. There will certainly be people in America that don't like this. I think NAM has already come out and said that this really hurt some of the people in manufacturing in the industry and you kind of expect this. Well, if it's good for us, who isn't it good for, and they certainly will weigh in.  And we'll see what impact that has. It is -- it must be at least a zero-sum game in order to be positive to the scorecard in Congress. So we're not hurt by it, other people are. I fully expect that it will provide headwinds to getting it done. We'll see if it's enough to sway some votes. I don't know.\nOperator: Thank you. And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks?\nThomas Fanning: Yes. This is an exciting time, isn't it? We've had a wonderful quarter. We've made great progress on the ITAAC. My sense is these, next 2 will be done in a matter of days, not months or weeks. And son of a gun, we're poised to turn this thing over to operations and look forward to fuel and so forth, that will remove a great deal of risk, I think, from our portfolio going away. But that does not mean that risk is done. We still have to complete the work necessary to fuel load. We still have to improve particularly our performance in electrical, particularly in the terminations area. We believe we have reason to expect that performance to actually happen. We'll know reasonably soon whether that's true or not.  So look, I think we're as well poised as we can be. Dan mentioned the blessing of the good performance that we've had to date, $0.27 over versus our own estimate, gives us the flexibility to deal with problems in the future, including rate pressure. So I like our cards here. I like the cards that are shown by the robust performance of the Southeast economy relative to the national economy.  I know you all have to make your bets, and we have to do the same in terms of allocating capital. I think the allocation of capital from our own sense to our business model and going forward in this manner is really attractive.  So thank you all for joining us this afternoon. Look forward to our next call in October. See you soon.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Southern Company Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Daniel Tucker",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom mentioned, we had a very strong quarter, with adjusted earnings of $1.07 per share, $0.23 higher than last year and $0.27 above our estimate. The primary drivers for the increases compared to last year and our estimate are higher revenues associated with higher usage, changes in rates and pricing and warmer-than-normal weather at our regulated electric utilities.  These revenue effects were partially offset by higher interest expense and depreciation, along with higher nonfuel O&M, consistent with the rising cost environment and our long-term commitments to reliability and resilience. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results as compared to 2021 is included in today's release and earnings package.  Turning now to retail electricity sales in the economy. In the second quarter 2022, weather-normal retail sales were 2.3% higher than the second quarter of 2021. This increase reflects stronger sales across all 3 customer classes, as we continue to see expansion across our Southeast electric service territories. We also continue to see robust customer growth with the addition of 12,000 residential electric customers and 7,000 residential gas customers during the quarter. We remain encouraged by these trends and are continuing to monitor the potential impacts of supply chain constraints, labor force participation and inflation pressures on our outlook.  Economic development within our service territories remains robust, with Alabama seeing a 10-year high in jobs and capital investment announcements during the quarter, led by announcements from Hyundai, Novelis and Airbus. Additionally, recent electric vehicle plant announcements in Georgia from Hyundai and Rivian represent the largest economic development projects in the state's history. These 2 projects alone are expected to create nearly 16,000 jobs and over $10 billion of capital investment across the state.  As we highlighted last quarter, the Port of Savannah continues to show strength, with the container volume growth seen during the first quarter accelerating in the second quarter as a result of U.S. consumer demand and the diversion of vessels from other ports driving record cargo levels in June. We remain encouraged by the level of economic development within our service territories, and we continue to partner with each of our states to attract new businesses.  With our solid adjusted results through the first half of the year, we are well positioned as we head into the peak electric-load season. Our estimate for the third quarter of 2022 is $1.32 per share on an adjusted basis. And consistent with historical practice, we will address earnings for the year relative to our EPS guidance after the third quarter.  Before turning the call back over to Tom, I would like to briefly highlight Georgia Power's 2022 Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP, which was unanimously approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission last week. Recall, Georgia Power files an IRP every 3 years, outlining the company's plan to continue delivering clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to its 2.7 million customers over the next several decades. The approved plan includes the addition of 2,300 megawatts of new renewable resources as part of Georgia Power's long-term plan to double its renewable generation by adding an additional 6,000 megawatts by 2035. The plan also approves the addition of over 750 megawatts of battery energy storage projects, the retirement of over 1,500 megawatts of coal by 2028, and the continuation of existing grid investment in ash pond closure programs.  Additionally, the approved IRP continues Georgia Power's hydro modernization program and authorizes initiating a license renewal application for Plant Hatch, each of which will extend the lives of these important carbon-free energy resources for the benefit of customers. The expected capital expenditures associated with approval of the IRP are consistent with the capital plan that we laid out on the fourth quarter earnings call in February.  Tom, I'll now turn the call back to you. Yes. I think that's a great example of demobilization and scaffolding, temporary lighting is a similar example. Testing and surveillance activities and documentation, I think those are pretty obvious part of the finishing work, really gets to what Tom alluded to, but it's doing coatings, it is getting particularly containment to this pristine condition to get ready for fuel load. So it's those activities that, frankly, have a logical sequence to them, and it just takes time to work through. Yes. So just as a reminder for folks, we've done this for over a decade. And what we do a couple of times a year is bring in folks from regional universities, large financial institutions and then, frankly, a lot of representation from a cross sector -- or a cross-sector representation from our customer base. So we had railroads in the room. We had manufacturing companies, ones that get involved with housing. We had consumer goods across the board.  And to Tom's point, there was this backdrop of, yes, a recession is looming, but a very clear acknowledgment that what you may find yourself in is a place where there's very clear geographic or regional differences as you enter into that period and endure it. So Tom is right. Everything we're seeing provides a lot of tailwinds for us. We're in terrific shape. Things could certainly change. But everything we see now every indication, and if you look at Slide 10 of our deck and how sales manifested during the quarter relative to what we expected. We're in terrific shape. Resolute, a newspaper manufacturer that was in Georgia. No, I think we just see if Steve has any follow-ups. Yes. The one near-term data point, Julian, is there is an August 27 date by which we'll know whether MEAG plans to tender their portion is what we've heard from [indiscernible] and MEAG still needs to work through their process and let us send one way or the other. Yes. For all of our regulated utilities, they're always going to make the economic choice for customers and what the PTC does is make cell phone that much more economic. So I think our competitiveness has definitely improved if this goes through. Jeremy, this is Dan. So look, as we always do, we'll narrow down our year-end expectations during the third quarter call. It is clear that our year-to-date performance has positioned us really well to deliver strong results. But what it also does is position us really well to mitigate our operational and financial risk in future years.  So we're going to take every opportunity we have to fix the roof while the sun is shining, if you will. And if you look at our history of O&M spending in the electric business, there's almost never such a thing as a normal year. We build flexibility into our programs so that we can accelerate maintenance activities when we have higher-than-expected revenues from weather or customer growth or strong economic activity.  And then conversely, in those years, that inevitably happen where weather or economic activity are below our expectations or even recently a pandemic, we have the flexibility to curtail in those years knowing what we've done in years prior to get ready. Over time, this all balances out. And the system remains in great shape to serve customers, and our financial results are a lot less volatile than they might have otherwise been.  Additionally, and very importantly, many of our regulatory frameworks have backstops whereby better-than-expected results accrue to the benefits of our customers through the various rate or rebate mechanisms. So I would just say, stay tuned to the third quarter, but know that we're doing everything we can to improve and derisk future years. Yes, I was going to say, Michael, just along the same lines as what we've been talking about on the call around renewables and what this agreement with Manchin and Schumer may -- how that may benefit renewables something similar may be needed for RNG since you asked about that, to make it equally affordable for customers. Yes. I mean when you said material, it's hard to see it being material in the near term. Yes. Look, we are where we were, but the reason we put out a range, Nick, is because there's -- it was 3 years away, and there's a lot of moving parts. So, look, you see what's happening around inflation and interest rates. You see that we've got a significant regulatory calendar ahead of us. We recognized that there was a lot of uncertainty. And as those things get buttoned up, and we get closer to 2024, we'll narrow in on exactly where within that range we are. Yes, Durgesh, again, we don't want to get ahead of any of the process. There is a calendar in the slide deck, Slide 25. So really, the process will start in earnest in mid-September with hearings. And yes, we still expect a decision by the September. I think the only other thing I would say is just as a reminder, this rate case is largely a continuation of all the elements of the 2019 rate case. It is carrying a lot of those same capital initiatives forward. It's not Vogtle. It's 2019, 3 years later. Yes. Again, so qualifying this, Paul, this is Dan. As it's 700 pages to get through and understand the details, and this is based on our high-level review of similar provisions in BBB. The legislation essentially sets an economic floor for nuclear plants. And so when you have a regulated nuclear plant that operates in a constructive jurisdiction and is recovering its costs on a regular basis, it's unlikely to truly benefit from something that's intended for troubled financially nuclear units."

            "name": "Thomas Fanning",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted earnings results for the second quarter, meaningfully ahead of the estimate provided last quarter. The economies within our Southeast service territories remain strong, and we believe we are well positioned to achieve our financial objectives for 2022.  Before turning the call over to Dan for a more detailed look at our financial performance, I'd first like to provide an update on the recent progress at Plant Vogtle units 3 and 4. The projected completion timeline forecast for both units remains within the ranges we provided the last 2 quarters, although at the end of those ranges. At Unit 3, we continue to progress with all necessary systems turned over from construction to testing, all inspection records related to ITAACs complete and then submittal of 51 ITAACs since our last earnings call, including 2, which were just filed this morning. 2 ITAACs remain outstanding.  Concurrent with our final ITAACs submittals, we plan to submit the all ITAAC complete letter to the NRC for Unit 3. This submittal should position us for receipt of the historic 103G finding from the NRC a few weeks later, documenting that license acceptance criteria for Unit 3 have been met. Upon receipt of the 103G finding from the NRC, no further NRC findings are necessary for Southern Nuclear to load fuel or begin the startup up sequence.  Receiving the 13G letter is an important milestone, but there's still more work to do before we load fuel. In the weeks ahead, we will be focusing on testing and surveillance, demobilization, finishing work and documentation. To support an in-service date at the end of the first quarter of 2023, we will need to complete this work and load fuel by the end of October.  Turning to Unit 4. Direct construction is now approximately 96% complete and progress continues in advance of cold hydro testing and hot functional testing. Electrical production, in particular, electrical terminations continues to be a key area of focus. We continue to add resources on site for this work, and we have a plan for transitioning electrical field engineers from Unit 3 as we continue our focus on increasing productivity and ensuring first quality first times to support the upcoming testing and long-term operations.  Timely Unit 3 fuel load and start-up, along with a sustained improvement in Unit 4 electrical production over the next several months is necessary to support our December 2023 in-service objective.  Moving now to cost. At the end of the second quarter, Georgia Power recorded an after-tax charge of $39 million, including replenishment of contingency and estimated incremental co-owner sharing impacts. Contingency allocated during the quarter is primarily related to procurement activities for remediation and a revised resource plan for Unit 4 that reflects updated productivity assumptions and the planned increase in craft and support resources.  We're excited about the progress that we've seen at the site over the last several months and look forward to the transition of Unit 3 from construction to operations in the weeks ahead.  Dan, I'll turn the call over to you. Thanks, Dan. For more than 5 decades, Southern Company's world-class research and development organization has remained at the forefront of innovation to build the future of energy today. I'd like to take a moment to highlight a couple of recent R&D announcements. Last month, Georgia Power and Mitsubishi Power, along with the Electric Power Research Institute, successfully blended 20% hydrogen fuel at Georgia Power's Plant, McDonagh, representing the world's largest hydrogen fuel blending demonstration project to date on an advanced-class gas turbine. This demonstration project helped pave the way for long-term clean and carbon-free use for existing natural gas-generating infrastructure.  Additionally, in Alabama, Southern Company continues to manage the National Carbon Capture Center for the Department of Energy, which recently surpassed 128,000 hours of testing, and has expanded its focus on advancing carbon capture for natural gas-powered generation, carbon utilization and technology-enhanced solutions such as direct air capture. In fact, a low-carbon concrete technology developed by Carbon XPRIZE winner, UCLA and CarbonBuilt, recently achieved its first commercialization deal bolstered by successful testing at the center. We are proud of the legacy created by our R&D group over the last 50 years and look forward to continuing this important work for many years to come.  In closing, I'd like to take a moment to highlight Southern Company's generating fleet and power delivery system, which performed exceedingly well through June's extremely hot weather. During what was the second hottest June in 50 years, we were able to maintain sufficient generating capacity reserves across daily peaks, including 6 days, which peaked over 40,000 megawatts, and an all-time peak load of 41,376 megawatts on June 15.  Delivering these results requires effective long-term planning that is best facilitated in a vertically integrated, state-regulated markets, coupled with real-time coordination between our plants and our system operators. And I'd be remiss if I didn't recognize the performance of our covered workers who, once again, performed during these times of duress in an exemplary manner. I'm proud of our team's continued outstanding performance during times when our customers need us the most.  Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we're now ready to take questions. Shar, you hit the nail on the head. My overarching comment here is that our long-term strategy as a system remains robust and strong commitment to net-zero by 2050 is in place. I think the beauty of how we work with the commission and the staff and, frankly, all of our stakeholders is something that allows us to respond to the kind of exogenous factors that really impact us from a tactical standpoint. Obviously, fuel markets have changed, inflation has changed, supply chains have changed. And so I think the wisdom of the commission in this case is perfectly warranted in pushing that decision forward.  I don't want to certainly prejudge what we don't know at this point. But I will say the 2 options you outlined are very reasonable. One, is to think about keeping generation in the northern part of our state. You know that our big load sync is Atlanta. And so the Bowen unit historically have played a really important part in kind of balancing the load between North and South.  Were we to continue to shut down those units, you would need to think about replacement. Obviously, gas is an option North. More renewables North could play a role. As you know, our big answer on renewables across the system is most likely solar, not wind, just we don't have the climate to do widespread wind. And maybe these tall turbines will come to fruition or not, who knows.  So failing that, putting more solar in the south part of the state with a much better terrain does make sense. In order to locate more generation in the state in order to balance the needs in the North, we'll need to build significant transmission. The beauty of our market structure here is we are allowed to iterate among and between generation and transmission as an optimal portfolio solution. The so-called organized markets have difficulty doing that. So this is a topic of conversation. I think we'll handle it in the future. Yes. I would hate to say that. You would love to say that. Yes, right, right. If we don't either. We're guiding you all to say that we feel comfortable within the range that we've laid out, I guess, 2 calls ago. Let's say the schedule calls for completion by end of March 23. Here's kind of where we are. We have 2 ITAACs remaining, not 4. And I believe we'll finish those in days, not weeks. I think these things are reasonably imminent. Then we'll file concurrently for the letter requesting the 103G, letter to be issued by the NRC. We think the NRC has plenty of capability to handle that within their time frame, which I think is we've laid out at a max of 17 days.  Really, I think the greater pacing factor to fuel load is now not ITAACs, it is the rest of the work we need to finish on our own to begin fuel load and then begin the initial operation of the plant. As I mentioned before, and Dan can help me here, too, there are 4 kind of big categories we're thinking about in terms of the scope of that work. One is demobilization. The second is testing and surveillance. The third is just finishing the work that we already have in place. And then the final one we've talked to you about is documentation, getting the paper right.  Simple examples of some of those things, demobilization is taking down things like scaffolding, and taking any of the spare parts that we have laying around the site and moving those off so that, at the end of the day, the work rooms and everything within Unit 3 will meet nuclear standards in terms of operations.  Dan, do you want to add anything else there? And now is the time to do that work. There's nothing unusual about the work ahead, we needed to finish the safety-related ITAAC, and now we finish that stuff. Look, the whole exciting transition we have here is moving this plant from transition to operations, and we have line of sight to that now. Yes, sure. You bet. Let me give you the -- it's all good. Let me go back to what I said before. I never say it wouldn't happen. I said the deal physics were hard. And let's just kind of replay the cards as we've worked relentlessly on the hill, whether it's Congress or in the administration and, frankly, our stakeholder groups, environmental, et cetera, the deal physics were getting tough because we were entering this period of inflation. And I won't say senator Manchin had his eye on inflation a long time before a lot of other people did.  And so the idea of spending more money in light of inflation pressures, and I guess the latest announcement was 9% or so, is really something that is concerning. And so the way that you get to promote this kind of bill is to include within it, pay-fors that will offset whatever inflationary pressures may arise from the increased spending. And as you can see from the proposal right now, and let's leave it as a proposal, there's an additional, I don't know, $300 billion of pay-fors. So hopefully, it speaks to the need to not make this an additional log on the inflationary fire.  The second kind of interesting exogenous variable is a specter of a recession. And I think what has been concerning many people is that adding taxes at this time may be another domino to fall that may increase your likelihood of entering into a recession. Now we've just heard this morning that the United States is in technical recession that is 2 GDP quarters negative in growth. But if you look at our numbers, and I leave this to Dan or whatever, who kind of did a nice summary in the script, we're not seeing any indicators of recession right now. But certainly, the historic numbers that bring us up to date for the quarter are way better than what we expected.  Further, when you look at the data Dan referenced with respect to our headlights, if you will, our economic development activity, you're talking over 300% of job growth in the backlog, and you're talking nearly 700% of capital investment. And you're talking about things like Rivian and you're talking about more EV development, and you're talking about data centers. We don't see the specter of a recession right now.  Now I'd like for Dan to comment a little bit. He does his economic roundtable, just got through with it. Other people are seeing some reasons to be cautious. And maybe that's cautious in the first part of 2023, Dan, why don't you give us a burst on the roundtable. And even those industrial results, Dan, included 2 pretty big plant closures, one Olin Chemical and the other one was... And so absent those guys, [indiscernible], I mean, it would have been certainly higher than 3.7%. The momentum numbers look good. So we just don't -- the data doesn't support a recession, all right? Now we raised the issue on the last call in light of the recession that there may be the likelihood of a national recession where the Southeast remains robust and growing. So we just don't see that right now.  Now, I will say, we do see inflation and particularly in the food and energy markets, and that hurts our customers. So this is not an environment without duress? And it's those factors, I would say, inflation and potential for recession and what the other exogenous variables may be? I mean, what is the future of Ukraine? And what is the unwinding of the supply chain from and how will that visit the United States in the future are all key variables.  What has changed a bit has been this narrative of, are we really in a technical recession? Does that really reflect the strength of the economy? There's pretty good arguments on each side. I would argue that the Southeast, given our strong foundation, is going to be better able to weather this than many places else in the United States.  I think the conclusion of the people that have come up with this legislation is also that this is an inflationary by its structure and the tax increases, which don't impact us very much, and I'll speak to some of the pieces of this legislation and how in respect Southern, probably aren't going to be enough to tip very further into recessionary territory. They tend to believe more of the qualitative not the quantitative story.  With respect to Southern, good having -- this looks really good. When you look at the energy security and climate change pieces of the legislation, the $369 billion or so, it's very helpful to us. You know that the move from investment tax credit or production tax credits is very favorable. To us, our favorite kind of renewable over the years, we call it one time, we were the largest owner of solar in the United States. We've recycled some capital. I never particularly like having to live off the ITC characteristics. So moving to PTC is really a good thing.  And when you look at the Georgia IRP, solar plays an important part in our future. So that's really good start. Recall also our R&D for storage. We've already mentioned our importance of carbon capture science. So the 45Q credits are great.  Here's the big thing, though. If I had to write a headline on all of those benefits, I would say that this is really beneficial to our customers and should reduce the cost of the transition from the fleet today to the net-zero long-term strategy in the future. There are some other things in there that are kind of attractive. The tax credits in there for purchase of electric vehicles, whether they're used or new. There're some other things in there for hydrogen, a variety of other things.  So what about the negatives? What about the pay-fors? If you look at kind of the list of that leading the charts is this 15% corporate minimum book tax. I'll probably leave this for the guys in the boiler room after the call, but I am prepared, Steve, with examples that will show you that the difference between tax taxes and book taxes to us is almost nothing.  A company as big as ours with $23 billion of revenue and all that other stuff, the difference is in taxes paid is just really small like 0.5% kind of as an estimate. It's almost you can't see it, $5 million, $10 million. It's almost nothing. Now of course, as that travels over time depends on a host of factors. But to us, this alternative book tax just doesn't have a material impact to the company, okay?  It will be interesting to see what happens on the prescription drug pricing reform and some of these other things. I just don't have enough there. And everything I should say should be underscored with the admonition that we really haven't been through the 700-page document as thoroughly as we will. What we're giving you are our first thoughts on what it appears to be to us. Dan, do you want to say anything there? I think Sinema becomes a really important person now. I don't know how involved she has been so far on the creation of this agreement, frankly, between Manchin and Schumer. So her sense of this is going to be extremely important. And I know she's been very hawkish on raising taxes. So we'll see.  In the house, let's not even put that in the wind column just yet because I know that a lot of the House Democrats have had a lot of, I don't know, requests, desires for a change in tax policy, including things like a surtax on the wealthy, including SALT relief, the state and local tax relief. There's no additional taxes on small businesses. So there's a lot on the Democrat side in the house that's not in this bill, that still has to be negotiated. So we'll see how that goes. Yes. Julian, I don't think we expect anything in the near term there. I think, as this plays out, I wouldn't be surprised to move to business court in Georgia, and the resolution could be second half of '23. I don't think we'll know anything in the near term. Yes, man, certainly, going to the PTC, certainly makes it more competitive, more attractive for our operating companies to own this stuff. So that's really helpful. We're all in. And of course, Southern Power can compete for the new megawatts of particularly solar in the state. So on the margin, everything that we see in this potential settlement looks good for us. We're very happy with it. I would also say that we have been engaged in conversations in this. Like I say, I mean, with the administration, with any stakeholder, with Congress for months. So to the extent they arrived at a resolution, is it surprising? I don't know. I think it depends on how you view this inflation versus recession pressure issue. The pay fors certainly speak to the inflation. And I think the judgment on the ability of the United States economy to withstand the tax increases is really what's going to get us over the line. I just think, on the margin, this is good stuff for us. It sure does. In general, a lot of that goes to compensation. I think we're top decile. We measure ourselves all the time. And so the compensation issues are pretty well spoken for. I think you always have kind of a worry that as you finish conclusion of work that people will start leaving and go to other more sustained work. We're keeping our eye on that, and we think we have that spoken for. We measure our churn statistics virtually every day, report every week, and they're within our expectations right now. We are adding people to the site with relative ease.  I think the interesting issue there will be, you may remember us talking a lot about attracting electricians. We're able to do that now. I think the more important point for us is as we wrap up work on 3, it frees people from 3 to move to 4.  And it's not just folks that will do particularly these electrical termination. We're ramping that up in a big way. It's engineering and supervisory people that will make the increase in people on Unit 4 more efficient. Those are necessary to achieve the ramp-up schedule that we expect to see, oh, I don't know, over the next 10 to 12 weeks or so.  So that really is it. I think it's this idea of advancing on 3, freeing people up, moving those resources to 4 and increasing our productivity. Settlement is always an option, but, boy, we don't want to get in front of that horse. We'll just let it go. As you may remember, the official schedule calls for prudence to begin on fuel load for Unit 4. And we kind of expect that in what summer next year.  So that's the official date to have a prudence hearing or begin that process. Yes, we could settle in advance of that, but I'm not going to front-run that issue here. No, I mean just a little bit of clarity to that, too. It's inescapable. We're way ahead of where we thought we would be. I mean we, what, $0.37 up on the first 6 months. We're not going to be $0.37 over at the end of the year, right? That's what Dan is trying to say. I mean, I'd be disappointed if we weren't improved in the range or whatever. But we're just sticking with our practice of really giving you the firm guidance on our range in the next earnings call. But the performance so far -- Yes, we're doing great. Yes, it's slim. I think that language was designed to help plants under duress. Ours haven't been under duress. So I don't think it's a big deal. And recall that we already have production tax credits in place for Vogtle 3 and 4. So really, the application of Vogtle 1 and 2 fairly are hatch slim to none. That's our view right now. Yes. You know what, but, I think that while some people have been breathlessly optimistic about hydrogen and I would argue we're doing the most research and the most kind of real money behind our words. We think hydrogen has a great place, particularly in blending with kind of methane fuels as we're demonstrating here in McIntosh. And then as we're looking at with the new plant that we may be building in Alabama to blend hydrogen, those are great applications, and we like them, okay? But I think the real issue in terms of near-term impact is going to be the classic chicken or the egg. Who's going to generate the hydrogen, and how do we move it?  Now we are doing also a lot of research on the gas side. So we're looking at, as we add safety-related pipeline replacement programs in Southern Gas, is it suitable to think about moving hydrogen through those facilities. We're certainly thinking about that. Dan, I don't know. We need to dive through the material. We're kind of looking at each other, going I don't know. Yes. I really think hydrogen is a good idea, but it's probably in the 30s. We gave a lot of thought to that. We provided the guidance plus 3 months, plus 6 months. And as we look at the progress on 3, that has a lot to say about 4, okay? And let me give you an example. So as we begin fuel load and start-up of 3, the same kind of personnel that will be devoted to that activity will also be devoted to HFT in Unit 4. There can be overlap there, particularly, say, in the second half of start-up, maybe the last 25% of start-up. So let's just take a calendar. We've suggested that we could have fuel load before October. So that's -- and that would permit by March.  If the same personnel are starting to get freed up in the second half by February, by January, somewhere in there, that would suggest you could accelerate hot functional test on 4 from the calendar that we're showing you on Page 6. So all we're trying to say is the timing of 3 has a lot to do with the timing of 4.  And to the extent we're successful on accelerating 3 prior to March, or have the people available at the end of startup of 3 prior to March, we can start hot functional testing sooner than the critical path we indicate on Page 6. That really is, I think, what is mostly behind our comments on schedule right now. Well, I mean I almost describe it this way. I think we got line of sight on 3. I think we have reasonable expectations on 4. We admit that there's lots of variables on 4. We'll certainly keep you abreast of those developments as they occur. Right now, we believe we're reasonably comfortable within the ranges. We are expecting an improvement in productivity on 4. So we'll be watching that in the very near term. We'll have more to say about that certainly next quarter. Yes. But I think we're still within the range. The biggest change, I guess, Dan, that we see of interest rates, particularly cost of -- interest costs at the parent. But we'll certainly update that at our year-end earnings call. But I would say that it is a range, and Dan mentioned, we'll tell you where we are within the range. I don't see any reason to change it now. But within that expectation as a result of the Georgia rate case, anything to do with the economy, a recession, a host of variables. But everything we know right now, we're still within the range. I think -- I'm giving you a complete judgment here, not fact, all right? My judgment would say that it's been so hard to get to this place. And there are still uncertainties out there, as I mentioned in response to Steven Fleishman's question. You don't have SALT relief in here. You don't have a surtax on the wealthy individuals in America.  There are things here that so many people wanted this thing -- and [indiscernible], there are still many unknowns as to whether we can get this across the finish line. This is a great thing for us, and I broadly would say for the industry. Adding something else at this point, I think, is a bridge too far, in my opinion.  And I think, the inside the beltway people are kind of talking to each other with the frame of mind that don't let the perfect get in the way of the good. This is pretty good, and we hope it crosses the finish line. What I'd add, reference the NERC report that warned the industry that half of the United States would be under duress with our energy future. And then you're stressed further by this unusual weather we're having, whether that's part of climate change, et cetera, the tails appear to be flatter, our system has performed beautifully. And I think, given our relative price position in the United States, given the resilience of our system, I think the decisions of the commission in the past and the company had been excellent in respect to benefiting customers long term here in the Southeast.  And it's no secret why a lot of data centers in some of these big economic development projects, Rivian and others, are coming because of the price, because of the resilience, because of the long-term stability. Having this kind of constructive regulatory environment benefits long term the economic growth of the Southeast and that continues to look very robust. I don't see any reason why it would change at this point. No, I mean, I think you're absolutely making a good point. I'm telling you it's good for us. There will certainly be people in America that don't like this. I think NAM has already come out and said that this really hurt some of the people in manufacturing in the industry and you kind of expect this. Well, if it's good for us, who isn't it good for, and they certainly will weigh in.  And we'll see what impact that has. It is -- it must be at least a zero-sum game in order to be positive to the scorecard in Congress. So we're not hurt by it, other people are. I fully expect that it will provide headwinds to getting it done. We'll see if it's enough to sway some votes. I don't know. Yes. This is an exciting time, isn't it? We've had a wonderful quarter. We've made great progress on the ITAAC. My sense is these, next 2 will be done in a matter of days, not months or weeks. And son of a gun, we're poised to turn this thing over to operations and look forward to fuel and so forth, that will remove a great deal of risk, I think, from our portfolio going away. But that does not mean that risk is done. We still have to complete the work necessary to fuel load. We still have to improve particularly our performance in electrical, particularly in the terminations area. We believe we have reason to expect that performance to actually happen. We'll know reasonably soon whether that's true or not.  So look, I think we're as well poised as we can be. Dan mentioned the blessing of the good performance that we've had to date, $0.27 over versus our own estimate, gives us the flexibility to deal with problems in the future, including rate pressure. So I like our cards here. I like the cards that are shown by the robust performance of the Southeast economy relative to the national economy.  I know you all have to make your bets, and we have to do the same in terms of allocating capital. I think the allocation of capital from our own sense to our business model and going forward in this manner is really attractive.  So thank you all for joining us this afternoon. Look forward to our next call in October. See you soon."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Kelly, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Southern Company First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Investor Relations Director. Please go ahead, sir.\nScott Gammill: Thank you, Kelly. Good afternoon and welcome to Southern Company’s first quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining me today are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Dan Tucker, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you we’ll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Qs, and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I’ll turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Fanning: Thank you, Scott. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted earnings results for the first quarter ahead of our estimates. The economies within our Southeast service territories are among the best in the United States and we believe we are well-positioned to achieve our financial objectives for 2022. Before turning the call over to Dan for a more detailed look at our financial performance, I will first provide an update on recent progress at Plant Vogtle units 3 and 4. Importantly, the projected completion timeline and capital cost forecast for both units are unchanged from the updates that we provided last quarter. Since that time, we've seen sustained progress consistent with our expectations for each unit. The NRC completed its follow-up inspection this week and issued its final supplemental report. The inspection verified that Southern Nuclear effectively implemented the corrective actions and remediation efforts at the site. No additional findings were identified during the follow-up inspection and the findings identified last year have been closed. With this step complete, the Vogtle site returns to the baseline inspection program. Let's focus now on Unit 3. We continue to progress towards receipt of the NRC's 103G letter. All necessary systems have been turned over from construction to testing, and nearly all the inspection records necessary for submission of the remaining ITAAC are now complete. Associated with this progress, 70 ITAAC were submitted to the NRC since our last earnings call and 53 ITAAC remain. Of these remaining ITAAC, the last 30 to 40 are expected to be completed just prior to submitting the all ITAAC complete letter to the NRC in support of the 103G letter. Considering our progress over the last two months, we have provided an updated ITAAC completion schedule. Following receipt of the 103G letter from the NRC and as Unit 3 continues its transformation from construction to operations, our efforts will be focused on completing the remaining inspection records, system turnovers and the necessary preoperational and component test required to load fuel later this year. Turning to Unit 4. Direct construction is now approximately 94% complete. Unit 4 continues to make progress in advance of cold hydro testing and hot functional testing. We believe we have the resources we need on site for Unit 4 and have a clear plan for transitioning additional personnel from Unit 3 as we continue our focus on increasing productivity and ensuring first-time quality. Overall, construction completion has averaged 0.9% per month since the start of the year, supportive of a September 2023 in-service and ahead of the 0.4% average projected to be needed through the year-end to achieve a December 2023 in-service date. For electrical production specifically, progress on Unit 4 is meeting our current expectations. However, electrical production will need to increase to support our projected in-service dates. The schedule changes announced last year required Vogtle 3 and 4 owners to affirmatively vote to proceed with the project, which, in late February, they unanimously voted to do. This decision underscores the importance of the 2,200 megawatts of baseload carbon-free energy, which will be vital to increasing the availability of net zero resources for customers across the state. We value our partners on Vogtle 3 and 4 and the relationships that we have had with them across multiple endeavors for decades. We look forward to our continued partnership as we work to bring Vogtle units 3 and 4 safely online, providing Georgia with a reliable, carbon-free energy resource for the next 60 to 80 years. We are pleased with the progress at the site over the past few months and incredibly proud of the entire team at Vogtle units 3 and 4 for their relentless commitment to completing this important project safely and with the utmost quality. Dan, I'll now turn the call over to you.\nDan Tucker: Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom mentioned, we had a very strong start to the year. Our adjusted EPS for the first quarter of 2022 was $0.97, $0.01 lower than last year and $0.07 above our estimate. The primary driver for the variance to last year was higher non-fuel O&M, which reflects a trend towards more normal operating conditions relative to significantly reduced levels during the first quarter of 2021 and then largely offset by constructive state regulatory actions and robust customer growth at our state-regulated utilities. When looking at adjusted EPS compared to our estimate for the quarter, the main drivers were continued strong customer growth and cost control. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted quarterly results as compared to 2021 is included in today's release and earnings package. Turning now to retail sales in the economy. In the first quarter, weather normal retail sales were approximately 1% higher than first quarter 2021. This increase reflects stronger commercial and industrial sales from the continued economic recovery in our service territories, somewhat offset by lower residential sales as schools and businesses continue to transition from remote environments to hybrid or in-person modes throughout the quarter. We also continue to see robust customer growth with the addition of nearly 11,000 residential electric customers and over 7,000 residential gas customers during the quarter. This level of customer growth is driven by a strong labor market recovery and our Southeast service territories are expected to reach pre-pandemic levels of employment later this year. Additionally, the Port of Savannah, which is the fourth largest port in the nation and a major contributor to jobs and economic growth in Georgia, experienced a 3% year-over-year increase in container volumes in the first quarter of 2022, ahead of 2021's record pace as elevated US consumer demand continues to drive record cargo levels. Recent figures from the Georgia Port Authority also signaled that congestion is easing with only a handful of ships currently at anchor outside of the Port of Savannah, down from a peak of around 30 in mid-September of last year. Additionally, the recent approval of the Garden City Terminal West expansion is expected to increase the Port of Savanna's annual capacity by more than 15% by the end of 2024. The economic development pipeline in our service territories remains robust. In the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter last year, economic development announcements in our regulated electric service territory saw a 168% increase in payroll additions and a 66% increase in business investment, respectively. The first quarter closed with 230 active projects in the pipeline for the State of Georgia alone, which is well-above historical averages and new job additions in Georgia exceeded 7,000, an all-time high for the first quarter of the year. We remain encouraged by the economic trends that we are seeing as we continue to monitor the implications of supply chain constraints, labor force participation and inflationary pressures on our outlook. And I have two final topics before turning the call back over to Tom. First, for the second quarter, our adjusted EPS estimate is $0.80 per share; and second, I'd like to highlight our recent dividend increase announcement. Earlier this month, the Southern Company Board of Directors approved an $0.08 per share increase in our common dividend, raising our annualized rate to $2.72 per share. This action marks the 21st consecutive annual increase and for three quarters of the century dating back to 1948, Southern Company has paid a dividend that was equal to, or greater than the previous year. This remarkable track record reinforces Southern Company as a premier sustainable investment. And as we mentioned on our last call, we believe once Vogtle 3 and 4 are completed, our Board will have the opportunity to consider accelerating the rate of dividend growth, further supporting our objective of providing superior risk-adjusted total shareholder return to investors. Tom, I'll now turn the call back over to you.\nTom Fanning: Thanks, Dan. Sustainability has always been a top priority for Southern Company. In recent years, our plans and progress have received heightened interest from our investors, customers, communities, employees and other stakeholders. We have a long, strong history of constructive engagement with all stakeholders and we are excited about the recent release of a dedicated sustainability website, which provides additional transparency on core environmental, social and governance topics. This new site highlights the tremendous work underway across our company to help us reach our sustainability and business objectives, as we seek to build the future of energy. Additionally, just this week, we published a report outlining our just transition principles and look to continue enhancing our disclosures. We know that stakeholders are increasingly interested in information related to our sustainability efforts, and we remain committed to open and transparent communication. In closing, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the great job that employees throughout Southern Company do each and every day. National Lineman Appreciation Day, which was observed this month, specifically recognizes the important contribution of line workers and those supporting them to our country from. From extreme heat to bitter cold to answering the call of those that need thousands of miles away for days and weeks at a time, the hard work and unwavering dedication that these men and women display, day in and day out is truly inspirational. Moreover, last month, the Edison Electric Institute and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers presented the prestigious Edwin D. Hill Award to Alabama Power and the IBEW System Council U-19. Through the National Utility Industry Training Fund and the electrical training ALLIANCE, Alabama Power and the IBEW are providing current and prospective employees with the appropriate training necessary to install and maintain the fiber infrastructure that enables grid automation and resiliency and improve community access to broadband. It is an honor to receive this award, and we remain committed to continued support and investment in our workforce to ensure that our employees have the skills and training needed to successfully meet the ever-evolving needs of the customers that we have the privilege to serve. Thank you in joining us this afternoon. Operator, we are now ready to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. You may proceed with your question.\nTom Fanning: Shar, how are you? Shar, are you there? Are you on mute? If you do, you owe us $20. Operator, I don't hear Shar. You want to go to the next question?\nOperator: Yes, certainly, one moment. Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. You may proceed with your question.\nTom Fanning: Hey Julien.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Thanks for the time and opportunity. Appreciate it. Thanks for comments too. So just on Unit 4, I just wanted to talk a little bit about productivity here. How is that trending versus historical and your own expectations? And then more specifically, if you can, just given all the comments about inflation and specifically the labor environment, what exactly are you seeing there? And just both on the availability of literally being able to get feel and then is the cost of those individuals?\nTom Fanning: Yes. I think simply, Dan can fill in some blanks here. But Unit 4 remains on-track with our expectations. We are consistent with our expected timeframes and budgets, all good in that regard. I think we gave you the data that suggests that the 0.9% kind of average monthly increase in construction is consistent with a September timeframe and is, in advance of better than the 0.4% that we need to hit the year-end. So that's your three-to-six-month stuff.  Importantly, as we said in the script, I just want to make sure you know, all of our production for Unit 4 is consistent with our expectations. We are moving people from 3 to 4. And so, we expect their productivity and their production to increase overtime. So consistent with our estimates we need to increase. We have plans to move people over to effectuate that increase. With respect to the inflation and pay, we frankly went over that here getting ready for this call. We believe we're still top decile pay for the Southeast, and we feel like most of that risk is behind us. Dan, do you want to add anything else?\nDan Tucker: Yes. The only thing I'd add -- you hit on this briefly, but we do have a very detailed plan for transitioning, particularly the electric craft from Unit 3 to Unit 4 as we go through this process. And then as you'd expect us to do, we're certainly applying every lesson learned from Unit 3 to Unit 4, and that will also factor into our ability to increase productivity.\nTom Fanning: One last point there. Attrition is at normal levels. So it's progressing as we expected.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Thank you, guys. And then just if you can comment here on the tender timeline with the co-owners, that looks like it's coming up here in mid-June and mid-August. How should we think about the timing for resolution of the disagreements around the baseline costs, COVID cost, before that window opens in the middle? How will that resolution be communicated? And what are your expectations today?\nDan Tucker: Julien, I don't want to dive too deep into this. That's a conversation that frankly just needs to take place in the right form with us and our co-owners. As Tom mentioned in our prepared remarks, these are partners that go back with us decades and we have a track record of resolving any sort of disagreements constructively. We'll let this play out over the course of the year. The timeline you referenced it was a 180-day clock that started back in March just to, kind of formalize that. That's certainly a backdrop to these discussions. But let's let that play out on its own throughout the rest of the year.\nTom Fanning: Yes. And you should know that this is not a discrete kind of engagement we have with our co-owners. I was with them last week at the site. You should view us as having a real-time conversation here. Anything else, Julien?\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: I got more, but I'll let other folks jump in here. But thank you, guys.\nTom Fanning: All right. Feel free to jump back in, if you like. Thank you for joining us.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Good luck, guys.\nTom Fanning: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. You may proceed with your question.\nTom Fanning: Hey, Steve.\nSteve Fleishman: Hi, everybody. Hi, Tom. Hi, Dan.\nTom Fanning: Let me -- before you get to your call, I just want to complement you on your call to action here. I thought that was really well done. Good job. I'll share that with our folks as well.\nSteve Fleishman: Of course. So now that you brought that up, I'm curious if anybody is actually -- if you're hearing anything out of D.C. that would suggest that anybody actually might listen and act on, I guess, BBB slim down or other -- just energy policy.\nTom Fanning: Well, I'm sure you didn't see my little comment on Squat Box this morning. But I think one of the headlines out of the media was essentially unleashing -- let me just make sure I get it here, the United States needs to unleash the American energy economy. We have been having conversations with people like Gene McCarthy and Secretary of Energy, Jennifer Granholm and others. Listen, this is a constant conversation. Senator mentioned I think, has lots of good ideas. I think the challenge that we see in D.C. right now is essentially deal service. How do we get the right number of people to agree on the right number of issues and get it done in a time frame that is enough in advance of the November elections to be constructive. Listen, I think people get the issue and Steve, now more than ever. When we see Russia weaponized its energy policy, it's time for the United States to take action.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. I hope they do. So second question, just maybe related, you're one of the companies that still has a pretty good mix of gas, still some coal, renewables, nuclear and just -- I know you have that data set that you put in your slide deck on just showing the mix and you had pretty consistent metrics a little more renewables, even though gas has moved up a lot in price. So maybe you could just give some color on just why not seeing more switching away from gas. \nTom Fanning: Well, I think – I think it’s a little…\nSteve Fleishman: We see more call…\nTom Fanning: Yes, man. This may be -- I don't know the full data set for our industry. But we've always had this constructive relationship with our state regulators. And a long time ago, we put in a place -- put in place hedging programs. And so in effect, I'm going to say about -- and Dan correct me, about 30% of our natural gas consumption was hedged at about $3 per million Btu. So when you think about the dispatch curves, they're probably better than what you might have expected because of that hedging program. And of course, as we pointed out, lots of times over decades, all of these benefits accrue to our customers. We make no profit percentage off of any of this. Dan, anything else?\nDan Tucker: Yeah, a couple of things. So one thing that is occurring, Steve, is we are being a little conservative might be the right word in terms of looking towards our peak season in the summer in our electric business and just making sure that we're holding on to enough coal there as well. So there are times when we're we might have otherwise switched the coal but because we're looking ahead. And what's behind that, and I think you may have touched on a little bit of this in your report, transportation of energy is one of the things that is certainly a hot topic. And frankly, we don't have enough of. People talk a lot about natural gas pipes on coal, it's obviously with the rails. And with the lack of available personnel and other things, rails are having to reprioritize their own train sets and personnel and frankly, coal is not at the top of their list right now. And so we're just having to be thoughtful about how we do that.\nTom Fanning: The good news there is that the flagship, if you will, of our coal units is Plant Miller in Alabama. It is the cheapest best controlled plant, it has plenty of coal for the summer. So that one is in good shape. The other thing that I just want to make sure people here loud and clear. In no way does this negatively impact our long-term objective of achieving net-zero by 2050. You have to understand that long-term strategy should be robust and be able to manage the exogenous factors that change our plan day-to-day. Mike Tyson, you have a plan until you get hit in the face and then what happens. Certainly, the tactics will vary depending upon what's happening in the worldwide energy market. But our long-term strategy remains intact.\nSteven Fleishman: Great. One last question separately on Vogtle. And so when you made the update at year-end to the schedules, it mainly seem to be related to the paperwork issues with the electrical contracting, which seems to be getting resolved. So other than that issue, is there anything else that we should be most focused on in terms of getting to the goal line of fuel load?\nTom Fanning: Yeah, you bet. So if you – if I could change your question, but it's a similar question. What am I most worried about right now on Vogtle 3 in particular? I would say that the ITAAC situation looks pretty manageable if you just do the math that we gave you, 53 remaining ITAAC and you think about needing 30 to 40 to finish, that effort that will occur in a fairly lumpy fashion right as we file the request for the 103G letter. It looks pretty manageable. And so my sense is the ITAAC situation getting to 103G always hard. We take nothing for granted. Certainly, there's a variable in time and how we're going to do those things. But I think that looks like it's in pretty good shape. I am more worried now about the work that has to happen between today and fuel load. Now that covers a lot of different things, they're not nearly as kind of nuclear safety related as the 103G obviously are. But it would include things like, and I'm just giving you a sample, but the fuel transfer system, aligning the electric buses throughout the plant, general demobilization efforts, things like removing temporary lighting and putting in permanent lighting, removing scaffolding, closing the rooms, cleaning them and closing them, getting ready for a pristine operating condition. So that's a lot of stuff that still has to happen. I think, a few system turnovers for that. I think two left. There's just more work to be done. I think that is more of the critical path right now than probably 103G. And then the next thing that I would say, I worry about will be from fuel load to operation, just thinking about fully operating the kind of follow-on steam cycle and making sure that the digital controls are integrated together, as well as they can be. Those are the big things in my mind right now. Dan, do you want to say something?\nDan Tucker: Yes. I think it's important to understand, as you hear Tom describe what necessary to get the fuel load and the things we're focused on there, that is largely concurrent work with the work we're doing to get to 103G. It's not sequential. It's not get to on first and then to the other. We're doing those things on parallel paths.\nTom Fanning: Yes. And that's what I tried to be pointing and say now to fuel load. And the other thing that we have done, we brought a guy to the site, Pete Sena, who is our Chief Nuclear Officer, he runs our fleet. And so, we've added another senior member to the team, as we think about moving from a construction environment to an operating environment.\nSteve Fleishman: Great. I remember him from PSEG. Great. Thank you.\nTom Fanning: Thanks, Steve. He is terrific. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. You may proceed with your question.\nTom Fanning: Hey Angie, always glad to have you with us.\nAngie Storozynski: Thank you. Thanks for having me. So, I'm just wondering if you could give us any sense of what to expect from the upcoming rate case in Georgia and also how this new commodity price environment might have changed the perception of your nuclear plant under construction, both for the regulators, politicians in Georgia and the co-owners of the project?\nTom Fanning: Yes, Angie, you know, having followed us for many years, that we're not going to get in front of anything to do with the regulator. So we'll make our filing and when we make our filing right at the end of June, we'll certainly reveal all of the issues, I think, in the rate case. So, I think it's fair to say, though, that the issues in the triennial rate cases as they have been in past really since, gosh, I don't know, boy, what was it about -- 1995, I think is when we first filed our Triangle [ph] rate cases, especially in this case, it will cover issues separate from Vogtle.  And so, I think they are more of what I would call meat and potato issues about how system is running. And I would say, we've always been treated fairly. We have a constructive relationship. And whenever there's a sticky issue that arises, we work it out. I think you should just expect that same kind of process to continue.\nDan Tucker: Yes. I would think about it, to a large extent, a lot of the capital items, in particular, are a continuation of programs introduced in the 2019 rate case, things like grid investment and Ash PON programs. So, you'll see those carried forward, just updated.\nA – Tom Fanning: Yes, but you won't expect any curve policy here. This is normal stuff for us.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. And then on the appeal of Vogtle now that's – there's this global recognition that there has to be more of a diversification of power sources and that gas might not be the answer for everything.\nTom Fanning: Absolutely. Angie, look, when you think about the energy dispatch price of Vogtle, it's going to be at about $1 per million BTU as compared to, say, a $7 dispatch price or even higher potentially of the gas fleet. Look, this thing from a dispatch standpoint is going to look like a champion. And by the way, it's carbon-free. And by the way, it's going to be probably the most reliable and safest plant. I don't want to be hyperbolic here, but it's going to be a really good asset for this state, for the Southeast and for the nation. Look, I think we are all feeling very good about its positioning in the future transition of the fleet for the Southeast.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. And then just one last question. I saw some comments in your 10-K about it, but can you talk about the sourcing of uranium and nuclear – well, nuclear fuel in general, so processing enrichment and how it's dependent or not dependent on any director or indirect sourcing from Russia?\nTom Fanning: Well, you answered your own question. I think our – we moved away from Russia as a system some time ago. And we're so glad we did. We have no exposure to Russia.\nAngie Storozynski: Not even through like indirect exposure to 10x?\nTom Fanning: No, not – no. I've pushed on that question with our folks many times now. And we think we're well insulated from any Russia problems.\nAngie Storozynski: Great. Thank you.\nTom Fanning: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. You may proceed with question.\nTom Fanning: Hey, Shar, you are back.\nShahriar Pourreza: I am sorry about that. I got all excited that, I hung up. My apologies.\nTom Fanning: Not nearly as excited as we are.\nShahriar Pourreza: There you go. There you go. Thanks for getting me back on. So Tom, I am just curious, when you're looking at the Georgia IRP, there's obviously a fairly healthy mix between gas, solar and storage. And essentially, all the coal has gone besides the plant. We're supposed to get a PD with the circumvention tariffs, I think, in August and it goes through a period of – of rule making, which is about a month after the PSC decision with the IRP. So I guess, how are conversations going with stakeholders in light of this tail risk, which could cause some pricing uncertainty for some time? I mean, could we see the IRP maybe shift out pending visibility with the circumvention tariffs, investigations?\nTom Fanning: That's a fascinating question. The IRP is on its own schedule, and I think it's supposed to be resolved somewhere in July, August time frame. I have not heard anything. This recent news about the circumvention investigation is really interesting. And I know some of my peers have had a lot to say about it. My only comment on that, Shar, is given a lot of my experience in national security issues, it's my firm belief that if somebody is circumventing tariffs illegally that they should be held to account. The United States needs to protect itself from an economic standpoint in this global economy. So let the investigation run and let’s see what happens. I think here, again, it's a conversation between tactics and strategy. In the Southeast, it is clear to me that solar is a dominant renewable strategy, in the long run, despite any perturbation that we may see from this investigation. I think we stay the course there.\nDan Tucker: Yes. And Shar, you asked the question in the context of the current IRP. I wouldn't overlook anything to this one. The nature of the IRP process in Georgia is very long dated. It's really if you go back to the 2019 IRP, there are RFPs being executed today. And there are -- as a matter of fact, last week brought forward to the Georgia Commission, was seeking approval to defer some of the PPAs in the last IRP out a year, and that was approved. And it's tied in to not directly to the circumvention issue, but the general supply chain constraints in the solar space.\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it, got it. And then, obviously, there's -- we're still waiting for the Alabama IRP as well. But you put the Georgia opportunities plus Alabama and Southern Power. It's a lot of capital that we're going to be potentially thinking about, even post Vogtle generating an electron and the cash flows that come with that. So, maybe, just highlight how you're sort of thinking about financing that incremental CapEx that can come from the IRPs and opportunities with Southern Power. You already kind of optimized an asset. But, I guess, I'm curious as we're thinking about the next leg of CapEx, especially post Vogtle, how you're thinking about sort of the regional footprint, the mix?\nTom Fanning: Yes.\nShahriar Pourreza: Is there opportunities beyond just straight equity or equity-like instruments? Thanks.\nTom Fanning: Well, so let's first baseline what is CapEx? I feel like I'm on Jeopardy here all of a sudden. But, I guess, our official five-year budget assumes $41 billion, round numbers. I personally think it's higher than that, because I think, Dan, you demonstrated this in the last call. We typically understate our forward capital requirement, because we're conservative by nature, because we don't account for anything in our budget that we don't know about. In other words, we don't do placeholders. When I think about what that number may be, I could easily see something like $45 billion. Who knows, $9 billion a year, round numbers. And some of that may come from new generation, or things that may start to occur in the kind of late 20s that may start showing up maybe 2025, maybe 2026 time frame. So those would be the years that I would think you would see additional capital. I'll let Dan argue with me here, but I don't see the need to issue any equity during this time frame. Last point I will make. You have seen -- in the world of M&A, you have seen us not only do acquisitions, we also do divestitures and asset sales. It is important for us to always put our assets in the hands of the best owner. If that means we create -- if we do that well, we create the maximum amount of value to shareholders. If we see opportunities in the future to do stuff like that, we will do it, buying and selling, but we have no plans at present.\nDan Tucker: I have no argument to anything Tom said. I would just reiterate, we don't foresee any equity needs at the top of your outlook, even with the upside on the tailwind.\nShahriar Pourrez: Okay, perfect. Thank you so much, guys. Congrats on the execution. Sorry about that technical glitch earlier.\nTom Fanning: No sweat my friend. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.\nTom Fanning: Hey, Michael. How are you?\nMichael Lapides: I’m fine, Tom. Thank you and thank Dan for taking my question and Tom, this one is more of a macro one. It's an industry one. It's probably even a heck of a lot bigger than just our industry here. Given all that's going on in the world, given some of the stuff that came out a few months ago regarding a nuclear plant in Kansas, just curious how you and how industry leadership and how the Board thinks about cybersecurity and managing and investing around the cybersecurity risk that exists today?\nTom Fanning: Well, we think is enormous, and we are so lucky to have people on our Board that are well steeped in it. I mean we have former Secretary of Energy, Ernie Moniz, we have Dale Klein, former Chairman of the NRC. Kristine Svinicki, former Chairman of the NRC. All these people have classification status to be able to play in this information in an unfiltered way. You all obviously know my role. I've led the utility industry for eight years and turn that over to my good friend at Berkshire Hathaway, Bill Furman, and now I chair the CISA Advisory Board. Listen, this is an enormous issue. I was the only CEO private citizen on the Cyberspace Solarium Commission. As I walk the halls of Congress, which I do as frequently as anybody, I guess, it's clear to me that there is bipartisan recognition of the importance of this issue and what we need to do about it. Unfortunately, there was no playbook. When the Cyberspace Solarium Commission came out with its report, I think it's been universally adopted in Congress. Of course, not every chapter was agreed to, but 70% of that commission's recommendations are now in law. And I'm so glad now that I get to help in operationalizing, primarily now with CISA and elsewhere with our own industry. But making this stuff come to fruition. The United States is making enormous strides and making ourselves safer. We will only do that as we reimagine the role of the private sector in preserving our national security. I think we're making terrific progress with that. And I want to give two shout-outs. First one is Jen Easterly, She's the Director of CISA. She does just a terrific job operationalizing the nation's cybersecurity agency. And then our National Cyber Director in the White House, Chris Inglis, just a brilliant guy in my wandering around before the Solarium Commission became to fruition he and I got together, and I found a real thought partner in how to advance the nation. Look, we have talent on our Board. We have talent inside the company. And I think the nation is operationalizing a real plan to make our national security better than it ever has been. A whole lot more to go, but man o man, as a nation we're better off than we were five years ago.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. And then a regulatory question, Tom, and thank you for that insight because over time, that's probably going to be -- I can almost guarantee it's going to be an issue that's discussed more and more frequently as generations past. I got a regulatory question. I'm trying to think about the bill and the changes in the bill in Georgia. So you'll file the GRC in the next couple of months, new rates probably early next year. And then a few months after that, the Vogtle Unit 3, if it goes in service as planned, those rates will kick in. And then fast forward to the fall of 2023 beginning of 2024 time frame, the Unit 4 rates will kick in. Am I thinking about that right as kind of a progression of events of changes to the customer bill, irrespective to any changes in the fuel cost?\nTom Fanning : Yes. I'm going to let Dan hit kind of the specifics of that, but let me just say too, we still are committed to bringing the Vogtle Units in at or cheaper than what was originally discussed when we received the order on those units. So I think we're still in at less than 10%, which is a big deal.\nDan Tucker : Yes. Michael, you described the cadence of those increases exactly correct.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Okay. And then finally, can you just remind us the changes in the fuel cost? I'm just trying to think about what pattern the customer bill? How do you look at what's going on across the southern companies, meaning Georgia, Alabama, et cetera? What's happening in the customer bill relative to what you're seeing elsewhere in the country?\nTom Fanning: Look, first of all, we're starting from a great spot, I mean, overall, our rates relative to the national average bounce around anywhere from 10% to 15% below national averages. So we're starting from a good place. We've got incredibly constructive mechanisms that help not only capture what's coming, so it's all forward-looking mechanisms that are also very kind of the cadence of them is thought out very well.\nMichael Lapides: Got it.\nTom Fanning : Make moving, Michael. Yes, you bet.\nMichael Lapides: No, go ahead, I didn't mean to cut you off, sorry.\nTom Fanning : That's right. I was just going to say more broadly, look, we are working every day internally to keep cost down. We've got coal plant retirements coming up that will help keep O&M down and customer bills down. We're working to be more efficient in lots of different ways, turning capital into O&M savings, whether that's enterprise systems or whether that's the things we're doing the grid investment plans. And so it's not one or two things. It's being very comprehensive in how we approach not only operations our regulatory plan.\nDan Tucker : Let me also just weigh in on the market structure issue. I know there are some with parochial interest in my opinion that are arguing for increased deregulation disaggregating the make moving sales structure that we find integrated in the Southeast to be so valuable. When you think about winter storm Yuri, when you think about resilience, value is a function of risk and return, I'm afraid some of these so-called organized markets have structured around preserving somehow the lowest price. Well, yes, they get low prices from time-to-time, but they also get a tremendous amount of volatility and no regard for reliability and resilience. In the Southeast in our integrated regulated market, there was one throat to choke, and it is ours. Make move or sell, we are accountable to the commission and the customers and the markets we serve. In our opinion, advancing to net zero, providing resilience, providing the lowest price to customers irrespective of where commodity prices go, Recall, we don't have a profit motive in rising and falling energy prices. We pass those along to customers at cost. This is the right market structure to pursue. And anybody that says different is misguided.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, Tom. Thanks Dan. Much appreciated guys.\nTom Fanning: You bet. Always good talking with you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. You may proceed with your question.\nTom Fanning: Hey Jeremy thanks for joining us.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, thanks for having me. Good afternoon. Just wanted to go back to Vogtle, real quick, if I could, and maybe better understand the ITAAC. A lot was completed in the last few months. And I just want to better see, I guess, what the drivers were, with the cadence where it's less in May and then kind of steps up into July, as you said a lot right before the end. Is there like a degree of difficulty difference in these versus the others, or just any other drivers, I guess, for the lumpiness and the outlook there?\nTom Fanning: No, it's really the nature of the work to perform. And I wouldn't say it's difficulty per se. It certainly has different time requirements. And like I say, the lumpiness is driven by the systems that will be completed right before we ask for the 103G letter. If I had to characterize those, I would say, of the 30 to 40, roughly half of that deals with our final electrical work, a quarter of it deals with ventilation systems and a quarter of it deals with, as you would expect, the final primary controls and monitoring systems. Once you finish that work, then you file your letter. It's just that as you do that work, it's just a big slug of ITaC that go out with it. Again, it's not a matter of degree of difficulty. It's more a matter of timing.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful there. And then I just want to pivot towards the Georgia economy. You had a lot of good commentary there as far as what's happening? You talk about the cargo levels and strong economic activity getting back to pre-COVID levels in the near-term. I'm just wondering, if you think about, I guess, the economic activity in your footprint going forward, maybe thinking more later dated, has it changed? I mean do you think that the growth is stronger now than maybe pre-COVID, or just from a big picture point of view, how do you think about the growth trends longer term in your area?\nTom Fanning: Yes. And you should also, I think -- CNBC put my interview out on their website, so you can go look at it. What we have seen is a migration of people into the Southeast, particularly Georgia. I think Georgia has the fifth highest growing population in the United States. And there's this question of, well, are we going to have a recession? You may have a different way to ask the question, and that would be regional recessions, we don't see any data that supports recession in the Southeast at this point. Let me give you some other data it's just interesting. If you look at our industrial sales year-over-year, it was up 1.7%. I mean you guys know that's a good number, okay? But within that number, we're two of our three biggest single-site plants closed. One was a chlor-alkali plant and one was a newsprint plant. If you remove the effect of those plants from the new brander and denominator, our industrial sales were up over 4.5%. I mean, that's amazing stuff. So, I think, especially as Dan suggested, with the ports, you see the unwinding of supply chain, you see the migration of people in, you see the low unemployment rate. I think the chemicals are in the sea for something to crawl up on the beach that will be sustainable and positive for years to come. And certainly, if there is a global downturn, and if there is a widespread recession. As we have seen in the past, the Southeast will be more resilient. The downturn will be less severe and the emergence from that downturn probably will be quicker. So I can't predict the future. All I can say is, relative to the United States, I love the organic economic growth in our area.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. I’ll leave it there. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Fremont with Mizuho. You may proceed with your question.\nTom Fanning: Hey, Paul. Always glad to have you with us.\nPaul Fremont: Always glad be here. A couple of quick questions. One would be the cable separation remediation work that you were doing on Unit 3, is that fully completed? And is that work required as part of the ITAAC process, or is that separate from the ITAAC process?\nTom Fanning: Yeah, it is part of that process. And yes, it's still underway, but it certainly is winding down.\nPaul Fremont: So your expectation based on the time line that you put out would be that, that work will be completed before July, right?\nTom Fanning: Yes. Everything that we're putting out is consistent with the time frames. We're in good shape there, I think.\nPaul Fremont: Okay.\nTom Fanning: Is that your dog in the background?\nPaul Fremont: That is a Wimeranner, yes.\nTom Fanning: All right. Nice dog.\nPaul Fremont: Second question, you had talked about thousands of documents potentially that you needed to locate. And this was around the time of the fourth quarter call, you said you had located 30%. Did I hear you right on this call that those documents are now either found or replaced?\nTom Fanning: Its not so much found. Sometimes it was incomplete. Sometimes it was absent. We've basically wound down that work. There may be a few left to go but nearly all are done for 103G. And for those that are required to load fuel, I think we're 75% of the way there. So there's still some work to be done, but it's not associated largely with 103G. It's more associated with the work I described for fuel load.\nPaul Fremont: Great. I think that's it in terms of questions for me. Thank you so much. And congrats on the NRC. When is the final section report due out?\nTom Fanning: Next week, I think. They've already posted some stuff on their website. So – and we've already had our debrief with the NRC.\nPaul Fremont: Great. Thanks.\nTom Fanning: Thank you, sir.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nicholas Campanella with Credit Suisse. You may proceed with your question.\nTom Fanning: Hey, Nicholas. Thanks for joining us.\nNicholas Campanella: Hey, everyone. Hi. Thanks for having me on. Really appreciate the time. I guess I just – I wanted to go back to Steve's question on just the comments on kind of running parallel paths with some of the remediation work and I know we're kind of waiting on the 103G, but as you get that 103G, like is the expectation at this point that you can move right to fuel load. Is there just really no more remediation that can be done? And it sounds like you're ahead of schedule on that front. So if that's the case, is there any reason why we shouldn't be kind of targeting the midpoint for COD on Unit 3?\nTom Fanning: Yeah, yeah, Nick, there's more work to be done. You should not expect us to get 103G and load fuel immediately. There is more work to be done. So there will be some space in between, yeah, I know we have this chart that shows 103G letter received and start fuel load almost immediately. I would expect if I were you. If we got the 103G letter sooner, there would still be a gap of time to get to fuel load.\nNicholas Campanella: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then I guess you talked about moving folks from Unit 3 to Unit 4 and broadly, are you starting to see lessons learned from Unit 3 to Unit 4 start to translate and bear fruit. Maybe you can kind of talk to that and that would just be last part of it.\nTom Fanning: Yeah, sure. We absolutely are. In fact, we've resequenced some work. Some stuff we mentioned in the past was energization of the control room and things like that. We moved that out. We've really been focused. Early on, and I think it was really smart. The site wanted to fail fast, if you will. And complete testing as soon as we were able in order to learn from whatever problems that arose and then be able to apply them critically. Now that we have a set of learnings at Unit 3, I think we have a better sense as to how to proceed on Unit 4 incorporating those learnings. And so you will see that in the Unit 4 progression.\nNicholas Campanella: Got it, got it. Okay. And then if I could just sneak one more in. The asset sales to the best owner commentary. You've been a large acquirer of LDCs in the past. There's clear interest from private markets. I know that there's no asset sales on the table today, but just how are you thinking about how the gas business fits into the overall Southern portfolio and your wider decarbonization goals at this point? Any comments there would be helpful.\nTom Fanning: Well, actually, I think our gas business fits in well with the decarbonization. When you think about the whole effort of energy policy in America, we have to make sure that we balance all of the clean, safe, reliable and may be resilient and affordable objectives, okay? So you could say, oh, well, we should eliminate all natural gas appliances in a home, eliminate gas heating. Well, in Illinois, that makes no sense at all. Who could afford to do that? And the electricity substitution effects in places like Illinois make no sense compared to the economies that our customers get through gas heat and other approaches like cooking and others. So what we have to do is take into account the full range of impacts to customers, clean, safe, reliable, affordable. And we've got to come up with a global solution on how to achieve those objectives and achieve net-zero. I think we're doing that. I think the idea somehow that gas should go away in America is really foolish. Don't undersell the capability of American technology innovation in solving the problem of the future. And when I talk about a new relationship, where we want the Department of Energy broadly, the United States government to get in the boat with us to achieve this net-zero goal. Some of that may be funding more important net zero technologies, whether that's storage, whether that is carbon removal, whether it's new nuclear, you name it. We are, by far, I think, the biggest proprietary research and development shop in America. We're one of the biggest funders of a -- Former Vice Chair. We've had several chairs. I think Stan Conley [ph] is now starting his second chairmanship of that effort. I think we're by far the biggest energy partner in technology development with DOE.  Look, what we need to do with the nation is invest in technology innovation and solve these problems. Saying that, given today's state of nature, we can't do gas in the future is foolish, given the amount of gas, the plentiful supply and the geopolitical national security interest we have in providing that. And now that geopolitical interest is not just parochial for the United States, now that Russia has weaponized their gas supply to Europe, how can Europe ever feel secure and having them as a trading partner. We need to step up to the plate and help solve the global problem here. The old idea was that Thomas Friedman, the world is flat or whatever that is, the world is not flat. It's full of perturbation and we may see a new global economy emerge where there are countries that are aligned with our national interest and perhaps those that aren't. And we'll see how that evolves. But boy-o-boy, it's clear to me from a supply chain standpoint, commodity development standpoint, energy can be one of the most important economic development activities, the United States can do, not only to keep things cheap and plentiful here, but provide us national security around the globe.\nQ – Nicholas Campanella: Thanks for all your thoughts I will leave it there.\nTom Fanning: Thanks \nOperator: Our next question comes from with Srinjoy Banerjee with Barclays. You may proceed with your question.\nTom Fanning: Srinjoy, great to have you with us.\nSrinjoy Banerjee: Thank you. good afternoon, guys. So a couple of questions just on the debt issuance side. For Southern Power, no debt issuance needs there, but some maturities coming up, so indicating deleveraging there. Could you remind us what the credit metric targets are? And then just thinking about the future for Southern Power, would we consider that a core part of Southern's broader decarbonization strategy?\nDan Tucker: So on the debt, I wouldn't think about it as deleveraging per se, I mean we're maintaining kind of continuous metrics there. And so that was related to the second part of your question. We're targeting about a 22% FFO to debt over time. And so, we're simply as we're as we're getting the cash flow, we're retiring that debt and recapitalizing the business to support that. And then yes, on the second part. Look, the Southern Power has been and continues to be an important part of the family here. We've always kind of considered it a core business, and we'll continue to operate it that way.\nTom Fanning: And its risk profile and its earnings profile is all consistent with what we think we have here, long-term contracts, creditworthy counterparties, bilateral, minimal to no fuel or transmission risk, those kinds of things.\nSrinjoy Banerjee: Perfect. And then...\nTom Fanning: Go ahead.\nSrinjoy Banerjee: Got it. And just one last one, just on Georgia Power issuance needs, I think that's still slated at $1.5 billion, just given some of the credit market conditions so far. Any thoughts on whether you would look at long-dated or more front-end maturities there?\nDan Tucker: Yes, we don't want to front run anything that we might do in the markets there, Srinjoy. I mean, we're always looking across the curve, trying to figure out what fits best and we'll just -- let's wait until we come to market with that to see what we end up doing.\nTom Fanning: And I'll just complement Dan's team. You look at our portfolio, I think we have it in the background material, but 18-year average life, 3.5 kind of average coupon. This is one of the more valuable debt portfolios in the United States. It is a real asset to us.\nSrinjoy Banerjee: Thank you very much.\nTom Fanning: Thank you, sir.\nOperator: And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks?\nTom Fanning: Well, my only closing remark will be, thank you all for joining us. We're off to an awfully good start this year, certainly in our financials, in our base business, but also with plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. We continue to work very hard to execute, happy so far this year. We'll continue to work hard for the rest of the year and bring this thing home. Thanks, everyone, for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Southern Company First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tom Fanning",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted earnings results for the first quarter ahead of our estimates. The economies within our Southeast service territories are among the best in the United States and we believe we are well-positioned to achieve our financial objectives for 2022. Before turning the call over to Dan for a more detailed look at our financial performance, I will first provide an update on recent progress at Plant Vogtle units 3 and 4. Importantly, the projected completion timeline and capital cost forecast for both units are unchanged from the updates that we provided last quarter. Since that time, we've seen sustained progress consistent with our expectations for each unit. The NRC completed its follow-up inspection this week and issued its final supplemental report. The inspection verified that Southern Nuclear effectively implemented the corrective actions and remediation efforts at the site. No additional findings were identified during the follow-up inspection and the findings identified last year have been closed. With this step complete, the Vogtle site returns to the baseline inspection program. Let's focus now on Unit 3. We continue to progress towards receipt of the NRC's 103G letter. All necessary systems have been turned over from construction to testing, and nearly all the inspection records necessary for submission of the remaining ITAAC are now complete. Associated with this progress, 70 ITAAC were submitted to the NRC since our last earnings call and 53 ITAAC remain. Of these remaining ITAAC, the last 30 to 40 are expected to be completed just prior to submitting the all ITAAC complete letter to the NRC in support of the 103G letter. Considering our progress over the last two months, we have provided an updated ITAAC completion schedule. Following receipt of the 103G letter from the NRC and as Unit 3 continues its transformation from construction to operations, our efforts will be focused on completing the remaining inspection records, system turnovers and the necessary preoperational and component test required to load fuel later this year. Turning to Unit 4. Direct construction is now approximately 94% complete. Unit 4 continues to make progress in advance of cold hydro testing and hot functional testing. We believe we have the resources we need on site for Unit 4 and have a clear plan for transitioning additional personnel from Unit 3 as we continue our focus on increasing productivity and ensuring first-time quality. Overall, construction completion has averaged 0.9% per month since the start of the year, supportive of a September 2023 in-service and ahead of the 0.4% average projected to be needed through the year-end to achieve a December 2023 in-service date. For electrical production specifically, progress on Unit 4 is meeting our current expectations. However, electrical production will need to increase to support our projected in-service dates. The schedule changes announced last year required Vogtle 3 and 4 owners to affirmatively vote to proceed with the project, which, in late February, they unanimously voted to do. This decision underscores the importance of the 2,200 megawatts of baseload carbon-free energy, which will be vital to increasing the availability of net zero resources for customers across the state. We value our partners on Vogtle 3 and 4 and the relationships that we have had with them across multiple endeavors for decades. We look forward to our continued partnership as we work to bring Vogtle units 3 and 4 safely online, providing Georgia with a reliable, carbon-free energy resource for the next 60 to 80 years. We are pleased with the progress at the site over the past few months and incredibly proud of the entire team at Vogtle units 3 and 4 for their relentless commitment to completing this important project safely and with the utmost quality. Dan, I'll now turn the call over to you. Thanks, Dan. Sustainability has always been a top priority for Southern Company. In recent years, our plans and progress have received heightened interest from our investors, customers, communities, employees and other stakeholders. We have a long, strong history of constructive engagement with all stakeholders and we are excited about the recent release of a dedicated sustainability website, which provides additional transparency on core environmental, social and governance topics. This new site highlights the tremendous work underway across our company to help us reach our sustainability and business objectives, as we seek to build the future of energy. Additionally, just this week, we published a report outlining our just transition principles and look to continue enhancing our disclosures. We know that stakeholders are increasingly interested in information related to our sustainability efforts, and we remain committed to open and transparent communication. In closing, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the great job that employees throughout Southern Company do each and every day. National Lineman Appreciation Day, which was observed this month, specifically recognizes the important contribution of line workers and those supporting them to our country from. From extreme heat to bitter cold to answering the call of those that need thousands of miles away for days and weeks at a time, the hard work and unwavering dedication that these men and women display, day in and day out is truly inspirational. Moreover, last month, the Edison Electric Institute and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers presented the prestigious Edwin D. Hill Award to Alabama Power and the IBEW System Council U-19. Through the National Utility Industry Training Fund and the electrical training ALLIANCE, Alabama Power and the IBEW are providing current and prospective employees with the appropriate training necessary to install and maintain the fiber infrastructure that enables grid automation and resiliency and improve community access to broadband. It is an honor to receive this award, and we remain committed to continued support and investment in our workforce to ensure that our employees have the skills and training needed to successfully meet the ever-evolving needs of the customers that we have the privilege to serve. Thank you in joining us this afternoon. Operator, we are now ready to take your questions. Shar, how are you? Shar, are you there? Are you on mute? If you do, you owe us $20. Operator, I don't hear Shar. You want to go to the next question? Hey Julien. Yes. I think simply, Dan can fill in some blanks here. But Unit 4 remains on-track with our expectations. We are consistent with our expected timeframes and budgets, all good in that regard. I think we gave you the data that suggests that the 0.9% kind of average monthly increase in construction is consistent with a September timeframe and is, in advance of better than the 0.4% that we need to hit the year-end. So that's your three-to-six-month stuff.  Importantly, as we said in the script, I just want to make sure you know, all of our production for Unit 4 is consistent with our expectations. We are moving people from 3 to 4. And so, we expect their productivity and their production to increase overtime. So consistent with our estimates we need to increase. We have plans to move people over to effectuate that increase. With respect to the inflation and pay, we frankly went over that here getting ready for this call. We believe we're still top decile pay for the Southeast, and we feel like most of that risk is behind us. Dan, do you want to add anything else? One last point there. Attrition is at normal levels. So it's progressing as we expected. Yes. And you should know that this is not a discrete kind of engagement we have with our co-owners. I was with them last week at the site. You should view us as having a real-time conversation here. Anything else, Julien? All right. Feel free to jump back in, if you like. Thank you for joining us. Yes, thank you. Hey, Steve. Let me -- before you get to your call, I just want to complement you on your call to action here. I thought that was really well done. Good job. I'll share that with our folks as well. Well, I'm sure you didn't see my little comment on Squat Box this morning. But I think one of the headlines out of the media was essentially unleashing -- let me just make sure I get it here, the United States needs to unleash the American energy economy. We have been having conversations with people like Gene McCarthy and Secretary of Energy, Jennifer Granholm and others. Listen, this is a constant conversation. Senator mentioned I think, has lots of good ideas. I think the challenge that we see in D.C. right now is essentially deal service. How do we get the right number of people to agree on the right number of issues and get it done in a time frame that is enough in advance of the November elections to be constructive. Listen, I think people get the issue and Steve, now more than ever. When we see Russia weaponized its energy policy, it's time for the United States to take action. Well, I think – I think it's a little... Yes, man. This may be -- I don't know the full data set for our industry. But we've always had this constructive relationship with our state regulators. And a long time ago, we put in a place -- put in place hedging programs. And so in effect, I'm going to say about -- and Dan correct me, about 30% of our natural gas consumption was hedged at about $3 per million Btu. So when you think about the dispatch curves, they're probably better than what you might have expected because of that hedging program. And of course, as we pointed out, lots of times over decades, all of these benefits accrue to our customers. We make no profit percentage off of any of this. Dan, anything else? The good news there is that the flagship, if you will, of our coal units is Plant Miller in Alabama. It is the cheapest best controlled plant, it has plenty of coal for the summer. So that one is in good shape. The other thing that I just want to make sure people here loud and clear. In no way does this negatively impact our long-term objective of achieving net-zero by 2050. You have to understand that long-term strategy should be robust and be able to manage the exogenous factors that change our plan day-to-day. Mike Tyson, you have a plan until you get hit in the face and then what happens. Certainly, the tactics will vary depending upon what's happening in the worldwide energy market. But our long-term strategy remains intact. Yeah, you bet. So if you – if I could change your question, but it's a similar question. What am I most worried about right now on Vogtle 3 in particular? I would say that the ITAAC situation looks pretty manageable if you just do the math that we gave you, 53 remaining ITAAC and you think about needing 30 to 40 to finish, that effort that will occur in a fairly lumpy fashion right as we file the request for the 103G letter. It looks pretty manageable. And so my sense is the ITAAC situation getting to 103G always hard. We take nothing for granted. Certainly, there's a variable in time and how we're going to do those things. But I think that looks like it's in pretty good shape. I am more worried now about the work that has to happen between today and fuel load. Now that covers a lot of different things, they're not nearly as kind of nuclear safety related as the 103G obviously are. But it would include things like, and I'm just giving you a sample, but the fuel transfer system, aligning the electric buses throughout the plant, general demobilization efforts, things like removing temporary lighting and putting in permanent lighting, removing scaffolding, closing the rooms, cleaning them and closing them, getting ready for a pristine operating condition. So that's a lot of stuff that still has to happen. I think, a few system turnovers for that. I think two left. There's just more work to be done. I think that is more of the critical path right now than probably 103G. And then the next thing that I would say, I worry about will be from fuel load to operation, just thinking about fully operating the kind of follow-on steam cycle and making sure that the digital controls are integrated together, as well as they can be. Those are the big things in my mind right now. Dan, do you want to say something? Yes. And that's what I tried to be pointing and say now to fuel load. And the other thing that we have done, we brought a guy to the site, Pete Sena, who is our Chief Nuclear Officer, he runs our fleet. And so, we've added another senior member to the team, as we think about moving from a construction environment to an operating environment. Thanks, Steve. He is terrific. Next question. Hey Angie, always glad to have you with us. Yes, Angie, you know, having followed us for many years, that we're not going to get in front of anything to do with the regulator. So we'll make our filing and when we make our filing right at the end of June, we'll certainly reveal all of the issues, I think, in the rate case. So, I think it's fair to say, though, that the issues in the triennial rate cases as they have been in past really since, gosh, I don't know, boy, what was it about -- 1995, I think is when we first filed our Triangle [ph] rate cases, especially in this case, it will cover issues separate from Vogtle.  And so, I think they are more of what I would call meat and potato issues about how system is running. And I would say, we've always been treated fairly. We have a constructive relationship. And whenever there's a sticky issue that arises, we work it out. I think you should just expect that same kind of process to continue. Absolutely. Angie, look, when you think about the energy dispatch price of Vogtle, it's going to be at about $1 per million BTU as compared to, say, a $7 dispatch price or even higher potentially of the gas fleet. Look, this thing from a dispatch standpoint is going to look like a champion. And by the way, it's carbon-free. And by the way, it's going to be probably the most reliable and safest plant. I don't want to be hyperbolic here, but it's going to be a really good asset for this state, for the Southeast and for the nation. Look, I think we are all feeling very good about its positioning in the future transition of the fleet for the Southeast. Well, you answered your own question. I think our – we moved away from Russia as a system some time ago. And we're so glad we did. We have no exposure to Russia. No, not – no. I've pushed on that question with our folks many times now. And we think we're well insulated from any Russia problems. Thank you. Hey, Shar, you are back. Not nearly as excited as we are. That's a fascinating question. The IRP is on its own schedule, and I think it's supposed to be resolved somewhere in July, August time frame. I have not heard anything. This recent news about the circumvention investigation is really interesting. And I know some of my peers have had a lot to say about it. My only comment on that, Shar, is given a lot of my experience in national security issues, it's my firm belief that if somebody is circumventing tariffs illegally that they should be held to account. The United States needs to protect itself from an economic standpoint in this global economy. So let the investigation run and let's see what happens. I think here, again, it's a conversation between tactics and strategy. In the Southeast, it is clear to me that solar is a dominant renewable strategy, in the long run, despite any perturbation that we may see from this investigation. I think we stay the course there. Yes. Well, so let's first baseline what is CapEx? I feel like I'm on Jeopardy here all of a sudden. But, I guess, our official five-year budget assumes $41 billion, round numbers. I personally think it's higher than that, because I think, Dan, you demonstrated this in the last call. We typically understate our forward capital requirement, because we're conservative by nature, because we don't account for anything in our budget that we don't know about. In other words, we don't do placeholders. When I think about what that number may be, I could easily see something like $45 billion. Who knows, $9 billion a year, round numbers. And some of that may come from new generation, or things that may start to occur in the kind of late 20s that may start showing up maybe 2025, maybe 2026 time frame. So those would be the years that I would think you would see additional capital. I'll let Dan argue with me here, but I don't see the need to issue any equity during this time frame. Last point I will make. You have seen -- in the world of M&A, you have seen us not only do acquisitions, we also do divestitures and asset sales. It is important for us to always put our assets in the hands of the best owner. If that means we create -- if we do that well, we create the maximum amount of value to shareholders. If we see opportunities in the future to do stuff like that, we will do it, buying and selling, but we have no plans at present. No sweat my friend. Thank you for joining us. Hey, Michael. How are you? Well, we think is enormous, and we are so lucky to have people on our Board that are well steeped in it. I mean we have former Secretary of Energy, Ernie Moniz, we have Dale Klein, former Chairman of the NRC. Kristine Svinicki, former Chairman of the NRC. All these people have classification status to be able to play in this information in an unfiltered way. You all obviously know my role. I've led the utility industry for eight years and turn that over to my good friend at Berkshire Hathaway, Bill Furman, and now I chair the CISA Advisory Board. Listen, this is an enormous issue. I was the only CEO private citizen on the Cyberspace Solarium Commission. As I walk the halls of Congress, which I do as frequently as anybody, I guess, it's clear to me that there is bipartisan recognition of the importance of this issue and what we need to do about it. Unfortunately, there was no playbook. When the Cyberspace Solarium Commission came out with its report, I think it's been universally adopted in Congress. Of course, not every chapter was agreed to, but 70% of that commission's recommendations are now in law. And I'm so glad now that I get to help in operationalizing, primarily now with CISA and elsewhere with our own industry. But making this stuff come to fruition. The United States is making enormous strides and making ourselves safer. We will only do that as we reimagine the role of the private sector in preserving our national security. I think we're making terrific progress with that. And I want to give two shout-outs. First one is Jen Easterly, She's the Director of CISA. She does just a terrific job operationalizing the nation's cybersecurity agency. And then our National Cyber Director in the White House, Chris Inglis, just a brilliant guy in my wandering around before the Solarium Commission became to fruition he and I got together, and I found a real thought partner in how to advance the nation. Look, we have talent on our Board. We have talent inside the company. And I think the nation is operationalizing a real plan to make our national security better than it ever has been. A whole lot more to go, but man o man, as a nation we're better off than we were five years ago. Yes. I'm going to let Dan hit kind of the specifics of that, but let me just say too, we still are committed to bringing the Vogtle Units in at or cheaper than what was originally discussed when we received the order on those units. So I think we're still in at less than 10%, which is a big deal. Look, first of all, we're starting from a great spot, I mean, overall, our rates relative to the national average bounce around anywhere from 10% to 15% below national averages. So we're starting from a good place. We've got incredibly constructive mechanisms that help not only capture what's coming, so it's all forward-looking mechanisms that are also very kind of the cadence of them is thought out very well. Make moving, Michael. Yes, you bet. That's right. I was just going to say more broadly, look, we are working every day internally to keep cost down. We've got coal plant retirements coming up that will help keep O&M down and customer bills down. We're working to be more efficient in lots of different ways, turning capital into O&M savings, whether that's enterprise systems or whether that's the things we're doing the grid investment plans. And so it's not one or two things. It's being very comprehensive in how we approach not only operations our regulatory plan. You bet. Always good talking with you. Hey Jeremy thanks for joining us. No, it's really the nature of the work to perform. And I wouldn't say it's difficulty per se. It certainly has different time requirements. And like I say, the lumpiness is driven by the systems that will be completed right before we ask for the 103G letter. If I had to characterize those, I would say, of the 30 to 40, roughly half of that deals with our final electrical work, a quarter of it deals with ventilation systems and a quarter of it deals with, as you would expect, the final primary controls and monitoring systems. Once you finish that work, then you file your letter. It's just that as you do that work, it's just a big slug of ITaC that go out with it. Again, it's not a matter of degree of difficulty. It's more a matter of timing. Yes. And you should also, I think -- CNBC put my interview out on their website, so you can go look at it. What we have seen is a migration of people into the Southeast, particularly Georgia. I think Georgia has the fifth highest growing population in the United States. And there's this question of, well, are we going to have a recession? You may have a different way to ask the question, and that would be regional recessions, we don't see any data that supports recession in the Southeast at this point. Let me give you some other data it's just interesting. If you look at our industrial sales year-over-year, it was up 1.7%. I mean you guys know that's a good number, okay? But within that number, we're two of our three biggest single-site plants closed. One was a chlor-alkali plant and one was a newsprint plant. If you remove the effect of those plants from the new brander and denominator, our industrial sales were up over 4.5%. I mean, that's amazing stuff. So, I think, especially as Dan suggested, with the ports, you see the unwinding of supply chain, you see the migration of people in, you see the low unemployment rate. I think the chemicals are in the sea for something to crawl up on the beach that will be sustainable and positive for years to come. And certainly, if there is a global downturn, and if there is a widespread recession. As we have seen in the past, the Southeast will be more resilient. The downturn will be less severe and the emergence from that downturn probably will be quicker. So I can't predict the future. All I can say is, relative to the United States, I love the organic economic growth in our area. Hey, Paul. Always glad to have you with us. Yeah, it is part of that process. And yes, it's still underway, but it certainly is winding down. Yes. Everything that we're putting out is consistent with the time frames. We're in good shape there, I think. Is that your dog in the background? All right. Nice dog. Its not so much found. Sometimes it was incomplete. Sometimes it was absent. We've basically wound down that work. There may be a few left to go but nearly all are done for 103G. And for those that are required to load fuel, I think we're 75% of the way there. So there's still some work to be done, but it's not associated largely with 103G. It's more associated with the work I described for fuel load. Next week, I think. They've already posted some stuff on their website. So – and we've already had our debrief with the NRC. Thank you, sir. Hey, Nicholas. Thanks for joining us. Yeah, yeah, Nick, there's more work to be done. You should not expect us to get 103G and load fuel immediately. There is more work to be done. So there will be some space in between, yeah, I know we have this chart that shows 103G letter received and start fuel load almost immediately. I would expect if I were you. If we got the 103G letter sooner, there would still be a gap of time to get to fuel load. Yeah, sure. We absolutely are. In fact, we've resequenced some work. Some stuff we mentioned in the past was energization of the control room and things like that. We moved that out. We've really been focused. Early on, and I think it was really smart. The site wanted to fail fast, if you will. And complete testing as soon as we were able in order to learn from whatever problems that arose and then be able to apply them critically. Now that we have a set of learnings at Unit 3, I think we have a better sense as to how to proceed on Unit 4 incorporating those learnings. And so you will see that in the Unit 4 progression. Well, actually, I think our gas business fits in well with the decarbonization. When you think about the whole effort of energy policy in America, we have to make sure that we balance all of the clean, safe, reliable and may be resilient and affordable objectives, okay? So you could say, oh, well, we should eliminate all natural gas appliances in a home, eliminate gas heating. Well, in Illinois, that makes no sense at all. Who could afford to do that? And the electricity substitution effects in places like Illinois make no sense compared to the economies that our customers get through gas heat and other approaches like cooking and others. So what we have to do is take into account the full range of impacts to customers, clean, safe, reliable, affordable. And we've got to come up with a global solution on how to achieve those objectives and achieve net-zero. I think we're doing that. I think the idea somehow that gas should go away in America is really foolish. Don't undersell the capability of American technology innovation in solving the problem of the future. And when I talk about a new relationship, where we want the Department of Energy broadly, the United States government to get in the boat with us to achieve this net-zero goal. Some of that may be funding more important net zero technologies, whether that's storage, whether that is carbon removal, whether it's new nuclear, you name it. We are, by far, I think, the biggest proprietary research and development shop in America. We're one of the biggest funders of a -- Former Vice Chair. We've had several chairs. I think Stan Conley [ph] is now starting his second chairmanship of that effort. I think we're by far the biggest energy partner in technology development with DOE.  Look, what we need to do with the nation is invest in technology innovation and solve these problems. Saying that, given today's state of nature, we can't do gas in the future is foolish, given the amount of gas, the plentiful supply and the geopolitical national security interest we have in providing that. And now that geopolitical interest is not just parochial for the United States, now that Russia has weaponized their gas supply to Europe, how can Europe ever feel secure and having them as a trading partner. We need to step up to the plate and help solve the global problem here. The old idea was that Thomas Friedman, the world is flat or whatever that is, the world is not flat. It's full of perturbation and we may see a new global economy emerge where there are countries that are aligned with our national interest and perhaps those that aren't. And we'll see how that evolves. But boy-o-boy, it's clear to me from a supply chain standpoint, commodity development standpoint, energy can be one of the most important economic development activities, the United States can do, not only to keep things cheap and plentiful here, but provide us national security around the globe.\nQ – Nicholas Campanella: Thanks for all your thoughts I will leave it there. Thanks Srinjoy, great to have you with us. And its risk profile and its earnings profile is all consistent with what we think we have here, long-term contracts, creditworthy counterparties, bilateral, minimal to no fuel or transmission risk, those kinds of things. Go ahead. And I'll just complement Dan's team. You look at our portfolio, I think we have it in the background material, but 18-year average life, 3.5 kind of average coupon. This is one of the more valuable debt portfolios in the United States. It is a real asset to us. Thank you, sir. Well, my only closing remark will be, thank you all for joining us. We're off to an awfully good start this year, certainly in our financials, in our base business, but also with plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. We continue to work very hard to execute, happy so far this year. We'll continue to work hard for the rest of the year and bring this thing home. Thanks, everyone, for joining us."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Dan Tucker",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom mentioned, we had a very strong start to the year. Our adjusted EPS for the first quarter of 2022 was $0.97, $0.01 lower than last year and $0.07 above our estimate. The primary driver for the variance to last year was higher non-fuel O&M, which reflects a trend towards more normal operating conditions relative to significantly reduced levels during the first quarter of 2021 and then largely offset by constructive state regulatory actions and robust customer growth at our state-regulated utilities. When looking at adjusted EPS compared to our estimate for the quarter, the main drivers were continued strong customer growth and cost control. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted quarterly results as compared to 2021 is included in today's release and earnings package. Turning now to retail sales in the economy. In the first quarter, weather normal retail sales were approximately 1% higher than first quarter 2021. This increase reflects stronger commercial and industrial sales from the continued economic recovery in our service territories, somewhat offset by lower residential sales as schools and businesses continue to transition from remote environments to hybrid or in-person modes throughout the quarter. We also continue to see robust customer growth with the addition of nearly 11,000 residential electric customers and over 7,000 residential gas customers during the quarter. This level of customer growth is driven by a strong labor market recovery and our Southeast service territories are expected to reach pre-pandemic levels of employment later this year. Additionally, the Port of Savannah, which is the fourth largest port in the nation and a major contributor to jobs and economic growth in Georgia, experienced a 3% year-over-year increase in container volumes in the first quarter of 2022, ahead of 2021's record pace as elevated US consumer demand continues to drive record cargo levels. Recent figures from the Georgia Port Authority also signaled that congestion is easing with only a handful of ships currently at anchor outside of the Port of Savannah, down from a peak of around 30 in mid-September of last year. Additionally, the recent approval of the Garden City Terminal West expansion is expected to increase the Port of Savanna's annual capacity by more than 15% by the end of 2024. The economic development pipeline in our service territories remains robust. In the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter last year, economic development announcements in our regulated electric service territory saw a 168% increase in payroll additions and a 66% increase in business investment, respectively. The first quarter closed with 230 active projects in the pipeline for the State of Georgia alone, which is well-above historical averages and new job additions in Georgia exceeded 7,000, an all-time high for the first quarter of the year. We remain encouraged by the economic trends that we are seeing as we continue to monitor the implications of supply chain constraints, labor force participation and inflationary pressures on our outlook. And I have two final topics before turning the call back over to Tom. First, for the second quarter, our adjusted EPS estimate is $0.80 per share; and second, I'd like to highlight our recent dividend increase announcement. Earlier this month, the Southern Company Board of Directors approved an $0.08 per share increase in our common dividend, raising our annualized rate to $2.72 per share. This action marks the 21st consecutive annual increase and for three quarters of the century dating back to 1948, Southern Company has paid a dividend that was equal to, or greater than the previous year. This remarkable track record reinforces Southern Company as a premier sustainable investment. And as we mentioned on our last call, we believe once Vogtle 3 and 4 are completed, our Board will have the opportunity to consider accelerating the rate of dividend growth, further supporting our objective of providing superior risk-adjusted total shareholder return to investors. Tom, I'll now turn the call back over to you. Yes. The only thing I'd add -- you hit on this briefly, but we do have a very detailed plan for transitioning, particularly the electric craft from Unit 3 to Unit 4 as we go through this process. And then as you'd expect us to do, we're certainly applying every lesson learned from Unit 3 to Unit 4, and that will also factor into our ability to increase productivity. Julien, I don't want to dive too deep into this. That's a conversation that frankly just needs to take place in the right form with us and our co-owners. As Tom mentioned in our prepared remarks, these are partners that go back with us decades and we have a track record of resolving any sort of disagreements constructively. We'll let this play out over the course of the year. The timeline you referenced it was a 180-day clock that started back in March just to, kind of formalize that. That's certainly a backdrop to these discussions. But let's let that play out on its own throughout the rest of the year. Yeah, a couple of things. So one thing that is occurring, Steve, is we are being a little conservative might be the right word in terms of looking towards our peak season in the summer in our electric business and just making sure that we're holding on to enough coal there as well. So there are times when we're we might have otherwise switched the coal but because we're looking ahead. And what's behind that, and I think you may have touched on a little bit of this in your report, transportation of energy is one of the things that is certainly a hot topic. And frankly, we don't have enough of. People talk a lot about natural gas pipes on coal, it's obviously with the rails. And with the lack of available personnel and other things, rails are having to reprioritize their own train sets and personnel and frankly, coal is not at the top of their list right now. And so we're just having to be thoughtful about how we do that. Yes. I think it's important to understand, as you hear Tom describe what necessary to get the fuel load and the things we're focused on there, that is largely concurrent work with the work we're doing to get to 103G. It's not sequential. It's not get to on first and then to the other. We're doing those things on parallel paths. Yes. I would think about it, to a large extent, a lot of the capital items, in particular, are a continuation of programs introduced in the 2019 rate case, things like grid investment and Ash PON programs. So, you'll see those carried forward, just updated.\nA – Tom Fanning: Yes, but you won't expect any curve policy here. This is normal stuff for us. Yes. And Shar, you asked the question in the context of the current IRP. I wouldn't overlook anything to this one. The nature of the IRP process in Georgia is very long dated. It's really if you go back to the 2019 IRP, there are RFPs being executed today. And there are -- as a matter of fact, last week brought forward to the Georgia Commission, was seeking approval to defer some of the PPAs in the last IRP out a year, and that was approved. And it's tied in to not directly to the circumvention issue, but the general supply chain constraints in the solar space. I have no argument to anything Tom said. I would just reiterate, we don't foresee any equity needs at the top of your outlook, even with the upside on the tailwind. Yes. Michael, you described the cadence of those increases exactly correct. Let me also just weigh in on the market structure issue. I know there are some with parochial interest in my opinion that are arguing for increased deregulation disaggregating the make moving sales structure that we find integrated in the Southeast to be so valuable. When you think about winter storm Yuri, when you think about resilience, value is a function of risk and return, I'm afraid some of these so-called organized markets have structured around preserving somehow the lowest price. Well, yes, they get low prices from time-to-time, but they also get a tremendous amount of volatility and no regard for reliability and resilience. In the Southeast in our integrated regulated market, there was one throat to choke, and it is ours. Make move or sell, we are accountable to the commission and the customers and the markets we serve. In our opinion, advancing to net zero, providing resilience, providing the lowest price to customers irrespective of where commodity prices go, Recall, we don't have a profit motive in rising and falling energy prices. We pass those along to customers at cost. This is the right market structure to pursue. And anybody that says different is misguided. So on the debt, I wouldn't think about it as deleveraging per se, I mean we're maintaining kind of continuous metrics there. And so that was related to the second part of your question. We're targeting about a 22% FFO to debt over time. And so, we're simply as we're as we're getting the cash flow, we're retiring that debt and recapitalizing the business to support that. And then yes, on the second part. Look, the Southern Power has been and continues to be an important part of the family here. We've always kind of considered it a core business, and we'll continue to operate it that way. Yes, we don't want to front run anything that we might do in the markets there, Srinjoy. I mean, we're always looking across the curve, trying to figure out what fits best and we'll just -- let's wait until we come to market with that to see what we end up doing."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.\nScott Gammill: Thank you, Malika. Good afternoon, and welcome to Southern Company's fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining me today are Chris Womack, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Dan Tucker, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you, we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent securities filings. In addition, we'll present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn it over to Chris.\nChris Womack : Thank you, Scott. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. 2023 was an exceptional year for Southern Company, a year in which we proved once again that we can do extraordinary things, including delivering strong financial results in the face of unprecedented headwinds and the successful completion of Plant Vogtle Unit 3, the first newly constructed nuclear unit in the United States in over three decades. Since its July 30th in-service date, Unit 3's performance has exceeded our expectations, delivering over 5 million megawatt hours of safe, reliable, carbon-free energy across Georgia. Other noteworthy items for 2023 included, constructive resolution of the Vogtle 3 and 4 prudence process, resolving all issues of reasonableness, prudence and cost recovery; successfully completed construction and commissioning for a brand new 720-megawatt combined cycle plant on schedule and on time at Alabama Power's plant Barry; acquired two new solar projects at Southern Power, which once construction is complete, will add an additional 350-megawatts of carbon-free generation to its portfolio of fully contracted renewable generation; continued progress toward our greenhouse gas emission reduction goals, including our interim goal of a 50% reduction versus 2007 levels by 2030; achieving a 49% reduction in 2023; earned a National Accounts Award for outstanding customer engagement by the Edison Electric Institute and top honors from J.D. Power for residential and business customer satisfaction. And just last week, Southern Company was ranked as the number one most admired electric and gas utility in Fortune magazine's World's Most Admired Companies list for 2024. These achievements reflect our team's steadfast commitment to keep the customers and the communities we are privileged to serve at the center of everything we do. Throughout 2023, our electric and gas franchises continue to excel at the fundamentals and started this year strong as evidenced through our preparations and execution during January's winter storm, Heather, when electricity demands reach all the time winter peaks and Southern Company gas system continue to reliably serving customers throughout severe weather conditions across its four-state territory. Our ability to navigate through such severe weather events further demonstrates how our customers benefit from the combination of outstanding operational performance by each of our utilities and the value of our vertically integrated state-regulated business model. Our state's long-term integrated planning processes, which include adoption of important planning assumptions like a 26% winter reserve margin for our electric utilities benefit our customers by providing a reliable and resilient mix of energy resources. Before turning the call over to Dan for a financial update, I'd like to provide an update on Vogtle Unit 4. We continue to make meaningful progress toward the completion of Unit 4 with initial criticality achieved yesterday. Initial criticality represents a key step during startup whereby operators for the first time safely begin the self-sustaining nuclear reaction to create heat for steam production. As we approach the initial sync with the grid, Unit 4 continues with the remaining start-up and preoperational testing activities that perceive the declaration of in service, which is projected in the second quarter of 2024. Our 2024 adjusted earnings per share guidance range, which Dan will detail, shortly assumes Unit 4 achieves commercial operation in April. Dan, I'll now turn the call over to you.\nDan Tucker: Thanks Chris and good afternoon everyone. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted earnings per share of $3.65 for 2023, which was the very top of our 2023 guidance range. The primary drivers of our performance compared to 2022 are higher utility revenues and lower non-fuel O&M expenses and income taxes, somewhat offset by higher depreciation and interest expenses. Mild weather was also a significant headwind with 2023 marking the mildest year in our history for our electric service territories. Our ability to deliver 2023 adjusted results at the very top of guidance is a great testament to our team and to the resilience and strength of our portfolio of companies. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results compared back to 2022 is included in today's release and earnings package. Turning now to electricity sales in the economy. Weather-adjusted retail electric sales were down 0.4% for 2023 compared to 2022. Strong usage drove commercial sales growth of 1.3% for the year, which was partially offset by lower residential usage with both commercial and residential sales impacted by the return to the office dynamic. We continue to see robust residential customer growth with the addition of over 46,000 residential electric customers and nearly 27,000 residential gas customers. Since 2020, we've added over 200,000 residential electric customers, which represents the highest four-year total in decades. Industrial sales finished down for the year nearly 2%, largely due to continued slowing in housing and construction-related sectors as well as lower sales to chemical companies due to outages and long planned plant closures. Consistent with the drivers detailed in Georgia Power's recently filed 2023 Integrated Resource Plan update, economic development in our Southeast service territory remains incredibly strong. Several years of extraordinary success in attracting new and expanding businesses to our states, underpins our long-term electricity sales forecast. While electricity sales growth is projected to remain around 1% to 2% for 2024 and 2025, growth from 2025 to 2028 is projected to accelerate to an average of approximately 6% annually, with Georgia Power's total retail electric sales growth projected to be approximately 9% annually over this same period. The magnitude and velocity of this growth are significant drivers for the increased capital investments reflected in our current outlook. This projected growth also represents a tremendous opportunity to de-risk our outlook and benefit customers as a substantial projected growth in kilowatt hour sales from new manufacturing facilities and data centers has the potential to put downward pressure on existing customers' rates. Turning now to our earnings projections for 2024 and beyond. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance range for 2024 is $3.95 to $4.05, and our projected long-term adjusted EPS growth rate is 5% to 7% from that range. In early 2021, we provided the investment community with a stable post Vogtle 3 and 4 construction and EPS projection, with an initial and reasonably wide 2024 guidance range. It is perhaps the greatest of understatement to say that the world has changed a lot since early 2021. On a macro basis, we've seen significant inflation and higher and then higher for longer interest rates, which alone has translated to interest expense for 2024 hundreds of millions of dollars higher than any of us assumed three years ago. Additionally, relative to our projection in early 2021, the projected in-service date for Vogtle 4 moved into 2024 from 2023. In the face of these challenges, we've continued to work extremely hard to grow our business and to create value for investors. Compared to our projections in early 2021, our state-regulated utility rate base for 2024 is projected to be approximately $6 billion higher, while lower O&M expenses and higher sales are projected to contribute hundreds of millions of dollars more than previously projected to help maintain affordability and help pay for those investments. We estimated adjusted earnings of $0.90 per share for the first quarter of 2024. Our capital investment plan continues to be well over 95% attributable to our state-regulated utility businesses. The current five-year capital investment forecast, totaling $48 billion, reflects a $5 billion increase in state-regulated utility investments relative to our forecast a year ago. This 12% increase in capital spending reflects our ongoing efforts to further increase the resiliency of our electric and gas networks and our technology infrastructure. It also partially reflects new resources proposed in Georgia Power's 2023 IRP update, about 60% of the brick-and-mortar megawatts proposed. We have maintained our disciplined measured approach to capital forecasting for our state-regulated utility businesses. Given the magnitude of change in our projected sales growth and the timeframe in which new resources are needed to serve higher peak demands, we felt it was appropriate to go ahead and reflect certain new resources in our capital plan. Additionally, our capital investment forecast tend to grow, especially in the later years as the visibility into customer additions improves, regulatory processes unfold compliance obligations evolve and our long-term integrated system planning is refined. While the increases in this year's five-year forecast represent an outsized upward adjustment due to the scale and velocity of the projected growth in the near-term, we do believe it's reasonable to expect a historical trend of capital increases to continue going forward. On its own, our capital investment forecast of $48 billion supports annualized state-regulated rate base growth of approximately 6%, providing a solid foundation for our long-term outlook. Any upside to the capital forecast will simply serve to add durability to an already strong outlook. Strong investment-grade credit ratings remain a priority. We continue to believe that in order to be a high-quality equity investment, a company must also have high-quality credit. As we near completion of Vogtle Unit 4, the reduction in major project construction risk and the improvement in our FFO should strengthen and meaningfully improve our credit profile to help ensure we preserve what we believe will be a positively differentiated profile. We are also turning on our internal equity plans to fund the incremental capital investment at our subsidiaries that I highlighted earlier. These plans typically provide approximately $350 million of new equity annually. Additionally, we'll preserve our financing flexibility and optionality with a continuous focus on preserving and improving shareholder value. For example, we will continue to maintain an at-the-market or ATM plan to partially finance potential additional increases in capital spending in our subsidiaries or potentially, to partially refinance callable hybrid securities, if we determine doing so preserves or improves our credit and long-term EPS objectives. Southern Company strives to deliver a superior risk-adjusted total shareholder return, and we believe the plan that we've laid out supports that objective. Our customer and community-focused business model the growing investments in our premier state-regulated utility franchises and the priority that we place on strong credit quality and our remarkable dividend history all contributes toward making Southern Company a premier investment. Chris, I'll now turn the call back over to you.\nChris Womack: Thank you, Dan. Again, let me say, Southern Company had an exceptional year in 2023. We didn't just meet challenges head on. We rose above them while remaining committed to keeping customers and communities in the center of everything that we do. I am extraordinarily proud of the hard work, the collaboration, the perseverance and the leadership that our teams show throughout the year to enable us to achieve these outstanding results. Having a team prepared to rise to such new heights doesn't just happen. For decades, Southern Company has prioritized investing in our people, with a focus on positioning our leaders and their teams to provide the exceptional service customers expect to deliver the innovative solutions needed in an evolving energy landscape and to support growing the communities we are privileged to serve. As you all know, our company implemented a leadership transition in early 2023. Rather than simply fill a handful of vacant seats, we embraced it as a grand opportunity. During 2023, we facilitated 75 officer level changes throughout the company. The changes brought renewed energy and excitement, and more importantly, and intentionally, the movement served to further strengthen what we believe to be the deepest and best bench in the industry. I am excited about the future of this company, and I'm excited about our team and its ability to deliver the results, all our stakeholders, customers and investors alike expect from Southern Company. Thank you again for joining us this afternoon and for your continued interest in Southern Company. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first phone question is from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nChris Womack : Hey, Shar, welcome. Thank you.\nShar Pourreza : Hey, Chris and Dan. Good afternoon. Just quickly on the new guidance that you rolled forward. Does the new 2024 estimate range still include a Vogtle charge? So should we be adding back $0.05 or so to grow off the 5% to 7% like you've talked about in the past? And sort of that new 6% rate base growth estimate now comes with equity, I guess, what's the comfort level of hitting the midpoint of that EPS growth range, which you just reiterated? Thanks. \nDan Tucker : Yes. Thanks for the question, Shahriar. And I know there's a lot of focus on this. I think we're always fascinated with the precision with which everyone wants to inhale all this down. The -- so let's start with the guidance range. Yes, I think, it absolutely includes impacts from Vogtle 4, not only being in 2024 at all, but certainly going into, as we've assumed in the guidance range, April. I mean, if you add all that up, that's $0.08 of incremental impact on 2024 relative to what it would have been if the project been lined in 2023. And -- but we haven't adjusted a range by that full amount, by any means. And what we're doing is using the flexibility, not unlike what we did in 2023 with the mildest year ever to kind of mitigate that. Those are the kind of mitigations and flexibility items that aren't necessarily available every year. You have to maintain the system, you've got to make sure you're prioritizing service to customers. And so that flexibility is limited. We're using it this year and that will diminish what we have the opportunity to do going forward. But also, I think what's not factored in is a couple of other important nuances. We thought 40 slides was enough, but maybe we needed one more slide to kind of draw how we always think about our guidance range and our growth range. We don't think about the 5% to 7% being off of the midpoint. We've always kind of drawn those trajectories off the top of it and off the bottom of it. So 7% off the top, 5% off the bottom. I think if you do that from this current range, it captures every reasonable estimate that's out there for 2025 and 2026. When it comes to the rate base growth, look, we were at 6% last year. We just added $5 billion of capital to the plan. We didn't add all the capital that we see as possible. That kind of incremental capital additions opportunity still exists. So yeah, our ability to grow rate base, and yeah, it's mitigated ever so slightly by a fraction of a percent of increased shares over time. Our ability to hit our numbers is as solid as it's ever been.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. Okay. That's helpful, Dan. And then just lastly, I know one of your peers has spoken pretty extensively on sort of nuclear PTCs, and obviously expects to receive hundreds of millions of dollars a year to fund sort of that capital plan. I guess, does the plan today -- do you expect to receive anything material on the nuclear PTC fund? Is it part of any of your credit metrics or funding plans? Thanks,\nDan Tucker: Yeah. We -- yes, thanks, Shahriar. We have not factored any cash flow from nuclear PTCs into our outlook. We've got a terrific plan with an improving FFO to debt metric that's several hundred basis points above any of our threshold over time, and frankly improves every year in the forecast that I look at without those nuclear PTCs. Is there the opportunity for us to capture some of those PTCs? We think there very well could be. We're not counting on it. And to the extent we do, we'll flow those to customers to the most practical amount of time possible. And so we're -- it's not going to be a factor in kind of how our metrics or earnings look.\nShar Pourreza: Terrific. Thank you, guys. Super helpful, Dan, really thank you.\nDan Tucker: Yeah. You bet.\nChris Womack: Thanks Shar.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open now.\nChris Womack: Good afternoon, Steve.\nSteve Fleishman: Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon. Hey, Chris, Dan. So just -- I think you've talked about targeting a 17% FFO to debt, which is differentiated. When do you expect you'll be there, let's say, in 2025, when you have first full year of bulk units running? When do you expect to be there?\nDan Tucker: Yeah. So I've always kind of said we see a forecast that gets us to 17-ish, it's the way I've characterized it in the past. So let me tell you where we are, Steve, here today, and I think it's still differentiated and a terrific story and we're doing everything we can to make sure we're being conservative in the way we think about this. So if we just think about Moody's metrics, our actual result for 2023 was 14%. Keep in mind, that's before Vogtle 4 is in service. 2024, with Vogtle in service on the timeline, we believe those metrics will improve by more than 100 basis points in 2024. The weight of the incremental capital that we're deploying and the fact that some of this is kind of long live construction, you think about building new gas plants at Georgia or other things, there's a bit of regulatory lag that weighs a little bit on credit metrics. And as that resolves itself, cash flow improves. So with the forecast that I see go from 14 to over 15 in 2024, and about a 50 to 60 basis point improvement every year after that over time and that's a function of that capital, it's -- we're issuing the equity to continue the improvement. And then there's a little bit of impact in the short-term for under-recovered fuel that as that gets collected and the debt goes away, that also adds to that upward trajectory. So in my five-year forecast, we get kind of in that mid-16 towards 17 range. But again, every year in the five years is an improving story, and still hundreds of basis points above our thresholds.\nSteve Fleishman: Great. Thanks. And my other question, just the -- I mean the -- can you just talk to this growth, particularly, I guess, in Georgia, the 9% a year sales growth, which is at least seems unprecedented, at least for my -- go ahead, Chris.\nChris Womack: No, go ahead, go ahead. Finish your question.\nSteve Fleishman: I guess, just how are you differentiating proposed growth projects between ones that are in your plan or ones that you're holding back from because you're not sure they're going to happen? And just -- is this a conservative risk-adjusted number, or how should I think about that? How are you doing it against your peers because it's so huge?\nChris Womack: Yes, it is an unprecedented growth that we continue to witness from economic development activities. And so yeah, this is a very conservative look. I mean, we look for -- we factor in build permits, building permits in terms of actual announcements of ground has been broken. I mean, so we look at not just companies that are forward looking and making site visits, but there's been some demonstrated commitment that they will, in fact, be building a project in the state. So we go through those thresholds before, we make those filings in terms of being -- having some certainty that these projects are, in fact, real. We've just seen unprecedented economic development activity, say, for the past three years. And we continue to have an aggressive pipeline. But as we go to the commission for this updated IRP, we just factored in those companies, those businesses that has clearly demonstrated and taken actions that we think of – that shows some firmness in their participation, in their operating businesses in the state.\nDan Tucker: Yeah. And I'll just add to that, that the momentum in the economic development activity has continued even since filing that 2023 IRP update. And so thank goodness, we've got a filing in 2025, and we do this periodically. It's going to continue to evolve. There's a lot still lingering out there that -- in our conservative nature, we're not counting on yet, but it's not unlikely.\nChris Womack: Yeah. But Steve, this is a very conservative look as we make these decisions. \nSteve Fleishman: And then just one last thing on this. The 9% since everybody is very focused on data center growth, how much of it is data centers relative to manufacturing or other growth, yeah?\nChris Womack: Data centers represent right now, we think somewhere around 80% of that emerging load.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. Thank you.\nChris Womack: Thanks Steve. Have a good day.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open now.\nCarly Davenport: Hey good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. Hey how are you? Thank you. Maybe just to start on the new five-year plan. Could you just talk a little bit about what drove the assumptions you made around including some of that spend on the incremental resource needs in the Georgia IRP? And then with the commission order sort of expected there in April, how would you think about updating the capital plan if it's necessary after that decision?\nDan Tucker: Yes, Carly, it's a great question. So -- and I think I alluded to this a few minutes ago, it really is about the velocity and magnitude of this growth that we just kind of characterized for Steve. It's right in front of us. These resources are needed sooner than later. And so we think there's -- it was reasonable to kind of break trend for us a little bit and get slightly ahead of regulatory outcome to reflect directionally what's happening. And so just to kind of peel the curtain back a little bit, we were very specific in what we included. If you go back and look at the proposal that Georgia Power put in front of the commission back in the fall, it included a lot of various owned resources. And what we've included in the capital plan is essentially the new combustion turbines, there's three of those, and then two specific storage projects that are kind of located near military bases in -- Air Force base. That leaves hundreds, I think, over 800 megawatts of storage projects and a small storage or solar kind of not included in there. We will get a decision in April, but again, as a reminder, there's a whole another process coming in 2025. So, there may be a degree of clarity in April. There may be further clarity coming out the 2025 process. And as those play out, we'll continue to obviously keep the investment community apprised and update our projections accordingly.\nCarly Davenport: Great. Thank you for that. That's super helpful. And then maybe just as we think about executing on Vogtle Unit 4. Just any insights on kind of the near-term milestones that we might get updates on that we can gauge project progress there? And then to the extent that timeline does slip beyond kind of the April that's embedded into current guidance, can you talk a little bit about some of the levers that you might have to pull there to sort of offset those impacts?\nChris Womack: Yes. Carly, let me start by saying with initial criticality achieved yesterday, we continue to progress through testing and start-up. The next major milestone is thinking to the grid, and that could occur later this month. We expect Unit 4 completion during the second quarter. And as we take in account the experiences we got from last year with our Unit 3, as we look at moving through Unit 4, and we could have worked through these units -- how we work through these issues that could arise. But we view this as a long-term investment and we'll make sure we're taking time to get it right. But right now, as we look at where we are, we are planning on the Unit being online in April, and we think we have a number of weeks of margin to accomplish that objective.\nDan Tucker: Yes. And Carly, I'll speak to the flexibility. I mean, obviously, I mentioned earlier, we're kind of already deploying some of that flexibility to address what we expect to be us here today in April in service because beyond that, we've laid out, it's roughly $0.03 for every month, but that's partially why we have a range, right? I mean it's a $0.10 range out there. So, it could be a function of moving us within the range for the year or depending on the circumstances as the year plays out, whether it's weather or something else, we might have some greater degree of flexibility. It's just too early in the year to really be that detailed about exactly how that might play out.\nCarly Davenport: All right. Appreciate all that color. Thank you, both.\nChris Womack: You bet, Carly.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open now.\nChris Womack: Hi, Julien.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good afternoon. Hey, pleasure, guys. Thanks so much for the time. Appreciate it. A couple of quick questions, following up on what you guys have said of late. Just on this big number on sales growth. Just to clarify, I mean, in your forecast, I know you've got this pending IRP that technically lines up against that sales. Are you seeing an improving ROE in the outlook? Or is this really underpinned at this point by just the IRP and the extent to which the IRP doesn't fully reflect that sales outlook? Is there something more to go as you work through the process? Question one, if you will.\nDan Tucker: So I'm not sure where you're headed with improved ROE.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Just from improving returns from the additional sales, if you will.\nDan Tucker: Certainly, not improving returns from an overall, say, regulated utility perspective. From a -- we really view that as the opportunity to kind of put downward pressure on existing customers' rates. I mean, our objective from an ROE perspective is regular, predictable, sustainable, I think you'll continue to see it play out that way. Just to be clear, Julien, on the sales growth that we've laid out here, so this is roughly 6% in the long term for Southern that 9% number for Georgia Power, this is actually based on a more conservative view than what's in the IRP update because the IRP update had to put some degree of expectation for additional success from an economic development perspective so that we do stay ahead of this from a resource perspective. It's not a huge differential, but what it also kind of reinforces is as this continues to play out, those numbers have the potential to continue to go up.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yeah. Excellent. And then just pivoting back to the FFO to debt quickly, I mean, the 17% that you guys were talking about once, I mean, what is -- has that changed at all? Just in terms of how you're thinking about pro forma Vogtle 4 coming on?\nDan Tucker: No, nothing's changed in terms of what I believe the financial profile supports which, again, my objectives, I've said this before, I think our parent company being a BBB+, kind of the A category for all the utilities, I think the profile we see ahead of us fully supports that. The only thing that's changed is a slightly slower ramp-up in those metrics because of the incremental capital that we're deploying. But in terms of where we stand relative to any of our thresholds, it's several hundred basis points above any of those in every year, and every year improves.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Wonderful. And then just quickly on the reactor cooler pumps, I know there was a little bit of talk in the K here. What's sort of the status on V4? And then just to the extent to which that there is some root cause impact on some of the other -- there's a need to evaluate the adjacent reactor cooler pumps, if you will. I know there's some language in the K on this.\nChris Womack: Yes. And so yes, we've done all the analysis, we sent the pump back to the manufacturer. And we think we identified the cause of the issue, but a root cause analysis has not been performed yet. But we have tested all the other pumps. And with the new pump, we made sure there were not any similar issues, but we think we're in pretty good shape with the pumps as we go forward.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Okay. So stay tuned on that front. Thank you guys very much. I really appreciate it.\nChris Womack: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Nick Campanella with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nChris Womack: Hi, Nick.\nNick Campanella: Hey, good morning or good afternoon. I am sorry.\nChris Womack: Good afternoon.\nNick Campanella: I guess just a follow-up on the question that Julien had on the root cause. I think you just mentioned the possibility of having to go look back at Unit 3 pumps in the Vogtle. And just what's the actual risk – line? And when is that no longer going to be an issue?\nChris Womack: I guess, as we have looked at the pump that we sent to the manufacturers, as we identified what we thought the issue was, we think it's not an issue with the other pumps. I mean, we test the other pumps. We assess the pump, the new pump that we installed. And we think we just have a good handle. And on these pumps, I think you consider the run time. I think that provides good color to kind of, I guess, the confidence we have in the pump and what we've identified as the issues and things we have to do to make sure we don't have similar issues as we go forward.\nDan Tucker: Yes. I think globally, there's 24 of these things running like a champ right now.\nNick Campanella: Absolutely. Yes, that's helpful. And then just on the capital plan, and reflecting roughly 60% of the IRP, I know that you kind of get a decision in the first half of this year. So just how do we kind of think about tweaks to the financing plan? Is it just going to be another fourth quarter update this time next year? Or is there a mid-period opportunity in the cards?\nDan Tucker: Look, none of these regulatory outcomes will be -- they'll all be in the light of day. I think it will be clear what's approved and what's yet to be approved. I kind of laid out what we've included already, which is those combustion turbines and two very specific storage projects. And so I think we'll be able to provide color along the way. We'll certainly do more formal updates every year as we normally do, but I think there'll be interim opportunities. And the other interim opportunity that will continue to exist is we've remained extremely conservative when it comes to owning in renewables in any of our electric service territories. We also are very optimistic that, that will happen. And as that gets clarity, we'll make sure that, that's known as well.\nChris Womack: But you'll also see great transparency through this process, man, as the commission and Georgia works through the process, many staff is filing testimony today, and they may have a different perspective. But you'll see that process play out and that leads us to the decision in April by the commission. But you've seen these IRP processes before. So those processes will continue as we go forward, and you'll see real time kind of how it unfolds.\nNick Campanella: All right. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open now.\nChris Womack: Hey, David.\nDavid Arcaro: Thanks so much. Hey, thank you. Let's see. Thinking about that load growth trajectory, is 6% rate base growth still the right kind of parameter to think about longer term? 6% load growth, 6% rate base growth, is that enough to kind of handle the system strain, the generation need to strain on the T&D system over time? Or is there potential upward growth rate pressure on that rate base growth number as you get into later years of this decade?\nDan Tucker: Yes. Look, I think, Dave, what we've tried to imply is there certainly is upward potential here. We've remained incredibly conservative and measured in how we forecasted. We're not trying to get too far ahead of any regulatory processes. We'll get these decisions in April. We'll have a 2025 process. We believe there's more economic development activity that is likely to come to fruition. And so given all of that, it is certainly not unreasonable that our capital budget will continue to rise to serve that incremental load. And so there certainly could be upward using your words, pressure on that rate base.\nDavid Arcaro : Got it. That makes sense. And I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on how you're thinking about the rate impacts, coming from that load growth? Are these low-priced new commercial customers when you're thinking about data center and manufacturing customers, such that there is a lot of grid investment that has to be covered by others within the system or other opportunities here? It sounded like you kind of see the opposite where you're bringing in a lot of revenue that ends up being downward pressure on the rest of the system. So I'm wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on how you see rates progressing over time?\nDan Tucker : Yes. No, go ahead, Chris.\nChris Womack: No, we do expect to see rate decreases for our customers with these additional sales and the customer growth that we'll experience. We think that should more than offset the cost of the resources needed to serve. And so we -- affordability is something we pay a lot of attention to, and there are things we do internal. And we think that one of the benefits of this sales growth is having the opportunity to put downward pressure on rates for our customers across the board. And so that's kind of how we see it and how we evaluate each project. I want to make sure that is, in fact, putting downward pressure on rates.\nDan Tucker : If you think about where probably every utility company was a year ago, one of the greatest risks facing all of this was affordability. We see this as a tremendous opportunity to derisk our outlook.\nDavid Arcaro : Excellent. Thanks for that. Really helpful. Appreciate it.\nChris Womack: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nChris Womack: Hey, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi. Good afternoon.\nChris Womack: Good afternoon.\nJeremy Tonet: Just wanted to come in, I guess, on the debt funding side, if I could start. I understand the Georgia Power debt funding increase driven by the IRP there. But at the holdco, just wondering what's the main contributor to the kind of big step up there of expected debt issuance? It looks like several billion in the 2024 plan now, and I think it was much less than that before. So just kind of curious, I guess, on the holdco debt issuance step-up expectations.\nDan Tucker : Yes. So in terms of the change kind of planned versus plan, Jeremy, it's largely driven by the CapEx as well, right? I mean, ultimately, the parent company is funding Georgia Power's equity contribution. And while we're financing that partially with new equity through our plans, certainly -- it's certainly not all being funded directly with new shares. So there's incremental debt there. And then just the overall magnitude of the parent company issuances is largely driven by maturities. If you look a couple of pages beyond, there's, I think, over $5 billion worth of maturities in the same time period. So the amount that's kind of new money is much smaller.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Thanks for that. And just curious if you're able to share any thoughts on the Georgia PSC elections here. Just as far as from what you guys see inside the state for those pending elections. Do you expect the ballot in the elections to happen before the November general election? Or do you think it all kind of comes in November? Just kind of curious, I guess, how you think timing could shape up there?\nChris Womack: I have no idea. I mean that matter is still in the court system. And so we'll observe it, just like you are. But I have no insight into how that's going to play out at this time. \nJeremy Tonet: Got it. And just a quick last one, if I could. If you guys are running an RFP process in the Georgia IRP, and how you think Southern Power -- Georgia Power stacks up, I guess, in RFP process there?\nDan Tucker: Look, just in answering that, generally, Jeremy, I mean, and we've said this before, the IRA is going to position all of our electric utilities to be much more competitive in these self-build options when it comes to resources, whether or not it plays out in this particular RFP, or it's a subsequent RFP, or it's a customer-specific siding, those things will happen over time. But it's also likely a function of something later in the plan. So not a 2024, 2025, maybe not even 2026 kind of resource. We're talking really towards the back end of the plan where that becomes a real opportunity.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That’s helpful. I’ll leave it there. Thanks.\nChris Womack: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open now.\nChris Womack: Hey, Durgesh.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey, good afternoon team. Just -- is there a way for us to give us a range? And I understand if you can't. But just in terms of the current capital plan, was that the Georgia IRP? What I'm after is what looks like a successful outcome there as we await the April decision? Just trying to see what is baked into the plan and what to look for in that April decision?\nDan Tucker: Yeah. It's a fair question, Durgesh. But this is where I want to stop short of getting ahead of any regulatory processes here. We've, kind of, characterized in terms of the megawatts that we've included that it's roughly 60% of the brick-and-mortar megawatts that were proposed. And so the best way for me to characterize it without getting ahead of anything is just say that the incremental capital associated with what we didn't include won't be lost in the rounding. It's a pretty meaningful number.\nDurgesh Chopra: Understood. I appreciate that, Dan. And then as we think about just along those lines, incremental CapEx upside. Is there a rule of thumbs, again, just for our models, high level, how should we think about it getting financed? You've got some strong load growth. But when we're thinking about higher CapEx, what percentage could be equity finance versus debt? Any guidance there?\nDan Tucker: Yeah. I think what we've done with this update is pretty representative of how we think about additional opportunities. So we added $5 billion of capital of this plan, let's call that $1 billion a year on average. We've added roughly $350 million of equity every year. So that 35% to 40% range is representative of our consolidated equity ratio and represents pretty well what we think is necessary to maintain if not marginally improve, but really just maintain the credit profile that's already in a really good place.\nDurgesh Chopra: Very clear. Thank you so much. Appreciate the time guys.\nChris Womack: Thanks, Durgesh.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nChris Womack: Hi, Andrew.\nAndrew Weisel: Hi. Good afternoon. A couple of quick follow-up questions, really. One, just to clarify, the equity of $350 million per year. That's through 2026 in the slides. It kind of sounds like you're saying that's through 2028. Should we think of that as just a run rate of $350 million per year going forward and potentially more if there's more CapEx?\nDan Tucker: Yes. So, what that $350 million represents is us turning on what we refer to as our internal plan. So, it's issuing new shares through our DRIP, through our 401(k), and that's about the run rate. And it just happens to match up pretty well with the needs associated with the $5 billion of incremental capital. We typically also maintain an at the market plan as flexibility. And so to the extent there's incremental CapEx that emerges, which again, is certainly reasonably possible given everything we've described, the ATM's the source that we'll tap into to help finance that.\nAndrew Weisel: Okay. Very good. Next, on the CapEx update. Just to clarify, and sorry if I missed it. Does that include anything for Alabama Solar? Or would that be incremental?\nDan Tucker: Yes. No, that would be incremental. There's still no new rate-based solar included. So, we've remained conservative in terms of our projections there in the outlook. And hey, just going back, Andrew, real quickly to the equity question. Just to kind of point out since maybe it wasn't clear because we only put a three-year financing plan out there, yes, leaving the plans on every year. And on average, kind of the average increase to shares every year is a fraction of a percent. So, that's also kind of in the rounding.\nAndrew Weisel: Sounds good. One last one, if I may. Dividend growth, you've been very consistent at $0.08 per share, about 3%. Given the CapEx outlook, is there any point in time at which you might reconsider the trajectory?\nDan Tucker: Another terrific question. So, we had kind of alluded to the possibility of reevaluating the rate of dividend growth once we got Vogtle 4 into service, and kind of had -- we're kind of in a steady state and into the kind of below 70% somewhere. Given our current circumstances where were we are, in a place of issuing equity, perhaps one of the most efficient sources of equity is to remain modest in the way we continue to increase the dividend. So, I think for the foreseeable future, the trajectory we've been on is a reasonable expectation for the trajectory we'll remain on.\nAndrew Weisel: Very clear. Thank you so much.\nDan Tucker: You bet.\nChris Womack: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nAnthony Crowdell: Hey good morning Chris, good morning Dan. If I could just pitch up one quick one on the data centers and I guess, the load growth. It seems like we finally are going to get some load growth in this sector, and we're all looking at data centers has helped. But it seems that maybe the rate design question, we're all trying to figure out typically a lower-margin customer, large investment requirement. And earlier, you touched on maybe helping with some customer bills. I just -- my question is, if you go deeper into that on -- is it going to be bigger bill impact and bigger fights and rate design or you don't think that's an issue? \nChris Womack: I mean there's always -- there will always be issues. But I think as we look at increased sales, as we look at growth in customers, and then as we work with these new customers, we think this provides us the opportunity to have downward pressure on rates. And so we will work with these customers in terms of their pricing. But once again, I just go back to the fundamentals of increased sales opportunity and this customer growth, how that supports the opportunity for us to put downward pressure all across our customer base to see downward pressure on rates. I mean, we'll evaluate each customer to ensure that, in fact, does happen, that they put downward pressure on overall rates across the company.\nDan Tucker: Yeah. And Anthony, what it appears a lot of these data centers are beginning to do is prioritize reliable, resilient service over many other things. That gives us the opportunity to price it appropriately for the benefit of everyone else.\nChris Womack: And, yeah, we'll look at the size, the demand, the timing, there are other factors that will go into making sure that we price service appropriately to those customers.\nAnthony Crowdell: Great. Thanks for taking my question.\nChris Womack: You're welcome. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Please go ahead. Your line is open now.\nChris Womack: Hi, Angie.\nAgnieszka Storozynski: Good morning. Great. I guess -- I know that everybody is asking questions on data centers, but I'm just -- just again, maybe just taking a step back. So when somebody wants to locate a data center in your service territory, do they just get connected to the grid? Or do they develop their own power sources? Do you actually see that they, for instance, have some preference for non-emitting resources. Do they use you more as a backup power source. Again, just -- just, again, trying to understand the dynamics of those data centers being added to in Georgia.\nChris Womack: Angie, there are a lot of considerations that go into that decision. And yeah, we want to connect them to our grid. And yeah, we'll have conversations with them about renewable resources and the mix. But those are conversations that we do have with them, recognizing what upgrade may be made on the system, locations, where they are. So there are a lot of kind of really detailed conversations, engineering conversations that go into making those final decisions that also then ultimately impact the pricing for that service. \nAgnieszka Storozynski: But again, it's not self-supply, right? So they use Georgia Power, for example, as a first source of power.\nChris Womack: Absolutely. Yes, that's correct.\nAgnieszka Storozynski: Okay. And then secondly, again, I know this question has been asked over and over. Just hard to believe that the load growth is not having a bigger impact on your earnings growth? And again, I don't even imagine this is like an emerging markets sort of pace of load growth, especially for Georgia and those outer years, and yet there's no impact from -- again, from our vantage point on your earnings growth. Is it just because the interest expense drag is so pronounced that it absorbs the help that you're getting from higher load growth?\nDan Tucker: Yes, Angie, it's a few things. Certainly, relative to where we were a year ago, and I think we've said this before, in a higher for longer environment, certainly, interest is a bigger headwind going forward. But the bigger dynamic in your question is around what we're actually investing in to serve this load or why we're investing. So keep in mind, the 6% for Southern Company sales growth and 9% for Georgia Power, that's kilowatt hour usage. That's the growth in the total kilowatt hours used. What we invest to do is serve the peaks. And so that looks a little different than the 24/7. We've got a lot of resources. We just may have to incrementally add resources to serve the peaks, and that's what you're seeing largely in the capital deployment. And net-net, we're comfortably in that 5% to 7% growth range.\nAgnieszka Storozynski: Okay. Understood. Thank you.\nChris Womack: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Paul Fremont with Ladenburg. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nChris Womack: How are you doing, Paul?\nPaul Fremont: Great. Congratulations on the good quarter.\nChris Womack: Thank you very much.\nPaul Fremont: Just to clarify, if you were not to get sort of the higher growth rate in sales after 2025, would that have an impact or change -- potentially change your 5% to 7% growth target? \nDan Tucker: No.\nPaul Fremont: Okay. Great. And then I noticed that the gas capital spending is roughly unchanged. Can you sort of share with us what you're anticipating is going to happen in Illinois? And is there spending that's being shifted from Nicor to any of the other gas subsidiary?\nChris Womack: And yes, I think you got it just right. I mean, we see the opportunities to have some increased capital spending in Atlanta around the operations here in Georgia. So we think that allows that gas investments to be stable going forward. So I think you've spoken to it just right.\nDan Tucker: Yes. And any changes in Illinois are modest, to be fair. I mean -- and the outcome there for us, while disappointing, also provided a bit of a road map as to how to be successful going forward in navigating that jurisdiction in terms of just the things we've got to make sure we do as we deploy capital. And keep in mind, a huge, vast majority of the capital that's deployed for Nicor Gas is compliance related. And so there's only so much to kind of not do in the first place.\nPaul Fremont: Great. And then my last question. I mean, generally speaking, when we think of EPS growth, with respect to rate base growth, there tends to be dilution to the rate base to the level of rate base growth because a portion or the equity portion is funded either by parent debt or by parent equity. So can you help us sort of understand at 6% rate base growth, is it possible for you to achieve? Or how would you achieve sort of the high end of your growth target? \nDan Tucker: Yes. Great question, Paul. So again, we were at 6% growth last year in rate base. We've added $5 billion of incremental capital to that. It's -- we kind of characterize it as approximately 6, but then also the shares we're issuing, and I think I mentioned this earlier, was that equates to a fraction of a percentage and it's kind of just in the rounding. We feel very comfortable that net-net, how all these things stack up is a conservative achievable forecast.\nPaul Fremont: Great. That’s it for me. Thank you very much.\nChris Womack: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTravis Miller: Hello, everyone. Thank you.\nChris Womack: Thanks Travis.\nDan Tucker : Thanks Travis.\nTravis Miller: You've answered almost all of my questions. I do want to follow-up on that dividend, it was one of my questions. Just to clarify what you said, you would expect the dividend growth to stay below earnings growth for at least a couple of more years. Did I hear that correctly?\nDan Tucker : Yes. Yes, Travis. You did. And so again, our cadence of growth has been $0.08 per year for several years. I think it's reasonable to expect that to continue, of course, it's all subject to the Board's oversight and approval. But what that will do is take us during this high period of CapEx, which hopefully goes on for a very long period of time, brings us comfortably down into the 60s from a payout ratio perspective. And so that's a good place to be, and we'll evaluate it every year with what the forecast looks like and what's appropriate. Right now, I think the reasonable expectation is that continued modest growth, which is just below 3%.\nTravis Miller: Yes. Okay, very good. And then obviously, a lot of talk about the demand growth. Put another way, what does demand growth mean for operating cost growth? Is there a tight correlation there if you get 6% or whatever percent annual demand growth? Should we also see a similar increase in operating costs? Or is there not a link there?\nDan Tucker : Yes. There's certainly a relationship, I wouldn't call it a correlation, but to the extent we're building a new gas plant, certainly, that comes along with incremental O&M to the extent we're building new transmission distribution lines, there's some maintenance component to that. But that's also part of the cost structure that we're ensuring these new rates and revenues will cover such that the net result is the opportunity to put downward pressure on the existing rates.\nTravis Miller: Okay. Got it. Thanks so much. That's all I had.\nChris Womack: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ryan Levine with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRyan Levine: Hi, everybody.\nChris Womack: How are you doing?\nRyan Levine: Good. How are you? With Vogtle's COD targeted for April freeing up some management attention and the personnel changes that were highlighted, do you see any meaningful opportunities to reduce O&M spending below the current guidance as time progresses? Or are these initiatives tabled, given all the opportunity in Georgia by the IRP process?\nChris Womack: No. I mean, we're always looking across our hand and finding ways to be more efficient. I mean, so there's ongoing efforts to -- once again, as we look at affordability, I mean, we think about the opportunities to keep -- to drive rates from pricing down because of sales growth and because of customer growth, but also making sure that we're focused on looking internal in terms of being more efficient and finding ways to also drive down the cost of our O&M expenses. Also making sure, we take full advantage of fuel pricing. I mean, you see where natural gas prices are now. So looking across the entire portfolio, I mean, that is an ongoing continuous exercise that we'll always focus on in terms of finding ways to drive down O&M and find ways to be more efficient.\nDan Tucker : Yes. And just as a nuance, all the costs associated with completing Vogtle 3 and 4 is a capital cost. And so those aren't O&M costs that are an opportunity to reduce.\nChris Womack: Yes. And the last thing I'd add, even though we've had this focus on Vogtle, but it hasn't kept us from paying attention to the fundamentals, to making sure that we provide the service that customers expect, but also being focused on the cost of our product.\nRyan Levine: Okay. And then what's the peak hour load growth forecast in Georgia? And how much lower is that than the total kilowatt hour growth number that you cited? And as you're looking to execute on this plan, how -- are there any limitations with supply chains that could constrain growth opportunities via the IRP process?\nDan Tucker: Yeah. Look, on supply chain, I think we're in terrific shape, given our scale and just -- we've kind of seen this coming for a little while to the point where we can deploy the resources needed. On your peak question, we'll have to follow-up with you on that, Ryan. Just let's connect with the Investor Relations team and get you an answer then.\nRyan Levine: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.\nDan Tucker: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nChris Womack: Hi, Paul.\nPaul Patterson: Hi. Good afternoon. Congratulations on this these opportunities that you guys have. Just with respect to the data center stuff, I mean, a; you did indicate in your prepared remarks, it seemed that this was based on actual activity, physical construction activity, et cetera. Is it correct to assume that these guys -- these data centers, et cetera, have a price in mind? I mean, they wouldn't be doing this. I mean, obviously, they're using a large amount of electricity. It's part of the economics of their determination to move that this -- that they know how much they're going to be essentially paying for power if they're doing this, correct?\nChris Womack: I think there is -- yes, I mean, they may not know exactly what the price will be. But once again, as we sit with them, understanding their needs, what their desires are and the level of service, I mean that all goes into consideration of what the ultimate price will be. I mean, the value, location, reliability, resiliency, all of those things go into consideration as we kind of price these projects out. And so that's a part of the negotiation, that's part of the conversation that we have with it.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. In some jurisdictions, because they have their own backup power, because they have to be there in case there is an outage or something, they have to get approval from regulatory commissions, their respective state regulatory commissions. Is that the case in Georgia?\nChris Womack: No. I mean, like I said, I mean, we will -- I mean…\nDan Tucker: Yeah, there's some customer-sided programs that have been proposed in the IRP, Paul, that those are being evaluated and those serve the same purpose, but it's not the dynamic that you're describing in those other states.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. Then just roughly speaking, when we're talking about the average data center rate versus the system rate, is there a rule of thumb as to where that kind of is? Do you follow what I'm saying? In other words, I mean how much of a percentage of the average system rate for Georgia Power, let's say, with a data center customer be roughly, I mean, just roughly speaking, you're getting?\nChris Womack: I don't think so. I think we may be better informed as we bring some more projects online. Right now, I think -- I don't think that would be the case. And plus it could be trade secrets as well, so.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. Then just finally, when we're looking at 2026, 2027 and 2028 in that 9% number, for instance, for Georgia Power, does that go up a lot? In other words, is it kind of -- I mean, is 2026 -- is 2028 a lot higher than 2026, if you follow what I'm saying? In other words, it's a three-year period, the number jumps up a lot in that period? Do you follow what I'm saying? In other words, is it roughly the –ratable over that period of time? Or is this sort of a hockey stick in terms of what you see in terms of demand?\nDan Tucker: Yes. It's fairly ratable, Paul. It's obviously not perfectly linear by any means. But that -- the significant load really begins to come in, in, say, late 2025 and into 2026, which is why a lot of the resource proposals you see at Georgia Power are to really serve the 2026-2027 winter peak to make sure they're in place for that, and then it continues to grow from there.\nPaul Patterson: Thanks so much and congratulations.\nChris Womack: Thank you.\nDan Tucker: Thanks Paul.\nOperator: Thank you. And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks?\nChris Womack: Again, let me say, Southern Company had an exceptional year in 2023. And I am really excited about the future of this company. Let me thank everybody for joining us today, and wish everybody a happy day, and thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Southern Company fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chris Womack",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. 2023 was an exceptional year for Southern Company, a year in which we proved once again that we can do extraordinary things, including delivering strong financial results in the face of unprecedented headwinds and the successful completion of Plant Vogtle Unit 3, the first newly constructed nuclear unit in the United States in over three decades. Since its July 30th in-service date, Unit 3's performance has exceeded our expectations, delivering over 5 million megawatt hours of safe, reliable, carbon-free energy across Georgia. Other noteworthy items for 2023 included, constructive resolution of the Vogtle 3 and 4 prudence process, resolving all issues of reasonableness, prudence and cost recovery; successfully completed construction and commissioning for a brand new 720-megawatt combined cycle plant on schedule and on time at Alabama Power's plant Barry; acquired two new solar projects at Southern Power, which once construction is complete, will add an additional 350-megawatts of carbon-free generation to its portfolio of fully contracted renewable generation; continued progress toward our greenhouse gas emission reduction goals, including our interim goal of a 50% reduction versus 2007 levels by 2030; achieving a 49% reduction in 2023; earned a National Accounts Award for outstanding customer engagement by the Edison Electric Institute and top honors from J.D. Power for residential and business customer satisfaction. And just last week, Southern Company was ranked as the number one most admired electric and gas utility in Fortune magazine's World's Most Admired Companies list for 2024. These achievements reflect our team's steadfast commitment to keep the customers and the communities we are privileged to serve at the center of everything we do. Throughout 2023, our electric and gas franchises continue to excel at the fundamentals and started this year strong as evidenced through our preparations and execution during January's winter storm, Heather, when electricity demands reach all the time winter peaks and Southern Company gas system continue to reliably serving customers throughout severe weather conditions across its four-state territory. Our ability to navigate through such severe weather events further demonstrates how our customers benefit from the combination of outstanding operational performance by each of our utilities and the value of our vertically integrated state-regulated business model. Our state's long-term integrated planning processes, which include adoption of important planning assumptions like a 26% winter reserve margin for our electric utilities benefit our customers by providing a reliable and resilient mix of energy resources. Before turning the call over to Dan for a financial update, I'd like to provide an update on Vogtle Unit 4. We continue to make meaningful progress toward the completion of Unit 4 with initial criticality achieved yesterday. Initial criticality represents a key step during startup whereby operators for the first time safely begin the self-sustaining nuclear reaction to create heat for steam production. As we approach the initial sync with the grid, Unit 4 continues with the remaining start-up and preoperational testing activities that perceive the declaration of in service, which is projected in the second quarter of 2024. Our 2024 adjusted earnings per share guidance range, which Dan will detail, shortly assumes Unit 4 achieves commercial operation in April. Dan, I'll now turn the call over to you. Thank you, Dan. Again, let me say, Southern Company had an exceptional year in 2023. We didn't just meet challenges head on. We rose above them while remaining committed to keeping customers and communities in the center of everything that we do. I am extraordinarily proud of the hard work, the collaboration, the perseverance and the leadership that our teams show throughout the year to enable us to achieve these outstanding results. Having a team prepared to rise to such new heights doesn't just happen. For decades, Southern Company has prioritized investing in our people, with a focus on positioning our leaders and their teams to provide the exceptional service customers expect to deliver the innovative solutions needed in an evolving energy landscape and to support growing the communities we are privileged to serve. As you all know, our company implemented a leadership transition in early 2023. Rather than simply fill a handful of vacant seats, we embraced it as a grand opportunity. During 2023, we facilitated 75 officer level changes throughout the company. The changes brought renewed energy and excitement, and more importantly, and intentionally, the movement served to further strengthen what we believe to be the deepest and best bench in the industry. I am excited about the future of this company, and I'm excited about our team and its ability to deliver the results, all our stakeholders, customers and investors alike expect from Southern Company. Thank you again for joining us this afternoon and for your continued interest in Southern Company. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Hey, Shar, welcome. Thank you. Thanks Shar. Good afternoon, Steve. No, go ahead, go ahead. Finish your question. Yes, it is an unprecedented growth that we continue to witness from economic development activities. And so yeah, this is a very conservative look. I mean, we look for -- we factor in build permits, building permits in terms of actual announcements of ground has been broken. I mean, so we look at not just companies that are forward looking and making site visits, but there's been some demonstrated commitment that they will, in fact, be building a project in the state. So we go through those thresholds before, we make those filings in terms of being -- having some certainty that these projects are, in fact, real. We've just seen unprecedented economic development activity, say, for the past three years. And we continue to have an aggressive pipeline. But as we go to the commission for this updated IRP, we just factored in those companies, those businesses that has clearly demonstrated and taken actions that we think of – that shows some firmness in their participation, in their operating businesses in the state. Yeah. But Steve, this is a very conservative look as we make these decisions. Data centers represent right now, we think somewhere around 80% of that emerging load. Thanks Steve. Have a good day. Yes. Carly, let me start by saying with initial criticality achieved yesterday, we continue to progress through testing and start-up. The next major milestone is thinking to the grid, and that could occur later this month. We expect Unit 4 completion during the second quarter. And as we take in account the experiences we got from last year with our Unit 3, as we look at moving through Unit 4, and we could have worked through these units -- how we work through these issues that could arise. But we view this as a long-term investment and we'll make sure we're taking time to get it right. But right now, as we look at where we are, we are planning on the Unit being online in April, and we think we have a number of weeks of margin to accomplish that objective. You bet, Carly. Hi, Julien. Yes. And so yes, we've done all the analysis, we sent the pump back to the manufacturer. And we think we identified the cause of the issue, but a root cause analysis has not been performed yet. But we have tested all the other pumps. And with the new pump, we made sure there were not any similar issues, but we think we're in pretty good shape with the pumps as we go forward. Thank you. Hi, Nick. Good afternoon. I guess, as we have looked at the pump that we sent to the manufacturers, as we identified what we thought the issue was, we think it's not an issue with the other pumps. I mean, we test the other pumps. We assess the pump, the new pump that we installed. And we think we just have a good handle. And on these pumps, I think you consider the run time. I think that provides good color to kind of, I guess, the confidence we have in the pump and what we've identified as the issues and things we have to do to make sure we don't have similar issues as we go forward. But you'll also see great transparency through this process, man, as the commission and Georgia works through the process, many staff is filing testimony today, and they may have a different perspective. But you'll see that process play out and that leads us to the decision in April by the commission. But you've seen these IRP processes before. So those processes will continue as we go forward, and you'll see real time kind of how it unfolds. Hey, David. No, we do expect to see rate decreases for our customers with these additional sales and the customer growth that we'll experience. We think that should more than offset the cost of the resources needed to serve. And so we -- affordability is something we pay a lot of attention to, and there are things we do internal. And we think that one of the benefits of this sales growth is having the opportunity to put downward pressure on rates for our customers across the board. And so that's kind of how we see it and how we evaluate each project. I want to make sure that is, in fact, putting downward pressure on rates. Thank you. Hey, Jeremy. Good afternoon. I have no idea. I mean that matter is still in the court system. And so we'll observe it, just like you are. But I have no insight into how that's going to play out at this time. Thank you. Hey, Durgesh. Thanks, Durgesh. Hi, Andrew. Thank you. I mean there's always -- there will always be issues. But I think as we look at increased sales, as we look at growth in customers, and then as we work with these new customers, we think this provides us the opportunity to have downward pressure on rates. And so we will work with these customers in terms of their pricing. But once again, I just go back to the fundamentals of increased sales opportunity and this customer growth, how that supports the opportunity for us to put downward pressure all across our customer base to see downward pressure on rates. I mean, we'll evaluate each customer to ensure that, in fact, does happen, that they put downward pressure on overall rates across the company. And, yeah, we'll look at the size, the demand, the timing, there are other factors that will go into making sure that we price service appropriately to those customers. You're welcome. Thank you. Hi, Angie. Angie, there are a lot of considerations that go into that decision. And yeah, we want to connect them to our grid. And yeah, we'll have conversations with them about renewable resources and the mix. But those are conversations that we do have with them, recognizing what upgrade may be made on the system, locations, where they are. So there are a lot of kind of really detailed conversations, engineering conversations that go into making those final decisions that also then ultimately impact the pricing for that service. Absolutely. Yes, that's correct. Thank you. How are you doing, Paul? Thank you very much. And yes, I think you got it just right. I mean, we see the opportunities to have some increased capital spending in Atlanta around the operations here in Georgia. So we think that allows that gas investments to be stable going forward. So I think you've spoken to it just right. Thank you. Thanks Travis. Thank you. How are you doing? No. I mean, we're always looking across our hand and finding ways to be more efficient. I mean, so there's ongoing efforts to -- once again, as we look at affordability, I mean, we think about the opportunities to keep -- to drive rates from pricing down because of sales growth and because of customer growth, but also making sure that we're focused on looking internal in terms of being more efficient and finding ways to also drive down the cost of our O&M expenses. Also making sure, we take full advantage of fuel pricing. I mean, you see where natural gas prices are now. So looking across the entire portfolio, I mean, that is an ongoing continuous exercise that we'll always focus on in terms of finding ways to drive down O&M and find ways to be more efficient. Yes. And the last thing I'd add, even though we've had this focus on Vogtle, but it hasn't kept us from paying attention to the fundamentals, to making sure that we provide the service that customers expect, but also being focused on the cost of our product. Hi, Paul. I think there is -- yes, I mean, they may not know exactly what the price will be. But once again, as we sit with them, understanding their needs, what their desires are and the level of service, I mean that all goes into consideration of what the ultimate price will be. I mean, the value, location, reliability, resiliency, all of those things go into consideration as we kind of price these projects out. And so that's a part of the negotiation, that's part of the conversation that we have with it. No. I mean, like I said, I mean, we will -- I mean... I don't think so. I think we may be better informed as we bring some more projects online. Right now, I think -- I don't think that would be the case. And plus it could be trade secrets as well, so. Thank you. Again, let me say, Southern Company had an exceptional year in 2023. And I am really excited about the future of this company. Let me thank everybody for joining us today, and wish everybody a happy day, and thank you very much."

            "name": "Dan Tucker",
            "content": "Thanks Chris and good afternoon everyone. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted earnings per share of $3.65 for 2023, which was the very top of our 2023 guidance range. The primary drivers of our performance compared to 2022 are higher utility revenues and lower non-fuel O&M expenses and income taxes, somewhat offset by higher depreciation and interest expenses. Mild weather was also a significant headwind with 2023 marking the mildest year in our history for our electric service territories. Our ability to deliver 2023 adjusted results at the very top of guidance is a great testament to our team and to the resilience and strength of our portfolio of companies. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results compared back to 2022 is included in today's release and earnings package. Turning now to electricity sales in the economy. Weather-adjusted retail electric sales were down 0.4% for 2023 compared to 2022. Strong usage drove commercial sales growth of 1.3% for the year, which was partially offset by lower residential usage with both commercial and residential sales impacted by the return to the office dynamic. We continue to see robust residential customer growth with the addition of over 46,000 residential electric customers and nearly 27,000 residential gas customers. Since 2020, we've added over 200,000 residential electric customers, which represents the highest four-year total in decades. Industrial sales finished down for the year nearly 2%, largely due to continued slowing in housing and construction-related sectors as well as lower sales to chemical companies due to outages and long planned plant closures. Consistent with the drivers detailed in Georgia Power's recently filed 2023 Integrated Resource Plan update, economic development in our Southeast service territory remains incredibly strong. Several years of extraordinary success in attracting new and expanding businesses to our states, underpins our long-term electricity sales forecast. While electricity sales growth is projected to remain around 1% to 2% for 2024 and 2025, growth from 2025 to 2028 is projected to accelerate to an average of approximately 6% annually, with Georgia Power's total retail electric sales growth projected to be approximately 9% annually over this same period. The magnitude and velocity of this growth are significant drivers for the increased capital investments reflected in our current outlook. This projected growth also represents a tremendous opportunity to de-risk our outlook and benefit customers as a substantial projected growth in kilowatt hour sales from new manufacturing facilities and data centers has the potential to put downward pressure on existing customers' rates. Turning now to our earnings projections for 2024 and beyond. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance range for 2024 is $3.95 to $4.05, and our projected long-term adjusted EPS growth rate is 5% to 7% from that range. In early 2021, we provided the investment community with a stable post Vogtle 3 and 4 construction and EPS projection, with an initial and reasonably wide 2024 guidance range. It is perhaps the greatest of understatement to say that the world has changed a lot since early 2021. On a macro basis, we've seen significant inflation and higher and then higher for longer interest rates, which alone has translated to interest expense for 2024 hundreds of millions of dollars higher than any of us assumed three years ago. Additionally, relative to our projection in early 2021, the projected in-service date for Vogtle 4 moved into 2024 from 2023. In the face of these challenges, we've continued to work extremely hard to grow our business and to create value for investors. Compared to our projections in early 2021, our state-regulated utility rate base for 2024 is projected to be approximately $6 billion higher, while lower O&M expenses and higher sales are projected to contribute hundreds of millions of dollars more than previously projected to help maintain affordability and help pay for those investments. We estimated adjusted earnings of $0.90 per share for the first quarter of 2024. Our capital investment plan continues to be well over 95% attributable to our state-regulated utility businesses. The current five-year capital investment forecast, totaling $48 billion, reflects a $5 billion increase in state-regulated utility investments relative to our forecast a year ago. This 12% increase in capital spending reflects our ongoing efforts to further increase the resiliency of our electric and gas networks and our technology infrastructure. It also partially reflects new resources proposed in Georgia Power's 2023 IRP update, about 60% of the brick-and-mortar megawatts proposed. We have maintained our disciplined measured approach to capital forecasting for our state-regulated utility businesses. Given the magnitude of change in our projected sales growth and the timeframe in which new resources are needed to serve higher peak demands, we felt it was appropriate to go ahead and reflect certain new resources in our capital plan. Additionally, our capital investment forecast tend to grow, especially in the later years as the visibility into customer additions improves, regulatory processes unfold compliance obligations evolve and our long-term integrated system planning is refined. While the increases in this year's five-year forecast represent an outsized upward adjustment due to the scale and velocity of the projected growth in the near-term, we do believe it's reasonable to expect a historical trend of capital increases to continue going forward. On its own, our capital investment forecast of $48 billion supports annualized state-regulated rate base growth of approximately 6%, providing a solid foundation for our long-term outlook. Any upside to the capital forecast will simply serve to add durability to an already strong outlook. Strong investment-grade credit ratings remain a priority. We continue to believe that in order to be a high-quality equity investment, a company must also have high-quality credit. As we near completion of Vogtle Unit 4, the reduction in major project construction risk and the improvement in our FFO should strengthen and meaningfully improve our credit profile to help ensure we preserve what we believe will be a positively differentiated profile. We are also turning on our internal equity plans to fund the incremental capital investment at our subsidiaries that I highlighted earlier. These plans typically provide approximately $350 million of new equity annually. Additionally, we'll preserve our financing flexibility and optionality with a continuous focus on preserving and improving shareholder value. For example, we will continue to maintain an at-the-market or ATM plan to partially finance potential additional increases in capital spending in our subsidiaries or potentially, to partially refinance callable hybrid securities, if we determine doing so preserves or improves our credit and long-term EPS objectives. Southern Company strives to deliver a superior risk-adjusted total shareholder return, and we believe the plan that we've laid out supports that objective. Our customer and community-focused business model the growing investments in our premier state-regulated utility franchises and the priority that we place on strong credit quality and our remarkable dividend history all contributes toward making Southern Company a premier investment. Chris, I'll now turn the call back over to you. Yes. Thanks for the question, Shahriar. And I know there's a lot of focus on this. I think we're always fascinated with the precision with which everyone wants to inhale all this down. The -- so let's start with the guidance range. Yes, I think, it absolutely includes impacts from Vogtle 4, not only being in 2024 at all, but certainly going into, as we've assumed in the guidance range, April. I mean, if you add all that up, that's $0.08 of incremental impact on 2024 relative to what it would have been if the project been lined in 2023. And -- but we haven't adjusted a range by that full amount, by any means. And what we're doing is using the flexibility, not unlike what we did in 2023 with the mildest year ever to kind of mitigate that. Those are the kind of mitigations and flexibility items that aren't necessarily available every year. You have to maintain the system, you've got to make sure you're prioritizing service to customers. And so that flexibility is limited. We're using it this year and that will diminish what we have the opportunity to do going forward. But also, I think what's not factored in is a couple of other important nuances. We thought 40 slides was enough, but maybe we needed one more slide to kind of draw how we always think about our guidance range and our growth range. We don't think about the 5% to 7% being off of the midpoint. We've always kind of drawn those trajectories off the top of it and off the bottom of it. So 7% off the top, 5% off the bottom. I think if you do that from this current range, it captures every reasonable estimate that's out there for 2025 and 2026. When it comes to the rate base growth, look, we were at 6% last year. We just added $5 billion of capital to the plan. We didn't add all the capital that we see as possible. That kind of incremental capital additions opportunity still exists. So yeah, our ability to grow rate base, and yeah, it's mitigated ever so slightly by a fraction of a percent of increased shares over time. Our ability to hit our numbers is as solid as it's ever been. Yeah. We -- yes, thanks, Shahriar. We have not factored any cash flow from nuclear PTCs into our outlook. We've got a terrific plan with an improving FFO to debt metric that's several hundred basis points above any of our threshold over time, and frankly improves every year in the forecast that I look at without those nuclear PTCs. Is there the opportunity for us to capture some of those PTCs? We think there very well could be. We're not counting on it. And to the extent we do, we'll flow those to customers to the most practical amount of time possible. And so we're -- it's not going to be a factor in kind of how our metrics or earnings look. Yeah. You bet. Yeah. So I've always kind of said we see a forecast that gets us to 17-ish, it's the way I've characterized it in the past. So let me tell you where we are, Steve, here today, and I think it's still differentiated and a terrific story and we're doing everything we can to make sure we're being conservative in the way we think about this. So if we just think about Moody's metrics, our actual result for 2023 was 14%. Keep in mind, that's before Vogtle 4 is in service. 2024, with Vogtle in service on the timeline, we believe those metrics will improve by more than 100 basis points in 2024. The weight of the incremental capital that we're deploying and the fact that some of this is kind of long live construction, you think about building new gas plants at Georgia or other things, there's a bit of regulatory lag that weighs a little bit on credit metrics. And as that resolves itself, cash flow improves. So with the forecast that I see go from 14 to over 15 in 2024, and about a 50 to 60 basis point improvement every year after that over time and that's a function of that capital, it's -- we're issuing the equity to continue the improvement. And then there's a little bit of impact in the short-term for under-recovered fuel that as that gets collected and the debt goes away, that also adds to that upward trajectory. So in my five-year forecast, we get kind of in that mid-16 towards 17 range. But again, every year in the five years is an improving story, and still hundreds of basis points above our thresholds. Yeah. And I'll just add to that, that the momentum in the economic development activity has continued even since filing that 2023 IRP update. And so thank goodness, we've got a filing in 2025, and we do this periodically. It's going to continue to evolve. There's a lot still lingering out there that -- in our conservative nature, we're not counting on yet, but it's not unlikely. Yes, Carly, it's a great question. So -- and I think I alluded to this a few minutes ago, it really is about the velocity and magnitude of this growth that we just kind of characterized for Steve. It's right in front of us. These resources are needed sooner than later. And so we think there's -- it was reasonable to kind of break trend for us a little bit and get slightly ahead of regulatory outcome to reflect directionally what's happening. And so just to kind of peel the curtain back a little bit, we were very specific in what we included. If you go back and look at the proposal that Georgia Power put in front of the commission back in the fall, it included a lot of various owned resources. And what we've included in the capital plan is essentially the new combustion turbines, there's three of those, and then two specific storage projects that are kind of located near military bases in -- Air Force base. That leaves hundreds, I think, over 800 megawatts of storage projects and a small storage or solar kind of not included in there. We will get a decision in April, but again, as a reminder, there's a whole another process coming in 2025. So, there may be a degree of clarity in April. There may be further clarity coming out the 2025 process. And as those play out, we'll continue to obviously keep the investment community apprised and update our projections accordingly. Yes. And Carly, I'll speak to the flexibility. I mean, obviously, I mentioned earlier, we're kind of already deploying some of that flexibility to address what we expect to be us here today in April in service because beyond that, we've laid out, it's roughly $0.03 for every month, but that's partially why we have a range, right? I mean it's a $0.10 range out there. So, it could be a function of moving us within the range for the year or depending on the circumstances as the year plays out, whether it's weather or something else, we might have some greater degree of flexibility. It's just too early in the year to really be that detailed about exactly how that might play out. So I'm not sure where you're headed with improved ROE. Certainly, not improving returns from an overall, say, regulated utility perspective. From a -- we really view that as the opportunity to kind of put downward pressure on existing customers' rates. I mean, our objective from an ROE perspective is regular, predictable, sustainable, I think you'll continue to see it play out that way. Just to be clear, Julien, on the sales growth that we've laid out here, so this is roughly 6% in the long term for Southern that 9% number for Georgia Power, this is actually based on a more conservative view than what's in the IRP update because the IRP update had to put some degree of expectation for additional success from an economic development perspective so that we do stay ahead of this from a resource perspective. It's not a huge differential, but what it also kind of reinforces is as this continues to play out, those numbers have the potential to continue to go up. No, nothing's changed in terms of what I believe the financial profile supports which, again, my objectives, I've said this before, I think our parent company being a BBB+, kind of the A category for all the utilities, I think the profile we see ahead of us fully supports that. The only thing that's changed is a slightly slower ramp-up in those metrics because of the incremental capital that we're deploying. But in terms of where we stand relative to any of our thresholds, it's several hundred basis points above any of those in every year, and every year improves. Yes. I think globally, there's 24 of these things running like a champ right now. Look, none of these regulatory outcomes will be -- they'll all be in the light of day. I think it will be clear what's approved and what's yet to be approved. I kind of laid out what we've included already, which is those combustion turbines and two very specific storage projects. And so I think we'll be able to provide color along the way. We'll certainly do more formal updates every year as we normally do, but I think there'll be interim opportunities. And the other interim opportunity that will continue to exist is we've remained extremely conservative when it comes to owning in renewables in any of our electric service territories. We also are very optimistic that, that will happen. And as that gets clarity, we'll make sure that, that's known as well. Yes. Look, I think, Dave, what we've tried to imply is there certainly is upward potential here. We've remained incredibly conservative and measured in how we forecasted. We're not trying to get too far ahead of any regulatory processes. We'll get these decisions in April. We'll have a 2025 process. We believe there's more economic development activity that is likely to come to fruition. And so given all of that, it is certainly not unreasonable that our capital budget will continue to rise to serve that incremental load. And so there certainly could be upward using your words, pressure on that rate base. Yes. No, go ahead, Chris. If you think about where probably every utility company was a year ago, one of the greatest risks facing all of this was affordability. We see this as a tremendous opportunity to derisk our outlook. Yes. So in terms of the change kind of planned versus plan, Jeremy, it's largely driven by the CapEx as well, right? I mean, ultimately, the parent company is funding Georgia Power's equity contribution. And while we're financing that partially with new equity through our plans, certainly -- it's certainly not all being funded directly with new shares. So there's incremental debt there. And then just the overall magnitude of the parent company issuances is largely driven by maturities. If you look a couple of pages beyond, there's, I think, over $5 billion worth of maturities in the same time period. So the amount that's kind of new money is much smaller. Look, just in answering that, generally, Jeremy, I mean, and we've said this before, the IRA is going to position all of our electric utilities to be much more competitive in these self-build options when it comes to resources, whether or not it plays out in this particular RFP, or it's a subsequent RFP, or it's a customer-specific siding, those things will happen over time. But it's also likely a function of something later in the plan. So not a 2024, 2025, maybe not even 2026 kind of resource. We're talking really towards the back end of the plan where that becomes a real opportunity. Yeah. It's a fair question, Durgesh. But this is where I want to stop short of getting ahead of any regulatory processes here. We've, kind of, characterized in terms of the megawatts that we've included that it's roughly 60% of the brick-and-mortar megawatts that were proposed. And so the best way for me to characterize it without getting ahead of anything is just say that the incremental capital associated with what we didn't include won't be lost in the rounding. It's a pretty meaningful number. Yeah. I think what we've done with this update is pretty representative of how we think about additional opportunities. So we added $5 billion of capital of this plan, let's call that $1 billion a year on average. We've added roughly $350 million of equity every year. So that 35% to 40% range is representative of our consolidated equity ratio and represents pretty well what we think is necessary to maintain if not marginally improve, but really just maintain the credit profile that's already in a really good place. Yes. So, what that $350 million represents is us turning on what we refer to as our internal plan. So, it's issuing new shares through our DRIP, through our 401(k), and that's about the run rate. And it just happens to match up pretty well with the needs associated with the $5 billion of incremental capital. We typically also maintain an at the market plan as flexibility. And so to the extent there's incremental CapEx that emerges, which again, is certainly reasonably possible given everything we've described, the ATM's the source that we'll tap into to help finance that. Yes. No, that would be incremental. There's still no new rate-based solar included. So, we've remained conservative in terms of our projections there in the outlook. And hey, just going back, Andrew, real quickly to the equity question. Just to kind of point out since maybe it wasn't clear because we only put a three-year financing plan out there, yes, leaving the plans on every year. And on average, kind of the average increase to shares every year is a fraction of a percent. So, that's also kind of in the rounding. Another terrific question. So, we had kind of alluded to the possibility of reevaluating the rate of dividend growth once we got Vogtle 4 into service, and kind of had -- we're kind of in a steady state and into the kind of below 70% somewhere. Given our current circumstances where were we are, in a place of issuing equity, perhaps one of the most efficient sources of equity is to remain modest in the way we continue to increase the dividend. So, I think for the foreseeable future, the trajectory we've been on is a reasonable expectation for the trajectory we'll remain on. You bet. Yeah. And Anthony, what it appears a lot of these data centers are beginning to do is prioritize reliable, resilient service over many other things. That gives us the opportunity to price it appropriately for the benefit of everyone else. Yes, Angie, it's a few things. Certainly, relative to where we were a year ago, and I think we've said this before, in a higher for longer environment, certainly, interest is a bigger headwind going forward. But the bigger dynamic in your question is around what we're actually investing in to serve this load or why we're investing. So keep in mind, the 6% for Southern Company sales growth and 9% for Georgia Power, that's kilowatt hour usage. That's the growth in the total kilowatt hours used. What we invest to do is serve the peaks. And so that looks a little different than the 24/7. We've got a lot of resources. We just may have to incrementally add resources to serve the peaks, and that's what you're seeing largely in the capital deployment. And net-net, we're comfortably in that 5% to 7% growth range. No. Yes. And any changes in Illinois are modest, to be fair. I mean -- and the outcome there for us, while disappointing, also provided a bit of a road map as to how to be successful going forward in navigating that jurisdiction in terms of just the things we've got to make sure we do as we deploy capital. And keep in mind, a huge, vast majority of the capital that's deployed for Nicor Gas is compliance related. And so there's only so much to kind of not do in the first place. Yes. Great question, Paul. So again, we were at 6% growth last year in rate base. We've added $5 billion of incremental capital to that. It's -- we kind of characterize it as approximately 6, but then also the shares we're issuing, and I think I mentioned this earlier, was that equates to a fraction of a percentage and it's kind of just in the rounding. We feel very comfortable that net-net, how all these things stack up is a conservative achievable forecast. Thanks Travis. Yes. Yes, Travis. You did. And so again, our cadence of growth has been $0.08 per year for several years. I think it's reasonable to expect that to continue, of course, it's all subject to the Board's oversight and approval. But what that will do is take us during this high period of CapEx, which hopefully goes on for a very long period of time, brings us comfortably down into the 60s from a payout ratio perspective. And so that's a good place to be, and we'll evaluate it every year with what the forecast looks like and what's appropriate. Right now, I think the reasonable expectation is that continued modest growth, which is just below 3%. Yes. There's certainly a relationship, I wouldn't call it a correlation, but to the extent we're building a new gas plant, certainly, that comes along with incremental O&M to the extent we're building new transmission distribution lines, there's some maintenance component to that. But that's also part of the cost structure that we're ensuring these new rates and revenues will cover such that the net result is the opportunity to put downward pressure on the existing rates. Yes. And just as a nuance, all the costs associated with completing Vogtle 3 and 4 is a capital cost. And so those aren't O&M costs that are an opportunity to reduce. Yeah. Look, on supply chain, I think we're in terrific shape, given our scale and just -- we've kind of seen this coming for a little while to the point where we can deploy the resources needed. On your peak question, we'll have to follow-up with you on that, Ryan. Just let's connect with the Investor Relations team and get you an answer then. You bet. Yeah, there's some customer-sided programs that have been proposed in the IRP, Paul, that those are being evaluated and those serve the same purpose, but it's not the dynamic that you're describing in those other states. Yes. It's fairly ratable, Paul. It's obviously not perfectly linear by any means. But that -- the significant load really begins to come in, in, say, late 2025 and into 2026, which is why a lot of the resource proposals you see at Georgia Power are to really serve the 2026-2027 winter peak to make sure they're in place for that, and then it continues to grow from there. Thanks Paul."

Our premier state-regulated electric and gas utilities and Southern Power continued to perform well during the third quarter. Plant Vogtle Unit 3 has continued to operate at 100% react to power since being declared in service July 31, and we expect to deliver on our adjusted financial targets for 2023. Before Dan provides an overview of our financial results, I'd like to provide an update on several announcements since our last call. First, we continue to see economic growth across our Southeast service territories. We are excited about the important role our utilities play and attracted new jobs and investment to our states and communities and are proud of the recent recognition for those efforts as Alabama Power and Georgia Power will each named a top utility for economic development by Site Selection magazine. With Georgia Power's recognition representing the 25th consecutive year for this honor. Last Friday, Georgia Power filed an update to its integrated resource plan. Economic development in Georgia has accelerated over the past couple of years and is contributing to extraordinary projected electricity usage growth, which is significantly larger than historic levels. Electric transportation, manufacturing and its supporting supplier base have been major contributors to the state's success along with new data centers to support increased computing power needs and the growing digital economy. With this 2023 IRP update, Georgia Power is proposing additional investments into Georgia's energy future to provide economical energy solutions that should benefit our customers and communities for generations to come. Building upon the plan approved in Georgia Power's 2022 IRP, the 2023 IRP update seeks to continue the utilization of a diversified approach to help ensure resilience, reliability and flexibility on behalf of customers, and Georgia Power has requested that the Georgia Public Service Commission evaluate this update by the end of April 2024. In late September, Southern Power announced the acquisition of the 150-megawatt South Cheyenne Solar facility in Wyoming and the 200-megawatt Millers Branch solar facility in Texas. Commercial operation of the facilities is expected in 2024 and 2025, respectively. These projects represent Southern Power's 29th and 30th solar facilities, which are the newest additions to a portfolio of 5,500 megawatts of carbon-free generating capacity. Consistent with the project in Southern Power's existing portfolio, these new projects include long-term contracts and counterparties with strong credit support. Additionally, Alabama Power's Barry Unit 8 was successfully placed in service yesterday on schedule and on budget. This 720-megawatt combined cycle unit is expected to be one of the most efficient natural gas plants in the country. Consistent with the proposed resource plan in Georgia Power's 2023 IRP update, we believe we are well positioned to continue applying our expertise and experience in constructing new natural gas and renewable generating units to serve our region's growing needs. Last week, we announced a memorandum of understanding between Southern Company and the U.S. General Services Administration to develop carbon-free electricity solutions for federal facilities across our Southeast service territory. The agreement documents our intent to collaborate on development of a road map that when executed will lead to federal agencies buying more carbon-free electricity in the region. We view this exciting partnership as another important contribution towards Southern Company's goal of reaching net zero by 2050. And finally, last Wednesday, we issued our annual sustainability summary highlighting the great progress that we made as we continue to advance clean energy, lead through innovation, invest in our people and serve and elevate the communities that we have the privilege to serve. We have worked with our states, customer groups, communities, regulators, policymakers and other stakeholders to develop strategic solutions to deliver clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to serve our growing economies. Dan, I'll now turn the call over to you for a financial update.\nDan Tucker: Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. For the third quarter of 2023, our adjusted earnings were $1.42 per share, $0.12 higher than our estimate -- $0.11 higher than last year. The primary drivers of our performance compared to last year were warmer than normal weather conditions, changes in rates and pricing and lower income taxes and O&M expenses, somewhat offset by higher depreciation and amortization. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our adjusted earnings per share were $3.01 compared to adjusted earnings per share of $3.35 for the same period in 2022. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results as compared to 2022 is included in today's release and earnings package. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, adjusted earnings per share are $0.34 below the same period a year ago, with the extremely mild weather conditions we experienced in the Southeast during the first six months of 2023, representing a major factor in how this year has developed. While weather conditions continue to present risk to our fourth quarter results, we project to achieve our full year adjusted earnings near the middle of our guidance range of $3.55 to $3.65 per share. Our adjusted estimate for the fourth quarter is $0.59 per share, which implies an estimated full year result of $3.60 on an adjusted basis. Turning now to electricity sales in the economy, year-to-date 2023 weather-normal retail electricity sales were approximately 0.5% lower than sales levels for the first nine months of 2022. Year-to-date, we have added approximately 35,000 electric customers and 19,000 gas customers, trends which continue to outpace pre-pandemic levels. Strong commercial usage was offset by a return to office dynamic and residential sales as the relationship between these two customer groups appears to have largely reached pre-pandemic status. Lower industrial sales continued to be driven by weakness in the chemical, paper and housing-related sectors. More broadly, our service territories are in a period of industrial transition particularly as it pertains to manufacturing. Historically, significant industries such as paper and chemicals are making way for the manufacturing of solar panels, batteries, airplanes and electric automobiles. As Chris mentioned earlier, during 2023, we have continued to see an extraordinary level of economic development activity within our service territories. While we will provide formal updates to our outlook during our fourth quarter earnings call in February, we did want to highlight the magnitude of potential change we are seeing in electricity sales growth. Recall, our previous forecast assumed annual electricity sales growth of 0% to 1%. Factoring in the power needs of these new, highly data-centric businesses and manufacturing facilities, electricity sales are likely to have an annual growth rate closer to a mid- to high single-digit range over the next five years. While there is likely to be significant incremental capital investment required to serve this level of economic development activity, we expect both existing and new customers to recognize economic benefits from this growth. Chris, I'll now turn the call back over to you.\nChris Womack: Thank you, Dan. Before taking your questions, I'd first like to provide a brief update on our progress at Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Since successfully achieving commercial operations at the end of July, Unit 3 has performed well, delivering nearly 2.5 million megawatt hours of reliable carbon-free energy to the citizens of Georgia. On Unit 4, following fuel load and during start-up and preoperational testing, we discovered a motor fault in one of the four reactor coolant pumps, necessitating a full replacement of the pump with one from our spare parts inventory. We have successfully cleared the path in which the existing reactor coolant pump will be removed and expect to begin that activity in the coming days. Many preoperational activities continue along a parallel path with the pump replacement, including coatings, insight containment and preparation of the turbine for power ascension testing. After successful installation of the spare pump, we will recommence with start-up in preoperational testing with a projected in-service date during the first quarter of 2024. Also, in late August as part of the Vogtle 3 and 4 prudence process, Georgia Power filed an application with the Georgia Public Service Commission to adjust rates to include reasonable and prudent Vogtle Unit 3 and 4 cost. Related to this application, the Georgia Public Service Commission public interest advocacy staff filed a stipulated agreement among Georgia Power and several other intervenors, which is intended to constructively resolve all issues regarding reasonableness, prudence and cost recovery for the remaining Vogtle 3 and 4 costs, not already in base rates. The Georgia Public Service Commission is expected to vote on this matter on December 19. Again, thank you all for joining us this afternoon and for your interest in Southern Company. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nCarly Davenport: Maybe just to start to pick up on your comments on Vogtle. I guess, first, just any expectations at this point in terms of the actual process of replacing the reactor coolant pump when you'd expect to get that wrapped? And kind of talk a little bit about maybe what gives you confidence still in that 1Q 2024 time line. And any factors that you're watching that could accelerate or decelerate that time line?\nChris Womack: Carly, again, thanks for your questions. We look at the pumps at Unit 3, I mean, the four pumps are running as designed. And as we've seen this from Sanmen in China, so we've seen this experience in terms of replacement. So, we think we have a good path to replacing the pump. And so, we just feel good about the process that we've identified that is in place for removal and then replacing the spare pump. So, we feel very confident about the process and where we are with the pump replacement process at this time.\nCarly Davenport: Great. And then maybe just shifting to sort of some of the capital opportunities that Daniel alluded to facilitate this load growth that you're expecting to see across your territory, I guess, in the context of the interest rate environment, how are you thinking about managing financing the CapEx required to support that growth? And how you'd expect to balance between debt and equity going forward.\nDan Tucker: Yes, Carly, it's a great question. And look, just order of magnitude, we'll provide specific guidance in February. But I think as we sit here today on the very front end of this IRP update process, we do see pretty substantial potential increases. And potentially, we're talking billions of dollars where our current five-year plan for capital is $43 billion. I think we easily see a plan that translates to something north of $45 billion, and it's really a question of how much higher than $45 billion once we get to February and kind of lay that out. And I say all that continuing to be conservative about including any owned renewables. We absolutely across all of our electric service territories expect to own renewables over the forecast horizon. But we're going to wait until there's better line of sight on those individual projects to include those. So getting to your question in terms of financing, we've been very clear about our credit objectives. And I think our profile is positioned to be differentiated, and it's our objective over the long term to preserve that differentiated profile. And so that will mean the potential for maybe turning on our equity plans. We're fortunate to have one of the largest, if not the largest drips in the industry. We can generate between $350 million and $400 million a year just through those. And then we always keep on the shelf and at the market program just to have flexibility. So, we will absolutely do what we need to do to preserve the credit profile in terms of the balance of how that's financed. I think it's still a fraction of any incremental capital that translates to equity. Again, I mentioned billions of capital and hundreds of millions of potential equity through the drip. I think that will be sufficient to maintain where we want to be.\nCarly Davenport: Great. If I could just sneak one follow-up on that point, Dan. Do you have any -- are there any targets that you have on the level of parent debt that you'd like to hold going forward?\nDan Tucker: I think where we sit today, Carly, just kind of on an unadjusted basis, if you will, so not trying to factor in equity credit or content for any particular securities. We're a little south just of 30% overall. I think as the business grows, we don't really intend to grow that percentage. So, the absolute quantum of debt may increase over time, but the proportion of parent debt to the rest of our debt will remain about the same, I think.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nShar Pourreza: Just a quick follow-up from the prior question. I guess, the opportunity set is pretty material, Dan, you're obviously highlighting it could be in the billions. I guess, how do we think about that opportunity set in relation to your 5% to 7%? So is this a scenario where it's accretive to growth or could be accretive to growth? Or is this sort of an extended runway scenario?\nDan Tucker: Yes. Look, Shar, it's a great question. It's the right question. But Chris and I have been out speaking to the investment community for months well in advance of this filing with the Georgia Commission coming together and acknowledging that whether it's owned renewables, whether it's the kind of economic development growth that we -- and activity we've been seeing, potential for more capital has been lingering out there. But what we've both been very clear about is it's not our objective to raise the growth rate as a result of that. What this opportunity presents itself as is an opportunity to strengthen the profile of the growth rate to potentially sustain it longer term. And again, the important governor on all of this is really two factors: One, we're focused on the long term here. We're not trying to have some temporarily higher growth rate in the short term. And more importantly, number two, is customer affordability, making sure that we maintain a profile from a customer perspective that preserves the constructive regulatory environments, we're fortunate to have. The other great benefit of everything that we're seeing and the fundamentals that Chris and I are so excited about is this level of sales growth. That, in and of itself, will provide an opportunity to mitigate the affordability equation.\nChris Womack: And Shar, one thing I'd add. I mean, you know us very well, you know our process. I mean we will kind of give you that '24 guidance in February of next year. I mean, so now we are looking at the headwinds, the tailwinds kind of where we are in terms of -- I mean, the cards that we have and what's in front of us, and we'll update and give you that guidance in '24. But I'd tell you, I mean, on the iconic development front, there are just a lot of exciting opportunities. We've got headwinds of interest rates, but we look forward to giving you that update in our call in '24 in February.\nShar Pourreza: Just, Chris, thanks for kind of bringing that up a little bit just on -- just, I guess, on the parent level maturities, it's somewhat sizable over the next few years. So maybe can you just provide a little bit of the interest rate sensitivities, and I guess, how to manage those pressures, especially as we're thinking about '24 and I think you prior guided to right around that 395 to 415 range. So how do you manage that if you have a sensitivity there you can provide?\nDan Tucker: Yes. Look, Shar, just like we did this year, we're going to kind of be thoughtful, creative, somewhat aggressive in terms of how we manage that. You saw us do the convert earlier this year that really mitigated the interest impact. We'll do everything kind of at our disposal to execute in a way that keeps rates as low as possible. I think what everyone is likely stepping back in the industry and saying is, look, we all knew interest rates were higher, and this sense of higher for longer as you sit here today, it's probably the longer piece that we all thought was perhaps not as long as what we're seeing as we sit here. But I think it's all consistent. And for us, kind of mitigated by this tremendous windfall of economic development activity we have. In terms of sensitivities, look, if you think about kind of a 50 basis point sensitivity around interest rates as we move forward, think with every incremental year, it's basically another an incremental penny of potential EPS plus or minus for that 50 basis points of interest rate sensitivity. And we're not interest rate forecasters. We're just basically using kind of public forecasts that are out there in terms of our planning.\nShar Pourreza: Okay. Perfect. That was all I had. I appreciate it. Thanks for the color and see you about in a week.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDavid Arcaro: Maybe starting on the load growth side of things first. When do you think you'll start to see that coming through in the quarter? I guess, the actual weather-normal sales were down over the last 12 months kind of a similar experience. So when do you think that inflection kind of comes to start to point the underlying electric load growth getting towards that upper single-digit level?\nChris Womack: I think as we lay out the plan and what the needs are, probably in the '26 time frame, I think, we'll see some of this play out could be as late as '25. I mean as plants begin and they've got to be constructed. They've got to go online. So yes, we look at late '25, the early '26 time frame. I think before you will see this kind of show up in those increased sales?\nDan Tucker: Yes. When you hear us talk about economic development activity and announcements, Dave, typically, that is three, four, five years from announcement time for facilities to get built, to get staffed to get trained and operating at a capacity that's meaningful to our load.\nDavid Arcaro: Yes, got it. That's helpful color and context there. And then -- was just wondering if you could maybe elaborate a little bit on the pump issue on Unit 4. Does this look -- are there any indications that it could be a design issue with the pumps has this happened at other AP1000 units? Or does this look like it could just be a one-off here?\nChris Womack: I think it's a little premature to say. I mean once we get it out, I mean, we'll get it back to the manufacturer to see actually what happened and we'll learn from that. But right now, our focus is on removal of the pump and then replacing it with a spare and then moving toward the process of putting the unit in service. So -- but yes, I mean, we'll take a hard look at, I mean what happened to the pump and we'll repair it and move forward.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Julian Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Indeed, likewise, Chris. Look, let's talk about the upside CapEx just a little bit further here, if you don't mind. I keep bothering you on this here. Let's talk about first Alabama. To what extent is that going to be ripe for 4Q? And just also, how do you think about the ownership angle there as you think going forward, 2.6 gigs, I think that's over six years, not trivial there as well. When you were talking about billions of upside, was that inclusive of that LMM opportunity? Or is that upside to the upside if you want to use that service?\nDan Tucker: It's upside to the upside, Julien. So again, and I mentioned this earlier, we're going to continue to be conservative on owned renewables that we absolutely have an expectation that will become part of the mix we're not going to forecast it until we have better line of sight on individual projects. And in Alabama, those will largely be tied to individual customer stories. When it comes to this economic development activity, while I think kind of the tip of the spear sit here today is what's happening in Georgia, there's a lot of momentum across the rest of our electric service territory for opportunities like this.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. And just to clarify that, Alabama, that would be to the extent of which they're more directly negotiated here with customers that would be presumably entirely an ownership opportunity and then just to clarify Carly's question a little bit further, the FFO to debt piece of this, you're thinking about targeting like a flat level here, even pro forma for the DRIP. It's not like you're leaning into the balance sheet by only turning on the DRIP. It's that inclusive of that incremental capital, you'll still hit a fairly flat level, if you will?\nDan Tucker: Yes. So on the first part, Julien, in terms of the mix of ownership -- and this is going to be true for all of our electric service territories. It will be a mix. We expect to own a meaningful amount, but there is likely to be third-party PPAs in the mix here, just like there has historically. So, that's the reason we're not including anything forecast. We don't want to be presumptuous as to exactly what that mix is. We just know or we have an expectation it will be meaningful. On the -- I'm sorry, what was the second question again, Julien?\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. Just in response to Carly's question, and you said something about sort of reengaging on the DRIP here, hundreds of millions of equity. When you think about that ratio of equity versus CapEx, are you thinking that you can keep the metrics relatively flat with that? Or are you kind of expecting that to use, if you will, some of the balance sheet capacity?\nDan Tucker: Yes. I would call it flat, Julian. So, it's flat over the long term. Our credit quality is a buffer against adversity that we have no desire to consume nor do we have -- or are we positioned where we've got to kind of over equitize incremental growth. It is a flat long-term objective.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. All right, guys. I'll leave it there. Best of luck. I see you soon.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDurgesh Evercore: Dan, just -- I don't want to jump the gun on '24 here, but just wanted to sort of last year EEI, you were clearly sort of -- you guys were articulating headwinds from rates and I think the '24 numbers were subsequentially brought down. How do you think about sort of '24 year again? Just qualitatively, obviously, there's headwinds from rates that keep going higher, but then you're showing a stronger load forecast prospectively. So, the puts and takes, how would you kind of articulate where '24 is shaking right now versus your expectations at the beginning of the year?\nChris Womack: Let me start by saying I mean, I think we -- as I said earlier, I mean, that is the things you've mentioned, that's part of the process we're in the middle of now that will lead us to February when we give you our '24 guidance, but assessing the tailwinds that we are really excited about from economic development activities to the headwinds of interest rates. I mean that will all go into the calculus to the process of us kind of coming forth in February with our guidance for '24. But I think it's just a tab bit premature. And you've seen us in terms of how we do this. But we don't give you any kind of indication or guidance at this point in time. We'll do that in February of '24.\nDan Tucker: Yes. And I guess it's just a matter of discipline for us. This is you could go back to every third quarter transcript, script ever, and you're going to hear the same answer. But I think it's fair to say where we are. Chris and I are really excited about. Our value proposition I would stack up against anybody else's right now.\nDurgesh Evercore: Okay. I tried it at least.\nChris Womack: It was a good try.\nDurgesh Evercore: Just maybe then just shifting back to discussion to the CapEx upside. How much -- so obviously, billions of dollars, would you think of customer bill impacts. I guess where I'm going with this is there's a pretty sizable load growth forecast that you were suggesting mid- to high single digits what percentage of that CapEx you think would go towards or the return would be satisfied by the slowed forecast versus increasing rates, if you could talk to that a bit.\nDan Tucker: Sure. Look, there's a lot of moving parts here, as you can imagine. And I don't want to get ahead of the regulatory process and things that will be evaluated in terms of the ultimate resource plan that's decided on. But stepping back at a really high level, everything that we see from a load growth perspective relative to the resources needed to serve this growing peak load, and that's key, right. You invest to make sure you can meet the peak loads, but the customers that you're adding aren't just using electricity at the peak, and it just so happens, the customers that we're adding are expected to use electricity oftentimes 24/7. And so that kind of profile will provide more than sufficient revenue at the rate structures that exist today that is needed to pay for that capital. That is where the economic benefits for other customers have the opportunity to really help with this affordability equation.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Weisel: Andrew, Okay. So first, it's a quick one. Third quarter was obviously well ahead of the estimate. I know part of that is weather, but you're still pulling to the midpoint of the full year range rather than something higher. Forgive me if I missed it, but what are the offsets relative to your outlook three months ago?\nDan Tucker: So, we didn't really update the year-end three months ago. Again, just as that same discipline, we only address year-end on our third quarter call. And so it's the first time we're really refining it. It's really about the first half of the year. Yes, we had a better-than-expected third quarter, but the headwinds of weather in the first half were pretty substantial. And that's why we're $0.34 below last year on a year-to-date basis. And so that's the biggest driver of kind of the middle of guidance expectations at the end of the year. Now I say all that, Andrew, I mean, again, we put out quarterly estimates all the time, and I kind of challenge you to go back and find a time where we didn't exceed that. So that should help with where our expectations are.\nAndrew Weisel: Yes, definitely. Okay. Got it. So you're back on track now, I guess, I could say. Next question is on Georgia, IRP. I know it's off cycle. The typical cadence would have been to wait until 2025. How receptive are the regulators to this? I assume you've had conversations with the key intervenors. Is there any reluctance to breaking that three-year pattern? And as a follow-up, is there any thought to postponing some plant retirements? I know you talked about what you're going to add and maybe sign contracts for existing assets, but any thoughts on postponing some of your retirements?\nChris Womack: Let me take a shot at a couple of things. And first of all, we never get ahead of our regulators. Secondly, I'd say as we were going through the '22 IRP process, we did socialize and bring forth to the commission the activity that we saw occurring that there was a likelihood that there would need to be some update filing in between the three-year cycle. So this is not necessarily a surprise. We did mention that this would, in fact, be forthcoming. But yes, so we will go through the process, and hopefully, we'll get a decision sometime by April of '24 with this updated IRP. And what was the second part of your question?\nAndrew Weisel: Potential to postpone plant retirements.\nChris Womack: As you look at this need that is there, that there is the likelihood that we would need some traditional units a little longer. Meaning, I think as we look at units that may have been scheduled to retire in '28, we may look to take them into the 30s. So that is a possibility as we look to respond to this growing demand for our customers.\nDan Tucker: And while that's an assumption in this IRP update, I think that will be a decision to be made in a future IRP proceeding in terms of those existing coal units.\nAndrew Weisel: Okay. And just to clarify that you're requesting a decision in April. Does that mean the CapEx update in February will not reflect anything related to this that will wait until February of 2025 ?\nDan Tucker: We'll do our best to assess where we are. There may be some degree of uncertainty, but I think we'll be able to reflect a good bit of it.\nChris Womack: Yes. And the scheduling order has not been established but we expect a similar process to the traditional integrated resource planning process. And so that would align with a decision sometime in the April time frame of '24.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Tonet: For those of us out of state, I was just hoping you could provide some in-state perspective with regards to Georgia and elections and the latest and what's happening there with regards to litigation and potential for these elections. What are the next steps forward here? When could these materialize? Just any thoughts on that and any implications that could mean for Southern down the road?\nChris Womack: Yes. There's a lot of activity around redistricting and lines from congressional seats. But in terms of the issue in Georgia regarding the Public Service Commission, the Rose case, that matter is still pending before the 11th Circuit quarter appeals. And there has not been a decision there. So the other matters that may go before the Georgia legislature you for redistricting. Those processes does not include matters consumed in the Rose case. So we are still waiting for a decision from the 11th Circuit on that matter.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. I mean would you expect those two elections to be held in '24 or just can't really tell too much at this point.\nChris Womack: I think you answered your question. We can't really tell us this time.\nJeremy Tonet: Fair enough. Fair enough. And then switching gears here, natural gas clearly a key component to the energy mix, as you talked about earlier. Just wondering, it's not as easy to build a natural gas pipeline as it was at points in the past to supply into the state. I'm just wondering where nat gas that you see incremental supply coming from? Is this MVP? Is this other sources? Or just how do you see that dynamic at this point?\nChris Womack: A couple of things, I mean there are different lines and different processes that we're in the middle of in terms of trying to expand pipeline capacity. And so we are working with existing companies; one, expanding on existing infrastructure where possible, but also working to find ways to, in fact, increase pipeline capacity and pipelines themselves all across our territory. So that's all I can speak about that at this time. Yes, we know there are challenges there, but we think it is essential and important to support us being able to serve our customers with the reliability they demand and they need. And so, we are continuing to pursue various host of alternatives and options to make sure we have the supply that we need.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Fair enough. And one last one, if I could. Just be it related to Vogtle or otherwise, just wondering how could green hydrogen play into the IRP and your view? Any plans to test that out as a power plant fuel?\nChris Womack: And we have. I mean we've done one of the largest blends, and we're looking at other opportunities. As you know, we participated in the hydrogen hub in the Midwest. We were not successful with the hydrogen hub that we participated in here in the Southeast, but we continue to have conversations and discussions with number of customers. And I think we're all interested in finding ways to get the price of hydrogen down and thus also create the infrastructure to move hydrogen around. So yes, I mean, we're still all arrows in the quiver, we're looking at every option for renewable resources to meet the needs of our customers and hydrogen is a big consideration for us.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Please go ahead.\nAngie Storozynski: So just two things. One, a small one, Southern Power, I mean, I was kind of surprised to see the announcement about the solar project acquisitions. You have struggled to find any projects that actually makes sense from an economic perspective. Now we're in a meaningfully high interest rate environment and now you're going after these projects. So I'm just wondering if there's something specific about these two projects? Or is it just that you are managing your FFO using some of the solar benefit and on the back of the IRA?\nDan Tucker: Yes. Great question, Angie, because it had been a while since we've done anything at Southern Power and really what changed was the IRA. So, we had stopped doing solar projects kind of middle of the last decade. We did a lot through 2015 through 2016 and then didn't do any sense because we didn't like the profile of investment tax credits for solar projects. The PTC is something that matches much better our regular, predictable, sustainable earnings profile and that the IRA kind of unlocked a lot of development activity on the solar front. And so the opportunity set was really big, and we narrowed it down to a couple of projects here recently that fit the kind of criteria we look for. Look, again, just to reiterate for everyone what we do at Southern Power, it's long-term contracts, it's creditworthy counterparties. It's returns that are better overall from an equity perspective than our regulated business, and it fits our overall profile. Southern Power is balance sheet financed, right? In of itself is a BBB+ company, and it's an important. If you think about the bulk of Southern Power, the rest of it, the natural gas fleet you think about what's happening with capacity needs in the Southeast, that business has become something of a crown jewel in the Southeast because it is one of the best providers of reliable, dispatchable capacity in the Southeast. So it's a business that's important to us, and these were two great opportunities to grow it.\nAngie Storozynski: But again, it's not again, when I think about Vogtle and the improvement in cash flow on the back of the COD of those units, you should be probably the very last or one of the very last utilities that needs to manage FFO using those PACS credits. So this is not…\nDan Tucker: This is not a credit play, Angie, that 0%.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. And then secondly, a different note. I saw that there was another management change of Alabama Power yesterday. Again, if I'm not mistaken, that's the third one this year. Just caught my attention, if there is again, if it's just the coincidence that we've had these three management changes at Alabama Power? Or is there something more to it?\nChris Womack: No, Angie, I wouldn't read anything more than that. I mean you've had a number of individual leadership there who have put 40 years of service in that have chosen to retire, and then the opportunity to bring in and bring in some new talent. I think that helps the overall team. But as you know, we pay a lot of attention to succession planning. And we do a lot of work internally in terms of growing our teams. But I think we're also wise enough to know when we can also go invest in some talent from the outside to bring in to our team and makes our overall team better. So I wouldn't read anything more to it than just the reality of a couple of individuals deciding to retire and us moving some people around.\nDan Tucker: Yes. You didn't hear that 40 years and then we're back.\nOperator: And our last question for today is coming from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead.\nTravis Miller: Hello, you answered almost all my questions on the capital financing and even used where I was going to use creative, but I'll throw out their nontraditional. Anything we've seen several other utilities who needed to raise financing, use some non-traditional mean divestitures, minority interest sale. Is that something in the toolbox for you? Or can we just rule that type of stuff out?\nDan Tucker: Yes. Look, there's always a toolbox. I would argue our toolbox is a lot smaller than it used to be when it comes to alternative sources of capital. We did a lot of work over the last several years to kind of hone this portfolio of companies to something that really fits and that we feel really good about. So are there some small opportunities? Yes. But do we have any for sale sign sitting out there right now? No?\nTravis Miller: Okay, makes sense and then a quick follow-up. The dividends, what do you think the Board is looking for to get off that $0.08 or lift growth rate to 4%, 5%, 6%? What are your thoughts around that?\nDan Tucker: Yes. I think it's primarily just working our way down to a sustainable payout ratio, right? So if you think about where our guidance sits here in 2023, our payout is going to be something like 77% for 2023. That's not a sustainable payout ratio for a growing company. Now that's largely a function of the ROEs we've been earning at Georgia Power during construction of Vogtle 3 and 4. As that rolls off, that payout ratio will begin to come down, but we just need to get it somewhere comfortably into something that probably starts with a six in order to start evaluating a higher growth rate.\nOperator: And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks?\nChris Womack: Again, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We really appreciate your interest in Southern Company. And we look forward to seeing many of you very, very soon. In the meantime, if you have questions, please give us a call. But again, thank you very much for joining us today.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes The Southern Company third quarter 2023 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Chris Womack",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us this afternoon. Our premier state-regulated electric and gas utilities and Southern Power continued to perform well during the third quarter. Plant Vogtle Unit 3 has continued to operate at 100% react to power since being declared in service July 31, and we expect to deliver on our adjusted financial targets for 2023. Before Dan provides an overview of our financial results, I'd like to provide an update on several announcements since our last call. First, we continue to see economic growth across our Southeast service territories. We are excited about the important role our utilities play and attracted new jobs and investment to our states and communities and are proud of the recent recognition for those efforts as Alabama Power and Georgia Power will each named a top utility for economic development by Site Selection magazine. With Georgia Power's recognition representing the 25th consecutive year for this honor. Last Friday, Georgia Power filed an update to its integrated resource plan. Economic development in Georgia has accelerated over the past couple of years and is contributing to extraordinary projected electricity usage growth, which is significantly larger than historic levels. Electric transportation, manufacturing and its supporting supplier base have been major contributors to the state's success along with new data centers to support increased computing power needs and the growing digital economy. With this 2023 IRP update, Georgia Power is proposing additional investments into Georgia's energy future to provide economical energy solutions that should benefit our customers and communities for generations to come. Building upon the plan approved in Georgia Power's 2022 IRP, the 2023 IRP update seeks to continue the utilization of a diversified approach to help ensure resilience, reliability and flexibility on behalf of customers, and Georgia Power has requested that the Georgia Public Service Commission evaluate this update by the end of April 2024. In late September, Southern Power announced the acquisition of the 150-megawatt South Cheyenne Solar facility in Wyoming and the 200-megawatt Millers Branch solar facility in Texas. Commercial operation of the facilities is expected in 2024 and 2025, respectively. These projects represent Southern Power's 29th and 30th solar facilities, which are the newest additions to a portfolio of 5,500 megawatts of carbon-free generating capacity. Consistent with the project in Southern Power's existing portfolio, these new projects include long-term contracts and counterparties with strong credit support. Additionally, Alabama Power's Barry Unit 8 was successfully placed in service yesterday on schedule and on budget. This 720-megawatt combined cycle unit is expected to be one of the most efficient natural gas plants in the country. Consistent with the proposed resource plan in Georgia Power's 2023 IRP update, we believe we are well positioned to continue applying our expertise and experience in constructing new natural gas and renewable generating units to serve our region's growing needs. Last week, we announced a memorandum of understanding between Southern Company and the U.S. General Services Administration to develop carbon-free electricity solutions for federal facilities across our Southeast service territory. The agreement documents our intent to collaborate on development of a road map that when executed will lead to federal agencies buying more carbon-free electricity in the region. We view this exciting partnership as another important contribution towards Southern Company's goal of reaching net zero by 2050. And finally, last Wednesday, we issued our annual sustainability summary highlighting the great progress that we made as we continue to advance clean energy, lead through innovation, invest in our people and serve and elevate the communities that we have the privilege to serve. We have worked with our states, customer groups, communities, regulators, policymakers and other stakeholders to develop strategic solutions to deliver clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to serve our growing economies. Dan, I'll now turn the call over to you for a financial update. Thank you, Dan. Before taking your questions, I'd first like to provide a brief update on our progress at Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Since successfully achieving commercial operations at the end of July, Unit 3 has performed well, delivering nearly 2.5 million megawatt hours of reliable carbon-free energy to the citizens of Georgia. On Unit 4, following fuel load and during start-up and preoperational testing, we discovered a motor fault in one of the four reactor coolant pumps, necessitating a full replacement of the pump with one from our spare parts inventory. We have successfully cleared the path in which the existing reactor coolant pump will be removed and expect to begin that activity in the coming days. Many preoperational activities continue along a parallel path with the pump replacement, including coatings, insight containment and preparation of the turbine for power ascension testing. After successful installation of the spare pump, we will recommence with start-up in preoperational testing with a projected in-service date during the first quarter of 2024. Also, in late August as part of the Vogtle 3 and 4 prudence process, Georgia Power filed an application with the Georgia Public Service Commission to adjust rates to include reasonable and prudent Vogtle Unit 3 and 4 cost. Related to this application, the Georgia Public Service Commission public interest advocacy staff filed a stipulated agreement among Georgia Power and several other intervenors, which is intended to constructively resolve all issues regarding reasonableness, prudence and cost recovery for the remaining Vogtle 3 and 4 costs, not already in base rates. The Georgia Public Service Commission is expected to vote on this matter on December 19. Again, thank you all for joining us this afternoon and for your interest in Southern Company. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Carly, again, thanks for your questions. We look at the pumps at Unit 3, I mean, the four pumps are running as designed. And as we've seen this from Sanmen in China, so we've seen this experience in terms of replacement. So, we think we have a good path to replacing the pump. And so, we just feel good about the process that we've identified that is in place for removal and then replacing the spare pump. So, we feel very confident about the process and where we are with the pump replacement process at this time. And Shar, one thing I'd add. I mean, you know us very well, you know our process. I mean we will kind of give you that '24 guidance in February of next year. I mean, so now we are looking at the headwinds, the tailwinds kind of where we are in terms of -- I mean, the cards that we have and what's in front of us, and we'll update and give you that guidance in '24. But I'd tell you, I mean, on the iconic development front, there are just a lot of exciting opportunities. We've got headwinds of interest rates, but we look forward to giving you that update in our call in '24 in February. I think as we lay out the plan and what the needs are, probably in the '26 time frame, I think, we'll see some of this play out could be as late as '25. I mean as plants begin and they've got to be constructed. They've got to go online. So yes, we look at late '25, the early '26 time frame. I think before you will see this kind of show up in those increased sales? I think it's a little premature to say. I mean once we get it out, I mean, we'll get it back to the manufacturer to see actually what happened and we'll learn from that. But right now, our focus is on removal of the pump and then replacing it with a spare and then moving toward the process of putting the unit in service. So -- but yes, I mean, we'll take a hard look at, I mean what happened to the pump and we'll repair it and move forward. Let me start by saying I mean, I think we -- as I said earlier, I mean, that is the things you've mentioned, that's part of the process we're in the middle of now that will lead us to February when we give you our '24 guidance, but assessing the tailwinds that we are really excited about from economic development activities to the headwinds of interest rates. I mean that will all go into the calculus to the process of us kind of coming forth in February with our guidance for '24. But I think it's just a tab bit premature. And you've seen us in terms of how we do this. But we don't give you any kind of indication or guidance at this point in time. We'll do that in February of '24. It was a good try. Let me take a shot at a couple of things. And first of all, we never get ahead of our regulators. Secondly, I'd say as we were going through the '22 IRP process, we did socialize and bring forth to the commission the activity that we saw occurring that there was a likelihood that there would need to be some update filing in between the three-year cycle. So this is not necessarily a surprise. We did mention that this would, in fact, be forthcoming. But yes, so we will go through the process, and hopefully, we'll get a decision sometime by April of '24 with this updated IRP. And what was the second part of your question? As you look at this need that is there, that there is the likelihood that we would need some traditional units a little longer. Meaning, I think as we look at units that may have been scheduled to retire in '28, we may look to take them into the 30s. So that is a possibility as we look to respond to this growing demand for our customers. Yes. And the scheduling order has not been established but we expect a similar process to the traditional integrated resource planning process. And so that would align with a decision sometime in the April time frame of '24. Yes. There's a lot of activity around redistricting and lines from congressional seats. But in terms of the issue in Georgia regarding the Public Service Commission, the Rose case, that matter is still pending before the 11th Circuit quarter appeals. And there has not been a decision there. So the other matters that may go before the Georgia legislature you for redistricting. Those processes does not include matters consumed in the Rose case. So we are still waiting for a decision from the 11th Circuit on that matter. I think you answered your question. We can't really tell us this time. A couple of things, I mean there are different lines and different processes that we're in the middle of in terms of trying to expand pipeline capacity. And so we are working with existing companies; one, expanding on existing infrastructure where possible, but also working to find ways to, in fact, increase pipeline capacity and pipelines themselves all across our territory. So that's all I can speak about that at this time. Yes, we know there are challenges there, but we think it is essential and important to support us being able to serve our customers with the reliability they demand and they need. And so, we are continuing to pursue various host of alternatives and options to make sure we have the supply that we need. And we have. I mean we've done one of the largest blends, and we're looking at other opportunities. As you know, we participated in the hydrogen hub in the Midwest. We were not successful with the hydrogen hub that we participated in here in the Southeast, but we continue to have conversations and discussions with number of customers. And I think we're all interested in finding ways to get the price of hydrogen down and thus also create the infrastructure to move hydrogen around. So yes, I mean, we're still all arrows in the quiver, we're looking at every option for renewable resources to meet the needs of our customers and hydrogen is a big consideration for us. No, Angie, I wouldn't read anything more than that. I mean you've had a number of individual leadership there who have put 40 years of service in that have chosen to retire, and then the opportunity to bring in and bring in some new talent. I think that helps the overall team. But as you know, we pay a lot of attention to succession planning. And we do a lot of work internally in terms of growing our teams. But I think we're also wise enough to know when we can also go invest in some talent from the outside to bring in to our team and makes our overall team better. So I wouldn't read anything more to it than just the reality of a couple of individuals deciding to retire and us moving some people around. Again, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We really appreciate your interest in Southern Company. And we look forward to seeing many of you very, very soon. In the meantime, if you have questions, please give us a call. But again, thank you very much for joining us today."

            "name": "Dan Tucker",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. For the third quarter of 2023, our adjusted earnings were $1.42 per share, $0.12 higher than our estimate -- $0.11 higher than last year. The primary drivers of our performance compared to last year were warmer than normal weather conditions, changes in rates and pricing and lower income taxes and O&M expenses, somewhat offset by higher depreciation and amortization. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our adjusted earnings per share were $3.01 compared to adjusted earnings per share of $3.35 for the same period in 2022. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results as compared to 2022 is included in today's release and earnings package. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, adjusted earnings per share are $0.34 below the same period a year ago, with the extremely mild weather conditions we experienced in the Southeast during the first six months of 2023, representing a major factor in how this year has developed. While weather conditions continue to present risk to our fourth quarter results, we project to achieve our full year adjusted earnings near the middle of our guidance range of $3.55 to $3.65 per share. Our adjusted estimate for the fourth quarter is $0.59 per share, which implies an estimated full year result of $3.60 on an adjusted basis. Turning now to electricity sales in the economy, year-to-date 2023 weather-normal retail electricity sales were approximately 0.5% lower than sales levels for the first nine months of 2022. Year-to-date, we have added approximately 35,000 electric customers and 19,000 gas customers, trends which continue to outpace pre-pandemic levels. Strong commercial usage was offset by a return to office dynamic and residential sales as the relationship between these two customer groups appears to have largely reached pre-pandemic status. Lower industrial sales continued to be driven by weakness in the chemical, paper and housing-related sectors. More broadly, our service territories are in a period of industrial transition particularly as it pertains to manufacturing. Historically, significant industries such as paper and chemicals are making way for the manufacturing of solar panels, batteries, airplanes and electric automobiles. As Chris mentioned earlier, during 2023, we have continued to see an extraordinary level of economic development activity within our service territories. While we will provide formal updates to our outlook during our fourth quarter earnings call in February, we did want to highlight the magnitude of potential change we are seeing in electricity sales growth. Recall, our previous forecast assumed annual electricity sales growth of 0% to 1%. Factoring in the power needs of these new, highly data-centric businesses and manufacturing facilities, electricity sales are likely to have an annual growth rate closer to a mid- to high single-digit range over the next five years. While there is likely to be significant incremental capital investment required to serve this level of economic development activity, we expect both existing and new customers to recognize economic benefits from this growth. Chris, I'll now turn the call back over to you. Yes, Carly, it's a great question. And look, just order of magnitude, we'll provide specific guidance in February. But I think as we sit here today on the very front end of this IRP update process, we do see pretty substantial potential increases. And potentially, we're talking billions of dollars where our current five-year plan for capital is $43 billion. I think we easily see a plan that translates to something north of $45 billion, and it's really a question of how much higher than $45 billion once we get to February and kind of lay that out. And I say all that continuing to be conservative about including any owned renewables. We absolutely across all of our electric service territories expect to own renewables over the forecast horizon. But we're going to wait until there's better line of sight on those individual projects to include those. So getting to your question in terms of financing, we've been very clear about our credit objectives. And I think our profile is positioned to be differentiated, and it's our objective over the long term to preserve that differentiated profile. And so that will mean the potential for maybe turning on our equity plans. We're fortunate to have one of the largest, if not the largest drips in the industry. We can generate between $350 million and $400 million a year just through those. And then we always keep on the shelf and at the market program just to have flexibility. So, we will absolutely do what we need to do to preserve the credit profile in terms of the balance of how that's financed. I think it's still a fraction of any incremental capital that translates to equity. Again, I mentioned billions of capital and hundreds of millions of potential equity through the drip. I think that will be sufficient to maintain where we want to be. I think where we sit today, Carly, just kind of on an unadjusted basis, if you will, so not trying to factor in equity credit or content for any particular securities. We're a little south just of 30% overall. I think as the business grows, we don't really intend to grow that percentage. So, the absolute quantum of debt may increase over time, but the proportion of parent debt to the rest of our debt will remain about the same, I think. Yes. Look, Shar, it's a great question. It's the right question. But Chris and I have been out speaking to the investment community for months well in advance of this filing with the Georgia Commission coming together and acknowledging that whether it's owned renewables, whether it's the kind of economic development growth that we -- and activity we've been seeing, potential for more capital has been lingering out there. But what we've both been very clear about is it's not our objective to raise the growth rate as a result of that. What this opportunity presents itself as is an opportunity to strengthen the profile of the growth rate to potentially sustain it longer term. And again, the important governor on all of this is really two factors: One, we're focused on the long term here. We're not trying to have some temporarily higher growth rate in the short term. And more importantly, number two, is customer affordability, making sure that we maintain a profile from a customer perspective that preserves the constructive regulatory environments, we're fortunate to have. The other great benefit of everything that we're seeing and the fundamentals that Chris and I are so excited about is this level of sales growth. That, in and of itself, will provide an opportunity to mitigate the affordability equation. Yes. Look, Shar, just like we did this year, we're going to kind of be thoughtful, creative, somewhat aggressive in terms of how we manage that. You saw us do the convert earlier this year that really mitigated the interest impact. We'll do everything kind of at our disposal to execute in a way that keeps rates as low as possible. I think what everyone is likely stepping back in the industry and saying is, look, we all knew interest rates were higher, and this sense of higher for longer as you sit here today, it's probably the longer piece that we all thought was perhaps not as long as what we're seeing as we sit here. But I think it's all consistent. And for us, kind of mitigated by this tremendous windfall of economic development activity we have. In terms of sensitivities, look, if you think about kind of a 50 basis point sensitivity around interest rates as we move forward, think with every incremental year, it's basically another an incremental penny of potential EPS plus or minus for that 50 basis points of interest rate sensitivity. And we're not interest rate forecasters. We're just basically using kind of public forecasts that are out there in terms of our planning. Yes. When you hear us talk about economic development activity and announcements, Dave, typically, that is three, four, five years from announcement time for facilities to get built, to get staffed to get trained and operating at a capacity that's meaningful to our load. It's upside to the upside, Julien. So again, and I mentioned this earlier, we're going to continue to be conservative on owned renewables that we absolutely have an expectation that will become part of the mix we're not going to forecast it until we have better line of sight on individual projects. And in Alabama, those will largely be tied to individual customer stories. When it comes to this economic development activity, while I think kind of the tip of the spear sit here today is what's happening in Georgia, there's a lot of momentum across the rest of our electric service territory for opportunities like this. Yes. So on the first part, Julien, in terms of the mix of ownership -- and this is going to be true for all of our electric service territories. It will be a mix. We expect to own a meaningful amount, but there is likely to be third-party PPAs in the mix here, just like there has historically. So, that's the reason we're not including anything forecast. We don't want to be presumptuous as to exactly what that mix is. We just know or we have an expectation it will be meaningful. On the -- I'm sorry, what was the second question again, Julien? Yes. I would call it flat, Julian. So, it's flat over the long term. Our credit quality is a buffer against adversity that we have no desire to consume nor do we have -- or are we positioned where we've got to kind of over equitize incremental growth. It is a flat long-term objective. Yes. And I guess it's just a matter of discipline for us. This is you could go back to every third quarter transcript, script ever, and you're going to hear the same answer. But I think it's fair to say where we are. Chris and I are really excited about. Our value proposition I would stack up against anybody else's right now. Sure. Look, there's a lot of moving parts here, as you can imagine. And I don't want to get ahead of the regulatory process and things that will be evaluated in terms of the ultimate resource plan that's decided on. But stepping back at a really high level, everything that we see from a load growth perspective relative to the resources needed to serve this growing peak load, and that's key, right. You invest to make sure you can meet the peak loads, but the customers that you're adding aren't just using electricity at the peak, and it just so happens, the customers that we're adding are expected to use electricity oftentimes 24/7. And so that kind of profile will provide more than sufficient revenue at the rate structures that exist today that is needed to pay for that capital. That is where the economic benefits for other customers have the opportunity to really help with this affordability equation. So, we didn't really update the year-end three months ago. Again, just as that same discipline, we only address year-end on our third quarter call. And so it's the first time we're really refining it. It's really about the first half of the year. Yes, we had a better-than-expected third quarter, but the headwinds of weather in the first half were pretty substantial. And that's why we're $0.34 below last year on a year-to-date basis. And so that's the biggest driver of kind of the middle of guidance expectations at the end of the year. Now I say all that, Andrew, I mean, again, we put out quarterly estimates all the time, and I kind of challenge you to go back and find a time where we didn't exceed that. So that should help with where our expectations are. And while that's an assumption in this IRP update, I think that will be a decision to be made in a future IRP proceeding in terms of those existing coal units. We'll do our best to assess where we are. There may be some degree of uncertainty, but I think we'll be able to reflect a good bit of it. Yes. Great question, Angie, because it had been a while since we've done anything at Southern Power and really what changed was the IRA. So, we had stopped doing solar projects kind of middle of the last decade. We did a lot through 2015 through 2016 and then didn't do any sense because we didn't like the profile of investment tax credits for solar projects. The PTC is something that matches much better our regular, predictable, sustainable earnings profile and that the IRA kind of unlocked a lot of development activity on the solar front. And so the opportunity set was really big, and we narrowed it down to a couple of projects here recently that fit the kind of criteria we look for. Look, again, just to reiterate for everyone what we do at Southern Power, it's long-term contracts, it's creditworthy counterparties. It's returns that are better overall from an equity perspective than our regulated business, and it fits our overall profile. Southern Power is balance sheet financed, right? In of itself is a BBB+ company, and it's an important. If you think about the bulk of Southern Power, the rest of it, the natural gas fleet you think about what's happening with capacity needs in the Southeast, that business has become something of a crown jewel in the Southeast because it is one of the best providers of reliable, dispatchable capacity in the Southeast. So it's a business that's important to us, and these were two great opportunities to grow it. This is not a credit play, Angie, that 0%. Yes. You didn't hear that 40 years and then we're back. Yes. Look, there's always a toolbox. I would argue our toolbox is a lot smaller than it used to be when it comes to alternative sources of capital. We did a lot of work over the last several years to kind of hone this portfolio of companies to something that really fits and that we feel really good about. So are there some small opportunities? Yes. But do we have any for sale sign sitting out there right now? No? Yes. I think it's primarily just working our way down to a sustainable payout ratio, right? So if you think about where our guidance sits here in 2023, our payout is going to be something like 77% for 2023. That's not a sustainable payout ratio for a growing company. Now that's largely a function of the ROEs we've been earning at Georgia Power during construction of Vogtle 3 and 4. As that rolls off, that payout ratio will begin to come down, but we just need to get it somewhere comfortably into something that probably starts with a six in order to start evaluating a higher growth rate."

I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please, go ahead, sir.\nScott Gammill: Thank you, Tommy. Good afternoon and welcome to Southern Company’s second quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining me today are Chris Womack, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company, and Dan Tucker, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you, we’ll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I’ll turn the call over to Chris Womack.\nChris Womack: Thank you, Scott and good afternoon and thank you for joining us for what is such a pivotal and exciting time for our company. As many of you know, on Monday, we announced that Plant Vogtle Unit 3 successfully achieved commercial operation. While work remains to bring Unit 4 online, this incredible milestone is something to be celebrated. This decade-plus journey which involved development in global supply chain, managing through a global pandemic, tens of thousands of American craft workers and engineers and millions of labor hours, combined with a group of committed co-owners and regulators that had the courage to support new nuclear power as an option when others didn't prove that we can accomplish monumental things when we share a common vision. Vogtle Unit 3 is now serving Georgia customers with over 1,100 megawatts, a 24-hour, seven-day a week carbon-free electricity. Turning now to Unit 4. Since our last call, the project team continues to make substantial progress as highlighted by completion of hot functional testing, receipt of all 157 fuel assemblies, so middle of all iTAC and most recently, receipt of the 103G finding from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission signifies acceptance criteria for Unit 4 have been met. The project team's current focus is working through final testing and system turnover to operations that when complete, will allow fuel load for Unit 4. Recall, as we contemplated in the VCM 17 order, Georgia Power can file his prudence request with the Public Service Commission following fuel load on Unit 4. Following fuel load, the project team will conduct final preparations and testing of systems primarily associated with the electrical power production side of the plant. And achieving the pristine conditions in the nuclear island necessary for start-up activities and initial criticality. Importantly, the project capital cost forecast is unchanged since last quarter. and we continue to project Unit 4 will be placed in service between late fourth quarter 2023 and end of the first quarter 2024. The successful completion of this important project critical for George's and our nation's energy future. We look forward to these units providing reliable, carbon-free energy to customers for decades to come. Dan, I'll now turn the call over to you for a financial update.\nDan Tucker: Thanks Chris and good afternoon everyone. For the second quarter of 2023, our adjusted earnings were $0.79 per share $0.04 higher than our estimate and $0.28 lower than last year. The primary drivers of our performance compared to last year were milder than normal weather conditions, higher depreciation and amortization and interest expense and changes in rates and pricing, somewhat offset by lower income taxes and O&M expenses. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results as compared to 2022 and is included in today's release and earnings package. Weather in our electric service territories during the first half of 2023 has been the mildest on record with the fewest aggregate degree days in the 129-year history of climate data reported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, more commonly known as NOA. The negative $0.16 per share EPS impact relative to our weather normal EPS guidance range is our largest ever negative weather-driven variance for the first six months of a year which is a significant headwind for the full year. While 2022 was a year in which we were able to fix the roof while the sun is shining and position the company well coming into 2023. We have been and will remain keenly focused on cost management, along with our constant focus on safety, reliability and customer satisfaction in the second half of this year. Our adjusted earnings estimate for the third quarter of 2023 is $1.30 per share. Turning now to retail sales in the economy. Year-to-date 2023, Weather-normal retail sales were in line with sales levels for the first half of 2022. We've seen positive residential and commercial growth and strong commercial usage offset by lower industrial sales. Year-to-date, we've added nearly 24,000 electric customers and 13,000 natural gas customers, trends which continue to outpace pre-pandemic levels. Chris, I'll now turn the call back over to you.\nChris Womack: Thank you, Dan. In closing, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge that Southern Company was recently awarded the number nine overall spot on Forbes ranking of America's best employers for women. The highest ranking within our industry. We are honored to be selected to this list once again. Workforce and leadership diversity is a tenant of ours and ensures we have the variety of experiences and perspectives to better serve our customers. We will continue to emphasize a culture where all employees feel valued, respected and able to accomplish their professional goals. Thank you for joining us this afternoon and for your interest in Southern Company. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you very much. And we'll proceed with our first question on the line is from Shahriar Pourreza, Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nChris Womack: Shar good afternoon.\nShahriar Pourreza: Good morning. Chris, that was the world record for the fastest prepared remarks. So, congrats here on that one.\nChris Womack: Thanks. Always appreciate your comments and your analysis. And your perspective.\nShahriar Pourreza: Just starting on George's economic backdrop. And obviously, you guys have seen a step change in the pace that major industrial customers have been announcing new capacity needs. How many, I guess, new gigawatts are you seeing now in Georgia versus the prior update with the state? What is the prior IRP embed? How should we sort of think about any updates to capacity needs, including the viability of the remaining coal assets as you're thinking about this incremental demand. So could we see a drastically different IRP being filed? Thanks.\nChris Womack: And Shar, we're working through that analysis now. I think we have said to you before, and we've commented about all the wonderful conic development activity that we've seen across the state of Georgia over the past couple of years. Some 250-plus projects, $20-plus billion of investment, some 60,000 jobs that I know the governor has reported. So, I think we've talked about the impressive activity that seen. We've not turned that into the capacity needs at this time. That's some work that we're doing. And I'm sure forthcoming, we'll work with the commission on what all that means and then figure out what it means for us in terms of capacity needs going forward. But I think it's a little bit premature.\nDan Tucker: Look, again, we're kind of going through the analysis, but it's fair to say what we've seen from economic development announcement perspective in the past is hundreds of megawatts at a maximum in a given year. And now we're having instances where it's thousands potentially in terms of the announcements. And so just the pace has accelerated. And you mentioned industrial, there's certainly a lot of large industrials involved with that, particularly around the electric transportation sector. but it's also data centers. It's a story that's playing out in a lot of places. Just as an example for ours. I mean, as we sit here today, data centers are roughly 2.5% of our overall electric load Five years from now, that will be well into the double digits in terms of percentage of our load. That's the pace of growth we're seeing.\nChris Womack: We're very excited about it. I think it's a real positive contribution, positive factor that we're excited about here in the state.\nShahriar Pourreza: Do you have a sense, Chris, on when you and Cam and Dan and the team could update us around that potential opportunity. I know it's really early in the process, but we're obviously seeing the amount of customers that are moving to Texas, and it's very material. So, I mean, to Georgia, which is really material. So, I'm just kind of curious on what the time?\nChris Womack: Yes. Sure. I think it's a little bit premature. But as soon as we get to that point, and we figure out and have a conversation with the commission. I'm sure we'll share that with you share that with the industry.\nShahriar Pourreza: Okay, perfect. And then lastly, Chris, we're obviously approaching the prudency case once we see Unit 4 fuel load. Anything you can provide and how we should be thinking about a potential settlement, or should we be thinking about like a rate case? And whether the potential for like a special election could impact the process, if at all, especially if fuel load takes long to the plan.\nChris Womack: Yes. Shar, I think there are a couple of questions. You embedded there together. First, around proven, we have to get the fuel load. Once we get the feel, we'll figure out what happens having transparency in the process is very important. But right now, once we get to fuel load, then we'll figure that out. We'll work with the commission and the staff on that process. I think the you made reference to the makeup of the commission, I mean, I -- the sense is that we'll get through prudence with the current commission. We have no idea what will happen in the Rose case, so we're still waiting for that order for that decision by the courts. But there's nothing more I can say about that decision at this point in time.\nShahriar Pourreza: Okay. Perfect. Thank you, Chris and Dan. Very helpful. I appreciate it and congrats.\nChris Womack: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll get to our next question on the line. It is from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nChris Womack: Carly how are you?\nCarly Davenport: Doing well. Thanks so much for taking the questions today. I appreciate it. Maybe just starting in terms of what we saw during the quarter for weather-normalized demand a little bit weaker on the industrial side, but commercial still looks quite strong. Can you just talk about how things are evolving relative to your forecast and kind of how you could see that evolving as we continue to move through the year?\nDan Tucker: Yes, absolutely, Carly. And we saw this earlier this year as well. From an industrial perspective, we're seeing -- two different dynamics play out that are negatively impacting growth. And those -- one is the housing sector. So, when it comes to things like lumber, stone clean glass to a degree textiles, particularly where it involves carpet, just given the broader trends in the housing industry, we're seeing that impact some of our usage in the short-term. And then the other thing is chemicals from a an industrial perspective. So we've had one particular facility in Alabama that has slowed pretty significantly. Again, some of that was anticipated very early in the year, and so it's just playing out as we anticipated, just wasn't anticipated when we kind of put our forecast together right before the end of the year. What we're really encouraged by what we're seeing on the commercial and residential side. I spoke to the customer growth that we're seeing from a residential perspective, again, we've seen sustained levels well above what we were seeing pre-pandemic. And from a commercial perspective, just a lot of different stories playing out in that regard. Some of its economic development, some of it is this data center dynamic that I mentioned. And certainly, a lot of it is just commercial naturally following the residential growth. As it pertains to how it's impacting our results, what's important to remember is kind of the revenue contribution of these two classes on a relative basis. A 1% change in industrial sales is only about $20 million of impact here as a 1% change in residential and commercial is more like $40 million to $50 million. So in terms of a net implication for us, we're getting the benefit of the residential commercial more than offsetting what we're seeing on industrial.\nCarly Davenport: Got it. That's super helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just on the financing front in the context of the current rate environment. Just you've got some financing kind of still outstanding for the rest of this year. Just how are you thinking about execution of the plan that you have as we move through 2023?\nDan Tucker: Yes, Carly. Look, we're always going to kind of keep our options open, the flexibility. You've seen us do the convertible debt instrument early this year. We typically lean on an ongoing basis towards just senior unsecured stuff at the parent. Lot of different instruments we've used across the utility franchises. I wouldn't characterize anything in our plans as out of the ordinary. We're going to be monitoring the market and making sure we're being thoughtful about as we always are maturities about the mix between fixed and variable and like everyone is doing, monitoring the rates as actively as we can to make sure we're getting to the market when it makes sense.\nCarly Davenport: Appreciate the color. Thank you.\nDan Tucker: You bet Carly. Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll get to our next question on the line. It is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith, Bank of America. Go right ahead.\nChris Womack: Julien, how are you doing?\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Thanks for the time. Great. Thanks so much. Really appreciate it. Hey look, just coming back to the other subject here on procurement and renewables -- on the renewables front. I know we talked about this last quarter here. Curious to hear your latest thoughts, both on the utility side and ownership think that had always been kind of back half of this year. How is that looking on that front in Georgia? And then separately, I think, Dan, last time we connected here, you were talking about the Southern Power effort looking like it was a tad more competitive in this environment. in terms of your ability to actually win and accrue projects from that side of the house. Do you want to talk about some of the progress and maybe the evolution just with the rate environment where it is?\nChris Womack: Yes, Julien, let me start with on the renewables front. As you know, in the 22 IRP, Georgia had another 2,100 megawatts of renewables approved doing that proceeding. The first IRP will begin later this year, targeting some 1,300 megawatts of renewable resources with operation dates between 2026 and 2027. I think you may have also seen Alabama Power guidance renewable generation certification modified some 2,400 megawatts over a six-year period. So I think that will also be later this year. So, we're proceeding and we're looking forward to opportunities for us to own some renewables. Clearly, we'll take advantage of the normalization of tax treatment between PTCs and ITCs and pursuing it from a best cost perspective. And we think we've got support from our commissions to for us to own more renewables. So, we're looking forward to those processes as they proceed later this year. I think your other question, Dan, you want to talk about pricing?\nDan Tucker: Well, I think the other question was around Southern Power and yes, Julian, the same continues to hold true. The radar screen of active, viable opportunities for Southern Power is as strong as it's ever been. And look, we fully expect to be able to continue to deploy capital in the right way there. We'll keep the same discipline we've always had in terms of the hurdles we look for, the risk profile, long-term contracts, creditworthy counterparty, but I think my short message there on Southern Power would just be stay tuned. There's good things happening.\nChris Womack: So bottom line, Julien, I think we're very optimistic on the regulated side of what the future holds for renewables. And we'll see how that plays out -- begin to play out later this year?\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. And then just as you think about the generation needs that the prior questioners have been really kind of poking at here, aligned with, as you alluded to a second ago, the added ability to own some of this renewable generation through utility tax credit optimization, if you will. Can you talk about that opportunity coming together and maybe specifically the time line that you could see that starting to play itself out? I know we just alluded to the prior IRP cycle, but getting the CapEx proposals, RFPs and ultimately just seeing that load forecast updated?\nChris Womack: Yes, Julien, once again, I think it's a little premature in that regard. Clearly, as I spoke to earlier, about the renewable process and the RFPs, we see that forthcoming later this year. Clearly, we've got some more work to do as we -- as we analyze the implications of the second night development activity and what is meaningful for loads. And so we simply right now need to let the RFP process play out. over the next few months and next few years. But we'll keep you updated as we move through the process.\nDan Tucker: Yes. As we've said before, consistent with what Chris just said, this will come together from a plan and capital deployment perspective in the latter part of our forecast horizon. So it was not a 2023 thing in terms of capital deployment might but probably not a meaningful 2024 -- but beyond that is where the real opportunity exists. And the other thing that's coming together to help drive this. And I think you mentioned the economic development aspect, Julian, as all these customers are choosing to locate in our service territories, they are increasingly demanding to be served with renewable generation, and that's just helping support everything we're trying to do.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: I hear you. Wish you guys best block and I hope to see you guys soon. All right. Take care.\nChris Womack: All right, Julian.\nOperator: Thank you very much. We'll get to our next question on the line is from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Go right ahead.\nChris Womack: Hey Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good afternoon. Just want to see, I guess, with start-off Vogtle here, some of the issues at the finish line gear, just wondering what learnings you take away from that? And do you see the same type of issues materializing for Unit 4 or there weren't here that can kind of head off any issues like that?\nChris Womack: And Jeremy, one of the things we've commented for -- we set a prior for a few years now that there would be lessons learned as we transfer over from unit 3 to unit 4. Let me just give you some examples of how that is playing out. On Unit 3 hot functional testing took 94 days on Unit 4. It took 88 days. It move forward from 94 -- took 42 days. Hot functional testing to complete to 103G was 371 days on Unit 3, 88 days on Unit 4. And from coal hydro, to hot functional test start was 191 days on Unit 3 to 103 days on Unit 4. So, I think you're seeing clear examples of how lessons are being learned from Unit 3 over Unit 4. And that that work -- those lessons learned will continue, I think, to show itself as we move through Unit 4.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. Thanks. And -- just kind of pivoting here. I think you saw that the D.C. core overruled for its approval of the Southeast Energy exchange market, just what do you make up this year? And what's the path forward?\nChris Womack: Yes. I mean, it remanded it back to FERC to clarify a couple of issues around the power pool, and there are some questions about who is who could participate in and seeing that it has to be interconnections. So I think they're simply remanded back for clarification of a couple of issues, but nothing big there. I mean seeing continues to operate and performed very well. Everybody is very pleased with the results we've seen. So, it will be -- it's going to be remanded back to FERC, like I said, with a couple of issues that they'll clarify for seen going forward.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. Thanks. And just last one, if I could. What are you expecting on hydrogen reg from treasury? And what do you think Southern Power's potential to participate could be with Vogtle and the potential for green hydrogen?\nChris Womack: Let me say something quickly about hydrogen, and I'll let Dan touch on any rules from treasury. We're participating in a number of processes DOE has with hydrogen hub. So we're excited about that. As you may recall, we did a 20% blend at our Platt McDonough Gas site. So we're excited about all the technology activity and the considerations that are going on around hydrogen. We look forward to seeing if we can develop this market and get the pricing right, get the transportation of the product right and then we can find off-takers. I mean, so we're thrilled by the possibility and how Vogtle can continue to serve customers in Georgia. So there are a lot of aspects of hydrogen that we get really excited about. Clearly, there's a lot of work that's got to be -- that we've got to work through to get to that point to make it viably commercial -- commercially viable.\nA – Daniel Tucker: Yes. And Jeremy, in terms of the treasury rig, certainly, like most in the industry, I think for us, it makes sense that those are as broad as possible going in to help kind of drive the deployment of the technology. Otherwise, it just may be cost prohibitive for a lot of people to get it out there. And whether that's a permanent broadness or it's a temporary broadness that transitions to something more specific, I think that's going to be in the hands of the Treasury Group. In terms of Southern Power's opportunity to play there, certainly, Southern Power's wheelhouse is providing utility scale, renewable generation to counterparties. And to the extent that we find opportunities in this space to serve an electrolyzer or another entity with a long-term contract, and it's a creditworthy counterparty, and it meets all of the same criteria. It certainly expands our universe of opportunities.\nQ – Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. I leave it there. Thanks.\nA – Daniel Tucker: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll get to our next question on the line is from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead.\nA – Christopher Womack: Hey, Dave.\nA – Daniel Tucker: How are you, David?\nDavid Arcaro: Hey, good. Thanks for taking my questions. Wondering if you might be able to touch a little bit on Forum Energy [ph]. You had an agreement reached to Georgia Power this quarter. I was wondering how you're thinking long duration energy storage might play a role in your system over time? .\nA – Christopher Womack: Once again, we're excited about the relationship that we've established with Forum. We have utilized the kind of 4- to 6-hour batteries we think a 100-megawatt -- 100-hour loan duration storage battery on 15 megawatts has got to be a part of the mix and it's got to be a part of the system and the grid going forward. So -- we're excited about what Forum is doing. We were at their ground breaking ribbon cutting up in West Virginia a month or so ago. So we are excited about Forum and looking forward to their development as we go forward. But we think this has got to be a part of the technology mix as we go forward, and we're hoping they're going to be successful. As you know, we pay a lot of attention to research and development. And we think as we look at a lot of solutions, whether it's submissions control or just making sure we maintain a reliable and resilient grid, we think technology advancement is very, very critical. And so -- we're excited about the work that form is doing, and we're glad to partner with them.\nQ – David Arcaro: Great. That makes sense. And then secondly, obviously, a big weather headwind that you're working through. And could you touch on the cost control -- just your confidence level in being able to manage and find flex in your O&M budget for this year? And where are the key areas that you're looking at in terms of offsetting the headwind so far?\nA – Christopher Womack: Yes. I think -- and Dan said it in the conversation earlier that we'll remain keenly focused on cost management. And so we've got to correspond with that with similar focus on cost management. And so there are a number of efforts going on across the company to make sure that we are executing around cost management controls. And right now, we feel good about where we are, but we know we've got a lot more work to do as we go forward through the rest of the year.\nDavid Arcaro: Okay. Understood. Congratulations on Vogtle Unit 3. And thanks again. I appreciate it.\nChris Womack: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll get our next question on the line. It is from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Go ahead.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey, good afternoon guys. 7 minutes and 58 seconds of prepared remarks. I'll keep it real brief, hopefully. Just following up on David's question. So this quarter, we had $0.04 of unfavorable weather versus normal, but you actually delivered $0.04 higher than your estimates. Is that all just cost cuts, or are there other things that we should think about onetime or and other things?\nDan Tucker: Yeah. It's primarily cost reductions, Durgesh. I mean there's always some little puts and takes here and there that are a little different than our forecast. But overall, it's just the fruit of our labor. And going back to Dave's original question in terms of where, frankly, be doing a disservice to highlight any particular area of the business where we're doing that because we're doing it everywhere. This is a significant lift, and we're doing everything we need to do and pulling out all the stops to deliver.\nDurgesh Chopra: Okay, solid. And then just maybe if you can, otherwise, I'll just follow up with Scott. Just any initial takes on July weather?\nDan Tucker: It hasn't looked like the first half.\nDurgesh Chopra: Okay. Thanks so much. Appreciate the time.\nOperator: Thank you very much. We’ll get to our next question on the line. It’s from Nick Campanella from Barclays. Go ahead.\nNick Campanella: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Hope you're doing well, and congrats on the Unit 3 news.\nChris Womack: Thanks Nick.\nNick Campanella: Yes, absolutely. So just looking forward to Unit 4 soon and then knowing that we're getting closer to that $700 million uplift that you detailed in slides here on the CFO. Dan, maybe you can just remind us your preferred use of those cash flows as you roll forward your plan in the fourth quarter. And I know we talked about improving balance sheet in the past, but I'm also cognizant you're talking up a lot of different CapEx opportunities in your region?\nDan Tucker: Yeah. Nick, and thanks for that question. It really is kind of all of the above strategy, if you will, in terms of the opportunity to use this cash. And the three things that we're primarily focused on, you said one, which is to fund the capital plan, right? So we'll be positioned as we had been historically kind of pre-penalty ROEs and heavy construction on BOGO 3 and 4, where our operating cash flow represents over three times the size of our common dividend. And so that leaves an awful lot of cash flow to deploy against this capital plan that we expect to continue to grow that’s thing one, the number one priority of the things we're focused on, you also mentioned this is credit quality. And what this does is provide an uplift to our credit metrics such that we're more in the 17, 17-plus range for FFO to debt. And the opportunity there is not raise at these levels well-above our thresholds and then use that as some sort of currency to do things, that's the opportunity to just once again get back to being a premium credit utility and maintaining that position for the foreseeable future. So that's thing too. And then the third thing that we've talked a lot about is the opportunity that we'll have as our payout ratio gets, kind of, sustainably at or maybe a little below 70%, so called that maybe 2024, but more likely 2025, an opportunity to go to our Board and for Chris and I to make a recommendation to increase the rate of the dividend growth to be more aligned with our earnings growth. So it's, again, all of the above, but really important things that this enables us to do.\nNick Campanella: All right. Thanks for that. That’s it from me today. Appreciate it.\nChris Womack: Thanks, Nick.\nNick Campanella: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll get to our next question on the line is from Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Go ahead.\nChris Womack: Hi, Angie. Angie, how are you?\nAngie Storozynski: Very good. Thanks. So just -- you guys have been in this combat mode for the last for a decade or it feels like. And I know that there's still the prudence review ahead of you. But I'm just trying to picture southern -- and back to basics mode. So I mean, what does it even look like? So that's one. And number two is, I mean, you clearly -- the stock has re-rated somewhat. What is it that you think you can do? Well, besides just putting Unit 4 online to further re-rate the stock from here?\nChris Womack: And Angie, let me start with the first part of your question in terms of being in combat mode doing this vogtle period. I'd say we're going to stay in combat mode in terms of execution. Yes, hopefully, we're going to be a little boring. We think boring is beautiful. But we're going to be incredibly aggressively focused on customers being at the center of everything that we do focus on the circle of life, making sure we're maintaining a constructive regulatory environment providing world-class service and using your language of in combat mode, but doing that in a very aggressive way that make sure we're giving customers what they need from a reliability, but also a resilient perspective, but also making sure we're paying attention to issues around portability. So we have a lot of work to do. And so we're going to be very singly focused on execution. And I think that's going to be very important as we also make the case that we deserve that premium valuation and returning back to the days of old Southern classic.\nDan Tucker: It is no mistake and no accident that the first page of our deck has a circle of life one.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. And then just maybe a smaller point, but you guys have, just like everybody else, more violent and impact storms going through your service territory. Is there anything from one investment perspective to regulatory setup that could help you, you know, hardening the grid and also assure timely recovery of any costs associated with those would the climate change basically?\nChris Womack: And I would say, I mean, if you look at our capital budget today and getting pass but with there are no really large projects, but it's a lot of blocking and tackling transmission distribution with grid improvement programs, with undergrounding, with changing out circuits and improving technology scale systems a lot of that work to enhance and improve reliability, but also improve resiliency so that storms are more different paying attention to more extreme weather, so doing the basic work to prepare for these kind of conditions and help us to maintain our focus on reliability and the resiliency of our system.\nAngie Storozynski: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you very much. And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks?\nChris Womack: Once again, let me thank everybody for your calls today. It's a wonderful time for Southern Company as we brought Unit 3 commercial and with the progress that we're making on unit and we'll continue to press ahead and move forward. But again, thank everybody for joining us today. Thank you very much, and everybody, be safe.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Southern Company second quarter 2023 earnings call. You may now disconnect, and have a great rest of the day.",

            "name": "Chris Womack",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott and good afternoon and thank you for joining us for what is such a pivotal and exciting time for our company. As many of you know, on Monday, we announced that Plant Vogtle Unit 3 successfully achieved commercial operation. While work remains to bring Unit 4 online, this incredible milestone is something to be celebrated. This decade-plus journey which involved development in global supply chain, managing through a global pandemic, tens of thousands of American craft workers and engineers and millions of labor hours, combined with a group of committed co-owners and regulators that had the courage to support new nuclear power as an option when others didn't prove that we can accomplish monumental things when we share a common vision. Vogtle Unit 3 is now serving Georgia customers with over 1,100 megawatts, a 24-hour, seven-day a week carbon-free electricity. Turning now to Unit 4. Since our last call, the project team continues to make substantial progress as highlighted by completion of hot functional testing, receipt of all 157 fuel assemblies, so middle of all iTAC and most recently, receipt of the 103G finding from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission signifies acceptance criteria for Unit 4 have been met. The project team's current focus is working through final testing and system turnover to operations that when complete, will allow fuel load for Unit 4. Recall, as we contemplated in the VCM 17 order, Georgia Power can file his prudence request with the Public Service Commission following fuel load on Unit 4. Following fuel load, the project team will conduct final preparations and testing of systems primarily associated with the electrical power production side of the plant. And achieving the pristine conditions in the nuclear island necessary for start-up activities and initial criticality. Importantly, the project capital cost forecast is unchanged since last quarter. and we continue to project Unit 4 will be placed in service between late fourth quarter 2023 and end of the first quarter 2024. The successful completion of this important project critical for George's and our nation's energy future. We look forward to these units providing reliable, carbon-free energy to customers for decades to come. Dan, I'll now turn the call over to you for a financial update. Thank you, Dan. In closing, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge that Southern Company was recently awarded the number nine overall spot on Forbes ranking of America's best employers for women. The highest ranking within our industry. We are honored to be selected to this list once again. Workforce and leadership diversity is a tenant of ours and ensures we have the variety of experiences and perspectives to better serve our customers. We will continue to emphasize a culture where all employees feel valued, respected and able to accomplish their professional goals. Thank you for joining us this afternoon and for your interest in Southern Company. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Shar good afternoon. Thanks. Always appreciate your comments and your analysis. And your perspective. And Shar, we're working through that analysis now. I think we have said to you before, and we've commented about all the wonderful conic development activity that we've seen across the state of Georgia over the past couple of years. Some 250-plus projects, $20-plus billion of investment, some 60,000 jobs that I know the governor has reported. So, I think we've talked about the impressive activity that seen. We've not turned that into the capacity needs at this time. That's some work that we're doing. And I'm sure forthcoming, we'll work with the commission on what all that means and then figure out what it means for us in terms of capacity needs going forward. But I think it's a little bit premature. We're very excited about it. I think it's a real positive contribution, positive factor that we're excited about here in the state. Yes. Sure. I think it's a little bit premature. But as soon as we get to that point, and we figure out and have a conversation with the commission. I'm sure we'll share that with you share that with the industry. Yes. Shar, I think there are a couple of questions. You embedded there together. First, around proven, we have to get the fuel load. Once we get the feel, we'll figure out what happens having transparency in the process is very important. But right now, once we get to fuel load, then we'll figure that out. We'll work with the commission and the staff on that process. I think the you made reference to the makeup of the commission, I mean, I -- the sense is that we'll get through prudence with the current commission. We have no idea what will happen in the Rose case, so we're still waiting for that order for that decision by the courts. But there's nothing more I can say about that decision at this point in time. Thank you. Carly how are you? Julien, how are you doing? Yes, Julien, let me start with on the renewables front. As you know, in the 22 IRP, Georgia had another 2,100 megawatts of renewables approved doing that proceeding. The first IRP will begin later this year, targeting some 1,300 megawatts of renewable resources with operation dates between 2026 and 2027. I think you may have also seen Alabama Power guidance renewable generation certification modified some 2,400 megawatts over a six-year period. So I think that will also be later this year. So, we're proceeding and we're looking forward to opportunities for us to own some renewables. Clearly, we'll take advantage of the normalization of tax treatment between PTCs and ITCs and pursuing it from a best cost perspective. And we think we've got support from our commissions to for us to own more renewables. So, we're looking forward to those processes as they proceed later this year. I think your other question, Dan, you want to talk about pricing? So bottom line, Julien, I think we're very optimistic on the regulated side of what the future holds for renewables. And we'll see how that plays out -- begin to play out later this year? Yes, Julien, once again, I think it's a little premature in that regard. Clearly, as I spoke to earlier, about the renewable process and the RFPs, we see that forthcoming later this year. Clearly, we've got some more work to do as we -- as we analyze the implications of the second night development activity and what is meaningful for loads. And so we simply right now need to let the RFP process play out. over the next few months and next few years. But we'll keep you updated as we move through the process. All right, Julian. Hey Jeremy. And Jeremy, one of the things we've commented for -- we set a prior for a few years now that there would be lessons learned as we transfer over from unit 3 to unit 4. Let me just give you some examples of how that is playing out. On Unit 3 hot functional testing took 94 days on Unit 4. It took 88 days. It move forward from 94 -- took 42 days. Hot functional testing to complete to 103G was 371 days on Unit 3, 88 days on Unit 4. And from coal hydro, to hot functional test start was 191 days on Unit 3 to 103 days on Unit 4. So, I think you're seeing clear examples of how lessons are being learned from Unit 3 over Unit 4. And that that work -- those lessons learned will continue, I think, to show itself as we move through Unit 4. Yes. I mean, it remanded it back to FERC to clarify a couple of issues around the power pool, and there are some questions about who is who could participate in and seeing that it has to be interconnections. So I think they're simply remanded back for clarification of a couple of issues, but nothing big there. I mean seeing continues to operate and performed very well. Everybody is very pleased with the results we've seen. So, it will be -- it's going to be remanded back to FERC, like I said, with a couple of issues that they'll clarify for seen going forward. Let me say something quickly about hydrogen, and I'll let Dan touch on any rules from treasury. We're participating in a number of processes DOE has with hydrogen hub. So we're excited about that. As you may recall, we did a 20% blend at our Platt McDonough Gas site. So we're excited about all the technology activity and the considerations that are going on around hydrogen. We look forward to seeing if we can develop this market and get the pricing right, get the transportation of the product right and then we can find off-takers. I mean, so we're thrilled by the possibility and how Vogtle can continue to serve customers in Georgia. So there are a lot of aspects of hydrogen that we get really excited about. Clearly, there's a lot of work that's got to be -- that we've got to work through to get to that point to make it viably commercial -- commercially viable.\nA – Daniel Tucker: Yes. And Jeremy, in terms of the treasury rig, certainly, like most in the industry, I think for us, it makes sense that those are as broad as possible going in to help kind of drive the deployment of the technology. Otherwise, it just may be cost prohibitive for a lot of people to get it out there. And whether that's a permanent broadness or it's a temporary broadness that transitions to something more specific, I think that's going to be in the hands of the Treasury Group. In terms of Southern Power's opportunity to play there, certainly, Southern Power's wheelhouse is providing utility scale, renewable generation to counterparties. And to the extent that we find opportunities in this space to serve an electrolyzer or another entity with a long-term contract, and it's a creditworthy counterparty, and it meets all of the same criteria. It certainly expands our universe of opportunities.\nQ – Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. I leave it there. Thanks.\nA – Daniel Tucker: Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks Nick. Thanks, Nick. Hi, Angie. Angie, how are you? And Angie, let me start with the first part of your question in terms of being in combat mode doing this vogtle period. I'd say we're going to stay in combat mode in terms of execution. Yes, hopefully, we're going to be a little boring. We think boring is beautiful. But we're going to be incredibly aggressively focused on customers being at the center of everything that we do focus on the circle of life, making sure we're maintaining a constructive regulatory environment providing world-class service and using your language of in combat mode, but doing that in a very aggressive way that make sure we're giving customers what they need from a reliability, but also a resilient perspective, but also making sure we're paying attention to issues around portability. So we have a lot of work to do. And so we're going to be very singly focused on execution. And I think that's going to be very important as we also make the case that we deserve that premium valuation and returning back to the days of old Southern classic. And I would say, I mean, if you look at our capital budget today and getting pass but with there are no really large projects, but it's a lot of blocking and tackling transmission distribution with grid improvement programs, with undergrounding, with changing out circuits and improving technology scale systems a lot of that work to enhance and improve reliability, but also improve resiliency so that storms are more different paying attention to more extreme weather, so doing the basic work to prepare for these kind of conditions and help us to maintain our focus on reliability and the resiliency of our system. Once again, let me thank everybody for your calls today. It's a wonderful time for Southern Company as we brought Unit 3 commercial and with the progress that we're making on unit and we'll continue to press ahead and move forward. But again, thank everybody for joining us today. Thank you very much, and everybody, be safe."

            "name": "Dan Tucker",
            "content": "Thanks Chris and good afternoon everyone. For the second quarter of 2023, our adjusted earnings were $0.79 per share $0.04 higher than our estimate and $0.28 lower than last year. The primary drivers of our performance compared to last year were milder than normal weather conditions, higher depreciation and amortization and interest expense and changes in rates and pricing, somewhat offset by lower income taxes and O&M expenses. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results as compared to 2022 and is included in today's release and earnings package. Weather in our electric service territories during the first half of 2023 has been the mildest on record with the fewest aggregate degree days in the 129-year history of climate data reported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, more commonly known as NOA. The negative $0.16 per share EPS impact relative to our weather normal EPS guidance range is our largest ever negative weather-driven variance for the first six months of a year which is a significant headwind for the full year. While 2022 was a year in which we were able to fix the roof while the sun is shining and position the company well coming into 2023. We have been and will remain keenly focused on cost management, along with our constant focus on safety, reliability and customer satisfaction in the second half of this year. Our adjusted earnings estimate for the third quarter of 2023 is $1.30 per share. Turning now to retail sales in the economy. Year-to-date 2023, Weather-normal retail sales were in line with sales levels for the first half of 2022. We've seen positive residential and commercial growth and strong commercial usage offset by lower industrial sales. Year-to-date, we've added nearly 24,000 electric customers and 13,000 natural gas customers, trends which continue to outpace pre-pandemic levels. Chris, I'll now turn the call back over to you. Look, again, we're kind of going through the analysis, but it's fair to say what we've seen from economic development announcement perspective in the past is hundreds of megawatts at a maximum in a given year. And now we're having instances where it's thousands potentially in terms of the announcements. And so just the pace has accelerated. And you mentioned industrial, there's certainly a lot of large industrials involved with that, particularly around the electric transportation sector. but it's also data centers. It's a story that's playing out in a lot of places. Just as an example for ours. I mean, as we sit here today, data centers are roughly 2.5% of our overall electric load Five years from now, that will be well into the double digits in terms of percentage of our load. That's the pace of growth we're seeing. Yes, absolutely, Carly. And we saw this earlier this year as well. From an industrial perspective, we're seeing -- two different dynamics play out that are negatively impacting growth. And those -- one is the housing sector. So, when it comes to things like lumber, stone clean glass to a degree textiles, particularly where it involves carpet, just given the broader trends in the housing industry, we're seeing that impact some of our usage in the short-term. And then the other thing is chemicals from a an industrial perspective. So we've had one particular facility in Alabama that has slowed pretty significantly. Again, some of that was anticipated very early in the year, and so it's just playing out as we anticipated, just wasn't anticipated when we kind of put our forecast together right before the end of the year. What we're really encouraged by what we're seeing on the commercial and residential side. I spoke to the customer growth that we're seeing from a residential perspective, again, we've seen sustained levels well above what we were seeing pre-pandemic. And from a commercial perspective, just a lot of different stories playing out in that regard. Some of its economic development, some of it is this data center dynamic that I mentioned. And certainly, a lot of it is just commercial naturally following the residential growth. As it pertains to how it's impacting our results, what's important to remember is kind of the revenue contribution of these two classes on a relative basis. A 1% change in industrial sales is only about $20 million of impact here as a 1% change in residential and commercial is more like $40 million to $50 million. So in terms of a net implication for us, we're getting the benefit of the residential commercial more than offsetting what we're seeing on industrial. Yes, Carly. Look, we're always going to kind of keep our options open, the flexibility. You've seen us do the convertible debt instrument early this year. We typically lean on an ongoing basis towards just senior unsecured stuff at the parent. Lot of different instruments we've used across the utility franchises. I wouldn't characterize anything in our plans as out of the ordinary. We're going to be monitoring the market and making sure we're being thoughtful about as we always are maturities about the mix between fixed and variable and like everyone is doing, monitoring the rates as actively as we can to make sure we're getting to the market when it makes sense. You bet Carly. Thank you. Well, I think the other question was around Southern Power and yes, Julian, the same continues to hold true. The radar screen of active, viable opportunities for Southern Power is as strong as it's ever been. And look, we fully expect to be able to continue to deploy capital in the right way there. We'll keep the same discipline we've always had in terms of the hurdles we look for, the risk profile, long-term contracts, creditworthy counterparty, but I think my short message there on Southern Power would just be stay tuned. There's good things happening. Yes. As we've said before, consistent with what Chris just said, this will come together from a plan and capital deployment perspective in the latter part of our forecast horizon. So it was not a 2023 thing in terms of capital deployment might but probably not a meaningful 2024 -- but beyond that is where the real opportunity exists. And the other thing that's coming together to help drive this. And I think you mentioned the economic development aspect, Julian, as all these customers are choosing to locate in our service territories, they are increasingly demanding to be served with renewable generation, and that's just helping support everything we're trying to do. Yeah. It's primarily cost reductions, Durgesh. I mean there's always some little puts and takes here and there that are a little different than our forecast. But overall, it's just the fruit of our labor. And going back to Dave's original question in terms of where, frankly, be doing a disservice to highlight any particular area of the business where we're doing that because we're doing it everywhere. This is a significant lift, and we're doing everything we need to do and pulling out all the stops to deliver. It hasn't looked like the first half. Yeah. Nick, and thanks for that question. It really is kind of all of the above strategy, if you will, in terms of the opportunity to use this cash. And the three things that we're primarily focused on, you said one, which is to fund the capital plan, right? So we'll be positioned as we had been historically kind of pre-penalty ROEs and heavy construction on BOGO 3 and 4, where our operating cash flow represents over three times the size of our common dividend. And so that leaves an awful lot of cash flow to deploy against this capital plan that we expect to continue to grow that's thing one, the number one priority of the things we're focused on, you also mentioned this is credit quality. And what this does is provide an uplift to our credit metrics such that we're more in the 17, 17-plus range for FFO to debt. And the opportunity there is not raise at these levels well-above our thresholds and then use that as some sort of currency to do things, that's the opportunity to just once again get back to being a premium credit utility and maintaining that position for the foreseeable future. So that's thing too. And then the third thing that we've talked a lot about is the opportunity that we'll have as our payout ratio gets, kind of, sustainably at or maybe a little below 70%, so called that maybe 2024, but more likely 2025, an opportunity to go to our Board and for Chris and I to make a recommendation to increase the rate of the dividend growth to be more aligned with our earnings growth. So it's, again, all of the above, but really important things that this enables us to do. It is no mistake and no accident that the first page of our deck has a circle of life one."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Kathy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Southern Company First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, April 27, 2023. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.\nScott Gammill : Thank you, Kathy. Good afternoon, and welcome to Southern Company's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Chris Womack, President of Southern Company; and Dan Tucker, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you, we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com.  At this time, I'll turn the call over to Chris Womack.\nChristopher Womack : Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I am delighted to be joining you today on my first earnings call as President of Southern Company. I've enjoyed given the opportunity to interact with many of you over the last couple of months and look forward to meeting with many more of you in the months ahead. I am incredibly excited about the future of Southern Company, the energy industry and the valuable work that we're doing to serve our customers and communities. I am excited about the opportunities ahead of us and proud to be a part of a team that is making such a significant impact in building the future of energy. As you've watched us reposition our deep talented bench across the system, our mission remains unchanged, provide our customers and communities with clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy, while continuing to keep our customers at the center of everything we do. Also unchanged is our goal to deliver superior risk-adjusted total shareholder return. And I believe our financial plan supports that objective. The strength of our value proposition is a function of our customer and community, focused business model, the robust economic growth in our service territories and the constructive regulatory frameworks in our states. It is also a function of our discipline as we remain committed to our objectives of strong investment-grade credit ratings with a regular, predictable and sustainable dividend policy. Along with our focus on long-term execution and value accretion, we are executing on our plans as we -- and believe we're well positioned to achieve our financial objectives for 2023.  Dan, I'll now turn the call over to you for our financial update.\nDaniel Tucker : Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. For the first quarter of 2023, our adjusted EPS was $0.79 per share, $0.18 lower than the first quarter of 2022 and $0.09 above our estimate. The major driver for the variance to last year was milder-than-normal weather as the first quarter of 2023 was the warmest on record in the Southeast. Higher depreciation and amortization and interest expense also impacted earnings for the first quarter compared to last year and were somewhat offset by constructive state regulatory actions. A complete reconciliation of our year-over-year earnings is included in the materials we released this morning. When looking at adjusted EPS impact compared to our estimate for the quarter, the main drivers were a strong start for our state regulated natural gas utilities and continued strong electric and gas customer growth. Given the mid-February timing of our last earnings call, we were able to factor milder than normal January and February weather into our estimate for the quarter, so weather was not a major driver of our performance versus our estimate. You may recall that our adjusted earnings in the first half of 2022 were significantly better than projected due to weather and other market-driven factors. Our early 2022 outperformance supported our full year adjusted EPS performance and enabled us to accelerate maintenance activities in several areas of the business. Those initiatives had us well positioned with additional spending flexibility entering 2023, such that we expect the significant weather impact we experienced in January and February should be manageable over the remainder of the year, assuming a return to more normal weather throughout the balance of the year. Turning now to retail sales in the economy. In the first quarter, weather-normal electric retail sales were 0.4% higher than the first quarter of 2022. This increase reflects stronger residential and commercial sales from continued robust net in migration to our service territories, a strong labor market and a return to more normal business trends. Industrial sales for the quarter were down 1.6% as we are beginning to see weakness in housing-related sectors, such as stone clay and glass, lumber and textiles due to inflationary pressures and higher interest rates. Half of the industrial variance for the quarter compared to last year can be attributed to the closure of a caustic soda manufacturing facility in Alabama. Excluding the impact of this single customer, industrial sales were down approximately 0.8%. In a trend that continues to differentiate our Southeast service territories from many other areas of the country, we once again saw record levels of economic development activity with job creation and capital investment announcements at all-time highs in the first quarter. We are beginning to see supplier announcements related to the Rivian and Hyundai electric vehicle manufacturing facilities in Georgia, with 6 supplier announcements made during the quarter, totaling over 4,200 jobs and nearly $2 billion in capital investment. We expect additional automotive supplier announcements in the coming months. Beyond the automotive industry, QCells recently announced a new $2 billion solar panel and component manufacturing facility in Georgia, which is expected to create 2,000 jobs. Additionally, the Port of Savannah continues to set records, posting its highest national market share ever and second busiest February on record. The port continues to expand capacity, including the recent announcement of the addition of 55 electric cranes, which are expected to eliminate 500,000 gallons of diesel consumption and related emissions per year. Before I turn the call back over to Chris, I'd like to call your attention to our recent dividend increase. At its last meeting, Southern Company Board of Directors approved an $0.08 per share increase in our common dividend, raising our annualized rate to $2.80 per share. This action marks our 22nd consecutive annual increase and for 76 consecutive years, dating all the way back to 1948, Southern Company has paid a dividend that was equal to or greater than the previous year. This remarkable track record supports Southern Company's value proposition. And lastly for me, our adjusted EPS estimate for the second quarter is $0.75 per share. Chris, I'll turn it back over to you.\nChristopher Womack : Thank you, Dan. Before taking your questions, I'd like to first provide an update on recent progress on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Importantly, the projected completion time line and capital cost forecast for both units are unchanged from the updates that we provided last quarter. Since that time, we've seen sustained progress consistent with our expectations for each unit. At Unit 3, we've achieved initial criticality in March and successfully synced to the grid earlier this month. We continue to work through final startup testing and commissioning and are currently performing testing at the 50% thermal power plateau. This testing is expected to continue in the coming weeks with extensions to higher power plateaus and force trips to test the unit's safety systems. Following completion of this final testing sequencing, and consistent with our long-term plans, we expect Unit 3 to enter into a brief maintenance outage window before returning to full power. After the successful completion of all appropriate preoperational and power extension testing, as well as any necessary fine-tuning, Unit 3 will be ready for commercial operations. We continue to project placing Unit 3 in service in May or June of 2023. Turning now to Unit 4. Substantial progress continued throughout the last quarter, with hot functional testing commencing in March, with lessons learned from Unit 3 continuing to benefit our execution on Unit 4, hot functional testing is approximately 80% complete. We have already achieved peak planned output of the test and are currently in the process of cooling the unit back down with progress throughout the test that has been consistent with our plan. We project to complete hot functional testing in the coming weeks to be followed by planned inspections and surveillance, along with the middle of our final ITAAC's receipt of the 103(g) finding from the NRC and fuel load later this year. Only 6 systems remain for turnover to testing for Unit 4, and we continue to project an in-service date between late fourth quarter of 2023 and end of the first quarter 2024. We look forward to sharing our exciting progress in the weeks and months ahead as we bring these units online to provide reliable, carbon-free energy to the benefit of our customers in the State of Georgia for decades to come. In closing, I'd like to highlight that Southern Company was named the top utility on Forbes Magazine Best Large Employers in America 2023 rankings. We ranked nearly 100 places higher than the next industry peer and the top 15 of the 500 large employers ranked for the second consecutive year. Being recognized amongst the best in the nation once again is an honor. This accolade is particularly gratifying because it is directly based on employee feedback. We are committed to creating a workplace where all groups are well represented, included and fairly treated with all -- within all levels of the organization and that everyone feels welcome, valued and respected. At Southern Company, we aspire to be a leader in our industry. As such, we will continue to strive to create the best workplace possible for our thousands of team members who work tirelessly each and every day to provide world-class service to the customers that we have the privilege to serve.  Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolf Research.\nSteve Fleishman : Hey, good afternoon, Chris. Congrats on your first call in a new role. And hi to Tom out there, I'm sure he's listening. But the -- just on -- could you just remind us for the prudency filing in Georgia, when that would -- when that comes and roughly when that's going to be scheduled this year?\nChristopher Womack : It is scheduled to come as we enter fuel load on Unit 4. Right now, we're looking to -- for unit -- for fuel load to occur in the July time frame. So we're working -- we'll work with the commission and the staff on moving through that process. But it will get started as we enter fuel load on Unit 4.\nSteve Fleishman : Okay. And take like -- I think most things take 6 months pretty much in Georgia?\nChristopher Womack : We expect yes, 6 months. It's the time frame we expect today.\nSteve Fleishman : Okay. And then I think -- I know you mentioned the remaining process for Unit 3 start-up, but just the testing so far -- I mean, obviously, you kept the time line, but so far in the testing, is it fair to say everything's gone as planned? Are there any issues that have come up? Just any color there.\nChristopher Womack : And Steve, I think as you've seen before, things do come up. I would say testing has gone very well. We've experienced some trips and the systems operated as they should, but we worked our way through it. And -- but we continue to proceed and move ahead. So, so far, so good, but we know there's -- first time start-up, there's always issues. This is why we test, and we're focused on the secondary side. But I'd say so far, so good, but we continue to -- testing is always a process that we'll go through to make sure we're ready for commercial operation.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.\nShar Pourreza : Chris, you guys recently just around the '24 guidance, you kind of lowered it on the back of ongoing inflation and interest rates. I guess how are you seeing things develop now? And do you see kind of opportunities to manage your exposure like we saw with the prior convertible note you issued in February got a bit of a better sales outlook today. I guess what are some of the pushes and takes since you revised that '23 guide? It seems like there's some incremental tailwinds here.\nChristopher Womack : Shar, you asked is about '23 or '24.\nShar Pourreza : '24.\nChristopher Womack : Okay. So I'm going to -- let me start, and then I'll kick it to Dan. We moved the lower end of our band down because as we pushed out I expected start-up of commercial on Unit 4. We moved that. We lowered the range down to [3.95]. So that was based on the push on the schedule Unit 4. Dan, do you want to comment on any other aspects of guidance?\nDaniel Tucker : Yes. And just following on to what Chris said, once we have clarity, which again will be the end of this year, early next year on Unit 4, we'll narrow that 2024 guidance down to something that's more akin to what we typically do, around a $0.10 range or so based on the actual in-service date. All the other moving parts you mentioned, Shar, I mean, we kind of are where we were -- we are executing in a way to make sure that we're managing where we need to. We'll continue to be creative and thoughtful around how we're financing, particularly at the parent company. I think the convertible deal was a tremendous success. We'll see what other opportunities we have, not necessarily that specific instrument, but just to be opportunistic in the way we do that. And then from a cost perspective, everyone is seeing pressures, and we are no different. But we've got a lot of efforts underway to make sure that we're running the business as efficiently as we can in a way that continues to support that guidance range.\nShar Pourreza : Got it. And then just, Chris, I'm kind of curious maybe just your overall thoughts on the cost side because Southern doesn't really have a stated cost-cutting target like some of your peers despite obviously you guys managing O&M fairly well. I guess, looking at things kind of from a fresh lens, are you seeing opportunities to cut cost incremental to your current plan maybe at the holdco level like shared services or even at the opcos? I mean, I guess, is there any opportunities you see as a new CEO that could be additive to plan as we're thinking about maybe further streamlining the business?\nChristopher Womack : Yes. And Shar, I would say it's a wonderful question I'd build on what Dan has said. I mean, we will continue to look at how we can run this business more efficiently. I mean there are opportunities to create shared service opportunity to find efficiencies in places, we will do that. As you know, there's a lot of conversation and interest in, and we take it very soon to the issue of affordability. And so we will continue to find ways to put downward pressure on our pricing, find ways to look at the interest rate and inflation implications, but look to find ways to make sure, from O&M perspective, that is either flat or declining over our forecast period. So we will continue to do that and pursue those kind of opportunities. And we've done it in the past, and we'll continue to do it in the future.\nDaniel Tucker : And I'd say, in addition to the -- particularly the shared service opportunities, as Chris mentioned, 1 of the other great opportunities we have, which you'd hope we would have is to really optimize how our internal resources are deployed between operating expenses and capital investments. So we're certainly doing everything we can to optimize the way they're deployed to focus on our capital spend and reduce costs at the same time.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Ross Fowler with UBS.\nRoss Fowler : So Dan, I just want to go through the seasonality again, you kind of brought it up in your prepared remarks, but I just want to make sure I fully understand your drivers there. You hear about -- you had a little over $2 in the first half of '22, and you've got a little over $1.50 in the first half of '23. So if I heard you correctly, you said that, that outperformance in '22 allowed you to pull a lot of O&M forward into the year, so that's part of it. But there's other pieces here, too, I think 1 would be a reduction in part of the Vogtle penalty once Unit 3 goes in. And then I think there was some sharing outside the band in Q4 of last year. So other than those 3 pieces, is there anything I'm missing around sort of getting back into the guidance range with a better second half number this year versus last?\nDaniel Tucker : Yes, not in terms of getting back, but just in terms of making those comparisons year-over-year, Ross, I think the other important moving part that we saw in the first half of last year that really helped us get up to that strong start was earnings that were really driven by where energy prices were. So not only on our regulated side, we had some commercial industrial pricing that benefited from that, but also on the Southern Power side got off to a great start just because of where market energy prices where and it allowed us to do a lot of those things. So when you're doing a year-over-year comparison, that will be a difference. Big thing that you brought up that's just not as obvious always looking at this is the kind of rebates or refunds back to customers' notion. That was a significant element of the second half of last year if you combine all of our jurisdictions in terms of either what was accrued to refund back to customers or what was put into regulatory reserves, so we have the reliability reserves in some of our jurisdictions. That was $0.33 just in the fourth quarter. And so that's a pretty significant year-over-year reconciling item that will necessarily be there this year, but we'll still be able to support that $3.60 as a midpoint.\nRoss Fowler : And then on the industrial sales decline, you mentioned about half of that was sort of a one-off item due to the caustic soda facility, and the rest was kind of like seen in lateral housing-related sectors. Maybe ex-housing, what are you seeing for the economic backdrop currently in that context?\nDaniel Tucker : Yes. Still, and I want Chris to kind of add on to this. But just from an overall sales perspective, still seeing year-over-year growth in a lot of sectors. There is a bit of slowing going on, but the overall strength here in the Southeast continues to show itself. Chris, do you want to add anything there?\nChristopher Womack : Yes. And so we look at the economic development pipeline here in the Southeast, which remains to be robust, I mean I look at first quarter of '23 versus the first quarter of '22 and announced projects expect like 10,000 -- 10-plus thousand jobs and some $4 billion of investment here in Georgia and in Alabama also sees increases around EV and battery supply chain. And the pipeline continues to be very full. So we continue to be excited about the economic activity, the economic development pipeline from population growth, in migration to the customer growth, we saw somewhere 11,000 on the electric side, some 6,000 on the gas side. So we continue to see very positive factors that -- some people say there may be a recession, but we think here in our territory maybe lessen because of this ongoing continuing economic strength and economic activity that we continue to see.\nRoss Fowler : That's great, Chris. And maybe this is an unfair question, but I'm going to pose it anyway. How do you think about -- I mean, you've seen in the press this week an EPA power plant rule potentially coming around natural gas and emissions reductions. How do you think about that in terms of sustainability achievement versus affordability and reliability because natural gas is definitely needed for both of those things as we walk through the energy transition? What are the risks and opportunities around that type of regulation?\nChristopher Womack : Yes. And let me break that up in two parts. I mean I think in terms of the proposal using the process before, and that will go through a number of different iterations. And when there is a final rule, we'll assess it in understanding and figure out what it means to us. I mean, we have been pursuing our fleet transition, our focus on sustainability and with a real commitment of balancing affordability with sustainability and moving toward to our net zero. I mean -- and we'll continue to do that as we go through this fleet transition. So our path will continue. And so whenever a new rule comes out, we'll take a look at it. I mean, I would also say I think for the economy, natural gas is very important. Natural gas is important to this country and to the economy to a lot of regions that cannot, from an affordability standpoint, make a transition to all electric. And so I think, from a national energy policy standpoint, I think it's important to recognize the importance of natural gas as we go forward. So that would be my response to that question.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. \nJulien Dumoulin-Smith : Congrats, again. So with that said, look, I want to pivot back to the credit conversation. As we kind of pivot out of the U3, U4, you look at the time lines getting a little bit narrower here. What are you guys thinking today about the prospects of credit improvement? What kind of metrics would you want to target? Obviously, you've seen some gyrations there through the course of construction -- how far do you want to go on that improvement side? What does that mean in terms of the targeted broad metrics? Again, I get that the rating agencies have different metrics they target? And then ultimately, what does that translate to in terms of target FFO for you guys? And the time line they're in, right, as you look at this in service?\nDaniel Tucker : Yes, Julien, it's Dan. So look, with -- once Unit 3 and 4 is in service, reflected in rates from a cash flow perspective, and we've talked about this before, it's about a $700 million improvement in our operating cash flow and thus improvement in FFO from an FFO to debt perspective, what that means is given the rest of our business, combined with that improvement, we should be comfortably in a let's just call it, 7-ish zone from an FFO to debt. It could be as high as 18 in years, could be in the high 16s, but comfortably above certainly current rating thresholds. And what I've continued to articulate as an objective to have all of our regulated utilities in the A category and our parent company at BBB+. And I think we can achieve that without having to do anything but execute.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith : Right. But that a further improvement in terms of the underlying metrics per se?\nDaniel Tucker : Absolutely.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith : Okay. And then, sorry, if I can pivot 1 more subject here. Just to touch on Georgia and Georgia Power, specifically around solar opportunities. I know that IRA has unlocked certain opportunities. I know that this isn't in flight in the process of maybe not necessarily right. But prospects for investing on that front. Obviously, you've had the Southern Power placeholder, but I'm focused more specifically on solar at Georgia Power and/or any of the other opcos today post IRA. And given the RFP?\nChristopher Womack : Yes. And Julien, as you know, we have opportunity as a result of the 2022 integrated resource plan, but also with the, inflation reduction act, we think as a level of the playing fields between -- from tax policy, it offers us the opportunity to own renewables ourselves. And so our teams are looking at the opportunities, and we'll be working with the commissions to pursue those opportunities for us to build and own more renewables as we go forward, taking advantage of the opportunities that the inflation Reduction Act affords us. And the opportunity we have is not just looking at the lease cost, but also -- but who's the best cost owner of these projects going forward. So it's a wonderful opportunity for us. But also, I think, as you mentioned, there're also opportunities for Southern Power as we go forward. So there are wonderful opportunities for us as we go forward, and we're looking forward to fully investigating and executing around them.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith : Got it. But maybe in the next quarter or so, we'll get a little bit more detail there?\nChristopher Womack : We'll keep you posted.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Arcaro : A couple of quick questions on the Vogtle units. I was wondering when would we expect Unit 3 to be running at full capacity? We've seen it ramping up and down, getting to 50% power. Wondering when we might see it at full capacity. And then just on that Unit 2, have the -- I think you touched on this before, but has the testing and running so far been going smoothly enough to not push out any like incremental delays within the May to June time frame?\nChristopher Womack : No. And so David, we're not announcing any schedule or cost estimate increases. 100% power sometime in May. I mean, we're working through the process. We're doing all the testing and we're ramping up. I would say, look for some time in May to get to 100% power.\nDavid Arcaro : Okay. Got you. And then on Unit 4, just during hot functional, I guess, similar question. Have you seen any issues pop up during that testing phase that would add incremental time even within the 4Q to 1Q 2024 window?\nChristopher Womack : And I think as we said, we're about 80% complete on hot functional on Unit 4. And I think it is clear that we have taken lessons learned from our Unit 3 experience, and there are no issues to note. And so I'd say, so far, so good. And I mean, if you recall, you may recall, Unit 3 took us about 94 days. And so we're now 80% complete. And if we stay on schedule, sometime in early May we will conclude hot functional testing and then look toward critical path items of ITAAC's and testing and looking toward fuel load sometime in July. So, so far, so good. So that's kind of just -- that's where we are. But we've -- I mean the lessons learned from Unit 3, Unit 4, I think, are clearly reflecting in showing up as we go through hot functional testing on Unit 4.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Q - Durgesh Chopra  Just first, Chris, you talked about the maintenance outage at Unit 3. I just want to confirm that's just standard process, right? That's not an added step based on...\nChristopher Womack : Yes, it's -- go ahead, Durgesh.\nDurgesh Chopra : No, that's it. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Womack : Yes. No, you're right. I mean it's a standard outage. I mean, there's some testing equipment that has to be removed and some things that we have learned. And so we'll fine-tune some things, maybe some remediation that will occur probably about a 10-day maintenance outage. But yes, I mean, it's standard and what's expected.\nDurgesh Chopra : Perfect. Thank you for clarifying that. And then maybe I can just pivot to the Georgia Power under-recovered fuel filing. I believe you made that in February. Just any initial stakeholder feedback there I know in the last call, we talked about perhaps offsetting some of that balance with lower gas prices going forward as we see it. Just anything you can share with us on that front would be great.\nChristopher Womack : As you may know, we reached a stipulation with the staff, and we're looking at about a 12% price increase on retail rates over 3-year period to recover that under-recovered fuel balance, and that would take effect in June. And that is lower than what our initial request was and 30% less than what we expected. And I think as we look at this outcome, this stipulation, it reflects kind of our sensitivity and our interest in paying attention to affordability and recognizing that we must recover this under-recovered fuel balance, but how do we do it in a manner that minimizes the impact on customers. And so that's kind of where we are. More hearings and consideration to take place, but the rates will take effect starting in June.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc.\nSophie Karp : Most of my questions have been answered actually. Let me just maybe throw this 1 at you guys. With Vogtle moving towards the completion Unit 3 and Unit 4 and remain on track to be completed in the direct line of vision. Would you take some time in the medium term to have another look at the businesses that you own and maybe figure out which ones could be recycled capital wise and optimize the business mix? Or are you quite happy with what you guys right now?\nChristopher Womack : I mean, I think you kind of speak to it. But as we have success on Vogtle 3 and 4, it does give us the opportunity to unlock the fuel value of this company and kind of regain our premium valuation. And I mean, we will look at our business, and we'll look at all parts of it in terms of from a buyer and seller perspective. And the thing about it is, I say, we've got -- and we will always look our handover. We feel real good about the cards that we have. I mean we'll always do our homework, and we look at what others have extracted in the marketplace. But we'll also look and see some things we can do better. We don't have any equity needs. I mean we're in a very, very good spot. And so I just think it's an opportunity for us to really unlock full value and the full potential of this company as we go forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport.\nAgnieszka Storozynski : So I'll ask a bit for question. So we actually be willing to acquire some assets now that you have seemingly a clean slate. You mentioned you have no equity needs. You have a strongly improving cash flow, and there are assets available for sale. For now, the way we look at you guys, you've basically sold for roughly the sector average earnings growth, which I cannot believe that you would be happy with.\nChristopher Womack : Angie, I'll tell you, and I think I said it on the last answer to the last question. We are excited about the progress we're making through on these Vogtle units. And we're looking forward to bringing both units online and getting those units completed. Once we do that, I mean, we're really going to focus on really making sure that we are unlocking the full potential and the full opportunities for this business that we have, and we are large enough to do this as a stand-alone. At the same time, we're continuing to always look at our -- look at the market, look over our hand, as I said, from both a buyer and seller perspective. We'll always continue to do our homework. But we feel good about where we are. 5 to 7 is good enough for us to be the best risk-adjusted return in the industry, and we feel good about where we are.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Verition.\nAshar Khan : Congratulations. My questions have been answered. Thank you.\nOperator: That will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks?\nChristopher Womack : Guys, we thank you for being with us today. and we look forward to speaking with you in the future. But otherwise, operator, thank you very much for the call.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Southern Company First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Daniel Tucker",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. For the first quarter of 2023, our adjusted EPS was $0.79 per share, $0.18 lower than the first quarter of 2022 and $0.09 above our estimate. The major driver for the variance to last year was milder-than-normal weather as the first quarter of 2023 was the warmest on record in the Southeast. Higher depreciation and amortization and interest expense also impacted earnings for the first quarter compared to last year and were somewhat offset by constructive state regulatory actions. A complete reconciliation of our year-over-year earnings is included in the materials we released this morning. When looking at adjusted EPS impact compared to our estimate for the quarter, the main drivers were a strong start for our state regulated natural gas utilities and continued strong electric and gas customer growth. Given the mid-February timing of our last earnings call, we were able to factor milder than normal January and February weather into our estimate for the quarter, so weather was not a major driver of our performance versus our estimate. You may recall that our adjusted earnings in the first half of 2022 were significantly better than projected due to weather and other market-driven factors. Our early 2022 outperformance supported our full year adjusted EPS performance and enabled us to accelerate maintenance activities in several areas of the business. Those initiatives had us well positioned with additional spending flexibility entering 2023, such that we expect the significant weather impact we experienced in January and February should be manageable over the remainder of the year, assuming a return to more normal weather throughout the balance of the year. Turning now to retail sales in the economy. In the first quarter, weather-normal electric retail sales were 0.4% higher than the first quarter of 2022. This increase reflects stronger residential and commercial sales from continued robust net in migration to our service territories, a strong labor market and a return to more normal business trends. Industrial sales for the quarter were down 1.6% as we are beginning to see weakness in housing-related sectors, such as stone clay and glass, lumber and textiles due to inflationary pressures and higher interest rates. Half of the industrial variance for the quarter compared to last year can be attributed to the closure of a caustic soda manufacturing facility in Alabama. Excluding the impact of this single customer, industrial sales were down approximately 0.8%. In a trend that continues to differentiate our Southeast service territories from many other areas of the country, we once again saw record levels of economic development activity with job creation and capital investment announcements at all-time highs in the first quarter. We are beginning to see supplier announcements related to the Rivian and Hyundai electric vehicle manufacturing facilities in Georgia, with 6 supplier announcements made during the quarter, totaling over 4,200 jobs and nearly $2 billion in capital investment. We expect additional automotive supplier announcements in the coming months. Beyond the automotive industry, QCells recently announced a new $2 billion solar panel and component manufacturing facility in Georgia, which is expected to create 2,000 jobs. Additionally, the Port of Savannah continues to set records, posting its highest national market share ever and second busiest February on record. The port continues to expand capacity, including the recent announcement of the addition of 55 electric cranes, which are expected to eliminate 500,000 gallons of diesel consumption and related emissions per year. Before I turn the call back over to Chris, I'd like to call your attention to our recent dividend increase. At its last meeting, Southern Company Board of Directors approved an $0.08 per share increase in our common dividend, raising our annualized rate to $2.80 per share. This action marks our 22nd consecutive annual increase and for 76 consecutive years, dating all the way back to 1948, Southern Company has paid a dividend that was equal to or greater than the previous year. This remarkable track record supports Southern Company's value proposition. And lastly for me, our adjusted EPS estimate for the second quarter is $0.75 per share. Chris, I'll turn it back over to you. Yes. And just following on to what Chris said, once we have clarity, which again will be the end of this year, early next year on Unit 4, we'll narrow that 2024 guidance down to something that's more akin to what we typically do, around a $0.10 range or so based on the actual in-service date. All the other moving parts you mentioned, Shar, I mean, we kind of are where we were -- we are executing in a way to make sure that we're managing where we need to. We'll continue to be creative and thoughtful around how we're financing, particularly at the parent company. I think the convertible deal was a tremendous success. We'll see what other opportunities we have, not necessarily that specific instrument, but just to be opportunistic in the way we do that. And then from a cost perspective, everyone is seeing pressures, and we are no different. But we've got a lot of efforts underway to make sure that we're running the business as efficiently as we can in a way that continues to support that guidance range. And I'd say, in addition to the -- particularly the shared service opportunities, as Chris mentioned, 1 of the other great opportunities we have, which you'd hope we would have is to really optimize how our internal resources are deployed between operating expenses and capital investments. So we're certainly doing everything we can to optimize the way they're deployed to focus on our capital spend and reduce costs at the same time. Yes, not in terms of getting back, but just in terms of making those comparisons year-over-year, Ross, I think the other important moving part that we saw in the first half of last year that really helped us get up to that strong start was earnings that were really driven by where energy prices were. So not only on our regulated side, we had some commercial industrial pricing that benefited from that, but also on the Southern Power side got off to a great start just because of where market energy prices where and it allowed us to do a lot of those things. So when you're doing a year-over-year comparison, that will be a difference. Big thing that you brought up that's just not as obvious always looking at this is the kind of rebates or refunds back to customers' notion. That was a significant element of the second half of last year if you combine all of our jurisdictions in terms of either what was accrued to refund back to customers or what was put into regulatory reserves, so we have the reliability reserves in some of our jurisdictions. That was $0.33 just in the fourth quarter. And so that's a pretty significant year-over-year reconciling item that will necessarily be there this year, but we'll still be able to support that $3.60 as a midpoint. Yes. Still, and I want Chris to kind of add on to this. But just from an overall sales perspective, still seeing year-over-year growth in a lot of sectors. There is a bit of slowing going on, but the overall strength here in the Southeast continues to show itself. Chris, do you want to add anything there? Yes, Julien, it's Dan. So look, with -- once Unit 3 and 4 is in service, reflected in rates from a cash flow perspective, and we've talked about this before, it's about a $700 million improvement in our operating cash flow and thus improvement in FFO from an FFO to debt perspective, what that means is given the rest of our business, combined with that improvement, we should be comfortably in a let's just call it, 7-ish zone from an FFO to debt. It could be as high as 18 in years, could be in the high 16s, but comfortably above certainly current rating thresholds. And what I've continued to articulate as an objective to have all of our regulated utilities in the A category and our parent company at BBB+. And I think we can achieve that without having to do anything but execute. Absolutely."

            "name": "Christopher Womack",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I am delighted to be joining you today on my first earnings call as President of Southern Company. I've enjoyed given the opportunity to interact with many of you over the last couple of months and look forward to meeting with many more of you in the months ahead. I am incredibly excited about the future of Southern Company, the energy industry and the valuable work that we're doing to serve our customers and communities. I am excited about the opportunities ahead of us and proud to be a part of a team that is making such a significant impact in building the future of energy. As you've watched us reposition our deep talented bench across the system, our mission remains unchanged, provide our customers and communities with clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy, while continuing to keep our customers at the center of everything we do. Also unchanged is our goal to deliver superior risk-adjusted total shareholder return. And I believe our financial plan supports that objective. The strength of our value proposition is a function of our customer and community, focused business model, the robust economic growth in our service territories and the constructive regulatory frameworks in our states. It is also a function of our discipline as we remain committed to our objectives of strong investment-grade credit ratings with a regular, predictable and sustainable dividend policy. Along with our focus on long-term execution and value accretion, we are executing on our plans as we -- and believe we're well positioned to achieve our financial objectives for 2023.  Dan, I'll now turn the call over to you for our financial update. Thank you, Dan. Before taking your questions, I'd like to first provide an update on recent progress on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Importantly, the projected completion time line and capital cost forecast for both units are unchanged from the updates that we provided last quarter. Since that time, we've seen sustained progress consistent with our expectations for each unit. At Unit 3, we've achieved initial criticality in March and successfully synced to the grid earlier this month. We continue to work through final startup testing and commissioning and are currently performing testing at the 50% thermal power plateau. This testing is expected to continue in the coming weeks with extensions to higher power plateaus and force trips to test the unit's safety systems. Following completion of this final testing sequencing, and consistent with our long-term plans, we expect Unit 3 to enter into a brief maintenance outage window before returning to full power. After the successful completion of all appropriate preoperational and power extension testing, as well as any necessary fine-tuning, Unit 3 will be ready for commercial operations. We continue to project placing Unit 3 in service in May or June of 2023. Turning now to Unit 4. Substantial progress continued throughout the last quarter, with hot functional testing commencing in March, with lessons learned from Unit 3 continuing to benefit our execution on Unit 4, hot functional testing is approximately 80% complete. We have already achieved peak planned output of the test and are currently in the process of cooling the unit back down with progress throughout the test that has been consistent with our plan. We project to complete hot functional testing in the coming weeks to be followed by planned inspections and surveillance, along with the middle of our final ITAAC's receipt of the 103(g) finding from the NRC and fuel load later this year. Only 6 systems remain for turnover to testing for Unit 4, and we continue to project an in-service date between late fourth quarter of 2023 and end of the first quarter 2024. We look forward to sharing our exciting progress in the weeks and months ahead as we bring these units online to provide reliable, carbon-free energy to the benefit of our customers in the State of Georgia for decades to come. In closing, I'd like to highlight that Southern Company was named the top utility on Forbes Magazine Best Large Employers in America 2023 rankings. We ranked nearly 100 places higher than the next industry peer and the top 15 of the 500 large employers ranked for the second consecutive year. Being recognized amongst the best in the nation once again is an honor. This accolade is particularly gratifying because it is directly based on employee feedback. We are committed to creating a workplace where all groups are well represented, included and fairly treated with all -- within all levels of the organization and that everyone feels welcome, valued and respected. At Southern Company, we aspire to be a leader in our industry. As such, we will continue to strive to create the best workplace possible for our thousands of team members who work tirelessly each and every day to provide world-class service to the customers that we have the privilege to serve.  Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. It is scheduled to come as we enter fuel load on Unit 4. Right now, we're looking to -- for unit -- for fuel load to occur in the July time frame. So we're working -- we'll work with the commission and the staff on moving through that process. But it will get started as we enter fuel load on Unit 4. We expect yes, 6 months. It's the time frame we expect today. And Steve, I think as you've seen before, things do come up. I would say testing has gone very well. We've experienced some trips and the systems operated as they should, but we worked our way through it. And -- but we continue to proceed and move ahead. So, so far, so good, but we know there's -- first time start-up, there's always issues. This is why we test, and we're focused on the secondary side. But I'd say so far, so good, but we continue to -- testing is always a process that we'll go through to make sure we're ready for commercial operation. Shar, you asked is about '23 or '24. Okay. So I'm going to -- let me start, and then I'll kick it to Dan. We moved the lower end of our band down because as we pushed out I expected start-up of commercial on Unit 4. We moved that. We lowered the range down to [3.95]. So that was based on the push on the schedule Unit 4. Dan, do you want to comment on any other aspects of guidance? Yes. And Shar, I would say it's a wonderful question I'd build on what Dan has said. I mean, we will continue to look at how we can run this business more efficiently. I mean there are opportunities to create shared service opportunity to find efficiencies in places, we will do that. As you know, there's a lot of conversation and interest in, and we take it very soon to the issue of affordability. And so we will continue to find ways to put downward pressure on our pricing, find ways to look at the interest rate and inflation implications, but look to find ways to make sure, from O&M perspective, that is either flat or declining over our forecast period. So we will continue to do that and pursue those kind of opportunities. And we've done it in the past, and we'll continue to do it in the future. Yes. And so we look at the economic development pipeline here in the Southeast, which remains to be robust, I mean I look at first quarter of '23 versus the first quarter of '22 and announced projects expect like 10,000 -- 10-plus thousand jobs and some $4 billion of investment here in Georgia and in Alabama also sees increases around EV and battery supply chain. And the pipeline continues to be very full. So we continue to be excited about the economic activity, the economic development pipeline from population growth, in migration to the customer growth, we saw somewhere 11,000 on the electric side, some 6,000 on the gas side. So we continue to see very positive factors that -- some people say there may be a recession, but we think here in our territory maybe lessen because of this ongoing continuing economic strength and economic activity that we continue to see. Yes. And let me break that up in two parts. I mean I think in terms of the proposal using the process before, and that will go through a number of different iterations. And when there is a final rule, we'll assess it in understanding and figure out what it means to us. I mean, we have been pursuing our fleet transition, our focus on sustainability and with a real commitment of balancing affordability with sustainability and moving toward to our net zero. I mean -- and we'll continue to do that as we go through this fleet transition. So our path will continue. And so whenever a new rule comes out, we'll take a look at it. I mean, I would also say I think for the economy, natural gas is very important. Natural gas is important to this country and to the economy to a lot of regions that cannot, from an affordability standpoint, make a transition to all electric. And so I think, from a national energy policy standpoint, I think it's important to recognize the importance of natural gas as we go forward. So that would be my response to that question. Yes. And Julien, as you know, we have opportunity as a result of the 2022 integrated resource plan, but also with the, inflation reduction act, we think as a level of the playing fields between -- from tax policy, it offers us the opportunity to own renewables ourselves. And so our teams are looking at the opportunities, and we'll be working with the commissions to pursue those opportunities for us to build and own more renewables as we go forward, taking advantage of the opportunities that the inflation Reduction Act affords us. And the opportunity we have is not just looking at the lease cost, but also -- but who's the best cost owner of these projects going forward. So it's a wonderful opportunity for us. But also, I think, as you mentioned, there're also opportunities for Southern Power as we go forward. So there are wonderful opportunities for us as we go forward, and we're looking forward to fully investigating and executing around them. We'll keep you posted. No. And so David, we're not announcing any schedule or cost estimate increases. 100% power sometime in May. I mean, we're working through the process. We're doing all the testing and we're ramping up. I would say, look for some time in May to get to 100% power. And I think as we said, we're about 80% complete on hot functional on Unit 4. And I think it is clear that we have taken lessons learned from our Unit 3 experience, and there are no issues to note. And so I'd say, so far, so good. And I mean, if you recall, you may recall, Unit 3 took us about 94 days. And so we're now 80% complete. And if we stay on schedule, sometime in early May we will conclude hot functional testing and then look toward critical path items of ITAAC's and testing and looking toward fuel load sometime in July. So, so far, so good. So that's kind of just -- that's where we are. But we've -- I mean the lessons learned from Unit 3, Unit 4, I think, are clearly reflecting in showing up as we go through hot functional testing on Unit 4. Yes, it's -- go ahead, Durgesh. Yes. No, you're right. I mean it's a standard outage. I mean, there's some testing equipment that has to be removed and some things that we have learned. And so we'll fine-tune some things, maybe some remediation that will occur probably about a 10-day maintenance outage. But yes, I mean, it's standard and what's expected. As you may know, we reached a stipulation with the staff, and we're looking at about a 12% price increase on retail rates over 3-year period to recover that under-recovered fuel balance, and that would take effect in June. And that is lower than what our initial request was and 30% less than what we expected. And I think as we look at this outcome, this stipulation, it reflects kind of our sensitivity and our interest in paying attention to affordability and recognizing that we must recover this under-recovered fuel balance, but how do we do it in a manner that minimizes the impact on customers. And so that's kind of where we are. More hearings and consideration to take place, but the rates will take effect starting in June. I mean, I think you kind of speak to it. But as we have success on Vogtle 3 and 4, it does give us the opportunity to unlock the fuel value of this company and kind of regain our premium valuation. And I mean, we will look at our business, and we'll look at all parts of it in terms of from a buyer and seller perspective. And the thing about it is, I say, we've got -- and we will always look our handover. We feel real good about the cards that we have. I mean we'll always do our homework, and we look at what others have extracted in the marketplace. But we'll also look and see some things we can do better. We don't have any equity needs. I mean we're in a very, very good spot. And so I just think it's an opportunity for us to really unlock full value and the full potential of this company as we go forward. Angie, I'll tell you, and I think I said it on the last answer to the last question. We are excited about the progress we're making through on these Vogtle units. And we're looking forward to bringing both units online and getting those units completed. Once we do that, I mean, we're really going to focus on really making sure that we are unlocking the full potential and the full opportunities for this business that we have, and we are large enough to do this as a stand-alone. At the same time, we're continuing to always look at our -- look at the market, look over our hand, as I said, from both a buyer and seller perspective. We'll always continue to do our homework. But we feel good about where we are. 5 to 7 is good enough for us to be the best risk-adjusted return in the industry, and we feel good about where we are. Guys, we thank you for being with us today. and we look forward to speaking with you in the future. But otherwise, operator, thank you very much for the call."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Southern Company's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Greg MacLeod. Thank you. You may begin.\nGreg MacLeod: Thank you, Julian. Good afternoon and welcome to Southern Company's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Chris Womack, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Dan Tucker, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you that, we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. I'll now turn the call over to Chris Womack.\nChris Womack: Thank you, Greg. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Our entire company including our premier state-regulated electric gas and utilities, continued to perform well during the third quarter, especially as our dedicated employees across Southern Company came together as one team in response to Hurricane Helene. The resolve and the professionalism of our employees has never been more evident than was demonstrated through the recent storm restoration efforts in Georgia. Before Dan provides an overview of our financial results, I'd like to share our story from this unprecedented weather event. Hurricane Helene was a storm of historic magnitude. Its aftermath was met with an extraordinary response from our dedicated team across Southern Company, our mutual assistance partners, state and local first responders and emergency management agencies and government officials, all across Georgia. Persistent rain, extreme flooding and heavy winds resulted in what can only be characterized as devastation to many of the communities we serve, with the destruction stretching hundreds of miles impacting the Eastern two-thirds of the entire state. Ultimately, the damage caused by Hurricane Helene was the most destructive in Georgia Power's 140-year history, exceeding the damage caused by the largest -- the three largest storms to impact Georgia Power's service territory combined. Helene entered Southern Georgia as a Category one hurricane and resulted in 53 out of the 159 counties in the state being declared major disaster areas by the Federal Energy -- Emergency Management Agency. With considerable damage to transmission infrastructure, nearly 12,000 damaged utility poles and some 1,500 miles of downed wires, the equivalent of the distance between Atlanta and Phoenix, Arizona, our customers' experienced over 1.5 million outages in the wake of the storm. With the support of resources from across North America, a workforce of well over 20,000 worked around the clock to safely reconnect customers through extremely difficult conditions. Commensurate with the devastation seen in our communities, much of our utility infrastructure was damaged beyond near repair, and significant portion of our system in the affected regions require a complete rebuild. Thanks to the contributions of our utility industry partners and especially thanks to the unwavering commitment of our own hard-working dedicated crews, many of whom lived in the same communities and some of whom endured destruction to their own homes, the restoration and rebuilding efforts were 95% complete within eight days with power restored to over 0.5 million customers within the first 48 hours. We are incredibly proud of our team's response and eternally grateful to be a part of an industry that works so well together in times of need. Many of the communities we are privileged to serve across Eastern Georgia have a long road ahead to recovery, Georgia Power, Atlanta Gas Light. Southern Company are contributing to organizations to aid these communities and Georgia Power has taken additional steps to provide support and resources to our customers in Georgia. In our business model, customers are at the center of everything we do. And our commitment to the communities and customers we serve has never been more important than in times like these. I am extremely proud of our team's exceptional efforts to clearly demonstrate that we are a citizen wherever we serve each and every day. Dan, I'll now turn the call over to you for a financial update.\nDan Tucker: Thanks Chris and good afternoon everyone. Before I walk through the third quarter financial results, I'd like to briefly address the costs associated with the recovery efforts Chris just described related to Hurricane Helene. The initial estimated cost for this historic storm-related restoration and rebuild is approximately $1.1 billion. The unprecedented destruction associated with this weather event combined with impacts of inflation on the cost of contract labor, supplies, food, fuel, and lodging contribute to the overall cost. Our estimate is subject to change over the next several months as estimates are replaced with bills from our mutual assistance partners as we complete the final cleanup of damaged equipment and as we work to ensure the impacted areas are restored to meet our standards for long-term reliability. That is not to suggest that our estimate is likely to materially change, but rather to acknowledge that it takes time to fully capture the ultimate cost of such an extensive endeavor. Turning now to our financial results. For the third quarter of 2024, our adjusted earnings were $1.43 per share $0.01 higher than the third quarter of 2023. The primary drivers of our performance for the quarter compared to last year were continued investment in our state-regulated utilities and customer growth. This was mostly offset by higher interest, depreciation, and other operating expenses. And for the nine months ended September 30th, 2024, our adjusted earnings per share were $3.56 compared with adjusted earnings per share of $3.01 for the same period in 2023. One of the largest drivers in our year-to-date results compared with the prior year is weather-related impacts from an extremely mild first half of 2023, contrasted with the weather effects we've experienced thus far in 2024. A complete reconciliation of the year-over-year earnings is included in the materials we released this morning. Our adjusted EPS estimate for the fourth quarter is $0.49 per share, which combined with our year-to-date performance, would represent full year adjusted earnings of $4.05 per share. After excluding a 0.4% negative impact of lost sales that resulted from the damage caused by Hurricane Helene, weather-normalized total retail electricity sales were essentially flat compared with the third quarter of 2023. The broad strength of the economy in the Southeast was exhibited in the quarter by strong electricity sales in the chemical, pipeline, and transportation segments, as well as data center power usage which continued its positive trend and was up 10% year-over-year. And while weather-normalized residential electricity usage per customer was slightly down in the quarter, we saw strong residential customer additions of 12,000 in our electric businesses and 7,000 new customers in our natural gas distribution businesses. The economic development activity across our electric service territories remains robust and our pipeline continues to grow at an historic pace. 42 companies either established or expanded operation in our service territory in the third quarter generating 5,000-plus potential new jobs and representing capital investments totaling approximately $2.6 billion. Alabama Power's economic activity this quarter, represented its strongest quarter in several years led by announcements in metals, renewable energy and the chemicals segment. The combined pipeline for new industrial and other large load commercial customers across our three-state electric utility footprint continues to grow. The upcoming quarterly large load economic development report to be filed with the Georgia Public Service Commission, is expected to reflect that Georgia Power's potential load additions and its economic development pipeline have grown to over 36 gigawatts, by the mid-2030s with 8 gigawatts committed. Chris, I'll turn the call back over to you.\nChris Womack: Thanks, Dan. We have delivered exceptional operational and solid financial results through the first three quarters of the year, and we are well positioned to finish the year strong. Our team's resilience in the face of a historic storm, highlights our dedication to the customers and the communities we are privileged to serve, and I am so extremely grateful and proud to be a part of their team. It is certainly an exciting time for our great company and for this industry. With supportive states and constructive regulation, along with our portfolio of state-regulated electric and gas utilities, we are well positioned for the opportunity presented by this extraordinary energy demand growth our industry is projecting in the coming years. As we work to help our states grow and partner with the communities we are privileged to serve, our disciplined approach, combined with the orderly planning and regulatory processes, across our utility service territories, should support mutual benefits for all of our stakeholders including, our existing customers. Let me conclude by saying, I am very excited about our future. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Carly Davenport, Goldman Sachs.\nQ – Carly Davenport: Hi, good afternoon – Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just to start on the storm cost side. I appreciate the color on the kind of $1.1 billion estimate at this point. Will all of that be deferred? And can you just talk through the process and the timing for filing for recovery of those costs in Georgia?\nDan Tucker: Yes. And pretty usual, Carly, we don't want to get too far ahead of any upcoming regulatory processes or make assumptions about how the commission will ultimately decide to deal with it. Just I think it's good to acknowledge historically. They've been very constructive, and the recovery has been timely and balanced kind of the needs of the company and the customers. In terms of where we sit today, yes, all the costs have been deferred. There is still work to do not unlike just turning estimates into more firm numbers. Again, don't expect material changes there. There's also -- we will also go through a process of determining particularly based on the nature of this rebuild that occurred, not just restoration, how much of these dollars are ultimately capital dollars essentially new assets, as opposed to the cost to support the crews, cost to simply rehang wires, those look -- would typically look more like O&M, but those will be deferred and potentially recovered in a different manner than the capital cost.\nQ – Carly Davenport: Got it. Okay. That's super helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just pivoting to the load growth side. I appreciate the updates there on the pipeline in Georgia. Could you just talk a little bit about, how that pipeline has developed and also the commitments? In the context of the upcoming IRP filing in Georgia, how are you thinking about the potential magnitude or mix of that filing just based on what you've seen so far, in terms of, how that large load pipeline has developed? And how that pipeline has converted to actual customer commitments?\nDan Tucker: Yes. That's a great question, Carly. So -- and again, without getting too far ahead of any processes or actual filings, the reason that Georgia Power is making this quarterly filing with the PSC was really to help all parties have a little bit better line of sight leading into the next formal process. And so since, we began that process, we've seen not only momentum continue and the size of the pipeline, but we have, to your point, seen continued commitments within that pipeline. So as we sit here today, again, we have 8,000 megawatts that have been committed by the kind of mid-2030 time frame, whereas at the time of our filing last fall with the Public Service Commission, that number was more like 3,600 megawatts. And so we're continuing to see that kind of progress.\nChris Womack : Carly, one thing I would add, and we talk about it a lot as we go through kind of our narrative about how this process works and I talk a lot about our orderly processes. And I think, as you look forward to this next large load filing and then as the company prepares for the Integrated Resource Planning process, I think that demonstrates that process that's in place to clearly demonstrate what's real. And then how we price this and just how we work our way through bringing these projects online, but just working through an orderly process, because there's a lot of activity up in the marketplace. But I think we owe it to our regulatory bodies, but also to all of our states to make sure we're being very diligent as we work through this process to bring these projects online.\nCarly Davenport : Got it. Very clear. Thanks so much for time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners.\nShar Pourreza : Hey, guys, Chris and Dan.\nChris Womack : Hey, Chris.\nShar Pourreza : Hey, Chris. I just wanted to maybe start with Southern Power for a second, sort of this kind of push for resource adequacy being so front and center in almost every jurisdiction. I mean Southern Power is predominantly contracted, but I have to imagine kind of the offtakers want to stick with the assets. Are you seeing kind of any opportunities around restriking the contracts and extending the tenors? Are you seeing opportunities as contracts roll off? And how do we think about pricing kind of in this environment and what it could also mean for Southern Power's growth? Thanks.\nDan Tucker : Yes. Let me start, Shar, and just level set on Southern Power. So we've always taken approach to Southern Power to have it -- have a risk profile that looks and feels like the regulated business. So long-term contracts, creditworthy counterparties, we don't take fuel risk. And so that portfolio, and in particular, if we focus in -- on the natural gas generation portfolio, is largely covered, I mean, 90%-plus covered through the end of this decade. And so it's not until then that you begin to have contracts that are up for renewal. Now obviously, we would have an opportunity to renew or extend to your point well before the end of the decade. And so in that context, as we look at the current contract rates relative to what capacity values appear to be out in that time frame, they've essentially doubled relative to what they were. Again, this is a long-term opportunity to kind of improve the returns within Southern Power. So yes, there is great interest in that capacity. Beyond the existing assets, we're also getting pinged, if you will, continuously by customers, hoping to be able to add new assets, whether those be natural gas or renewables, whether that's in the Southeast or in other markets, particularly where we have renewables. And it's the same kind of potential customer mix that we have today. We serve a lot of load-serving entities. So, investor-owned utilities, municipalities, co-ops. But we also, particularly in our renewable portfolio, serve a lot of large commercial and industrial customers directly through contract. They may be in structured markets, but it's ultimately a contract with an individual customer. So we're exploring those too, but maintaining that same discipline I described on the front end, long-term contracts, creditworthy counterparties, no fuel risk.\nShar Pourreza : Got it. But that discipline doesn't really curtail or put a ceiling on how big you expect Southern Power to get, because the opportunities are pretty sizable?\nDan Tucker : Yes, I think that's right, Shar. And just historically, and I think even going forward, we are a regulated utility holding company and we have this incredibly attractive complementary wholesale generation business that we've never wanted to get outsized relative to our retail business, our retail electric business or in gas business. That said, the regulated utility business is growing so fast right now. I have no concerns about Southern Power's growth rate outstripping that.\nChris Womack: But Shar, just always remember we talk about being disciplined. And just know that in the midst of all this opportunity we will remain very disciplined as we move through this period.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. Okay. Perfect. And then just lastly just on follow-up on Carly's just fine-tuning. Just Dan, do you have any sense you've got an estimated cost number there. You said $1.1 billion it could change. But do you have any sense on how much of that could be capital versus O&M? And then how do we sort of think about the timing of that recovery going into a GRC, as we're thinking about bill impact and customer affordability right? So there's a bunch of things happening at once and this is a big GRC coming up. So how do we sort of think about the risks there?\nDan Tucker: Yes. On your first point Shar, it's just too early to say. I think intuitively, we believe it will likely skew at least a little more capital than historically. But in terms of what that actually looks like, it's hard to say. And the reason that that's our belief is simply because of the magnitude of rebuilding that occurred in this storm. And then in terms of the process, again you know us and go back to Chris' comments. We're going to remain disciplined and part of our discipline is not getting ahead and making assumptions about what our regulatory processes will be. There's going to be lots of variables, not only the split of the capital versus this other piece, but just what else is being considered at the time. And I think the most important thing to look back on is the constructive approach that the commission has taken historically.\nShar Pourreza: Perfect. I appreciate it guys. Thanks so much.\nDan Tucker: Thanks, Shar. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Fowler, Bank of America.\nDan Tucker: Hey, Ross.\nRoss Fowler: Good morning, Chris, good morning, Dan. So maybe following on the Shar's question he asked most of it. But Dan, maybe not commenting on whatever happens in the future. But in the past sort of as you work through storm recovery processes in Georgia, this isn't first hurricane you've ever had. What is the typical sort of cash recovery lag? Can you remind us what that looks like? And then does that create an opportunity for securitization? Can that be done in the state? And then how do you sort of finance the gap between kind of the expenses that have gone out on the balance sheet versus the actual cash recovery this going forward?\nDan Tucker: Yes. Look I think the PSC has in their hands every tool of their disposal to overlay kind of a flexible approach to this. Without being too precise about the history, I think it's fair to say it has dependent on the magnitude of the storm and the circumstances at the time, but the recovery periods have been from a couple of years to as many as six years depending on how big the balance was and what else was kind of being factored into rates at the same time.\nRoss Fowler: Okay. Perfect. Thank you.\nDan Tucker: You bet.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nick Campanella, Barclays.\nDan Tucker: Hey, Nick.\nNick Campanella: Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Hope everyone is doing well. So I just wanted to kind of get your perspective 36 gigawatts is a big number. You already have eight committed to your point. It just kind of seems like there's pressure higher on your load outlook every quarter here. And you have seen some peers in the space starting to kind of revise numbers specifically kind of EPS outlooks on this. And I'm just kind of curious, is there a tipping point for you into where you would essentially need to kind of reevaluate the 5% to 7%? Is there a point where the plant can sustain a rate base growth figure even that kind of financing drag that would kind of put you above that 5% to 7% range? Thanks.\\\nDan Tucker: Sure. So I'll start Nick with what I've said historically on the growth rate. I would not expect anything to change in the near term everything we're describing. So let's go back to the 36 gigawatts that we're referring to. That's by the mid-2030s. That's not a 2024, 2025, 2026 kind of phenomenon. That's long term. There's certainly -- it certainly gets feathered in through the end of the decade and then well into the next decade. But every opportunity that exists here for acceleration of anything is long term in nature. And what I've said historically is to the extent this momentum continues, and the momentum is less about the pipeline as it is the commitments and the risk-adjusted outlook on sales and the capital that it takes to serve the load. If that continues, long term, in the latter half of our outlook, there may be an opportunity to reevaluate where the growth is starting from. As we sit here today, I don't think five to seven as a rate of growth changes. But again, we will evaluate it when we get there. You mentioned a lot of the moving parts here. We shared earlier this year that our long-term sales growth or at least the back half of the plan was close to 6%. With everything we're seeing, when we update our plan in February for you all, I won't be surprised if that's a higher number. When we get to February, we'll unveil our capital plan. We've already talked along the way and disclosed in our Q several things that are incremental to our capital plan earlier this year, handful of Southern Power projects, little bit of refinement around the Georgia Power IRP process, that IRP update around storage and the cost of plant Yates and its certification. We've seen the details around the Southern Natural pipeline opportunity that we own 50% of. Those things on their own that are known are roughly $3 billion of incremental capital relative to our $48 billion plan. It won't surprise me, given what we're seeing, that there are several billion dollars on top of that reflected in our plan in February. So we're taking a long-term view here. There's lots of opportunity. We're being very disciplined about how we approach this.\nNick Campanella: That's great, Dan. I appreciate all that context. Thank you for that. And I know the IRP filing is coming. You guys have been kind of leader in the nuclear space. Can you just kind of talk about how this fits into the company's wider generation outlook, even if it's not kind of the consolidated level? Are there re-licensing opportunities? Are, there uprate opportunities to consider? And there was discussion about potential multi-state framework? Is that something that you are part of? Maybe you could talk about this a little bit. Thanks.\nDan Tucker: Yes. Look, there's obviously a lot in that question as well. Let's just put it in the context of the IRP, just not going to get ahead of any regulatory processes, but let's talk about what that process looks like, right? It's -- at the end of the day, it's reflecting and projecting out scenarios under various moving parts, environmental rules, the cost of natural gas over time, the cost of capital over time. And those scenarios are solving for the most economic, reliable way to serve customers in the long term. Is it possible that one of those scenario model runs, spits out a nuclear uprate or a new nuclear unit as the solution in the model? Sure, it might. Does that mean that's a recommendation? No. Does that mean that's a path we've embarked on? No. Does that mean it's an option that is worth preserving and considering down the road? Of course, it is. But there's a lot that's going to take place before we get to that point. And that's, I think, what you hear a lot of us in the industry talking about. Aq New nuclear is super important for them for this country, but in order to get to the right place, there's got to be better risk mitigation than exists today. That's got to come from changes with the federal government, that could come from some of these conversations with these large technology companies. We're talking to as many of these companies as anyone. I'd argue we're having conversations with the majority of them, not just around nuclear, just around different ways to solve for this load equation. So it's a part of a broader conversation, but our discipline around this, and I'll tell you as my discipline as CFO, we're not going down that path until the risk is mitigated. But Chris, what would you add?\nChris Womack: Yeah. No, Dan, I think you're exactly right. I mean there's a lot of work that needs to be done at the federal level if this country is to embrace more nuclear. I mean -- and Dan said it. I mean, Southern Company has engaged with, over majority, maybe all of the hyperscalers regarding nuclear solutions, but other solutions to respond to their data center needs, but there are just so many risks that have to be dealt with. I mean, the risk is simply just too great. There's a ;lot of work t I mean, I am hopeful and we are trying to encourage to make sure that the government leans in a manner that helps mitigate the risk to shareholders and existing customers. But we're not going to move forward until we see a better line of sight in terms of those risks being mitigated. But between the federal government and some of the hyperscalers and we hope we can see hope there's progress and advancement on responding to what needs to be done but also helping mitigate some of this risk.\nNick Campanella: I appreciate your perspective on it and look forward to see you in Florida. Thanks.\nChris Womack: Great. Thank you very much.\nDan Tucker: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Jamieson Ward, Jefferies.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. It's Julien here actually. Thanks again for taking the question. Maybe to follow up on Nick's last one here if you can just elaborate a little bit further here on the nuclear side. I mean clearly a lot of focus. You guys obviously led the Vanguard here at the outset of the last build-out cycle. Can you speak a little bit more -- you talked about preserving the option over time. That doesn't sound like it's kind of a nearer-term development that you could press release in the next year with the hyperscaler precise. I just want to make sure I'm hearing this right. This is more preliminary than maybe what we've seen from some of your peers out there? I don't want to put words in your mouth. I'm just sort of curious to tease out of you how far down that rabbit hole you are considering the expertise that you guys bring to the table on the subject whether an SMR or [indiscernible] down.\nChris Womack: No. I think you said it upfront. I mean we've had -- with Vanguard. We've had this experience and we recognize and fully understand the risk that are there. And so as we spoke earlier we think before we can move down this path we've got to find solutions to mitigate the risk to our shareholders but also to our customers with nuclear. And so that's kind of where we are. I mean we'll go through the IRP processes that -- and as we go through those models and all the different scenarios in terms of what may come forward. But from a nuclear perspective the risk issues are just so real and we know what they are that we've got to find some way to mitigate those issues before we see the opportunity we see the reality of moving forward.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet, JPMorgan.\nChris Womack: Hey, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi. Good afternoon. Happy Halloween. If I could just continue on the nuclear side a bit here. And I know you touched on uprates there a bit. But just wanted to see at a high level if you could share any thoughts at all as far as what the opportunity set the range of I guess uprate potential there. And I know that there's a lot of variables in play economics and all the other factors that you've listed. Just wondering directionally if you could give us any thoughts there?\nDan Tucker: Yes. Look again Jeremy -- I hate to keep -- we're not going to get ahead of any regulatory processes. I'll give you just a little color there. So broadly across the enterprise so this is not Georgia-Power specific, but Georgia Power and Alabama Power and we have co-owners on all of these things. We do have six legacy units that there are opportunities for up rates. Historically, many of those uprates have not been economic. The benefits that are inherent in the IRA and some of the other legislation help with that and are pushing them to a point where they are potentially more viable not that they don't require a significant amount of capital not that they don't require a significant amount of time, but certainly don't bring with them the kind of risk of a new nuclear project. So it is certainly something on the table that we are evaluating. And at the right time we'll put that forward as an option if appropriate.\nJeremy Tonet: Great. Thank you for that. And then I just want to kind of shift gears given the big call on generation as you've outlined there. Just wondering any thoughts you could share with I guess coal retirement time lines? What could be impacted there? And then even as it relates to carbon capture is that something that you see as plausible for coal or gas? Or just any thoughts as it relates to Southern?\nChris Womack: A couple of things. On coal retirements clearly we're watching and paying attention to the EPA rules and we'll -- that will clearly instruct and inform us as we go through planning processes in terms of what those -- what the life of those projects will look like. So that's a couple of things that will of course continue to pay attention to. And what was the second part of your question?\nJeremy Tonet: Just as it relates to carbon capture potential for both the coal and gas.\nChris Womack: So as you know we've been operating the national carbon capture center now for some 50 years. And so we initially were doing a lot of carbon capture research around coal. We have shifted that research now to gas. And we have a number of partners from the utility industry, but also partners from the oil and gas industry because we all recognize the vital role that natural gas will play in this economy and supporting electricity generation and knowing how important it will be to bring forth technology for carbon capture as well as sequestration. We continue to pursue this work. We know there's more research to be done to get this at a point where it's scalable, but we're going to continue to make this investment because we think gas will be essential for this country going forward. And we'll continue to invest in international carbon capture center, but also find other research opportunities to invest in carbon capture and research carbon capture.\nJeremy Tonet: That's very helpful. And one last quick one if I could sneak it in. Just as it relates to the pipes opportunity as you laid it out there, I think it was part of the $3 billion there. But just was wondering I guess, if you could provide a little bit more color on what that could look like just size of gas you'd like to get into your service territory? And what type of time frame do you see this ultimately unfolding over?\nDan Tucker: Yeah. So there's a lot of details there on the gas procurement side Jeremy that we can't share. I mean that's proprietary information that's part of the project. There are contractual provisions between Southern Natural and all the off-takers. Suffice it to say, the existing Southern Natural pipe, our entities between our electric generation fleet and Atlanta Gas Light and the marketers in Georgia represent 50% of the offtake of the existing pipe. And so I don't think it's unreasonable that with an expansion project that we have the opportunity to be a pretty large participant as well. As far as the timing of the project, again, I think all these details are probably out there in Kinder Morgan's materials. But just think about it essentially as a project that culminates sometime at the very back end of our forecast or late this decade.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.\nDan Tucker: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Fremont, Ladenburg Thalmann.\nChris Womack: Hi, Paul.\nPaul Fremont: Hi, thanks. Thanks for taking my question. Would you consider at this point adding fossil generation at Southern Power given the significant demand that you're seeing for customers to add capacity?\nChris Womack: Yes. I mean -- and Paul, Dan has referred back to our model as we think about Southern Power. And so that will guide a lot of work that we do in consideration of that we have. I mean, and so as we look at projects we look at creditworthy counterparties not taking fuel risk, but using that kind of discipline to guide what happens at Southern Power going forward, I think will instruct us in terms of what opportunities that may be available and what things we'll pursue. But I think it will be premature to make any kind of commitment or any kind of guidance in terms of what may happen there.\nDan Tucker: Yeah. If you think about the conversation we've already had along the way here, environmental rules, things like 111(d) and what happens there, pipeline infrastructure and its availability to do projects like that. If we can mitigate those risks or the contract is designed in such a way that more than pays for those risks then that's something we'll continue to keep on the table. So it's never, no. It's just a function of being consistent with our business model.\nChris Womack: And I think it's also being -- remaining disciplined. I mean there's a lot of enthusiasm in the marketplace today. But we've got -- as you'll hear me say a lot we've got to remain disciplined. We've got to be true to kind of who we are and kind of our philosophy and values that we have in place and let that guide us as we move through kind of this incredible growth opportunities that we see here in this industry. We've got to remain disciplined.\nPaul Fremont: And I guess you've identified sort of eight gigawatts of committed load including 3.6 gigawatts that were included in the last IRP. So how much of the 4.4 remaining should we assume is paid for by an individual customer versus being socialized over your entire retail load?\nDan Tucker: Substantially all of it by specific customers.\nPaul Fremont: Okay. So it wouldn't -- most of it would actually have a positive impact then on customer bills?\nDan Tucker: Yeah. That is the objective as we overlay this disciplined and orderly process that there are mutual benefits of serving this load to the existing customer base.\nPaul Fremont: And then last question for me. We've seen sort of endless legal challenges to new pipelines would an expansion of SONAT be subject to legal challenges? Or how should we think about that?\nDan Tucker: I think you have to believe it certainly has its susceptibilities as well. And I think that's again factored in the way Kinder Morgan is thinking about the timeline.\nPaul Fremont: But you would need additional permitting and all the things that would sort of potentially lead to a legal fight?\nDan Tucker: Yeah. There's about 90% of this particular project is brownfield largely compression and looping. And so that greatly de-risks the opportunity doesn't mean there's a not still requirement, but you're not creating a brand-new right of way for hundreds of miles and building new pipe.\nDan Tucker: Great. Thank you very much.\nDan Tucker: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra, Evercore ISI.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey Dan. Good afternoon. Thank you for giving me time. Hey just a blue sky question. Just what you guys think of the SMR technology? Obviously you've seen several announcements that your peers have made which are dated at the end of the decade. But what do you -- what is your experience with the technology? Have you had any discussions? Do you think it's scalable? Just kind of your position as a nuclear power operator I'd just be curious on what do you think of the technology itself? Thank you.\nChris Womack: Yeah. Durgesh, this is Chris. And you've heard us talk before about our research and development organizations and the proprietary research that we do. And we have partnered with a number of organizations for years, investing in SMR technology, researching SMR technology and Advanced Nuclear. And we follow it. We work very closely with a lot of partners. I mean there's a lot of work being done, but there's very few projects that are moving forward. There's a lot of discussion about them, but I think there's just a lot more work to be done to finalize the designs and finalize the engineering. And we're following it and involve very closely. We think it's very beneficial for us to follow but also to be engaged on multiple fronts I mean even as we were building Vogtle Units 3 and 4. We continue to involve ourselves with Gen IV an additional advanced nuclear technology. I mean that's kind of who we are and what we do as a company and we're going to continue to do that. But from my perspective, there's still more work to be done before we get close to anything commercial. I mean but there's a lot of talk out there, but I think there's more work and more design work and more engineering work to be done.\nDan Tucker: Given that approach I think what it would be fair to say is that we view it as too early to put all of our eggs in one nuclear technology basket.\nDurgesh Chopra: Very clear guys. I appreciate that added color. Thank you.\nChris Womack: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Travis Miller, Morningstar Inc.\nTravis Miller: Good afternoon. Thank you. A quick follow-up on the storm costs. Did you have any storm cost reserves? Or how much did you use of those that was available?\nDan Tucker: There was not a reserve going into the storm. We actually had a very small balance to be recovered. So, this was additive to that. If you actually look at the balance the balance is closer to $1.2 billion whereas this particular reserve was $1.1 billion.\nTravis Miller: Okay. Okay. And then higher level to serve that demand that you're talking about especially that 8 gigawatts if you were to decide to build say a gas unit or whatever today, in terms of supply chain, how long would it actually take you to get from concept today to flowing electrons to a new customer?\nDan Tucker: Well, I'm going to start and Chris jump in here. But I think in answering the question, I don't want to answer the question as though we haven't already done things to get ahead of that. So, you -- we've taken the opportunity to get in the queue for long-lead time equipment. We have partners from an EPC perspective that we've worked closely with very recently and very successfully. And so we're I would say several steps ahead on that. But then you have to step back and say what technology. So, is it a combustion turbine? Is it a combined cycle? Those are different time lines. All that to say, Travis, I think we're in good shape. It's in general a three to five-year timeframe to kind of get gas generation from the beginning to the end. And given the long lead time nature of this load we're pretty well positioned.\nChris Womack: Yes. And I think if you look back at our Barry 8 Project at Alabama, that was a little bit over three years, I think in the construction of that unit so 800 megawatts combined cycle unit. So, we've had some good experiences of late with construction of those units.\nTravis Miller: Okay, that's great. And then what about T&D, is there any difference in terms of supply chain or timing of supplies T&D versus generation?\nDan Tucker: No, I think it all overlays pretty nicely. Our lead-times on large transformers and other major equipment longer than they used to be, yes. But we have visibility into that and are planning accordingly.\nTravis Miller: Okay, perfect. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Paul Patterson, Glenrock Associates.\nPaul Patterson: Hey. Happy Halloween. So, it sounds like you guys are -- things are falling into place and everything. And it sounds like you guys are -- I mean -- just to make sure that I'm understanding it correctly that you guys see upside to the sales growth expectations that you previously had and obviously CapEx associated with that, correct?\nDan Tucker: Yes.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. And that would -- in terms of in the past, when you guys talked about this earnings increase -- I'm sorry, this sales growth increase, et cetera. There wasn't necessarily a direct impact on earnings that you had seen. Should we think that perhaps with this more robust outlook that might be coming out that? How should we think about that in terms of earnings I guess?\nDan Tucker: Yes Paul, I'll go back to what I said earlier. To the extent we do indeed see this momentum is continuing and we do maintain our discipline about not getting too far ahead or ahead at all of any of the regulatory processes and the line of sight on this stuff. The opportunity to reflect and provide a different outlook will not occur until the latter half of our plan. All of this is long-term in nature. There's -- as exciting as this is and as much work is happening around all this for us and the entire industry, this load is on the back end of the forecast. It's not this year. It's not next year. It's 2028, 2029, 2030 and beyond.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. I just wanted to make sure that. I don't know. I thought maybe I just want to make sure if there was anything else I should be looking at. Okay, that's awesome. And then just finally on the deferral -- excuse me, on the storm costs. When you're deferring the cost is it at a cost of -- I mean I assume you're getting some sort of return. Is that return a debt return? Or is it -- how should we think about the return that's associated with the deferral?\nDan Tucker: Yes. It's typically been our cost of capital. But again, with the magnitude of it and with the nature of it, the commission has flexibility to adjust that just like they have done historically with us for other things with large under-recovered fuel balances have a different financing costs associated with it.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. Thanks so much. I really appreciate.\nDan Tucker: You bet, Paul.\nOperator: All right. Thank you. That will conclude today's Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back to Chris Womack for closing comments.\nChris Womack: Again, let me thank each one of you for joining us today. We are -- as we said we're excited about where we are in the company and we're pleased with the performance we've had through the first three quarters of this year. And so once again, we thank you for taking time to be with us and we wish all of you a happy Halloween. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. That will conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

            "content": "Thank you, Greg. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Our entire company including our premier state-regulated electric gas and utilities, continued to perform well during the third quarter, especially as our dedicated employees across Southern Company came together as one team in response to Hurricane Helene. The resolve and the professionalism of our employees has never been more evident than was demonstrated through the recent storm restoration efforts in Georgia. Before Dan provides an overview of our financial results, I'd like to share our story from this unprecedented weather event. Hurricane Helene was a storm of historic magnitude. Its aftermath was met with an extraordinary response from our dedicated team across Southern Company, our mutual assistance partners, state and local first responders and emergency management agencies and government officials, all across Georgia. Persistent rain, extreme flooding and heavy winds resulted in what can only be characterized as devastation to many of the communities we serve, with the destruction stretching hundreds of miles impacting the Eastern two-thirds of the entire state. Ultimately, the damage caused by Hurricane Helene was the most destructive in Georgia Power's 140-year history, exceeding the damage caused by the largest -- the three largest storms to impact Georgia Power's service territory combined. Helene entered Southern Georgia as a Category one hurricane and resulted in 53 out of the 159 counties in the state being declared major disaster areas by the Federal Energy -- Emergency Management Agency. With considerable damage to transmission infrastructure, nearly 12,000 damaged utility poles and some 1,500 miles of downed wires, the equivalent of the distance between Atlanta and Phoenix, Arizona, our customers' experienced over 1.5 million outages in the wake of the storm. With the support of resources from across North America, a workforce of well over 20,000 worked around the clock to safely reconnect customers through extremely difficult conditions. Commensurate with the devastation seen in our communities, much of our utility infrastructure was damaged beyond near repair, and significant portion of our system in the affected regions require a complete rebuild. Thanks to the contributions of our utility industry partners and especially thanks to the unwavering commitment of our own hard-working dedicated crews, many of whom lived in the same communities and some of whom endured destruction to their own homes, the restoration and rebuilding efforts were 95% complete within eight days with power restored to over 0.5 million customers within the first 48 hours. We are incredibly proud of our team's response and eternally grateful to be a part of an industry that works so well together in times of need. Many of the communities we are privileged to serve across Eastern Georgia have a long road ahead to recovery, Georgia Power, Atlanta Gas Light. Southern Company are contributing to organizations to aid these communities and Georgia Power has taken additional steps to provide support and resources to our customers in Georgia. In our business model, customers are at the center of everything we do. And our commitment to the communities and customers we serve has never been more important than in times like these. I am extremely proud of our team's exceptional efforts to clearly demonstrate that we are a citizen wherever we serve each and every day. Dan, I'll now turn the call over to you for a financial update. Thanks, Dan. We have delivered exceptional operational and solid financial results through the first three quarters of the year, and we are well positioned to finish the year strong. Our team's resilience in the face of a historic storm, highlights our dedication to the customers and the communities we are privileged to serve, and I am so extremely grateful and proud to be a part of their team. It is certainly an exciting time for our great company and for this industry. With supportive states and constructive regulation, along with our portfolio of state-regulated electric and gas utilities, we are well positioned for the opportunity presented by this extraordinary energy demand growth our industry is projecting in the coming years. As we work to help our states grow and partner with the communities we are privileged to serve, our disciplined approach, combined with the orderly planning and regulatory processes, across our utility service territories, should support mutual benefits for all of our stakeholders including, our existing customers. Let me conclude by saying, I am very excited about our future. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Carly, one thing I would add, and we talk about it a lot as we go through kind of our narrative about how this process works and I talk a lot about our orderly processes. And I think, as you look forward to this next large load filing and then as the company prepares for the Integrated Resource Planning process, I think that demonstrates that process that's in place to clearly demonstrate what's real. And then how we price this and just how we work our way through bringing these projects online, but just working through an orderly process, because there's a lot of activity up in the marketplace. But I think we owe it to our regulatory bodies, but also to all of our states to make sure we're being very diligent as we work through this process to bring these projects online. Hey, Chris. But Shar, just always remember we talk about being disciplined. And just know that in the midst of all this opportunity we will remain very disciplined as we move through this period. Yeah. No, Dan, I think you're exactly right. I mean there's a lot of work that needs to be done at the federal level if this country is to embrace more nuclear. I mean -- and Dan said it. I mean, Southern Company has engaged with, over majority, maybe all of the hyperscalers regarding nuclear solutions, but other solutions to respond to their data center needs, but there are just so many risks that have to be dealt with. I mean, the risk is simply just too great. There's a ;lot of work t I mean, I am hopeful and we are trying to encourage to make sure that the government leans in a manner that helps mitigate the risk to shareholders and existing customers. But we're not going to move forward until we see a better line of sight in terms of those risks being mitigated. But between the federal government and some of the hyperscalers and we hope we can see hope there's progress and advancement on responding to what needs to be done but also helping mitigate some of this risk. Great. Thank you very much. No. I think you said it upfront. I mean we've had -- with Vanguard. We've had this experience and we recognize and fully understand the risk that are there. And so as we spoke earlier we think before we can move down this path we've got to find solutions to mitigate the risk to our shareholders but also to our customers with nuclear. And so that's kind of where we are. I mean we'll go through the IRP processes that -- and as we go through those models and all the different scenarios in terms of what may come forward. But from a nuclear perspective the risk issues are just so real and we know what they are that we've got to find some way to mitigate those issues before we see the opportunity we see the reality of moving forward. Hey, Jeremy. A couple of things. On coal retirements clearly we're watching and paying attention to the EPA rules and we'll -- that will clearly instruct and inform us as we go through planning processes in terms of what those -- what the life of those projects will look like. So that's a couple of things that will of course continue to pay attention to. And what was the second part of your question? So as you know we've been operating the national carbon capture center now for some 50 years. And so we initially were doing a lot of carbon capture research around coal. We have shifted that research now to gas. And we have a number of partners from the utility industry, but also partners from the oil and gas industry because we all recognize the vital role that natural gas will play in this economy and supporting electricity generation and knowing how important it will be to bring forth technology for carbon capture as well as sequestration. We continue to pursue this work. We know there's more research to be done to get this at a point where it's scalable, but we're going to continue to make this investment because we think gas will be essential for this country going forward. And we'll continue to invest in international carbon capture center, but also find other research opportunities to invest in carbon capture and research carbon capture. Hi, Paul. Yes. I mean -- and Paul, Dan has referred back to our model as we think about Southern Power. And so that will guide a lot of work that we do in consideration of that we have. I mean, and so as we look at projects we look at creditworthy counterparties not taking fuel risk, but using that kind of discipline to guide what happens at Southern Power going forward, I think will instruct us in terms of what opportunities that may be available and what things we'll pursue. But I think it will be premature to make any kind of commitment or any kind of guidance in terms of what may happen there. And I think it's also being -- remaining disciplined. I mean there's a lot of enthusiasm in the marketplace today. But we've got -- as you'll hear me say a lot we've got to remain disciplined. We've got to be true to kind of who we are and kind of our philosophy and values that we have in place and let that guide us as we move through kind of this incredible growth opportunities that we see here in this industry.

I mean but there's a lot of talk out there, but I think there's more work and more design work and more engineering work to be done. You're welcome. Yes. And I think if you look back at our Barry 8 Project at Alabama, that was a little bit over three years, I think in the construction of that unit so 800 megawatts combined cycle unit. So, we've had some good experiences of late with construction of those units. Again, let me thank each one of you for joining us today. We are -- as we said we're excited about where we are in the company and we're pleased with the performance we've had through the first three quarters of this year. And so once again, we thank you for taking time to be with us and we wish all of you a happy Halloween. Thank you very much."

            "name": "Dan Tucker",
            "content": "Thanks Chris and good afternoon everyone. Before I walk through the third quarter financial results, I'd like to briefly address the costs associated with the recovery efforts Chris just described related to Hurricane Helene. The initial estimated cost for this historic storm-related restoration and rebuild is approximately $1.1 billion. The unprecedented destruction associated with this weather event combined with impacts of inflation on the cost of contract labor, supplies, food, fuel, and lodging contribute to the overall cost. Our estimate is subject to change over the next several months as estimates are replaced with bills from our mutual assistance partners as we complete the final cleanup of damaged equipment and as we work to ensure the impacted areas are restored to meet our standards for long-term reliability. That is not to suggest that our estimate is likely to materially change, but rather to acknowledge that it takes time to fully capture the ultimate cost of such an extensive endeavor. Turning now to our financial results. For the third quarter of 2024, our adjusted earnings were $1.43 per share $0.01 higher than the third quarter of 2023. The primary drivers of our performance for the quarter compared to last year were continued investment in our state-regulated utilities and customer growth. This was mostly offset by higher interest, depreciation, and other operating expenses. And for the nine months ended September 30th, 2024, our adjusted earnings per share were $3.56 compared with adjusted earnings per share of $3.01 for the same period in 2023. One of the largest drivers in our year-to-date results compared with the prior year is weather-related impacts from an extremely mild first half of 2023, contrasted with the weather effects we've experienced thus far in 2024. A complete reconciliation of the year-over-year earnings is included in the materials we released this morning. Our adjusted EPS estimate for the fourth quarter is $0.49 per share, which combined with our year-to-date performance, would represent full year adjusted earnings of $4.05 per share. After excluding a 0.4% negative impact of lost sales that resulted from the damage caused by Hurricane Helene, weather-normalized total retail electricity sales were essentially flat compared with the third quarter of 2023. The broad strength of the economy in the Southeast was exhibited in the quarter by strong electricity sales in the chemical, pipeline, and transportation segments, as well as data center power usage which continued its positive trend and was up 10% year-over-year. And while weather-normalized residential electricity usage per customer was slightly down in the quarter, we saw strong residential customer additions of 12,000 in our electric businesses and 7,000 new customers in our natural gas distribution businesses. The economic development activity across our electric service territories remains robust and our pipeline continues to grow at an historic pace. 42 companies either established or expanded operation in our service territory in the third quarter generating 5,000-plus potential new jobs and representing capital investments totaling approximately $2.6 billion. Alabama Power's economic activity this quarter, represented its strongest quarter in several years led by announcements in metals, renewable energy and the chemicals segment. The combined pipeline for new industrial and other large load commercial customers across our three-state electric utility footprint continues to grow. The upcoming quarterly large load economic development report to be filed with the Georgia Public Service Commission, is expected to reflect that Georgia Power's potential load additions and its economic development pipeline have grown to over 36 gigawatts, by the mid-2030s with 8 gigawatts committed. Chris, I'll turn the call back over to you. Yes. And pretty usual, Carly, we don't want to get too far ahead of any upcoming regulatory processes or make assumptions about how the commission will ultimately decide to deal with it. Just I think it's good to acknowledge historically. They've been very constructive, and the recovery has been timely and balanced kind of the needs of the company and the customers. In terms of where we sit today, yes, all the costs have been deferred. There is still work to do not unlike just turning estimates into more firm numbers. Again, don't expect material changes there. There's also -- we will also go through a process of determining particularly based on the nature of this rebuild that occurred, not just restoration, how much of these dollars are ultimately capital dollars essentially new assets, as opposed to the cost to support the crews, cost to simply rehang wires, those look -- would typically look more like O&M, but those will be deferred and potentially recovered in a different manner than the capital cost.\nQ – Carly Davenport: Got it. Okay. That's super helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just pivoting to the load growth side. I appreciate the updates there on the pipeline in Georgia. Could you just talk a little bit about, how that pipeline has developed and also the commitments? In the context of the upcoming IRP filing in Georgia, how are you thinking about the potential magnitude or mix of that filing just based on what you've seen so far, in terms of, how that large load pipeline has developed? And how that pipeline has converted to actual customer commitments? Yes. That's a great question, Carly. So -- and again, without getting too far ahead of any processes or actual filings, the reason that Georgia Power is making this quarterly filing with the PSC was really to help all parties have a little bit better line of sight leading into the next formal process. And so since, we began that process, we've seen not only momentum continue and the size of the pipeline, but we have, to your point, seen continued commitments within that pipeline. So as we sit here today, again, we have 8,000 megawatts that have been committed by the kind of mid-2030 time frame, whereas at the time of our filing last fall with the Public Service Commission, that number was more like 3,600 megawatts. And so we're continuing to see that kind of progress. Yes. Let me start, Shar, and just level set on Southern Power. So we've always taken approach to Southern Power to have it -- have a risk profile that looks and feels like the regulated business. So long-term contracts, creditworthy counterparties, we don't take fuel risk. And so that portfolio, and in particular, if we focus in -- on the natural gas generation portfolio, is largely covered, I mean, 90%-plus covered through the end of this decade. And so it's not until then that you begin to have contracts that are up for renewal. Now obviously, we would have an opportunity to renew or extend to your point well before the end of the decade. And so in that context, as we look at the current contract rates relative to what capacity values appear to be out in that time frame, they've essentially doubled relative to what they were. Again, this is a long-term opportunity to kind of improve the returns within Southern Power. So yes, there is great interest in that capacity. Beyond the existing assets, we're also getting pinged, if you will, continuously by customers, hoping to be able to add new assets, whether those be natural gas or renewables, whether that's in the Southeast or in other markets, particularly where we have renewables. And it's the same kind of potential customer mix that we have today. We serve a lot of load-serving entities. So, investor-owned utilities, municipalities, co-ops. But we also, particularly in our renewable portfolio, serve a lot of large commercial and industrial customers directly through contract. They may be in structured markets, but it's ultimately a contract with an individual customer. So we're exploring those too, but maintaining that same discipline I described on the front end, long-term contracts, creditworthy counterparties, no fuel risk. Yes, I think that's right, Shar. And just historically, and I think even going forward, we are a regulated utility holding company and we have this incredibly attractive complementary wholesale generation business that we've never wanted to get outsized relative to our retail business, our retail electric business or in gas business. That said, the regulated utility business is growing so fast right now. I have no concerns about Southern Power's growth rate outstripping that. Yes. On your first point Shar, it's just too early to say. I think intuitively, we believe it will likely skew at least a little more capital than historically. But in terms of what that actually looks like, it's hard to say. And the reason that that's our belief is simply because of the magnitude of rebuilding that occurred in this storm. And then in terms of the process, again you know us and go back to Chris' comments. We're going to remain disciplined and part of our discipline is not getting ahead and making assumptions about what our regulatory processes will be. There's going to be lots of variables, not only the split of the capital versus this other piece, but just what else is being considered at the time. And I think the most important thing to look back on is the constructive approach that the commission has taken historically. Thanks, Shar. Take care. Hey, Ross. Yes. Look I think the PSC has in their hands every tool of their disposal to overlay kind of a flexible approach to this. Without being too precise about the history, I think it's fair to say it has dependent on the magnitude of the storm and the circumstances at the time, but the recovery periods have been from a couple of years to as many as six years depending on how big the balance was and what else was kind of being factored into rates at the same time. You bet. Hey, Nick. Sure. So I'll start Nick with what I've said historically on the growth rate. I would not expect anything to change in the near term everything we're describing. So let's go back to the 36 gigawatts that we're referring to. That's by the mid-2030s. That's not a 2024, 2025, 2026 kind of phenomenon. That's long term. There's certainly -- it certainly gets feathered in through the end of the decade and then well into the next decade. But every opportunity that exists here for acceleration of anything is long term in nature. And what I've said historically is to the extent this momentum continues, and the momentum is less about the pipeline as it is the commitments and the risk-adjusted outlook on sales and the capital that it takes to serve the load. If that continues, long term, in the latter half of our outlook, there may be an opportunity to reevaluate where the growth is starting from. As we sit here today, I don't think five to seven as a rate of growth changes. But again, we will evaluate it when we get there. You mentioned a lot of the moving parts here. We shared earlier this year that our long-term sales growth or at least the back half of the plan was close to 6%. With everything we're seeing, when we update our plan in February for you all, I won't be surprised if that's a higher number. When we get to February, we'll unveil our capital plan. We've already talked along the way and disclosed in our Q several things that are incremental to our capital plan earlier this year, handful of Southern Power projects, little bit of refinement around the Georgia Power IRP process, that IRP update around storage and the cost of plant Yates and its certification. We've seen the details around the Southern Natural pipeline opportunity that we own 50% of. Those things on their own that are known are roughly $3 billion of incremental capital relative to our $48 billion plan. It won't surprise me, given what we're seeing, that there are several billion dollars on top of that reflected in our plan in February. So we're taking a long-term view here. There's lots of opportunity. We're being very disciplined about how we approach this. Yes. Look, there's obviously a lot in that question as well. Let's just put it in the context of the IRP, just not going to get ahead of any regulatory processes, but let's talk about what that process looks like, right? It's -- at the end of the day, it's reflecting and projecting out scenarios under various moving parts, environmental rules, the cost of natural gas over time, the cost of capital over time. And those scenarios are solving for the most economic, reliable way to serve customers in the long term. Is it possible that one of those scenario model runs, spits out a nuclear uprate or a new nuclear unit as the solution in the model? Sure, it might. Does that mean that's a recommendation? No. Does that mean that's a path we've embarked on? No. Does that mean it's an option that is worth preserving and considering down the road? Of course, it is. But there's a lot that's going to take place before we get to that point. And that's, I think, what you hear a lot of us in the industry talking about. Aq New nuclear is super important for them for this country, but in order to get to the right place, there's got to be better risk mitigation than exists today. That's got to come from changes with the federal government, that could come from some of these conversations with these large technology companies. We're talking to as many of these companies as anyone. I'd argue we're having conversations with the majority of them, not just around nuclear, just around different ways to solve for this load equation. So it's a part of a broader conversation, but our discipline around this, and I'll tell you as my discipline as CFO, we're not going down that path until the risk is mitigated. But Chris, what would you add? Thank you. Yes. Look again Jeremy -- I hate to keep -- we're not going to get ahead of any regulatory processes. I'll give you just a little color there. So broadly across the enterprise so this is not Georgia-Power specific, but Georgia Power and Alabama Power and we have co-owners on all of these things. We do have six legacy units that there are opportunities for up rates. Historically, many of those uprates have not been economic. The benefits that are inherent in the IRA and some of the other legislation help with that and are pushing them to a point where they are potentially more viable not that they don't require a significant amount of capital not that they don't require a significant amount of time, but certainly don't bring with them the kind of risk of a new nuclear project. So it is certainly something on the table that we are evaluating. And at the right time we'll put that forward as an option if appropriate. Yeah. So there's a lot of details there on the gas procurement side Jeremy that we can't share. I mean that's proprietary information that's part of the project. There are contractual provisions between Southern Natural and all the off-takers. Suffice it to say, the existing Southern Natural pipe, our entities between our electric generation fleet and Atlanta Gas Light and the marketers in Georgia represent 50% of the offtake of the existing pipe. And so I don't think it's unreasonable that with an expansion project that we have the opportunity to be a pretty large participant as well. As far as the timing of the project, again, I think all these details are probably out there in Kinder Morgan's materials. But just think about it essentially as a project that culminates sometime at the very back end of our forecast or late this decade. You bet. Yeah. If you think about the conversation we've already had along the way here, environmental rules, things like 111(d) and what happens there, pipeline infrastructure and its availability to do projects like that. If we can mitigate those risks or the contract is designed in such a way that more than pays for those risks then that's something we'll continue to keep on the table. So it's never, no. It's just a function of being consistent with our business model. Substantially all of it by specific customers. Yeah. That is the objective as we overlay this disciplined and orderly process that there are mutual benefits of serving this load to the existing customer base. I think you have to believe it certainly has its susceptibilities as well. And I think that's again factored in the way Kinder Morgan is thinking about the timeline. Yeah. There's about 90% of this particular project is brownfield largely compression and looping. And so that greatly de-risks the opportunity doesn't mean there's a not still requirement, but you're not creating a brand-new right of way for hundreds of miles and building new pipe. Great. Thank you very much. Thank you. Given that approach I think what it would be fair to say is that we view it as too early to put all of our eggs in one nuclear technology basket. There was not a reserve going into the storm. We actually had a very small balance to be recovered. So, this was additive to that. If you actually look at the balance the balance is closer to $1.2 billion whereas this particular reserve was $1.1 billion. Well, I'm going to start and Chris jump in here. But I think in answering the question, I don't want to answer the question as though we haven't already done things to get ahead of that. So, you -- we've taken the opportunity to get in the queue for long-lead time equipment. We have partners from an EPC perspective that we've worked closely with very recently and very successfully. And so we're I would say several steps ahead on that. But then you have to step back and say what technology. So, is it a combustion turbine? Is it a combined cycle? Those are different time lines. All that to say, Travis, I think we're in good shape. It's in general a three to five-year timeframe to kind of get gas generation from the beginning to the end. And given the long lead time nature of this load we're pretty well positioned. No, I think it all overlays pretty nicely. Our lead-times on large transformers and other major equipment longer than they used to be, yes. But we have visibility into that and are planning accordingly. Yes. Yes Paul, I'll go back to what I said earlier. To the extent we do indeed see this momentum is continuing and we do maintain our discipline about not getting too far ahead or ahead at all of any of the regulatory processes and the line of sight on this stuff. The opportunity to reflect and provide a different outlook will not occur until the latter half of our plan. All of this is long-term in nature. There's -- as exciting as this is and as much work is happening around all this for us and the entire industry, this load is on the back end of the forecast. It's not this year. It's not next year. It's 2028, 2029, 2030 and beyond. Yes. It's typically been our cost of capital. But again, with the magnitude of it and with the nature of it, the commission has flexibility to adjust that just like they have done historically with us for other things with large under-recovered fuel balances have a different financing costs associated with it. You bet, Paul."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Sherry, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everybody to the Southern Company Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.\nScott Gammill: Thank you, Sherry. Good afternoon, and welcome to Southern Company’s second quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining me today are Chris Womack, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Dan Tucker, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you, we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and subsequent filings. In addition, we'll present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we've released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I'll turn it over to Chris.\nChris Womack: Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted earnings results for the second quarter, meaningfully ahead of the estimate provided last quarter. We believe we are well-positioned to achieve our financial objectives for 2024. All our businesses, electric and gas, are performing well, and we continue to see both economic resilience and economic growth, especially within our southeast service territories. During the most recent heat wave across the southeast, our dedicated employees, supported by our coordinated planning, ensured our electric system delivered outstanding reliability and resiliency for the customers and communities that we are privileged to serve. Last quarter represented the warmest second quarter in the last 38 years, with a peak electric load of over 38,000 megawatts, the third highest June peak electric load on record for the Southern Company system. We take tremendous pride in our ability to reliably serve our customers through all operating conditions. Our performance continues to highlight the value of the integrated regulated framework in which we operate. Coordinating planning for generation and transmission as well as our robust portfolio of natural gas transportation, capacity, and storage have positioned us to effectively manage peak demand needs. This same framework, including our orderly internal and external regulatory processes for long term demand planning and resource decisions, is what also positions us so well to reliably serve the significant electric load growth projected over the next decade, an opportunity we're excited about. Dan, I'll now turn the call over to you for a financial update.\nDan Tucker: Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. For the second quarter of 2024, our adjusted earnings per share was $1.10 per share, $0.31 higher than the second quarter of 2023 and $0.20 above our estimate. The primary drivers of our performance for the quarter compared to last year were continued investment in our state regulated utilities and warmer than normal weather for our electric subsidiaries. This was somewhat offset by higher interest and depreciation expenses. A complete reconciliation of year-over-year earnings is included in the materials we released this morning. Our adjusted EPS estimate for the third quarter is $1.30 per share. As Chris noted, all of our businesses experienced a strong second quarter leading to adjusted financial results meaningfully higher than our estimate of $0.90 per share. The warmer than normal weather in the Q2 contributed to these results as well as our continued focus on managing operating costs. Additionally, during the second quarter, we experienced higher than expected weather adjusted electricity sales in our commercial customer class. These higher sales were driven by a combination of continued strength in our local economies as well as increased usage by many of our existing data center customers. In fact, sales to existing data centers for the quarter were up approximately 17% year-over-year. The strong Southeast economy, including favorable business climates and expansions in manufacturing, continues to drive net in migration and customer growth. For the second quarter, we saw residential customer additions of 14,000 in our electric businesses and 6,000 in our natural gas distribution businesses. We also continue to see strong economic development activity across our electric service territories. The aggregate pipeline for potential new industrial and commercial customers across our 3 state electric utility footprint includes nearly 200 projects and over 30 gigawatts of potential load over the next decade or so. While it's likely these numbers include some degree of duplication as in potential projects as some prospective customers are evaluating multiple states that we serve for their facilities, these numbers are significantly higher than what we've seen historically. About 40% of the projects in the pipeline and 80% of the potential electric load are data centers. In addition to data centers, clean energy and transportation manufacturing, port related businesses and other heavy industries continue to be attracted to our states due to reliable energy, a diverse workforce, robust transportation networks and a low cost of living, all compelling reasons to locate or expand in our Southeastern states. The potential load growth in this pipeline that is reflected in our forecast is currently only a fraction of this full potential. As a reminder, during our year-end earnings call in February, we updated our forecast to reflect projected retail electric sales growth that is expected to accelerate in the latter part of this decade with a projected growth rate of approximately 6% from 2025 to 2028. The underlying Georgia Power projected sales growth is approximately 9% over the same period. In response to this growth, Georgia Power filed and the Georgia Public Service Commission subsequently approved earlier this year its 2023 Integrated Resource Plan Update. Since the time of the original filing last year, Georgia Power's pipeline of potential large load additions by the mid-2030 has grown approximately 40%, and the amount of committed peak demand at the same time frame has more than doubled, now totaling over 7 gigawatts. As we described in detail on our last earnings call, we continue to execute on our disciplined approach to attracting, serving, pricing and forecasting this potential incremental electric load, and we continue to expect that our disciplined approach to pricing this new load should result in revenues that not only cover the incremental cost to serve these new customers, but also provides economic benefits to existing customers. Chris, I'll now turn the call back over to you.\nChris Womack: Thanks, Dan. Southern Company remains focused on execution, and we're excited about the future. We believe we are well-positioned to capture the value of this significant electricity demand for the benefits of all stakeholders. Our orderly and proven processes for engaging with prospective customers and for addressing resource needs with our regulators, differentiates Southern Company from our peers and helps mitigate risk for our customers and our investors. Additionally, prospective electric customers are increasingly recognizing the value of our institutional experience and wherewithal, the value of the great states we operate in, and the value of the vertically-integrated regulated utility model. Before taking your questions this afternoon, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the hundreds of team members from Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power who recently returned home, after aiding in power restorations in Texas following the devastation caused by Hurricane Beryl. These teams and others from across our industry worked tirelessly to bring relief to affected communities, and their performance throughout the successful restoration effort stands as a testament that our employees are at their very best when conditions are at their worst. Let me conclude by saying, we have delivered very strong operational and financial results for the first half of this year. We will remain focused on continuing to execute on our plan, and we believe that we are extraordinarily well positioned to deliver the superior performance that you expect from us for the remainder of the year. Operator, we're now ready to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs.\nCarly Davenport: Maybe just to start on the quarter itself, I guess just with the significant beat relative to your initial $0.90 guidance, sort of how are you thinking about the puts and takes around the full year guidance and your execution there at this point?\nA – Dan Tucker: Look, we're always very cautious. While we're halfway through the year, there's a lot of year left to go. And in particular, with our electric utilities being in the Southeast, the summer is a pretty big period from a revenue perspective. So we've typically kind of hone in on a more specific expectation after our third quarter call. That said, to your point, we are incredibly well-positioned. We're off to a great start. And what we also have a history of doing is really taking that kind of opportunity and doing anything and everything that we can to not only deliver on the current year, but use that as an opportunity to improve our positioning for future years. So that might look like advancing maintenance work out of future years into 2024 or getting ahead on other programs or reliability reserves. We have the opportunity to kind of optimize in some of our states. And so with how we're positioned, we're working hard to do all those things, focus on this year, but focus on the long term. But, you know, all that to say, given how we started, if we, you know, don't end up in the top half of our range, I think Chris and I would be disciplined.\nChris Womack: But I think, Dan, I think as we say internally a lot, when we have the opportunity to fix the roof while the sun is shining, and so thinking about '24 and '25 and '26, those are some things we'll consider as we continue to move forward through this year.\nCarly Davenport: Great. Appreciate that color. And then the follow-up, just would love to get your perspectives on nuclear as it continues to gain focus here. I guess, what do you think the industry needs to do to support the build out of new large scale nuclear? And as you think about the 2025 Georgia IRP filing, is there any potential to see nuclear play a role there?\nChris Womack: Carly, I mean, I think the industry has got to continue to do all the planning, all the reviews, working with industries to look at what all the possibilities may be. I think to ultimately get that build out and get the momentum, we've got to have incredible leadership from the government, to make this a reality. We know there are risks, and I think we all must find ways, and I think support from the government can help mitigate some of that risk. So I think that is the critical element in terms of really gaining the momentum to build on what we got done by completing both units 3 and 4. I think it's got to be a part of the future. It's got be a part of the mix. We've got have diverse resources to meet this demand we see going forward, and nuclear's got a play a very prominent part in that role. But I think there's got be and needs to be great leadership from the government to really kind of help build the momentum that I that we need to see. I mean, I'll leave it at that.\nOperator: Our next question is from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.\nShar Pourreza: Excellent. So, Dan, I can maybe a quick one for Dan. Dan, I can totally appreciate the conservativeness and sort of how you're messaging around this year. But like obviously like we are seeing much stronger the reality of your sort of your footprint is much stronger than kind of your planning assumptions. Right? And I know you've talked about in the past that maybe you can provide an update in the fourth quarter or potentially EEI timeframe of what all this kind of means to your longer range guidance. I guess what other trigger points are you looking for outside of sustainability around this load backdrop to really revisit how you guys think about a longer range plan?\nA – Dan Tucker: I think it does. I know you said besides sustainability, but it really is rooted in that notion of continued momentum. Look, I think we feel good about what we know and see right in front of us, and that's a large part of what we addressed in this recent Georgia proceeding. We've got the 2025 IRP ahead of us, that will provide an opportunity to kind of further button up the latter part of the decade and into the next decade. For again, what we kind of know sitting here today, the opportunity and it certainly feels like there is continued increased momentum. The opportunity is that, assuming that continues, there will inevitably be more capital investment needed to serve continued load growth, whether that's in the form of new generation resources, certainly transmission improvements around the system. But the thing I want to balance all of that with and I think we've continued to say this, this is really a later in the decade phenomenon. This is not a '25 thing. This is starting to bleed into '26. But because of the long term nature of these capital investments, because of the long-term nature of building out these data centers, it this is an opportunity that sustains beyond the current forecast period, the kind of financial profile and strength that we see.\nShar Pourreza: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. Maybe just, Chris, on your end, I know, obviously, we've got a Georgia GRC coming. It's going to come sooner than we think. There's been some noise around sort of ROEs and equity ratios maybe being overly adequate now that Vogtle is online from just some of the commissioners. Can you maybe just talk this through a bit? Is this going to be an issue as you prep for the case? Have you begun discussions kind of with stakeholders ahead of this filing?\nChris Womack: I mean, there's always conversations about those matters as we go through those proceedings. And so I would not be surprised. I mean, we always have good deliberations about those issues in terms of where we are and recognizing the level of service that we provide and the premium nature of how we run this business. I mean, equity ratio also came from a tax reform issue, not just from Vogtle. I mean, so there are a lot of implications. And so, as usual, I mean, as we go through '25, all of these issues, I think, will be thoroughly vetted and thoroughly, debated, recognized. And also, once again, as I said, recognizing how we perform as a company.\nA – Dan Tucker: The equity ratio kind of changes were broad based. This is not just a Georgia conversation. It was in all of our states and Chris made the point, that was for tax reform. It was coincidentally during the construction of Vogtle, but had nothing to do with Vogtle construction itself. Unless there's some major change to the tax policy that has implications, I think defending that is where we will start from.\nOperator: Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Look, speaking of having the sunshine, I think you guys have starting the year off pretty well. It's nice to see. Maybe to turn that into a specific question. You've got this $1.30 out there. Just to kick it off, you've probably seen some continuation of that good weather from 2Q into 3Q. Is that already reflected in that $1.30 or is there some more upside there? Because you already had $0.10 versus normal in the second quarter?\nA – Dan Tucker: What we would typically do, Julian, and what we've certainly done in this case is put out a quarterly estimate that is weather normal. There's always still at least 2 months left in the quarter when we put these out and just anecdotally, I would say, I think this is the first day in about 3 weeks that it hasn't rained here in Atlanta. So I'm not so sure that July has looked like June too.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: It sounds like Texas as far as rig go. Anyway, just to keep going on that. In terms of the backdrop of the loan growth here, I just want to make sure I'm hearing because clearly on this, right? The 17% is phenomenal on the data center load growth, how do you think about that number in terms of the medium and longer term? And you've obviously provided some very healthy longer-term loan growth numbers. Should we expect that to continue to compound kind of consistently through the period here or to what extent actually could we see an acceleration of that number here? I mean there's a lot of talk about building infrastructure, but you guys are realizing it in a much more tangible way than perhaps some of your peers.\nA – Dan Tucker: Great question. So let me just kind of clarify the dynamics that are happening. That 17% that we referred to is existing data centers that are on the ground have been on the ground and they're either in the process of ramping to their full load or, in some cases, what we believe is also happening as some of these are actually improving the technology in the data centers with not only increasing processing capabilities, but that's also utilizing a little bit more electricity in the process. What will happen going forward, while this dynamic will be there, this is a small component of our overall commercial sales today? The -- everything we've been talking about in terms of what drives that 6% sales growth from '25 to '28, 9% at Georgia Power. Those are new data centers. And so it will be a significant acceleration that begins to happen in the '26, '27, '28 time frame and beyond, as these data centers are completed and they too will have their own ramp-ups to the point where overall commercial sales growth implicit in that 6% will be in the double-digits.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. But the point is all 17% looks phenomenal you just think that acceleration is obviously accentuated in '26. And we can see continued ramping of the existing base in '25.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Arcaro: Great commentary here just on the load growth that you're seeing in data center commentary. Are you tracking ahead of that 6% assumption? I feel like things are pretty fluid and moving quickly. Are there indications that it could be stronger from here?\nA – Dan Tucker: I think given how the pipeline is evolving, there are indications the long term could certainly be stronger. So again, we're talking into the decade into the 2030s, the way that is building the momentum is very promising. In terms of the very near term, Dave, like the 17% we were just talking about, even if that swung a little bit. It's such a small piece today, it's not going to have a meaningful impact on kind of current results. It really is about the capital being deployed in the big hyperscale data centers that are due to be online a little bit here in a few years.\nDavid Arcaro: Yes. Got it. That makes sense. And I was thinking about the load growth overall. And let's see, the other -- the other item I just wanted to check on, there was a valve issue at Vogtle 3 recently. Just wondering if you had any feedback on that kind of the extent of that issue? And anything else to watch for there.\nChris Womack: Yes. No, they worked through that issue and the unit is now back online and Vogtle 3 has operated more than 98% is capacity factor over the period. So those things will happen, with new units, but we're very pleased with the performance of Vogtle 3 and Vogtle 4.\nOperator: Our next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.\nSteve Fleishman: Chris. First, just wanted to clarify on the data center. So I think on the Q1 call, you gave a number of pipeline of 21 gigawatts firm commitment of 6.2 gigawatts by the mid-2030s. Does that sound right? What are those numbers now?\nA – Dan Tucker: Sure. And so I'm going to even take it a little bit further back to you because I think the progression here is important. So you mentioned the 21 gigawatts that was where we were as of our last call, and that's compared to 17 gigawatts back when we originally filed the 2023 IRP update at Georgia Power. So it had grown 4,000 gigawatts -- as we sit here today, that 21 gigawatts is 24.3 gigawatts in terms of the total pipeline. You mentioned the commitments. The commitments were a significant change from the original filing last quarter. So it went from 3.6 gigawatts to 6.2 gigawatts. And then from the last earnings call to today, that 6.2 gigawatts is now 7.3 gigawatts.\nSteve Fleishman: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then a totally separate question. The -- on Kinder Morgan's call, they mentioned expanding the SONAT system with $3 billion, I think, growth investment and kind of, I think, implied that you would represent half of it? And could you just talk to your thoughts on that and likelihood you'll do that?\nA – Dan Tucker: Yes. Look, it's really early for that. So yes, we're a 50% partner on Southern Natural. There is a project that is proposed that total capital is $3 billion. Our share would be $1.5 billion. It's just really early days. You know how these projects evolve. Look, we're very encouraged by it. It’s 90-plus percent, I believe, brownfield, existing rights of way, a tremendous opportunity there. We will kind of at the right time down the road once this thing has solidified a little bit more, there's some traction from a FERC perspective, in terms of approval kind of reflect that more in our outlook. But that's still -- all that said, it's an encouraging opportunity.\nChris Womack: Steve, the only thing I would add, I think Dan said it, but it's just very early on in that process. I think there's a great deal of diligence to be done. But I think at this point in time, I think the thing to note is that's just very early on in that consideration.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And last question --\nA – Dan Tucker: Going to say just policy wise, I mean we're excited about it. To the extent that we can get this done, it's important for everything else is happening, right? To the extent that all this large load is down the road has the opportunity to be served with more gas capacity like this is really important. And so we're super supportive.\nChris Womack: Yes, Steven, let me add 1 more thing on that. I mean -- and we talk a lot about the importance of this country, building infrastructure. So these kind of things need to happen to support this economy going forward. But for us, it's just very early on, but it's somethings that this country must embrace and must move forward on.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. One last question, just going back to my first topic on data centers. Can you just remind me what -- how you define firm commitments relative to pipeline for data centers?\nA – Dan Tucker: Yes. So the commitment we're characterizing is essentially signed request for service within our service territory. It's a commitment by the customer to be at a particular level to commitment by us to provide the service -- and then a lot of these commitments have kind of further papering, if you will, that goes beyond those kind of key elements where it's commitments for local infrastructure, commitments around pricing, commitments around the ramp so there's clearly different stages here. I think, importantly, because we argue with ourselves what is the right nomenclature for this, what's the right word to really characterize this because commitment sounds like something that's completely fixed and unreversible. The reality is we have these commitments. These requests for services and over time, there's puts and takes. And in fact, in the numbers I shared with you a few minutes ago, Steve, there were puts and takes in there. But net-net, the megawatts are still going up.\nChris Womack: And Steve, last earnings call, we went through this, I guess, process, this orderly process that we go through internal in terms of confirming that this load is, in fact, real. And so if you look -- remember some of that, I mean, that's kind of the discipline in which we look at these projects to make sure they are real that they've demonstrated a commitment to the state that they've selected our utility companies. I mean a very orderly and disciplined process that we go through because actually, we've been in the second development business for a very, very long time. I mean we're in the market each and every day engaging with customers. But we know how this plays out. We know how it works and so for us as well as for them, it's important to understand what's real in terms of -- and what it means to have a commitment. So we spend a lot of time working on this.\nA – Dan Tucker: And so importantly, I'll just last thing, Steve, I'll just to clarify, commitment for us does not mean it's in our forecast. There's further risk adjustment from there. There's -- we know that things will get delayed. We know that the actual peak load alluded to may not show up to that extent, but there'll be load, but not that much. So we're risk adjusting beyond this commitment level to be conservative but also as pragmatic as we can with the forecast.\nSteve Fleishman: And then lastly, the 9% Georgia Power growth rate, that was based off of the initial numbers that you gave at the end of '23 for when you had the filing.\nA – Dan Tucker: Yes, there is potential for those to evolve, and I think that's what we will -- we will see where we are at the time of the 2025 IRP filing.\nOperator: Our next question is from Nick Campanella with Barclays.\nNick Campanella: Hey, a lot of questions have been answered, but I guess just I know that there's been potential for DOE loans to enter the portfolio and hopefully, that's coming up soon. But just can you just remind us how that could affect your overall financing plans and what could maybe be on the table, if anything?\nA – Dan Tucker: Sure. Nick, happy to. So look, there's -- we believe -- and the DOE in the details as we work through this process with the DOE loan office, there could be big round numbers, eligible capital in the range of $15 billion to $20 billion over the next, I don't know, 7 to 8 years or so that could qualify for this. And the program allows that qualified capital to be financed up to 80% of the qualifying amount. So that's a significant amount of debt financing that could be done through a very low-cost source relative to the capital markets. Implication of that is a potential tremendous benefit to customers over time, not unlike what we had with Vogtle 3 and 4 in terms of the loan program there. Again, this program could potentially be 3x, 4x the size of the Vogtle 3 and 4 program, which created tremendous savings for customers.\nNick Campanella: I appreciate that. And maybe just one conceptual question here, just -- we've heard about economic development on your call on all of your peers' calls this earnings season, the tailwinds continue to be very strong. I can't help but notice that some economic and industrial indicators are now starting to roll. ISM indicators this morning were at their lowest since the pandemic. And I guess my question is, just what's differentiating your service territory, you think? On the economic development side? And then is this just all kind of chalking up to maybe you guys being conservative in this 5% to 7% outlook and waiting for it to come.\nChris Womack: No, and we talked about it earlier on this call about the reliability and the performance of our company, the cost of living in the territory, the transportation hubs and access and resources that we have here, the kind of business climate, Alabama was recently recognized by CNBC as a top state to do business in. And so great advancements there. So I think a collection of things that occurring across the southeastern territory has really made -- has been attractive for a long period of time and continues to make this part of the country very attractive. And so I think we have a lot of good things going forward. And so we're kind of excited about where we are. And it shows up in the pipeline of business in the projects that are currently in the queue in all of our states -- all of our Southeastern states. So I think it speaks well for the characteristics of our states and where we are. And also, I think our vertically integrated model also supports kind of -- this is a good place to come and do business.\nOperator: Our next question is from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.\nDurgesh Chopra: Just then, as we think about your forward-looking guidance and your 2024 base, you've obviously started the year phenomenal year-to-date materially above the plan, but there are some one-timers in there like weather. So as we think about our models and '26, '27 EPS estimates and beyond, -- are you -- when you rebate whenever you provide this guidance at Q4, are you going to exclude these onetime benefits in 2024? I'm just trying to think of what should be the base of the new 5% to 7%, if you will.\nA – Dan Tucker: The base for the 5% to 7% is the current guidance in 2024, $3.95 to $4.05. The way to think about -- so you mentioned weather as an example, Durgesh, you heard us describe kind of the notion of fixing the roof while the sun is shining, advancing maintenance out of future years in this year. If you look back over the course of time at our O&M spend, while on average, it's probably flattish to down over time. Year-to-year, it's more of a sign wave, because again, what we're doing is managing the short term, taking advantage of opportunities like warmer-than-normal summers colder than normal winters, such that in other years, where we have milder weather, 2023 being a great example, we have the flexibility to spend less. And so we're managing to a regular predictable kind of sustainable results year-in and year-out despite what might be characterized as 1x things.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. Okay. So basically, and then just one quick follow-up on credit metrics and FFO to debt. I think this year, in -- this is from the Q1 call, I believe, but you were kind of trending towards 14% by the end of this year and then 16% to 17% by the end of the planning period in 2028. How does that outlook get strengthened here given the year-to-date outperformance as we think about the end of 2024?\nA – Dan Tucker: I think we are where we were. You heard Chris and I allude to maybe being disappointed if we're not in the top half of the range. So maybe there's some incremental benefit for 2024. But I think in terms of the trajectory we're on, we are exactly where we were and how you described it.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: Just wanted to come back to the SONAT expansion, if I could, in the open season. I was just wondering if you're able to share any color on shipper interest there and whether that was a larger Southern or there was others that came in with good demand there.\nChris Womack: I think it's very premature. I mean we have no insight or perspective on that at this time. It's just very early in the process.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Fair enough. And then -- just wondering, as you sit back today, how you think about the current business mix in additional exposure as the electric backdrop is changing for load growth. Is there any rotation of assets that you might be interested in here?\nA – Dan Tucker: Yes. I don't think we're there. I mean we love the portfolio we have. We've done a lot of work over the years to kind of hone it to the portfolio it is today. We've got great electric and gas jurisdictions at large. We've got great complements with Southern Power. So no, there's certainly no designs on anything like that as we sit here today.\nOperator: And our next question is from Travis Miller with Morningstar Inc.\nTravis Miller: Back to the data center conversation. As you go through those numbers and you talked about risk adjusting and all of that, what are the regulatory hurdles, the state regulatory hurdles that you face in terms of thinking about that risk adjustment and some of those numbers actually coming to fruition?\nChris Womack: Once the Travis, as we go back to a pretty detailed conversation we had on our last call, it's also going to the commissions to confirm the reality of the projects, understanding what the risks are, understanding the pricing that needs to take place that make sure that we are working with these customers to really fully load, understand what the incremental costs are and their marginal costs are and how we price that. So that we also -- when we do this, we're providing benefits to the rest of the customers in terms of what sometimes we refer to as downward pressure. So just as we work to confirm reality and commitments, but also then do risk adjusting, having that same kind of process and conversation with the regulatory jurisdictions in terms of understanding the reality and then understanding the financial and pricing implications. And so 1 thing that I feel really good about is this kind of orderly process that we have to work through this with the commissions, but also the ability to work through this with their respective customers. So I just feel real good about kind of our process to give order to sometimes what looks like a lot of chaos in this marketplace. I think we have the experience, we have the wherewithal, we have these constructive regulatory environments, and we have the framework to do this, I think, in a way that makes sure that is orderly and disciplined and provides benefits to all stakeholders.\nTravis Miller: Sure, sure. And do each of those contracts need official regulatory sign-off? Or can you negotiate those without regulatory sign-off state regulatory?\nChris Womack: Yes, we can negotiate that without regulatory approval.\nTravis Miller: Okay. Very good. And then real quick, what's the long-term planning process timing in Alabama and Mississippi in terms of when we might get more information on data center load or total C&I load growth there.\nChris Womack: You'll see those conversations, I think, on a regular basis annually. I mean, it's a little different than what happens in Georgia. But the -- as we look at their plans and look at the issues and needs that show up, I mean they'll take that to the commissions for first certification.\nOperator: And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks?\nChris Womack: Again, thanks, everybody, for taking time to be with us. We feel good about where we are as a company and how we're performing and executing and we're incredibly excited about the future. Thanks for being with us today and be safe.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes The Southern Company's second quarter 2024 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Chris Womack",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted earnings results for the second quarter, meaningfully ahead of the estimate provided last quarter. We believe we are well-positioned to achieve our financial objectives for 2024. All our businesses, electric and gas, are performing well, and we continue to see both economic resilience and economic growth, especially within our southeast service territories. During the most recent heat wave across the southeast, our dedicated employees, supported by our coordinated planning, ensured our electric system delivered outstanding reliability and resiliency for the customers and communities that we are privileged to serve. Last quarter represented the warmest second quarter in the last 38 years, with a peak electric load of over 38,000 megawatts, the third highest June peak electric load on record for the Southern Company system. We take tremendous pride in our ability to reliably serve our customers through all operating conditions. Our performance continues to highlight the value of the integrated regulated framework in which we operate. Coordinating planning for generation and transmission as well as our robust portfolio of natural gas transportation, capacity, and storage have positioned us to effectively manage peak demand needs. This same framework, including our orderly internal and external regulatory processes for long term demand planning and resource decisions, is what also positions us so well to reliably serve the significant electric load growth projected over the next decade, an opportunity we're excited about. Dan, I'll now turn the call over to you for a financial update. Thanks, Dan. Southern Company remains focused on execution, and we're excited about the future. We believe we are well-positioned to capture the value of this significant electricity demand for the benefits of all stakeholders. Our orderly and proven processes for engaging with prospective customers and for addressing resource needs with our regulators, differentiates Southern Company from our peers and helps mitigate risk for our customers and our investors. Additionally, prospective electric customers are increasingly recognizing the value of our institutional experience and wherewithal, the value of the great states we operate in, and the value of the vertically-integrated regulated utility model. Before taking your questions this afternoon, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the hundreds of team members from Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power who recently returned home, after aiding in power restorations in Texas following the devastation caused by Hurricane Beryl. These teams and others from across our industry worked tirelessly to bring relief to affected communities, and their performance throughout the successful restoration effort stands as a testament that our employees are at their very best when conditions are at their worst. Let me conclude by saying, we have delivered very strong operational and financial results for the first half of this year. We will remain focused on continuing to execute on our plan, and we believe that we are extraordinarily well positioned to deliver the superior performance that you expect from us for the remainder of the year. Operator, we're now ready to take your questions. But I think, Dan, I think as we say internally a lot, when we have the opportunity to fix the roof while the sun is shining, and so thinking about '24 and '25 and '26, those are some things we'll consider as we continue to move forward through this year. Carly, I mean, I think the industry has got to continue to do all the planning, all the reviews, working with industries to look at what all the possibilities may be. I think to ultimately get that build out and get the momentum, we've got to have incredible leadership from the government, to make this a reality. We know there are risks, and I think we all must find ways, and I think support from the government can help mitigate some of that risk. So I think that is the critical element in terms of really gaining the momentum to build on what we got done by completing both units 3 and 4. I think it's got to be a part of the future. It's got be a part of the mix. We've got have diverse resources to meet this demand we see going forward, and nuclear's got a play a very prominent part in that role. But I think there's got be and needs to be great leadership from the government to really kind of help build the momentum that I that we need to see. I mean, I'll leave it at that. I mean, there's always conversations about those matters as we go through those proceedings. And so I would not be surprised. I mean, we always have good deliberations about those issues in terms of where we are and recognizing the level of service that we provide and the premium nature of how we run this business. I mean, equity ratio also came from a tax reform issue, not just from Vogtle. I mean, so there are a lot of implications. And so, as usual, I mean, as we go through '25, all of these issues, I think, will be thoroughly vetted and thoroughly, debated, recognized. And also, once again, as I said, recognizing how we perform as a company.\nA – Dan Tucker: The equity ratio kind of changes were broad based. This is not just a Georgia conversation. It was in all of our states and Chris made the point, that was for tax reform. It was coincidentally during the construction of Vogtle, but had nothing to do with Vogtle construction itself. Unless there's some major change to the tax policy that has implications, I think defending that is where we will start from. Yes. No, they worked through that issue and the unit is now back online and Vogtle 3 has operated more than 98% is capacity factor over the period. So those things will happen, with new units, but we're very pleased with the performance of Vogtle 3 and Vogtle 4. Steve, the only thing I would add, I think Dan said it, but it's just very early on in that process. I think there's a great deal of diligence to be done. But I think at this point in time, I think the thing to note is that's just very early on in that consideration. Yes, Steven, let me add 1 more thing on that. I mean -- and we talk a lot about the importance of this country, building infrastructure. So these kind of things need to happen to support this economy going forward. But for us, it's just very early on, but it's somethings that this country must embrace and must move forward on. And Steve, last earnings call, we went through this, I guess, process, this orderly process that we go through internal in terms of confirming that this load is, in fact, real. And so if you look -- remember some of that, I mean, that's kind of the discipline in which we look at these projects to make sure they are real that they've demonstrated a commitment to the state that they've selected our utility companies. I mean a very orderly and disciplined process that we go through because actually, we've been in the second development business for a very, very long time. I mean we're in the market each and every day engaging with customers. But we know how this plays out. We know how it works and so for us as well as for them, it's important to understand what's real in terms of -- and what it means to have a commitment. So we spend a lot of time working on this.\nA – Dan Tucker: And so importantly, I'll just last thing, Steve, I'll just to clarify, commitment for us does not mean it's in our forecast. There's further risk adjustment from there. There's -- we know that things will get delayed. We know that the actual peak load alluded to may not show up to that extent, but there'll be load, but not that much. So we're risk adjusting beyond this commitment level to be conservative but also as pragmatic as we can with the forecast. No, and we talked about it earlier on this call about the reliability and the performance of our company, the cost of living in the territory, the transportation hubs and access and resources that we have here, the kind of business climate, Alabama was recently recognized by CNBC as a top state to do business in. And so great advancements there. So I think a collection of things that occurring across the southeastern territory has really made -- has been attractive for a long period of time and continues to make this part of the country very attractive. And so I think we have a lot of good things going forward. And so we're kind of excited about where we are.

            "name": "Dan Tucker",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. For the second quarter of 2024, our adjusted earnings per share was $1.10 per share, $0.31 higher than the second quarter of 2023 and $0.20 above our estimate. The primary drivers of our performance for the quarter compared to last year were continued investment in our state regulated utilities and warmer than normal weather for our electric subsidiaries. This was somewhat offset by higher interest and depreciation expenses. A complete reconciliation of year-over-year earnings is included in the materials we released this morning. Our adjusted EPS estimate for the third quarter is $1.30 per share. As Chris noted, all of our businesses experienced a strong second quarter leading to adjusted financial results meaningfully higher than our estimate of $0.90 per share. The warmer than normal weather in the Q2 contributed to these results as well as our continued focus on managing operating costs. Additionally, during the second quarter, we experienced higher than expected weather adjusted electricity sales in our commercial customer class. These higher sales were driven by a combination of continued strength in our local economies as well as increased usage by many of our existing data center customers. In fact, sales to existing data centers for the quarter were up approximately 17% year-over-year. The strong Southeast economy, including favorable business climates and expansions in manufacturing, continues to drive net in migration and customer growth. For the second quarter, we saw residential customer additions of 14,000 in our electric businesses and 6,000 in our natural gas distribution businesses. We also continue to see strong economic development activity across our electric service territories. The aggregate pipeline for potential new industrial and commercial customers across our 3 state electric utility footprint includes nearly 200 projects and over 30 gigawatts of potential load over the next decade or so. While it's likely these numbers include some degree of duplication as in potential projects as some prospective customers are evaluating multiple states that we serve for their facilities, these numbers are significantly higher than what we've seen historically. About 40% of the projects in the pipeline and 80% of the potential electric load are data centers. In addition to data centers, clean energy and transportation manufacturing, port related businesses and other heavy industries continue to be attracted to our states due to reliable energy, a diverse workforce, robust transportation networks and a low cost of living, all compelling reasons to locate or expand in our Southeastern states. The potential load growth in this pipeline that is reflected in our forecast is currently only a fraction of this full potential. As a reminder, during our year-end earnings call in February, we updated our forecast to reflect projected retail electric sales growth that is expected to accelerate in the latter part of this decade with a projected growth rate of approximately 6% from 2025 to 2028. The underlying Georgia Power projected sales growth is approximately 9% over the same period. In response to this growth, Georgia Power filed and the Georgia Public Service Commission subsequently approved earlier this year its 2023 Integrated Resource Plan Update. Since the time of the original filing last year, Georgia Power's pipeline of potential large load additions by the mid-2030 has grown approximately 40%, and the amount of committed peak demand at the same time frame has more than doubled, now totaling over 7 gigawatts. As we described in detail on our last earnings call, we continue to execute on our disciplined approach to attracting, serving, pricing and forecasting this potential incremental electric load, and we continue to expect that our disciplined approach to pricing this new load should result in revenues that not only cover the incremental cost to serve these new customers, but also provides economic benefits to existing customers. Chris, I'll now turn the call back over to you."

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Southern Company First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.\n [Operator Instructions]\n As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir. \nScott Gammill: Thank you Rob. Good afternoon, and welcome to Southern Company's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Chris Womack, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Dan Tucker, Chief Financial Officer.\n Let me remind you we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and subsequent filings.\n In addition, we'll present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com.\n At this time, I'll turn the call over to Chris Womack. \nChristopher Womack: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for what is such an exciting time for our company. Monday, we announced that Plant Vogtle Unit 4 successfully achieved commercial operation. Units 3 and 4 now deliver more than 2,200 megawatts of reliable 24/7 carbon-free energy and are designed to do so for decades to come. With all 4 units operational, the Vogtle site is now the largest generator of clean energy in the country.\n I cannot be prouder of our team's press severance and commitment to getting Vogtle Units 3 and 4 completed with the standard of quality clearly demonstrated by Unit 3's performance since it reached in service last July. Along with our own team, success on this historic project required the hard work and dedication of tens of thousands of American craft workers and engineers, a committed group of co-owners and regulators who had the courage to support new nuclear when others did not.\n While it was not our mission when we embarked on this project and while it was at times an arduous journey. We have proven that new nuclear is achievable in the United States. With ever-increasing demands for carbon-free energy and the burgeoning demand for reliable 24/7 Energy to support our digital economy and society, we believe our country will need more nuclear energy.\n So the importance of this project for Georgia and our nation cannot be understated. This is what making history looks like. These are the first new nuclear units built from the ground up here in the United States in over 30 years. And we are proud to be the company that saw it through.\n Dan I'll now turn the call over to you for a financial update. \nDaniel Tucker: Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. For the first quarter of 2024, our adjusted EPS was $1.03 per share $0.24 higher than the first quarter of 2023 and $0.13 above our estimate. The primary drivers of our performance for the quarter compared to last year were investments in our state-regulated utilities and weather that was less mild for our electric utilities than in the first quarter of 2023.\n This is somewhat offset by higher interest expense and depreciation. A complete reconciliation of our year-over-year earnings is included in the materials we released this morning. All our businesses experienced a strong start for 2024, driving our results meaningfully higher than our estimate of $0.90 per share.\n While there were several factors for this performance versus our estimate, one worth highlighting is the higher than expected weather-adjusted electricity sales in our commercial customer class. This was driven by a combination of our strong local economies as well as increased usage by many of our existing data center customers. Sales to data centers were up over 12% for the quarter compared to last year.\n Overall, weather-normal retail electric sales to all classes were 1.7% higher than the first quarter of 2023. Industrial sales are beginning to show signs of recovery following a soft 2023 with year-to-date increases led by the lumber and paper industries. The Southeast regional labor supply remains above pre-pandemic levels. Employment growth is strong and unemployment is low, averaging approximately 3% across our regulated electric jurisdictions. A favorable business climate and increased expansion of manufacturing is attracting new households to the Southeast, driving continued net in-migration and customer growth.\n Before turning the call back over to Chris, I'd like to highlight our most recent dividend increase. Last week, the Southern Company Board of Directors approved an $0.08 per share increase in our annual common dividend raising the annualized rate to $2.88 per share. This action marks the 23rd consecutive increase, and this will now be 77 consecutive years dating all the way back to 1948, that Southern Company has paid a dividend that is equal to or greater than the previous year.\n This remarkable track record remains an important part of Southern Company's value proposition. In one quick note, our adjusted EPS estimate for the second quarter is $0.90 per share.\n Chris, I'll turn the call back over to you. \nChristopher Womack: Thank you Dan. Our system performed extremely well, and that's a testament to our team's collective commitment to serving customers reliably across our business, especially as we meet the demands of the extraordinary growth that we're seeing. Particularly within our Southeast footprint, we continue to see strong economic development activity with first quarter investment announcements representing the second highest first quarter on record as our teams continue to work closely with our states and local development authorities to attract new businesses.\n This growth continues to reflect a diverse mix of sectors with recent announcements, including automotive suppliers, flooring and glass manufacturers, data centers and mixed-use developments. During our year-end earnings call in February, we updated our forecast to reflect projected retail electric sales growth that is accelerating to a projected growth rate of approximately 6% from 2025 to 2028.\n The underlying Georgia Power projected sales growth rate is approximately 9% over the same period. As we look ahead, we're encouraged to see the signs of incremental growth also materializing in Alabama and Mississippi.\n A little more in 2 weeks ago, the Georgia Public Service Commission approved a stipulated agreement among Georgia Power, the Public Service Commission staff and multiple interveners in the 2023 IRP update docket. This approval affirms the need to quickly procure and deploy several thousand megawatts of resources to serve customers rapidly growing project electricity demands by the winter of 2026 and 2027.\n Georgia Power was also authorized to build and own a balanced collection of resources, including new natural gas combustion turbines and battery energy storage systems while also providing for an accelerated RFP process for incremental battery energy storage systems.\n The constructiveness and timeliness of decisions like this are a testament to the quality of our Southeastern states regulatory environment and our ability to meet the projected rapid demand growth garnering headlines across the country.\n Coinciding with Georgia Power's 2023 IRP update filing last fall, and the release of our sales forecast in February, external attention including from the investment community has focused on several key questions. How do you know the load in your forecast is real? How do you know you're pricing this new load appropriately? And what protections are in place if the forecasted load does not materialize?\n Those are all very important questions, and the answers are all fundamentals of how Southern Company has run our electric utilities for a very, very, very long time. We'll address each one of those questions in just a moment. First, I want to share with you what we believe are the 4 key characteristics required to successfully navigate this tremendous growth opportunity.\n We believe Southern Company is positioned as well or better than any utility company in the country on these four fronts. First, it requires supportive states and constructive regulation. Our states continue to be great economic development partners, and they have advanced economic policies that support healthy growth.\n When it comes to utility regulation, our states are among the best in the country at balancing the needs of customers while helping ensure utilities provide real value to customers in the form of clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy.\n Second, it requires institutional wherewithal. We have vast expertise and experience deploying energy infrastructure. We've been investing billions to improve the resilience of our electric and gas transmission and distribution networks. In recent years across our subsidiaries and across the country, we've built thousands of megawatts of energy supply in the form of new solar, wind and battery facilities, advanced micro grids, a state-of-the-art combined cycle natural gas plant and the only new nuclear units built in this country and more than a generation.\n These new assets along with the existing electric and gas infrastructure we operate have served customers with a superior measure of reliability and resilience. We have the people, we have the experience and we have the scale to be successful.\n The third requirement is a flexible pricing framework. Our electric utilities working with existing customers approved by their respective public service commissions have a history of being able to price new large load projects appropriately even in periods of high demand and challenging market conditions.\n These frameworks are designed to benefit all customers. For example, Georgia Power's real-time pricing rate or RTP, which was pioneered decades ago allows for the flexibility to price individual customers based on their unique low profile and risk characteristics.\n And finally, success in this environment requires experience and discipline, experience understanding utility economics and the true marginal cost to serve new customers. Experience identifying and mitigating the risk inherent and new or expanding large load customers, and experience and competing for new load with an objective of capturing tangible economic benefit for customers and states.\n Our experience, combined with the robust models and tools we employ are partially a product of the competitive economic environment we've navigated in the Southeast for decades. For example, in Georgia, most new large load customers can choose their electricity supplier.\n Over the years, we've been the chosen provider more often than not, however, it's a load we did not win or perhaps did not even choose to compete for that reflects our discipline and experience. By offering prices designed to recover the marginal cost to serve new loads, we seek to protect all other customers and importantly, maintain our credibility with our regulators and state policymakers.\n I'll now turn back to Dan to address those 3 key stakeholder questions pertaining to this extraordinary growth opportunity. \nDaniel Tucker: Chris. So how do we know the load in our forecast is real? The short answer is that we've already incorporated risk adjustments to the forecast. One could argue it's a conservative view. We would say our forecasts are informed by our experience and by our continuous engagement with prospective new and existing customers.\n We've included a visual representation of our process in the slide deck. Typically, our forecast appropriately represents only a portion of the full potential load we might ultimately serve. If a customer has not formally communicated state-specific project details with our company, they're not included in the forecast. If they have a choice of utility provider within the state that they have chosen, which is the case in each of our states, they are either not included or only included at a reduced probability weighted level.\n Importantly, even once a customer has committed to one of our utilities, we further risk adjust the forecast based on the likelihood of delays on the customer side, whether those are construction delays or delays in ramping up production.\n And lastly, we further risk adjust the forecast based on the history of announced loads being higher than actual customer loads. Lower actual customer loads often result from technology improvements, economic conditions or other factors. All of that to say, we believe our forecast is the best representation of expected future demand. And with the potential for additional new customers to choose our states and utilities, there is potential for our forecast to be higher down the road.\n Next, I'll discuss pricing. When it comes to knowing that we're pricing this load appropriately with a view towards protecting existing customers, several of the factors Chris mentioned a moment ago are key. We use our experience and robust tools to ascertain the expected marginal cost to serve each new customer and incorporate that into our flexible pricing mechanisms.\n We priced the load in a manner that helps ensure the marginal cost will be borne by the new customer. Sometimes, as is the case with Georgia Power's recent growth, we're able to provide new large load customers with competitive market pricing that also provides meaningful benefits back to existing customers. These benefits are not only driven by carefully constructed market pricing. They're also a the function of a robust, long-term integrated resource planning process and Georgia Power's ability to use existing resources to serve a large portion of the new demand while only needing to incrementally invest to meet higher peak demands.\n The stipulation the Georgia PSC recently approved includes a commitment by Georgia Power for these customer benefits to be incorporated into the 2025 rate case. Our approach to pricing has never been more important given the current macroeconomic backdrop. Affordability is a key tenet of our customer-centric business model, and we work hard to ensure new customer demands don't place additional burdens on those less able to afford it.\n Lastly, the risk question, what protections are in place for our forecasted load does not materialize? I've already described how we've risk adjusted the forecast itself, the other major risk mitigations pertain to local infrastructure improvements and our portfolio of supply resources.\n These new large load customers often require significant local distribution system improvements, and these improvements often provide limited incremental benefit to other customers. As a result, we require most new large load customers to pay for these improvements upfront, helping ensure other customers are protected.\n When it comes to supply resources, the risk mitigation comes in the form of the diversity of our resources. Purchased resources or PPAs, can expire without being renewed. Older owned resources which might require additional investments or higher maintenance O&M spend to remain available over the long term can be retired earlier.\n Decisions and risk strategies like these are a key aspect of the multiyear integrated resource planning processes in each of our states. With robust long-term planning comes optionality in future decision-making. Said differently, planning for 20 years of resource needs every 3 years helps ensure that customers benefit from a flexible resource plan that is equally focused on reliability and affordability.\n Chris, I'll turn the call back over to you to wrap up our prepared remarks. \nChristopher Womack: Before taking your questions this afternoon, I'd like to first take a moment to reinforce that as we serve these growing energy needs, we also remain focused on achieving our long-term greenhouse gas reduction goals, including net 0 greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\n Working closely with each of our states, and with an unrelenting focus on safely and reliably serving our customers' needs, we continue to make responsible economic resource decisions over the long term. For example, over 80% of the resources additions plan across our system totaling nearly 10,000 megawatts from 2023 to 2030 are 0 carbon emitting resources.\n We have accomplished some wonderful things in recent weeks, and we are even more excited about our future. We have seven quality state-regulated utilities with long track records of outstanding operational and financial performance that deliver over 90% of our earnings, along with a few quality complementary businesses, we believe we have the ideal portfolio to support our long-term objectives.\n Southern Company's value proposition has never been more attractive. Our team has never been stronger, and we are positioned as well as we ever have been. As I said earlier, we have the people, the experience and the scale for sustained long-term success. Thank you, as always, for your interest in Southern Company.\n Robert, we're now ready to take questions. \nOperator: At this time, we'll begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]\n Our first question comes from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. \nCarly Davenport: Good to see the strong sales growth coming in during the quarter. I guess just as we think about the impact to earnings from some of these volumes, are there any sensitivities that you can provide around the commercial load or the data center load specifically there? \nDaniel Tucker: Yes, absolutely. So just big as a bread box. So it's roughly -- if you think about our total sales, kind of the average price, you're talking about $40 million for a 1% change in our overall sales. Now for the vast majority of what's showing up here, whether it's data centers, some of these other large load industrial customers, it may skew slightly below that. So really it's somewhere in the range of $20 million to $40 million for 1% change in sales. \nCarly Davenport: Got it. That's super helpful. And then, just as a follow-up, as you think about the recent commission approvals on the 23 Georgia IRP filing, do you see any incremental capital needed relative to what you previously laid out on the fourth quarter call? \nDaniel Tucker: So there will be some additions based on the approval, Carly, and that largely pertains to the additional storage resources, the battery energy storage system. So if you recall what we included was two very specific projects in our outlook, but the commission actually approved 500 megawatts of owned storage, which is a little more than double what we had assumed.\n And so total dollars is going to -- I'm going to give you a big range. And I'm going to throw in here if you didn't see, we also announced an expansion of one of our solar projects in Southern Power. So that also was not included in our forecast back in February. So all told you're somewhere above $500 million, a little south of $1 billion, probably and what we'll do, we don't want to get too far ahead of the regulatory processes. There's specific certification processes to go through. So we'll let all that play out and then update our forecast more formally later on. \nOperator: Our next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. \nSteven Fleishman: Well, first, congrats on getting Vogtle up and running. That's great. And just -- I know on the last call, you talked to the better sales growth, and you raised the CapEx and now there's a little bit more potential to come, and that kind of your reaffirmed squarely in the 5% to 7%. And I know you're a big company, and obviously, it's a lot to move the needle of 5% to 7%. But just is it fair to say that as you are adding this capital that at least within this range of 5% to 7% or some benefits of adding the capital even net of financing? \nDaniel Tucker: Yes. Look, I think it's fair to characterize that everything that is occurring and particularly if the momentum continues and what we're seeing, I would characterize that as adding an upward bias to where we are from an earnings perspective. And you kind of said it, Steve, and we certainly saw your commentary and your note yesterday. We are a big company. We are issuing equity. But even with all of that, these incremental investments should have an accretive effect. But I think it's just too soon to say exactly what that means, but an upward bias, absolutely exists, particularly if this momentum continues.\n Now does that mean change in growth rate? Probably not. Does it mean maybe that growth rate is off of some higher number later down the road? Probably so. \nChristopher Womack: And Steve, the only thing I'd add is we talked to you before about not just about raising growth rates, but it's about the durability and the length, how we extend the runway is something that we are keenly focused on as we've talked to you many times about. And I think that's clearly an opportunity that we are afforded by this added growth. \nDaniel Tucker: And then the only thing I'd add is also the thing that we are really gratified to see as part of this whole dynamic is a derisking of our outlook. Because of these customer benefits the affordability equation is greatly improved, and that's a good thing for the long-term sustainability of our business. \nChristopher Womack: Steve, the only thing I'd add, I mean, one of the things that we talked about in our prepared remarks, we've talked to you more about how do we use this opportunity to make sure we put downward pressure on rates across our customer classes and making sure that we price this new load in the right way. And I think we've demonstrated our ability to do that and having the resources and tools to do that going forward. So it provides us additional excitement for us as we go forward. \nSteven Fleishman: That's all helpful. And then just a different topic. Just on -- I think as you go back to the last call since then, we've had, I think, a bill on the commissioner status. I don't know if we've had an update on kind of the election court cases, and then there was that bill about bringing back a consumer council there. Just can you update us on all those developments? \nChristopher Womack: Yes, the consumer advocacy group inside the commission, that bill was not passed by the legislature. The legislature did pass a bill that provided what I think is some certainty around the election cycle going forward for the commissioners. There was some confusion chaos and time and schedule got a little short because of the court cases.\n And so as a result, the legislature didn't pass a bill that laid out the order and schedule of elections for commissioners between '25 and '28. And so the thing about that, that I think is very instructive is that the current commission in Georgia will be the commission that will sit to review Georgia Power's '25 IRP as well as Georgia '25 rate case. So there is order and schedule for the commission for the next 2 to 3 years -- out to '28. \nSteven Fleishman: And then just last question going back to the data center update, which was very helpful. Just we're hearing from a lot of other utilities about data center growth that they're seeing. And obviously, you're kind of somewhat at the forefront of that. But just you mentioned in some cases, taking deposits or taking money to kind of lock that in, that the customers can pay upfront. But just how are you trying to assess the risk of some of the customers putting themselves in line in 6 different regions and then in the end, only picking 2 of them and just making sure that you're not on the losing end of that? Or just trying to kind of put that into your assessment of risk. \nDaniel Tucker: Yes, Steve. I think that's what we tried to capture a little bit in what we laid out in the Slide 11 in our deck. It's we're not counting on those that could potentially still be trying to put multiple states or utilities on the hook, really until we have pretty firm line of sight and that bilateral conversation and commitment between them and our utilities, it's really not solidly in there. There may be some degree of risk adjusted or kind of a probability-weighted aspect just because there's so much activity out there. But we feel pretty good about -- I got I hate to use the word, but it's -- I think our forecast is fairly conservative in that regard. \nOperator: Our next question is from Shahr Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. \nShahriar Pourreza: Can you -- just a follow up from Steve's question. Just can you elaborate a little bit on the timing of sort of any guidance update around that \"upside bias\" you just kind of referenced. I guess what's the trigger event, whether you guide to the top end a rebased higher and grow 5% to 7% off of that? I guess I'm just trying to figure out what would move that needle. What's the event? \nDaniel Tucker: Yes. So importantly, Shahr, the way I characterize that is that if we continue to see this momentum, right? So it's certainly not the cards we have today. The cards we have today have greatly improved our overall profile. It's added that durability. It's massively derisked kind of the outlook. But it's going to take continued momentum on this front more investment, more sales growth over the long term.\n And then just in the disciplined way we do -- we're not going to make updates like that kind of intra year, right? I mean to the extent there's an update to be provided, it's going to be in our fourth quarter call, and it's going to have to be with a pretty -- as big a company as we are, a pretty significant needle-moving event within the profile. \nShahriar Pourreza: That's perfect. And then, Chris, maybe just quick one for you. There's been obviously kind of a debate in the industry around the behind the meter and in front of the meter, and language from some of the hyperscalers seem to show a little bit of a preference around self-generation and self-supply with some backup capacity, which can obviously impact some of the demand numbers as we're thinking about things more prospectively, right? Chris what conversations are you having around this as you kind of engage with new customers? \nChristopher Womack: So I'd say we're having a lot of conversations that covering all of those options and all those considerations. I mean, I think as you talk to these hyperscalers data centers, one, they want the power. They want resilience. They want the reliability. Some of them want clean, and they recognize the demand that they're putting on load in certain locations. And so their considerations do they self generate, do they want support from behind the meter.\n So I think you go across the continuum of options reflects kind of the conversations that we are having with them, one, to understand what their needs are, but also to help them understand our business and how we provide service and how we operate as a company. Yes, I mean, we're trying to -- want to serve them as customers. But I think we're also in a period where there's just a lot of instruction and education that's occurring in the marketplace today.\n And so the thing about our company is with all the complementary subsidiaries that we have in this portfolio, we have the opportunity to support them and help them in multiple different ways. So I think that's another aspect of our portfolio. That's pretty exciting as we look at this demand and what's happening in the marketplace today and that we have resources and capabilities to serve them and support them in a number of different ways. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Nick Campanella with Barclays. \nNicholas Campanella: Congrats on Vogtle, really excited stuff. So on the sales growth, you talked about things bubbling up in other jurisdictions just outside of Georgia. And can you just kind of remind us what you're assuming there, what's embedded in the plan versus where the upside of those tickers could go? \nChristopher Womack: I don't think there's anything embedded in the plan. I think we -- it's about announcements and that we see forthcoming. We know I think there was an announcement today in Alabama of a 200-megawatt facility that Meta just announced. And then you saw also some legislation in Mississippi that was providing incentives for data centers and other hyperscalers to come into Mississippi. So we see it coming, but that activity -- those projects have not assumed are not included in the forecast as we talk about it today. \nNicholas Campanella: That's very clear. And then, Dan, I just wrapping in that $500 million to $1 billion figure that you were kind of discussing on the CapEx side. I understand this is outside the plan now and probably not coming to your yearly update. But just -- how do we think about the credit implications? And I know last quarter, I think you said you were 14% to 15% FFO to debt in '24 with a 60 basis point improvement every year thereafter. Is that still the way to kind of think about the uplift here over the next few years? Maybe you could comment on that. \nDaniel Tucker: Yes, absolutely, Nick. That profile we described in the fourth quarter that kind of ramps from that 14% last year up to 17% in the back half of the plan, it's absolutely still the profile to watch as this incremental capital opportunity emerges. What we'll do is issue sufficient equity probably through something like an ATM and through our plans to kind of restore the metrics to where they would have otherwise been without that incremental CapEx.\n And again, kind of going back to Steve's question, yes, even doing that, this incremental CapEx will have an accretive effect. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. \nDurgesh Chopra: So Dan, I was just curious in your commentary, you mentioned 12% growth from data center sales growth. Just can you break that for us? How much of that is new data centers versus is that -- or is it just existing data centers using newer technology? \nDaniel Tucker: So it's about 3/4 existing data centers and then a little bit the other quarter kind of coming from new data centers year-over-year. So we're seeing both. We're seeing a continued ramp-up of new facilities, existing facilities ramping up their usage. \nDurgesh Chopra: Cool. And then just one quick follow-up on the legislative front. I'm not sure if the House Bill 1192 was actually passed and signed into law, and that talks to kind of suspending the, I believe, the sales stack exemption on data centers. Maybe can you just address that? Where does that sit? And what implications, if any, do you see on the data center growth in Georgia? \nChristopher Womack: Yes. I mean I think that I mean, it passed and now sitting on the governor's desk and so waiting to see what happens there. I think one of the things the government wants to do is let economic development activities know that Georgia is still open for business. And so I think that's one of the key factors in consideration that he will pay attention to as he makes a decision on that bill. But right now, I don't know what will happen, but it's there for him to take action on. And so we're waiting just like everybody else to see what happens. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. \nJeremy Tonet: Congratulations on Vogtle Unit 4 there. Just wanted to continue with I guess the topic is your and given the notably higher than expected load growth in earnings, in ongoing data center investment in your service territory, just wondering how you think this impacts future generation mix and specifically coal plant retirement dates given what's happening here? Is there -- could there be deferrals or just any thoughts on that? \nChristopher Womack: I think that's a lot to come. And I'd add one more factor there. It's the new EPA rules, and we saw the suite of announcements that came out of EPA last week, which we are reviewing. And many of the rules we think are in practical in terms of aligning with the kind of demand that we see forthcoming, and also from a technology standpoint, some expectations that they are advocating and putting forward don't align necessarily with the reality.\n So there's a lot of -- I think a lot of issues that are up in the air. At the state level, I think as we look at how we respond to the demand, how we respond to this need, all those considerations must be on the table in terms of new generation, what happens to existing generation. Those all get extended, what happens there?\n All of that has to be on the table, but we also have to factor in what are the potential new rules from the [indiscernible] Protection Agency. So I would say all of that is very subject to for the consideration as we move forward through all the processes that we'll be a part of. \nJeremy Tonet: That makes sense. And how do you think about the feasibility of carbon capture in your territories? \nChristopher Womack: Geologically, yes. I mean there are places down on the coast. The mobile area, some parts of Mississippi, where we have the geology for sequestration. But once again, I think as you look at what is somewhat predicated in some of these roles and the expectations and what the desires are -- is the technology available at a commercial scale to do what they're asking us to do. I think there are a lot of questions there.\n So I think it's -- I go back to these rules, I think they are in practical at this time. And so I think there's more work to be done and more conversations to be had about how they should go forward. But we're still doing the analysis because it's a lot of pages, a lot of work, and then we've got to decide what we do going forward in terms of litigation and whether it's with our stage, whether it's with the other different associations. So there's a lot of work to be done there, a lot more conversations to be had. \nJeremy Tonet: That's very helpful. And one last one, if I could. Just given nuclear ability to offer base load that is very suitable for data center and other demand as such. Just wondering any updated thoughts on the viability of that technology down the road? And how Southern thinks about that? \nChristopher Womack: I mean I can give you my speech if you'd like to hear it. I mean the country is going to need more nuclear. I mean there's clearly no technology better suited to support demands of this increasingly digital economy and society.\n And so I think the federal government has got to step in and provide great leadership to incent companies to move in that direction. I'd also say we're going to celebrate what we've done at Vogtle for a very long time before we give any consideration to any more. But we think others, they have the opportunity and should really look at this country has to look at new nuclear to go forward to meet this growing demand. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho Securities. \nAnthony Crowdell: Yes. I think that last question was asking you about Vogtle 5 and 6, but I'm not sure. But I guess just a quick one. Last month, there was approval overwhelmingly approved the Georgia Public Service Commission, the IRP. But just curious, any commentary on some of the language related to rate increases. And you guys have laid out, especially on the slides, great information on how you're navigating the challenges of adding all this infrastructure, but focus on the customer bill. And just if you could tie that to the language on one of the approved -- during the approval with maybe no more bill increases. \nDaniel Tucker: Yes, Anthony, this is Dan. Look, I think largely, any commentary you heard was simply focused on affordability and ensuring that the benefits that Georgia Power said we're there, end up reflected in customer rates. And that's exactly what the stipulation does is provide that commitment so that when we file the 2025 rate case, one of those moving parts is going to include incorporating those economic benefits for all customers into that calculation. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. \nAgnieszka Storozynski: So first maybe about your -- the Southeast Energy exchange market. So when it was first created, I thought that was a sign that maybe there's some excess power in your neck of boots and then you're trying to distribute it to other parts of the Southeast. Now I'm thinking the other way. But maybe there's a way to move some power into Georgia to actually address the load growth. Again, I'm just clearly fishing for any upside potential associated with this newly created power market? \nChristopher Womack: Angie, I think it is what it is. I mean it was intended to move around the partners and participants of excess capacity. And so that's what it has been doing, I think, has been very successful, but I don't think it signals anything more than that. I mean that simply is it's doing what we intended to do with all the participants. And so we'll continue to utilize that. Now how does it factor into the additional growth? I mean we'll step back and look at it. But it doesn't signal anything more than what we intended to be when we made all the filings and got all the approval. \nDaniel Tucker: Yes. And really just to create a more nimble market for those intermittent resources to make sure that customers, wherever it's needed benefit from that very, very low-cost energy. \nAgnieszka Storozynski: And so on a similar vein here, about Southern Powers. I understand that it's fully contracted for now. And I'm just wondering when do you have some open capacity there, which could potentially benefit from this run up and full with power curves that we're seeing in other markets. That's number one.\n And number 2 is, so when you hear hyperscalers talk about contracting for supply of power, they do talk about net 0, right? So I'm wondering, is there a way for Southern Power to, for example, participate in these negotiations, for example, plug into the Mississippi Power Grid, but address the carbon footprint of that supply with building contract-based solar or some other resources that could basically provide the carbon-free offsets? \nDaniel Tucker: Yes. Look, so I'll start with the second question first. Look, Southern Power is always going to evaluate opportunities to serve load-serving entities, right? And so to the extent those opportunities present themselves in any of our jurisdictions where it makes sense, we'll evaluate that. And you've seen that happen in the past, particularly in Georgia.\n On the first question in terms of the kind of the portfolio, yes, look, it's very highly covered the next 5 years. And -- but if you think about 5 years out, that's the end of the decade, that's when other resource needs begin to emerge. That's when you start seeing utilities around the Southeast, begin to consider the -- how long with their assets be on the ground.\n So I think once you start looking towards the end of the decade and into the 30s, Southern Power will have a lot of opportunity to take advantage of what we're seeing today. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Fremont with Ladenburg. \nPaul Fremont: Congrats on Vogtle, great seeing both units and commercial operations. So great job there. I guess my first question is on HP1192, if the governor were to sign the bill, would that essentially slow down the addition of data centers in the state of Georgia or put you in a relative -- or put your stated at a relative disadvantage to other states? \nChristopher Womack: And Paul, I think it's hard to answer that question, but I would think not, but also I think you have to look at the competitive nature of economic development across states. And where does it put Georgia and then what signal does it send. But also, I think it's about -- it's a big question about resilience and the ability to meet the demands of these customers and not just reliably, but providing them the resilience they expect and the demand.\n But I think it's I think just a straight answer to your question, I think it's probably not, but I think at the same time, it's a competitive nature of economic development by states that I think you have to say what have to evaluate very closely. \nPaul Fremont: And then my other question has to do with sort of the tougher EPA rules. If those ultimately were to be adopted, does that -- do you need to accelerate the time frame for coal plant retirements? \nChristopher Womack: And Paul, that's like we're evaluating those rules as we speak today. And I mean I think there's a lot we've kind of gotten to very quickly on the gas side in terms of capacity factors and the expectations for carbon capture. I mean I think there's more work for us to do in terms of the coal implications. But at first blush, like I said, I think they're in practical and probably yet would make it more difficult to run coal units as well any longer. \nOperator: Our next question is from Ryan Levine with Citi. \nRyan Levine: What time frame or cadence do you expect some of these data center companies that are shopping multiple jurisdictions to make a decision? And then in terms of in development projects, it looks like there was 3 pending construction at the time of the stipulated agreement testimony. Have those pending construction data centers started construction? Or any update you could provide on that? \nDaniel Tucker: I don't know that we have the specific construction updates, Ryan, but I will tell you just in general, this is -- I mean, think of it as a continuous kind of waterfall, right? I mean there are always data centers coming in and exploring and then committing. And so it's just -- it's an ongoing thing. So we've got -- right now, there's 12 under construction that totaled about 2,400 megawatts. \nRyan Levine: So that includes 1 or 2 that are still pending, okay. And then given that the continuous nature to the extent that the momentum were to continue to build, is there a time frame that you may seek to reengage the updated IRP process? Or any kind of framework you might apply to assess when additional resources may need to be get approval for? \nChristopher Womack: I think we said before, Georgia has an RFP in 2025. And so they'll factor in new requests, new demands, new load doing that proceeding. Alabama and Mississippi will do make similar decisions in their processes based on the demands and requests that they receive as well. \nDaniel Tucker: And coming out of this last process, Ryan, there was a part of the stipulation is that Georgia will kind of keep the staff and commission updated a little more -- it's not real time, but on a quarterly basis, kind of leading up to the next formal process that way everyone kind of has line of sight as to what is emerging. \nChristopher Womack: Because it goes back to some of the points we laid out in the prepared remarks. Is this load real? And so I think that quarterly update helps give the commission and the staff the information they need to give confirmation of the reality of this load. \nDaniel Tucker: And that next regular filing is scheduled for next January '25. \nRyan Levine: And then last question for me. In terms of the customer preference for or carbon resources. Any stipulations or any requirements that they're speaking to specifically as they're looking to decide what locations to locate their data centers? \nChristopher Womack: I mean early on, we saw a lot of requests for 24/7 carbon-free of late. We see the request for do you have power. And like I said, we continue to build additional carbon-free resources. And so we'll continue to work with them. But right now, I think there is just a simple desire and request for resources for energy. \nDaniel Tucker: And we're very transparent about our own transition plans. And I think that is an opportunity for them to kind of latch on to transitioning along with us. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Travis Miller with Morningstar. \nTravis Miller: Also congrats on Vogtle and I thought it was a very good choice of words arduous in your prepared remarks. I appreciate that. \nChristopher Womack: We chose that word very carefully. \nTravis Miller: I figured. On the load forecast and specifically even the Georgia IRP, what does that mean for T&D investment? Is there upside there in addition to the generation upside you talked about? \nDaniel Tucker: Yes. And so if you remember, Travis, part of our year-end update on the capital plan, I mean, it totaled $5 billion of increased capital. There was a big piece of that, that was also transmission, and that will continue to be part of the long-term planning discussions we have with our states.\n Absolutely, as we add new resources, transmission considerations have to take place absolutely as our fleet transitions from its current state to its future state, transmission considerations are part of that. So they will clearly be transmission opportunities along the way here. \nChristopher Womack: And I'll also add, there's got to be some additional build-out of gas infrastructure as well. I mean, so there's a lot more infrastructure that's got to be built to support the generation resources to meet this demand. \nTravis Miller: And then can you remind us the Alabama and Mississippi IRP schedules? And then in addition to that, would you expect some similar issues to come up as what came up in Georgia in those states? Or is there something different going on there? \nDaniel Tucker: We don't want to get too far ahead of exactly what it will look like in terms of if there's suddenly this accelerated load. But so the next scheduled processes. We got Mississippi, we'll launch a process and -- or they launched the process in April rather they're going through that now and Alabama will have one next spring 2025. \nOperator: And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks? \nChristopher Womack: I think it's -- let me call by saying this. Understandably, I mean, Vogtle 3 and 4, the journey that we've been through, took a lot of attention from our stakeholders and have met fewer conversations focused on our underlying business and the success of our underlying business.\n The fact is all along, we continue to execute at a very high level across our portfolio and delivered strong results. Reliability and customer service were outstanding. Investments in critical financial structure we made in every jurisdiction. We successfully navigated our regulatory processes and received constructive outcomes.\n Now as we look ahead in what's next, it's this, a continued unrelenting focus on the fundamentals with customers at the center of everything that we do. Serving the growing load we're experiencing is what we were built for and our model is designed to turn that growth into value for all stakeholders, customers and investors alike.\n That is what the employees of Southern companies do. It might sound boring to some, but it's exciting for us. Thank you for spending time with us today. And operator, that's the end of this call. Thank you very much. \nOperator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Southern Company First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect. Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Daniel Tucker",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. For the first quarter of 2024, our adjusted EPS was $1.03 per share $0.24 higher than the first quarter of 2023 and $0.13 above our estimate. The primary drivers of our performance for the quarter compared to last year were investments in our state-regulated utilities and weather that was less mild for our electric utilities than in the first quarter of 2023.\n This is somewhat offset by higher interest expense and depreciation. A complete reconciliation of our year-over-year earnings is included in the materials we released this morning. All our businesses experienced a strong start for 2024, driving our results meaningfully higher than our estimate of $0.90 per share.\n While there were several factors for this performance versus our estimate, one worth highlighting is the higher than expected weather-adjusted electricity sales in our commercial customer class. This was driven by a combination of our strong local economies as well as increased usage by many of our existing data center customers. Sales to data centers were up over 12% for the quarter compared to last year.\n Overall, weather-normal retail electric sales to all classes were 1.7% higher than the first quarter of 2023. Industrial sales are beginning to show signs of recovery following a soft 2023 with year-to-date increases led by the lumber and paper industries. The Southeast regional labor supply remains above pre-pandemic levels. Employment growth is strong and unemployment is low, averaging approximately 3% across our regulated electric jurisdictions. A favorable business climate and increased expansion of manufacturing is attracting new households to the Southeast, driving continued net in-migration and customer growth.\n Before turning the call back over to Chris, I'd like to highlight our most recent dividend increase. Last week, the Southern Company Board of Directors approved an $0.08 per share increase in our annual common dividend raising the annualized rate to $2.88 per share. This action marks the 23rd consecutive increase, and this will now be 77 consecutive years dating all the way back to 1948, that Southern Company has paid a dividend that is equal to or greater than the previous year.\n This remarkable track record remains an important part of Southern Company's value proposition. In one quick note, our adjusted EPS estimate for the second quarter is $0.90 per share.\n Chris, I'll turn the call back over to you. Chris. So how do we know the load in our forecast is real? The short answer is that we've already incorporated risk adjustments to the forecast. One could argue it's a conservative view. We would say our forecasts are informed by our experience and by our continuous engagement with prospective new and existing customers.\n We've included a visual representation of our process in the slide deck. Typically, our forecast appropriately represents only a portion of the full potential load we might ultimately serve. If a customer has not formally communicated state-specific project details with our company, they're not included in the forecast. If they have a choice of utility provider within the state that they have chosen, which is the case in each of our states, they are either not included or only included at a reduced probability weighted level.\n Importantly, even once a customer has committed to one of our utilities, we further risk adjust the forecast based on the likelihood of delays on the customer side, whether those are construction delays or delays in ramping up production.\n And lastly, we further risk adjust the forecast based on the history of announced loads being higher than actual customer loads. Lower actual customer loads often result from technology improvements, economic conditions or other factors. All of that to say, we believe our forecast is the best representation of expected future demand. And with the potential for additional new customers to choose our states and utilities, there is potential for our forecast to be higher down the road.\n Next, I'll discuss pricing. When it comes to knowing that we're pricing this load appropriately with a view towards protecting existing customers, several of the factors Chris mentioned a moment ago are key. We use our experience and robust tools to ascertain the expected marginal cost to serve each new customer and incorporate that into our flexible pricing mechanisms.\n We priced the load in a manner that helps ensure the marginal cost will be borne by the new customer. Sometimes, as is the case with Georgia Power's recent growth, we're able to provide new large load customers with competitive market pricing that also provides meaningful benefits back to existing customers. These benefits are not only driven by carefully constructed market pricing. They're also a the function of a robust, long-term integrated resource planning process and Georgia Power's ability to use existing resources to serve a large portion of the new demand while only needing to incrementally invest to meet higher peak demands.\n The stipulation the Georgia PSC recently approved includes a commitment by Georgia Power for these customer benefits to be incorporated into the 2025 rate case. Our approach to pricing has never been more important given the current macroeconomic backdrop. Affordability is a key tenet of our customer-centric business model, and we work hard to ensure new customer demands don't place additional burdens on those less able to afford it.\n Lastly, the risk question, what protections are in place for our forecasted load does not materialize? I've already described how we've risk adjusted the forecast itself, the other major risk mitigations pertain to local infrastructure improvements and our portfolio of supply resources.\n These new large load customers often require significant local distribution system improvements, and these improvements often provide limited incremental benefit to other customers. As a result, we require most new large load customers to pay for these improvements upfront, helping ensure other customers are protected.\n When it comes to supply resources, the risk mitigation comes in the form of the diversity of our resources. Purchased resources or PPAs, can expire without being renewed. Older owned resources which might require additional investments or higher maintenance O&M spend to remain available over the long term can be retired earlier.\n Decisions and risk strategies like these are a key aspect of the multiyear integrated resource planning processes in each of our states. With robust long-term planning comes optionality in future decision-making. Said differently, planning for 20 years of resource needs every 3 years helps ensure that customers benefit from a flexible resource plan that is equally focused on reliability and affordability.\n Chris, I'll turn the call back over to you to wrap up our prepared remarks. Yes, absolutely. So just big as a bread box. So it's roughly -- if you think about our total sales, kind of the average price, you're talking about $40 million for a 1% change in our overall sales. Now for the vast majority of what's showing up here, whether it's data centers, some of these other large load industrial customers, it may skew slightly below that. So really it's somewhere in the range of $20 million to $40 million for 1% change in sales. So there will be some additions based on the approval, Carly, and that largely pertains to the additional storage resources, the battery energy storage system. So if you recall what we included was two very specific projects in our outlook, but the commission actually approved 500 megawatts of owned storage, which is a little more than double what we had assumed.\n And so total dollars is going to -- I'm going to give you a big range. And I'm going to throw in here if you didn't see, we also announced an expansion of one of our solar projects in Southern Power. So that also was not included in our forecast back in February. So all told you're somewhere above $500 million, a little south of $1 billion, probably and what we'll do, we don't want to get too far ahead of the regulatory processes. There's specific certification processes to go through. So we'll let all that play out and then update our forecast more formally later on. Yes. Look, I think it's fair to characterize that everything that is occurring and particularly if the momentum continues and what we're seeing, I would characterize that as adding an upward bias to where we are from an earnings perspective. And you kind of said it, Steve, and we certainly saw your commentary and your note yesterday. We are a big company. We are issuing equity. But even with all of that, these incremental investments should have an accretive effect. But I think it's just too soon to say exactly what that means, but an upward bias, absolutely exists, particularly if this momentum continues.\n Now does that mean change in growth rate? Probably not. Does it mean maybe that growth rate is off of some higher number later down the road? Probably so. And then the only thing I'd add is also the thing that we are really gratified to see as part of this whole dynamic is a derisking of our outlook. Because of these customer benefits the affordability equation is greatly improved, and that's a good thing for the long-term sustainability of our business. Yes, Steve. I think that's what we tried to capture a little bit in what we laid out in the Slide 11 in our deck. It's we're not counting on those that could potentially still be trying to put multiple states or utilities on the hook, really until we have pretty firm line of sight and that bilateral conversation and commitment between them and our utilities, it's really not solidly in there. There may be some degree of risk adjusted or kind of a probability-weighted aspect just because there's so much activity out there. But we feel pretty good about -- I got I hate to use the word, but it's -- I think our forecast is fairly conservative in that regard. Yes. So importantly, Shahr, the way I characterize that is that if we continue to see this momentum, right? So it's certainly not the cards we have today. The cards we have today have greatly improved our overall profile. It's added that durability. It's massively derisked kind of the outlook. But it's going to take continued momentum on this front more investment, more sales growth over the long term.\n And then just in the disciplined way we do -- we're not going to make updates like that kind of intra year, right? I mean to the extent there's an update to be provided, it's going to be in our fourth quarter call, and it's going to have to be with a pretty -- as big a company as we are, a pretty significant needle-moving event within the profile. Yes, absolutely, Nick. That profile we described in the fourth quarter that kind of ramps from that 14% last year up to 17% in the back half of the plan, it's absolutely still the profile to watch as this incremental capital opportunity emerges. What we'll do is issue sufficient equity probably through something like an ATM and through our plans to kind of restore the metrics to where they would have otherwise been without that incremental CapEx.\n And again, kind of going back to Steve's question, yes, even doing that, this incremental CapEx will have an accretive effect. So it's about 3/4 existing data centers and then a little bit the other quarter kind of coming from new data centers year-over-year. So we're seeing both. We're seeing a continued ramp-up of new facilities, existing facilities ramping up their usage. Yes, Anthony, this is Dan. Look, I think largely, any commentary you heard was simply focused on affordability and ensuring that the benefits that Georgia Power said we're there, end up reflected in customer rates. And that's exactly what the stipulation does is provide that commitment so that when we file the 2025 rate case, one of those moving parts is going to include incorporating those economic benefits for all customers into that calculation. Yes. And really just to create a more nimble market for those intermittent resources to make sure that customers, wherever it's needed benefit from that very, very low-cost energy. Yes. Look, so I'll start with the second question first. Look, Southern Power is always going to evaluate opportunities to serve load-serving entities, right? And so to the extent those opportunities present themselves in any of our jurisdictions where it makes sense, we'll evaluate that. And you've seen that happen in the past, particularly in Georgia.\n On the first question in terms of the kind of the portfolio, yes, look, it's very highly covered the next 5 years. And -- but if you think about 5 years out, that's the end of the decade, that's when other resource needs begin to emerge. That's when you start seeing utilities around the Southeast, begin to consider the -- how long with their assets be on the ground.\n So I think once you start looking towards the end of the decade and into the 30s, Southern Power will have a lot of opportunity to take advantage of what we're seeing today. I don't know that we have the specific construction updates, Ryan, but I will tell you just in general, this is -- I mean, think of it as a continuous kind of waterfall, right? I mean there are always data centers coming in and exploring and then committing. And so it's just -- it's an ongoing thing. So we've got -- right now, there's 12 under construction that totaled about 2,400 megawatts. And coming out of this last process, Ryan, there was a part of the stipulation is that Georgia will kind of keep the staff and commission updated a little more -- it's not real time, but on a quarterly basis, kind of leading up to the next formal process that way everyone kind of has line of sight as to what is emerging. And that next regular filing is scheduled for next January '25. And we're very transparent about our own transition plans. And I think that is an opportunity for them to kind of latch on to transitioning along with us. Yes. And so if you remember, Travis, part of our year-end update on the capital plan, I mean, it totaled $5 billion of increased capital. There was a big piece of that, that was also transmission, and that will continue to be part of the long-term planning discussions we have with our states.\n Absolutely, as we add new resources, transmission considerations have to take place absolutely as our fleet transitions from its current state to its future state, transmission considerations are part of that. So they will clearly be transmission opportunities along the way here. We don't want to get too far ahead of exactly what it will look like in terms of if there's suddenly this accelerated load. But so the next scheduled processes. We got Mississippi, we'll launch a process and -- or they launched the process in April rather they're going through that now and Alabama will have one next spring 2025."

            "name": "Christopher Womack",
            "content": "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for what is such an exciting time for our company. Monday, we announced that Plant Vogtle Unit 4 successfully achieved commercial operation. Units 3 and 4 now deliver more than 2,200 megawatts of reliable 24/7 carbon-free energy and are designed to do so for decades to come. With all 4 units operational, the Vogtle site is now the largest generator of clean energy in the country.\n I cannot be prouder of our team's press severance and commitment to getting Vogtle Units 3 and 4 completed with the standard of quality clearly demonstrated by Unit 3's performance since it reached in service last July. Along with our own team, success on this historic project required the hard work and dedication of tens of thousands of American craft workers and engineers, a committed group of co-owners and regulators who had the courage to support new nuclear when others did not.\n While it was not our mission when we embarked on this project and while it was at times an arduous journey. We have proven that new nuclear is achievable in the United States. With ever-increasing demands for carbon-free energy and the burgeoning demand for reliable 24/7 Energy to support our digital economy and society, we believe our country will need more nuclear energy.\n So the importance of this project for Georgia and our nation cannot be understated. This is what making history looks like. These are the first new nuclear units built from the ground up here in the United States in over 30 years. And we are proud to be the company that saw it through.\n Dan I'll now turn the call over to you for a financial update. Thank you Dan. Our system performed extremely well, and that's a testament to our team's collective commitment to serving customers reliably across our business, especially as we meet the demands of the extraordinary growth that we're seeing. Particularly within our Southeast footprint, we continue to see strong economic development activity with first quarter investment announcements representing the second highest first quarter on record as our teams continue to work closely with our states and local development authorities to attract new businesses.\n This growth continues to reflect a diverse mix of sectors with recent announcements, including automotive suppliers, flooring and glass manufacturers, data centers and mixed-use developments. During our year-end earnings call in February, we updated our forecast to reflect projected retail electric sales growth that is accelerating to a projected growth rate of approximately 6% from 2025 to 2028.\n The underlying Georgia Power projected sales growth rate is approximately 9% over the same period. As we look ahead, we're encouraged to see the signs of incremental growth also materializing in Alabama and Mississippi.\n A little more in 2 weeks ago, the Georgia Public Service Commission approved a stipulated agreement among Georgia Power, the Public Service Commission staff and multiple interveners in the 2023 IRP update docket. This approval affirms the need to quickly procure and deploy several thousand megawatts of resources to serve customers rapidly growing project electricity demands by the winter of 2026 and 2027.\n Georgia Power was also authorized to build and own a balanced collection of resources, including new natural gas combustion turbines and battery energy storage systems while also providing for an accelerated RFP process for incremental battery energy storage systems.\n The constructiveness and timeliness of decisions like this are a testament to the quality of our Southeastern states regulatory environment and our ability to meet the projected rapid demand growth garnering headlines across the country.\n Coinciding with Georgia Power's 2023 IRP update filing last fall, and the release of our sales forecast in February, external attention including from the investment community has focused on several key questions. How do you know the load in your forecast is real? How do you know you're pricing this new load appropriately? And what protections are in place if the forecasted load does not materialize?\n Those are all very important questions, and the answers are all fundamentals of how Southern Company has run our electric utilities for a very, very, very long time. We'll address each one of those questions in just a moment. First, I want to share with you what we believe are the 4 key characteristics required to successfully navigate this tremendous growth opportunity.\n We believe Southern Company is positioned as well or better than any utility company in the country on these four fronts. First, it requires supportive states and constructive regulation. Our states continue to be great economic development partners, and they have advanced economic policies that support healthy growth.\n When it comes to utility regulation, our states are among the best in the country at balancing the needs of customers while helping ensure utilities provide real value to customers in the form of clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy.\n Second, it requires institutional wherewithal. We have vast expertise and experience deploying energy infrastructure. We've been investing billions to improve the resilience of our electric and gas transmission and distribution networks. In recent years across our subsidiaries and across the country, we've built thousands of megawatts of energy supply in the form of new solar, wind and battery facilities, advanced micro grids, a state-of-the-art combined cycle natural gas plant and the only new nuclear units built in this country and more than a generation.\n These new assets along with the existing electric and gas infrastructure we operate have served customers with a superior measure of reliability and resilience. We have the people, we have the experience and we have the scale to be successful.\n The third requirement is a flexible pricing framework. Our electric utilities working with existing customers approved by their respective public service commissions have a history of being able to price new large load projects appropriately even in periods of high demand and challenging market conditions.\n These frameworks are designed to benefit all customers. For example, Georgia Power's real-time pricing rate or RTP, which was pioneered decades ago allows for the flexibility to price individual customers based on their unique low profile and risk characteristics.\n And finally, success in this environment requires experience and discipline, experience understanding utility economics and the true marginal cost to serve new customers. Experience identifying and mitigating the risk inherent and new or expanding large load customers, and experience and competing for new load with an objective of capturing tangible economic benefit for customers and states.\n Our experience, combined with the robust models and tools we employ are partially a product of the competitive economic environment we've navigated in the Southeast for decades. For example, in Georgia, most new large load customers can choose their electricity supplier.\n Over the years, we've been the chosen provider more often than not, however, it's a load we did not win or perhaps did not even choose to compete for that reflects our discipline and experience. By offering prices designed to recover the marginal cost to serve new loads, we seek to protect all other customers and importantly, maintain our credibility with our regulators and state policymakers.\n I'll now turn back to Dan to address those 3 key stakeholder questions pertaining to this extraordinary growth opportunity. Before taking your questions this afternoon, I'd like to first take a moment to reinforce that as we serve these growing energy needs, we also remain focused on achieving our long-term greenhouse gas reduction goals, including net 0 greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\n Working closely with each of our states, and with an unrelenting focus on safely and reliably serving our customers' needs, we continue to make responsible economic resource decisions over the long term. For example, over 80% of the resources additions plan across our system totaling nearly 10,000 megawatts from 2023 to 2030 are 0 carbon emitting resources.\n We have accomplished some wonderful things in recent weeks, and we are even more excited about our future. We have seven quality state-regulated utilities with long track records of outstanding operational and financial performance that deliver over 90% of our earnings, along with a few quality complementary businesses, we believe we have the ideal portfolio to support our long-term objectives.\n Southern Company's value proposition has never been more attractive. Our team has never been stronger, and we are positioned as well as we ever have been. As I said earlier, we have the people, the experience and the scale for sustained long-term success. Thank you, as always, for your interest in Southern Company.\n Robert, we're now ready to take questions. And Steve, the only thing I'd add is we talked to you before about not just about raising growth rates, but it's about the durability and the length, how we extend the runway is something that we are keenly focused on as we've talked to you many times about. And I think that's clearly an opportunity that we are afforded by this added growth. Steve, the only thing I'd add, I mean, one of the things that we talked about in our prepared remarks, we've talked to you more about how do we use this opportunity to make sure we put downward pressure on rates across our customer classes and making sure that we price this new load in the right way. And I think we've demonstrated our ability to do that and having the resources and tools to do that going forward. So it provides us additional excitement for us as we go forward. Yes, the consumer advocacy group inside the commission, that bill was not passed by the legislature. The legislature did pass a bill that provided what I think is some certainty around the election cycle going forward for the commissioners. There was some confusion chaos and time and schedule got a little short because of the court cases.\n And so as a result, the legislature didn't pass a bill that laid out the order and schedule of elections for commissioners between '25 and '28. And so the thing about that, that I think is very instructive is that the current commission in Georgia will be the commission that will sit to review Georgia Power's '25 IRP as well as Georgia '25 rate case. So there is order and schedule for the commission for the next 2 to 3 years -- out to '28. So I'd say we're having a lot of conversations that covering all of those options and all those considerations. I mean, I think as you talk to these hyperscalers data centers, one, they want the power. They want resilience. They want the reliability. Some of them want clean, and they recognize the demand that they're putting on load in certain locations. And so their considerations do they self generate, do they want support from behind the meter.\n So I think you go across the continuum of options reflects kind of the conversations that we are having with them, one, to understand what their needs are, but also to help them understand our business and how we provide service and how we operate as a company. Yes, I mean, we're trying to -- want to serve them as customers. But I think we're also in a period where there's just a lot of instruction and education that's occurring in the marketplace today.\n And so the thing about our company is with all the complementary subsidiaries that we have in this portfolio, we have the opportunity to support them and help them in multiple different ways. So I think that's another aspect of our portfolio. That's pretty exciting as we look at this demand and what's happening in the marketplace today and that we have resources and capabilities to serve them and support them in a number of different ways. I don't think there's anything embedded in the plan. I think we -- it's about announcements and that we see forthcoming. We know I think there was an announcement today in Alabama of a 200-megawatt facility that Meta just announced. And then you saw also some legislation in Mississippi that was providing incentives for data centers and other hyperscalers to come into Mississippi. So we see it coming, but that activity -- those projects have not assumed are not included in the forecast as we talk about it today. Yes. I mean I think that I mean, it passed and now sitting on the governor's desk and so waiting to see what happens there. I think one of the things the government wants to do is let economic development activities know that Georgia is still open for business. And so I think that's one of the key factors in consideration that he will pay attention to as he makes a decision on that bill. But right now, I don't know what will happen, but it's there for him to take action on. And so we're waiting just like everybody else to see what happens. I think that's a lot to come. And I'd add one more factor there. It's the new EPA rules, and we saw the suite of announcements that came out of EPA last week, which we are reviewing. And many of the rules we think are in practical in terms of aligning with the kind of demand that we see forthcoming, and also from a technology standpoint, some expectations that they are advocating and putting forward don't align necessarily with the reality.\n So there's a lot of -- I think a lot of issues that are up in the air. At the state level, I think as we look at how we respond to the demand, how we respond to this need, all those considerations must be on the table in terms of new generation, what happens to existing generation. Those all get extended, what happens there?\n All of that has to be on the table, but we also have to factor in what are the potential new rules from the [indiscernible] Protection Agency. So I would say all of that is very subject to for the consideration as we move forward through all the processes that we'll be a part of. Geologically, yes. I mean there are places down on the coast. The mobile area, some parts of Mississippi, where we have the geology for sequestration. But once again, I think as you look at what is somewhat predicated in some of these roles and the expectations and what the desires are -- is the technology available at a commercial scale to do what they're asking us to do. I think there are a lot of questions there.\n So I think it's -- I go back to these rules, I think they are in practical at this time. And so I think there's more work to be done and more conversations to be had about how they should go forward. But we're still doing the analysis because it's a lot of pages, a lot of work, and then we've got to decide what we do going forward in terms of litigation and whether it's with our stage, whether it's with the other different associations. So there's a lot of work to be done there, a lot more conversations to be had. I mean I can give you my speech if you'd like to hear it. I mean the country is going to need more nuclear. I mean there's clearly no technology better suited to support demands of this increasingly digital economy and society.\n And so I think the federal government has got to step in and provide great leadership to incent companies to move in that direction. I'd also say we're going to celebrate what we've done at Vogtle for a very long time before we give any consideration to any more. But we think others, they have the opportunity and should really look at this country has to look at new nuclear to go forward to meet this growing demand. Angie, I think it is what it is. I mean it was intended to move around the partners and participants of excess capacity. And so that's what it has been doing, I think, has been very successful, but I don't think it signals anything more than that. I mean that simply is it's doing what we intended to do with all the participants. And so we'll continue to utilize that. Now how does it factor into the additional growth? I mean we'll step back and look at it. But it doesn't signal anything more than what we intended to be when we made all the filings and got all the approval. And Paul, I think it's hard to answer that question, but I would think not, but also I think you have to look at the competitive nature of economic development across states. And where does it put Georgia and then what signal does it send. But also, I think it's about -- it's a big question about resilience and the ability to meet the demands of these customers and not just reliably, but providing them the resilience they expect and the demand.\n But I think it's I think just a straight answer to your question, I think it's probably not, but I think at the same time, it's a competitive nature of economic development by states that I think you have to say what have to evaluate very closely. And Paul, that's like we're evaluating those rules as we speak today. And I mean I think there's a lot we've kind of gotten to very quickly on the gas side in terms of capacity factors and the expectations for carbon capture. I mean I think there's more work for us to do in terms of the coal implications. But at first blush, like I said, I think they're in practical and probably yet would make it more difficult to run coal units as well any longer. I think we said before, Georgia has an RFP in 2025. And so they'll factor in new requests, new demands, new load doing that proceeding. Alabama and Mississippi will do make similar decisions in their processes based on the demands and requests that they receive as well. Because it goes back to some of the points we laid out in the prepared remarks. Is this load real? And so I think that quarterly update helps give the commission and the staff the information they need to give confirmation of the reality of this load. I mean early on, we saw a lot of requests for 24/7 carbon-free of late. We see the request for do you have power. And like I said, we continue to build additional carbon-free resources. And so we'll continue to work with them. But right now, I think there is just a simple desire and request for resources for energy. We chose that word very carefully. And I'll also add, there's got to be some additional build-out of gas infrastructure as well. I mean, so there's a lot more infrastructure that's got to be built to support the generation resources to meet this demand. I think it's -- let me call by saying this. Understandably, I mean, Vogtle 3 and 4, the journey that we've been through, took a lot of attention from our stakeholders and have met fewer conversations focused on our underlying business and the success of our underlying business.\n The fact is all along, we continue to execute at a very high level across our portfolio and delivered strong results. Reliability and customer service were outstanding. Investments in critical financial structure we made in every jurisdiction. We successfully navigated our regulatory processes and received constructive outcomes.\n Now as we look ahead in what's next, it's this, a continued unrelenting focus on the fundamentals with customers at the center of everything that we do. Serving the growing load we're experiencing is what we were built for and our model is designed to turn that growth into value for all stakeholders, customers and investors alike.\n That is what the employees of Southern companies do. It might sound boring to some, but it's exciting for us. Thank you for spending time with us today. And operator, that's the end of this call. Thank you very much."
